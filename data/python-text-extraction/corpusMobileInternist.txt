iCloud is an incremental part of the ecosystem for every iPhone user. It provides that much-needed sense of security by safely backing up your stuff, so you don’t have to worry even if it comes to worst.
But what if your iPhone stops backing up your files, photos, notes, contacts, and everything else to iCloud? Well, you’ll want to deal with that problem as soon as possible. You never know when you’re going to need a ready backup.
So, if you got up on a wrong foot today, and your iPhone stopped backing up your data to iCloud, I’ll try to resolve the problem with this article. Stay tuned.
Table of contacts:
- Check the storage
- Bonus: Manage your backup
- Make sure you’re connected to the internet
- Disable Low Power Mode
- Make sure backups are enabled
- Sign out of iCloud, then back in again
- Reset your settings
- Check the iCloud service status
- Check for updates
- Reset your iPhone
Check the storage
One of the main reasons the iPhone won’t sync to iCloud is insufficient storage. You can’t put more staff in your iCloud if there’s simply no room for it. In case the lack of storage is indeed the cause of your problem, you’ll probably get the message saying “Not enough storage”.
If you indeed received this message, you already know what to do. Either free up some storage or expand iCloud capacity. Now, if you’re not sure how to do that, don’t worry. I got you covered.
Bonus: Manage your iCloud storage
As I said, if you don’t have enough space in your iCloud account for fresh backups, you have two options. You either buy additional space or you free up the existing storage.
Now, I know you’d rather not pay for the expansion, but the initial 5GB you get for free won’t get you too far. As a matter of fact, I filled the original 5GB plan after just a few days after getting my iPhone, with pictures taking the most of it.
Apple offers iCloud storage plans that are billed monthly. The bad news is that it’s not a one-time purchase, but it’s not too expensive either, depending on your location and a monthly plan you choose.
For example, if you live in the US, an additional 50GB/200GB/2TB of storage space will set you back $0.99/$2.99/$9.99 per month respectively. If you live outside the United States, your price may vary. Check out Apple’s support page to see how much iCloud storage costs in your country.
On the other hand, if you don’t want to pay for additional storage, you’ll have to make the most out of what you’ve already got. That means, go to the iCloud storage management section and delete some existing backups or disable further sync for some of the apps that take too much space.
To manage your iCloud storage, go to Settings > tap your name > iCloud. Here you can choose which apps are backing up their data to iCloud, and you can easily disable backup for each app.
To see existing backups, tap Manage storage. Just go through the list of apps, and hopefully, you’ll find a backup that you don’t really need, but takes too much space. For example, while writing this article, I noticed that the Lightroom backup takes like 2GB of storage, which is something I had to deal with.
Photos are perhaps the biggest “eater” of storage, and deleting them would certainly free up a huge chunk of space. However, you probably don’t want to do that and leave your precious photos unprotected. If this dilemma bothers you, and you still don’t want to pay for additional storage space, I suggest turning to Google Photos. In fact, many people prefer Google Photos over iCloud, because the app and service are more convenient. And it’s free.
Make sure you’re connected to WiFi
Although this one looks obvious, you’d be surprised if I tell you how many times have my iPhone disconnected from my home WiFi network, and either switched to data or my neighbor’s WiFi. The same thing can happen to you.
So, before taking some more serious steps, just make sure you’re properly connected to WiFi. I should also point out that your phone only backs up your files while you’re connected to WiFi, it won’t do anything on mobile data. And that’s a good thing. Trust me, you don’t want to use mobile data for backing up, because you’ll lose it in a matter of minutes.
Disable Low Power Mode
My educated guess is that the Low Power Mode is exactly the cause of your problem. So, I’m confident you’ll solve your problem after dealing with the Lowe Power Mode.
In case you don’t know what this feature does, it puts your phone in a state where it uses less power to preserve the battery (hence the name). When your phone uses less power, it can’t perform some of the more power-consuming operations, with backing up being one of them.
The Low Power Mode usually activates when your battery percentage is below 20%. All you need to do in this case is to simply charge your phone. It will disable the Low Power Mode and the backup process will continue as usual.
But if you don’t want to wait for your phone to fully charge, you can also disable this feature manually. Here’s how to do that:
On the other hand, if I was wrong, and your iPhone still won’t back up to iCloud, well, I guess you should try another solution.
Make sure backups are enabled
So far, we’ve been talking about backups in general. But if a certain app won’t back up to iCloud, while others are working fine, you should go and see what’s wrong with that particular app.
Since I can’t predict which app won’t back up for you, I can’t lay down all of the possible solutions for your problem. However, I can tell you where to start. And that’s making sure backup is enabled for that specific app in the first place.
Anyway, here’s how to manage individual app backups on your iPhone:
- Go to Settings.
- Tap your name, and head over to iCloud.
- Here you’ll find a list of apps that are compatible with backing up to iCloud. Scroll down and just make sure the app you’re looking for is enabled.
Maybe the problem isn’t coming from your side. There’s a chance you’re unlucky today and that Apple’s servers that handle iCloud are temporarily down. It’s a real thing that could easily happen, believe me.
So, just in case, head over to Apple’s website and check if the servers are online. You can check the server status of iCloud, along with all other Apple services, here.
If the server’s indeed down, you shouldn’t worry too much. It will probably stay down for a brief period only, as Apple probably has the best infrastructure in the world. Once the servers go back online, you’ll be able to normally back up your files to your iCloud account. Of course, if there are no other problems.
iOS updates are a real amusement park. Or more precisely, a rollercoaster in an amusement park. At one moment you’re on top of the world, enjoying all the beautiful features Apple has given you. But at the very next moment, with the very next update, you’re terrified by all the issues that seemingly small update has caused to you.
Depending on when you’re reading this article, iOS may be going through a downward spiral of the current update, with iCloud backup being among the problems. To make sure that’s indeed the case, do a little research to see if others are complaining about the same issue in the very iOS version you have on your phone.
If the problem was indeed caused by an update, there’s probably not much you can do. You’ll have to wait for the next update and hope for the best.
As generic and cliche this is, and as much as I hate recommending this to my readers, I had to put it in the article. Just to make sure I included everything there is. And to beef up the word count a little bit. That’s important in today’s content marketing, you know.
All jokes and memes aside, there’s still a slight chance this one will work. So if you’ve already tried everything else, you might as well sign out and in to iCloud, just to be sure.
If you’re not sure how it’s done, here’s a quick set of instructions:
- Go to Settings.
- Tap your name, and go to Sign out.
- Type your Apple ID password and tap Turn Off.
- A window asking you which data you want to copy from your iCloud account to your phone will appear. Keep in mind that this might delete some data from your phone, so you’ll want to carefully read the instructions on this page.
- Once you’ve decided what you want to keep, tap Sign Out.
- Now that you’re signed out, head back to Settings, and go Sign in to your iPhone.
- Enter your credentials, tap Next, enter your passcode, and you’re back in.
And finally, if none of the solutions presented above resolved the iCloud backup problem, let’s turn to the last resort. And that’s resetting all settings. Now, you might want to think this one through, because it will, as you would’ve guessed, reset all your settings, but it may not resolve the problem at hand. And I’m sure you know how annoying will be to get all your settings back in order.
Nevertheless, if you can’t find any other solution, and you’re willing to risk, you might give this a shot. What’s positive about this method is that only reset your preferences, but keeps your content and personal data.
Here’s how to reset your iPhone settings:
- Go to Settings.
- Head over to General > Reset.
- Tap Reset All Settings.
- Confirm that you want to reset all your settings.
That’s it, all your settings are now reset. I surely hope this solution resolved the iCloud issue because the annoying task of re-adjusting your settings is now ahead of you.
I didn’t want to recommend to factory reset your phone because I simply don’t think it’s worth the risk. And you can easily lose something you don’t want to if you’re not careful enough.
That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions or “solutions” helped you resolve the problem with backing up your iPhone to iCloud. If you have any comments, questions, or maybe a better solution, feel free to write them down in the comments below.Home Tags Samsung galaxy s8Galaxy S8 is finally out! And, oh, boy, we’re in for a treat! First impressions are mostly positive and Samsung’s latest flagship is in the race for the smartphone of the year with the great battery, futuristic bezel-less design, an iris scanner, and it’s own smart assistant that promises a lot.
You would imagine that the premium device like S8 doesn’t have a lot of flaws. And, for all intents and purposes, it doesn’t. But there into play comes Samsung’s notorious system update that always brings out the bag of issues. Today, we’ll try to address the fingerprint scanner that got unresponsive after the update. One user posted the query and this is his explanation of the problem at hand:
”After the software update that came out a few days ago, my fingerprint scanner hasn’t been responding. I used to use it to unlock my phone. Now it isn’t picking up that I have my finger there. I went into settings and deleted my fingerprints I had registered. Then when I went to re-register my prints it would not pick up that my finger was there.”
So, if you have similar issues with your brand new Galaxy S8, these are some workarounds that you can use to resolve this issue.
Clean your fingerprint scanner
For starters, let’s clean the fingerprint scanner. Even the smallest particles of dust can create a problem with the fingerprint readings. You can use any soft material like cloth, apply a little water on it, and wipe gently over the surface of the reader. After that, you can use the dry cloth to rub any remaining liquid from the scanner.
Have in mind that these are just the precaution measures and that this is, at least most of the time, a software issue.
Restart your device
Once we got the exterior of the reader sorted out, let’s move to a more reasonable culprit for this issue: annoying software bug. We won’t place our bets on the restart as the permanent solution, but, you’ll at least be able to use the fingerprint reader for some time.
The first step you can take when it comes to bugs is to simply turn it off and on again. After the phone is on, check for changes with the fingerprint scanner. However, if the problem is still there, check the steps below before sending the angry ticket to responsible service or carrier.
Disable fingerprint gestures
Now we have reached the climax. Most of the folks seem to neglect the fact that the Nougat upgrade is a major miss for the South Korean megacorp. Yes, some of the features are more than welcomed, but what’s with the negative effects Android 7.0 had cast upon the Galaxy devices?
And, for a lot of users of S8, the latest update broken the fingerprint recognition. Or, to be more exact, the fingerprint gestures that are great and quite a useful feature. Some users reported that they retrieved fingerprint function by disabling fingerprint gestures. If you’re unsure how to do that, follow the instructions below:
- Tap Settings.
- Open Advanced features.
- Navigate to Finger sensor gestures and toggle it off.
- Now you should be able to use only the unlock function of the fingerprint scanner.
Restore factory settings
At the end, if you’re willing to trade your custom setup and saved data for the possible resolution of this issue, the factory reset is a viable solution. We’re aware that this is an undesirable action for most of the users, but there’s a great chance that you’ll resolve your issues. On the other hand, you can wait for the next update to sort it out.
If you’re unaware how to perform the factory reset on your S8, the instructions are just below. Of course, don’t forget to backup your data. You can use the PC suite to back it up on your PC or the cloud services to back it up online.
- Open Settings.
- Tap Backup & reset.
- Tap Reset device.
- Confirm with the Erase everything.
- The phone will restart and, hopefully, your fingerprint scanner issue will be gone for good.
That’s it. Don’t forget to report the problem to Samsung, as they can’t repair something that they’re not aware of. Additionally, we’ll like to hear your first impressions of the device and are you satisfied with what you’ve got.
The comments section is just below.Even though Facebook suffered significant drops in the number of active users, Facebook Messenger is still holding up. And it’s still, globally, in the top 5 instant messengers, as many users still cling to it for various reasons. Now, recently, some users reported that Messenger is not showing notifications on their Android devices. If you are among them, find a way to solve this below.
Table of contents:
- Clear cache and data from the app
- Check notification settings
- Make sure the sender is not muted
- Reinstall Facebook Messenger
Why am I not getting Facebook Messenger notifications?
Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from the app
Firstly, you should check the Do not disturb option. Make sure that it is disabled before moving to additional steps on the list. Additionally, if you see notifications but there’s no sound, inspect system sound settings.
If the DND is disabled and notification sound is enabled, you should reset the app. That’s done by clearing cache and data from Messenger. This will log you out of Messenger and address a temporary halt within the app.
Follow these steps to clear cache and data from Facebook Messenger:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps.
- Tap All apps (App manager or Manage apps).
- Open Messenger.
- Tap Storage.
- Clear cache first and then data.
- Reboot your device, log in to your Messenger account again.
Solution 2 – Check notification settings
Now, if notifications for a certain app are not coming through, the most important thing is to check notification settings. You’ll need to check both in-app and system notification settings to confirm that notifications are, indeed, enabled on your device for this particular app.
With that in mind, here’s what you need to do:
- Open Facebook Messenger.
- Tap on your profile pic in the top left corner.
- Open Notifications & Sounds.
- Make sure that notifications and notification previews are enabled.
- Now, swipe down the Quick settings and open Settings.
- Select Apps and then open All apps (on some devices App manager or Manage apps).
- Open Messenger from the list of apps.
- Select Notifications.
- Now, inspect all options and ensure that notifications are shown along with the sound. Make sure to set all Messenger notifications to High priority.
Solution 3 – Make sure the sender is not muted
As you might know, there’s an option to mute notifications for a certain chat or user. You can do so in the app or in the Notification shade. Time options are to mute user/group for 15 minutes, 1 hour, 8 hours, 24 hours, or until you manually turn the notifications back on.
Now, once you mute a user or group chat, you won’t be getting any notifications. Which is why you should ensure that the said user/group/page is not muted.
- Open Facebook Messenger.
- If you see the crossed-out bell icon next to a chat, it means that chat is muted.
- Tap and hold on a chat until the menu pops up.
- Then tap on the crossed-out bell icon to un-mute the chat.
Solution 4 – Reinstall Facebook Messenger
Finally, if Facebook Messenger is still not showing notifications on your Android, make sure to reinstall the app. You can also uninstall the Facebook app, just to cover all possible reasons why the Messenger notifications are not coming through.
Follow these instructions to reinstall Facebook Messenger on Android:
- Navigate again to Settings > Apps > All apps > Messenger.
- Uninstall the app and clear cache and data when prompted.
- Navigate to Play Store and install the app.
- Reboot your device.
- Log in again.
And, with that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share your questions or alternative solutions in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you.
Nothing was useful for me. If I don’t open the app, I don’t know if someone wrote me…
Do you also send messages on Facebook Messenger on your Computer/Tablet? Doing that screws up the notifications on your phone.
I stopped using Facebook Messenger on my Computer/Tablet and did Solution #1 above and for now at least I’m getting notifications like I should when somebody sends me something.
I suddenly stopped receiving messenger notifications on my lock screen. I tried all of these the article suggested and what actually worked at the end for me was to always leave messenger running in the background.So when I clear all my apps from being open in the background, I let messenger always running so I receive notifications on my lock screen.Why would anyone in their right mind disable one feature which has been automatized for ages and manages brightness manually? Well, it depends on the hardware you have and the software which runs it. If the ambient light sensor works as intended, the adaptive brightness is more than a viable option.
Now, even though budget handsets are getting cheaper, the OEMs still make some cuts. For example, the Mi A1 is one of the best budget devices from the past year. Might be the best when it comes to bang for the buck.
However, that ambient light sensor certainly isn’t the selling point for the Xiaomi’s Android One handset. And that’s where we get to our point. Me personally don’t fancy the Adaptive brightness feature on Android in general.
It’s erratic and not as precise. However, if we add a bad light sensor, you’ll do yourself a favor by disabling it. You might dim the screen a tad too much, but the battery life will prolonge for a couple of hours.
Now, disabling the Adaptive brightness in Oreo or Android Pie (or any Android for that matter) is a rather simple task. But, we want to take this a step further. Firstly, Qualcomm’s CABL (Content Adaptive Backlight) is another thing you should consider disabling. And that isn’t as simple as the Adaptive Backlight.
It basically uses the background of an app to determine the brightness level. And, due to a disparity between the ambient light sensor and Content Adaptive Backlight, the results might come out surprisingly bad. You can disable it by following these steps:
- You’ll need to download Nova Launcher from the Play Store.
- Set Nova as your default launcher.
- Tap and hold on the home screen to open the Launcher Menu.
- Select Widgets
- Under Nova Launcher, select Activities and drop the widget on the home screen.
- From the list, select Qualcomm Content Adaptive Backlight Settings.
- Open the shortcut you just created and uncheck the “Enable Content Adaptive Backlight” box.
- Exit and remove the shortcut.
In addition, if you’re not satisfied with what the built-in system Adaptive brightness management has to offer, you can use a third-party app to manage brightness instead. Now, there’s a lot of apps in this niche, but we highly suggest Lux Lite or its premium version Lux Auto Brightness.
They will, not only replace the built-in Adaptive brightness but take everything one step further, with the smarter sensor readings and more than a few interesting tools. With that said, we can conclude this article. Hopefully, it was a helpful read. Post your opinions in the comments section below.
MY INSTAGRAM CAMERA IS NOT WORKING WOULD YOU GET SOMEONE TO FIX THE INSTAGRAM CAMERA AND MESSAGE SO I COULD CONTACT MY FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS.Hyper-production in Xiaomi’s factories never stops. And, just as we are got used to a certain midrange device from Redmi, here comes its successor. Redmi Note 8 was a great budget device, but what about Redmi Note 9 and it’s top segment model with the PRO as a suffix? The Redmi Note 9 Pro is a great bang for your buck, that’s for certain.
What about everyday use and issues that emerged, plaguing owners of this device? No worries, we got your back. We conducted in-depth research and provided you with the list of most common issues along with solutions. All of you Redmi Note 9 Pro users — read below!
Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems.

- How to debloat your Redmi Note 9 Pro
- Common troubleshooting steps for the Redmi Note 9 Pro
1. Lift to wake not working
Some Redmi Note 9 Pro users reported issues with the Rise to wake feature. This feature is quite handy and definitely available on all contemporary Android devices, including the latest Redmi 9 lineup.
Firstly, make sure that the feature is enabled. Navigate to Settings > Display and enable Rise to wake there. If it still doesn’t work, the problem is a system bug resolvable with a simple reboot.
However, if you are still unable to address it, updating your firmware or, alternatively, resetting your device to factory settings should resolve the issue.
2. Battery draining fast
With its enormous 5020 mAh battery, the Redmi Note 9 Pro should provide users with a quite good SoT (Screen-on Time). However, Xiaomi’s MIUI is often hit or miss with the optimization and, for some, the battery depletes fast.
The most probable reason is the deep sleep integration, as the device is depleting even when the device is idle.
- Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight.
- Disable Face Unlock.
- Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps.
- Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery.
- Try calibrating your battery. Follow the steps provided, here.
3. Instagram video stutters
Issues with Instagram and Xiaomi devices appear to be quite common. Some users have problems with recording lengthy Stories (over 20 seconds), others experience stutters while recording videos within the app.
Now, Instagram does lower the framerate but we can’t say with certainty why the videos will stutter. Make sure to reinstall the app and grant it all necessary permissions and look for improvement.
4. Slow-motion videos are not recorded
Xiaomi finally decided to put some more effort into the software part of the photo-taking capabilities of their devices.
Despite the great hardware, the lackluster software made users switch to Google Camera ports modded by third-party developers. Things are getting better with MIUI 12, but there’s still a lot of work to do.
Some Redmi Note 9 Pro users reported issues with the slow-motion videos which are not saving after being recorded.
We advise you to update your device and, like with most of the issues we placed on the list, send the feedback to Xiaomi informing them about the issue. You can also clear data and cache from the Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Camera.
5. Wi-Fi disconnecting with the screen off
This one is, by far, the most common and the most excruciating issue that many of the Redmi Note 9 Pro users encountered. Namely, whatever users do and regardless of the Wi-Fi stability, it seems that their devices keep disconnecting.
Xiaomi allegedly acknowledged the issue but to no avail, as even after updates, the problem persists.
Resetting Network settings doesn’t help as well as resetting the device to factory values. Just make sure to install all recent updates and, if the issue persists, ask for the replacement.
Unlike many flagships, the Redmi Note 9 Pro comes with the headphone jack. Nonetheless, some users will still utilize Bluetooth to reproduce audio wirelessly. And, that’s where the issues start for some.
It seems that the volume on wireless headphones or speakers is too low even on the highest setting. If that’s the case for you, we suggest navigating to Developer options and tweaking a few settings there. Here’s what you need to do:
- Open Settings.
- Choose System.
- Open About phone.
- Locate the Build number and tap it 7 times in succession to enable Developer options.
- Now, you should see Developer options in Settings > System.
- Scroll down until you reach the Networking section.
- Once there, enable (toggle ON) the Disable absolute volume option.
- Reboot your device and you should have more control over the volume of Bluetooth devices.
The worst thing that can happen to an LCD IPS display is screen bleeding, where one (or multiple) screen edges show stripes of the white light.
This is not as common but some Redmi Note 9 Pro users are definitely seeing this problem on their devices. It seems that the displays that have this factory flaw are the ones with Tianma LCD panels.
Xiaomi and its subsidiaries tend to use Tianma Electronics-made LCD panels a lot and there are no reports about this problem on a plethora of available devices. However, if you are experiencing this issue, ask for the replacement.
To check if the screen bleeding exists, put on a dark image on your background and look at the screen edges at an angle. In regards to image retention, we think that this isn’t as common and that reports are too scarce.
MIUI is often hit or miss but, in comparison to some other OEMs, Xiaomi (Redmi and Poco, too), tends to provide a lot of timely updates. It takes some time to fix all the things but, in general, the user experience is getting better and more polished with every new iteration.
However, what to do if your device won’t update? Some users are having a hard time, as their device won’t install updates although they are informed that updates are available.
Firstly, we recommend restarting your device. If that doesn’t help, check the available storage and network connection.
Finally, you can reboot your device into Recovery and wipe the cache partition by following steps at the bottom of this article.
9. Bluetooth won’t connect
Reports of Bluetooth connectivity issues are rather scarce but there are still users having a hard time connecting. It seems that the problem, specifically, affects users that try to connect their Redmi Note 9 Pro to a Car Media in order to play music.
For some of them, the Bluetooth connection is unstable or certain devices (Bluetooth speakers and earbuds) won’t connect at all.
If you are among those users, make sure to try the steps we listed below:
- Restart your device.
- Unpair and pair your handset again with the device.
- Disable Bluetooth A2DP Hardware Offload in Developer Options.
- Reset Network Settings.
10. Notifications not coming through
The problem with notifications for certain apps is not exactly just an MIUI thing. For example, a bug with Gmail causes users to miss push notifications for received emails on some premium Samsung devices, as well.
However, since we are covering the Redmi Note 9 Pro, we’ll try and focus on this device solely.
There are two things you can do on your side and they include checking in-app settings first and then system notification settings after. If necessary, do so for each app that’s bothering you.
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps.
- Select Manage apps.
- Open the app that doesn’t provide you with notifications from the list.
- Select Notifications.
- Ensure that all notifications for various app segments are enabled. You can tweak settings additionally (disable sound or vibration, set custom tones, etc.).
- After that, get back to Settings and open Display and Status bar.
- Make sure to enable the “Show notification icons” option.
- Reboot your device and look for improvements.
You can learn more about addressing notification-related issues in this extensive article.
11. Cellular signal issues
Good, stable cellular signal reception and reliable network coverage are often neglected when talked about modern smartphones.
Many China-made devices are not supporting all bands in Western countries, which means that network coverage isn’t the best or some carrier-based features are missing.
Some European Redmi Note 9 Pro users have had a hard time with the network coverage, with the lackluster network reception.
In addition, the device might get hot and the battery will deplete rapidly, searching repetitively for a stable signal.
If that’s what’s bothering you, as well, we recommend restarting your device periodically. In addition, make sure that your SIM card is properly placed and try switching between the slots. Alternatively, you can try and reset your device to factory settings.
12. Camera exposure issues
Some users reported strange issues with the stock MIUI Camera focus and exposure. This is an isolated problem, but it still bothers some users. One of them went as far as replacing its Redmi Note 9 Pro.
If you are troubled by this issue, try clearing the Cache from the Camera app, wiping cache partition data, and updating the firmware. If that doesn’t help, consider restoring factory settings on your device.
You can also try Gcam ports for your device and go with them. Usually, they bring better results than the stock camera app. It shouldn’t be hard getting and installing modded Google Camera APK.
13. OK Google not working
Google Assistant comes preinstalled on every Android device (except recent Huawei handsets) and it usually, after you set it up, works without issues. Nonetheless, there are reports about OK Google/Google Assistant not working for some Redmi Note 9 Pro users.
For some, the Assistant is not responding with Voice commands. Have in mind that this might be caused by the Wi-Fi bug, as Google’s services require a stable connection.
If you are among the affected users, try using these steps to fix the issue completely:
- Check the Wi-Fi.
- Clear cache from the Google app from Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Google.
- Check Voice match recognition in the Assistant settings.
- Restart your device.
- Select Google as the default Voice assistant in Settings > Apps > Manage apps > 3-dot menu > Default apps.
You can learn more about issues with Google Assistant and ways to solve them in this dedicated article.
14. No HD support for Netflix and Amazon Prime
Chinese ROMs don’t come with the Widevine L1 which means that they can stream content only in SD (Standard Definition) and not HD. However, all devices with Global ROMs or regional ROMs should support HD for Netflix and Amazon Prime.
If you are seeing Widewine L3 instead of L1 (check with the DRM app, get it here), we encourage you to check your ROM. Most custom ROMs don’t support HD streaming so, if that’s important to you, choose custom ROMs wisely.
15. How to debloat your Redmi Note 9 Pro

Same problem. Cannot discover its cause.So you just got your new, I even assume the first-ever, iPhone. You’re overwhelmed with excitement that you would normally feel for getting a pair of headphones, let alone the most premium phone in the world. But the excitement quickly turns into panic when you realize how much work is ahead of you.
One of the first things you’ll want to do is moving all your contacts to the iPhone. Although Google and Apple aren’t the brightest examples of professional cooperation, moving your contacts from Android to iOS is actually easier than you’d expect. You’ll just have to follow a few rules.
I’m going to show you what you need to do here. Just follow the instructions, and you’ll move your contacts from one ecosystem to another without any fuss.
Sync contacts using Gmail
The most straightforward way to move your contacts to iOS is by simply installing Gmail. Once you install Google’s email client, it will automatically bring all your synced contacts with it. Assuming you backed up your contacts to your Google Account first (in case you haven’t, just take a look at this article).
Once you install Gmail, just make sure the sync is enabled, and contacts will appear. In case you’re not sure how to do that, here’s a step-by-step explanation:
- Go to the App Store and install Gmail.
- Open Gmail and login with your Google Account.
- Now, head over to Settings > Passwords & Accounts.
- Tap Gmail, and make sure Contacts is selected.
Enabling this option will surely sync all your Google contacts with your new phone. However, there’s a chance those contacts won’t show in the Contacts app. If you still can’t see your contacts in the app, just do the following:
That’s about it. Although Apple and Google usually make it harder for their respective users to use the other company’s services, transferring contacts doesn’t fall into this category. You can get the job done in a matter of minutes.
Import from SIM
Many people don’t know this, but Apple doesn’t let you import contacts from your phone or iCloud to your SIM card. It’s a security thing, you wouldn’t get it. However, the opposite way works.
If your SIM card already has contacts stored on it, you can seamlessly export them to iCloud or even your Google Account. Here’s how to do that:
- Go to Settings > Contacts.
- Tap Import SIM contacts.
- Choose the account you want to import your contacts to.
On the other hand, you should keep in mind that no new contacts you save on your current iPhone will be stored on your SIM card. So, relying on your SIM card for transferring contacts across Apple devices may not be the best solution in the long run.
Move Google contacts to iCloud
It’s important to keep in mind that syncing Google contacts using the above-mentioned method will only show contacts in the Contacts app. Your Google contacts won’t be automatically uploaded to iCloud.
If you want to literally transfer your contacts from Google to iCloud, you’ll have to do some extra work. To complicate the situation even further, you won’t be able to do that on your iPhone. You’ll have to export your contacts in the browser on your computer, and then manually upload them to iCloud.
Here’s how it looks like:
- Open your browser, and go to the Google Contacts website.
- Select the contacts you want to export.
- Go to Export, and choose vCard (for iOS Contacts).
- Now, switch to the contacts section of your iCloud.
- Click Settings (the gear icon), and choose Import vCard.
- Choose the vCard you just exported.
That’s about it, all your contacts are now safely stored on your iCloud account. When you do this, you don’t even need to sync Gmail contacts with your iPhone, because the new iCloud contacts will now appear in the app.
I know the whole process probably requires more time than it should, but you also can’t say it’s too complicated. Whether Apple of Google will change something remains to be seen. If that happens, we’ll update this article accordingly.
In case you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, make sure to leave them below.Android Oreo has changed the way we clear cached data on our phones! Which left some users confused, as the process isn’t as straightforward and simple as it used to be in Android Nougat.
In Android Nougat, you could simply go to Storage settings, and bulk clear all the cache on your phone. That’s very practical, because users don’t have to bother clearing each app’s cache individually. A time-saving feature, we must say.
But that’s not the case anymore. When you go to Storage settings in Android Oreo, you won’t see this option anymore. That’s because Google decided to remove the traditional cache-clearing fature from Oreo.
So, how do we actually clear cache in Android Oreo now?
How is cached data cleared in Android Oreo
To understand what’s going on, we’ll have to include the whole picture. With Android O, Google wants to change the whole policy of using, storing, and clearing cached data. Google encourages developers to be more ‘efficient’ in developing their apps.
Here’s what the Android O developer preview release notes say:
“Android O gives better guidance and behaviors around cached data. Each app is now given a disk space quota for cached data….
When the system needs to free up disk space, it will start by deleting cached files from apps that are the most over their allocated quota. Thus, if you [the developer of an app] keep your cached data under your allocated quota, your cached files will be some of the last on the system to be cleared when necessary. When the system is deciding what cached files to delete inside your app, it will consider the oldest files first (as determined by modified time).”
Of course, this is for the developer preview. But as it appears, nothing has changed in the official version.
So, long story short. You don’t need to clear cached data at all, as the system should do that for you. Because of that, there’s no cache partition, which will put all cached data in one place.
In theory, this looks pretty good, because the system should do all the work for you, when there’s need to free up disk space. But in practice, it might not function as flawless as Google imagines it.
Clear cache for each app individually
Although the option to bulk clear your cached data on your phone is missing, you can still clear cache for each app individually, if you really want. And here’s how to do that:
- Go to Settings > Storage
- Navigate to Other apps
- Now, tap on the app you want to clear cache for
- Tap on Clear Cache
Use a third party app
Additionally, if you really want to buck clear cache on your Android phone, you can always use some third-party app. Some of the most popular apps for these purposes are CCleaner and Clean Master. But be careful, because some apps might actually slow down your device, or remove something you don’t want to be removed. So, just think about if it’s worth installing a third-party app for something your system would do on its own anyway.
That’s about it. I hope you understand the whole cache clearing philosophy better now. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, let me know in the comments, or reach me out on twitter.
This is complete bull****. Straight up its unacceptable i done weekly cache clearing to keep phone memory clear of excess forever. The apps don’t do it as google wants and Googles expectations are unrealistic and they living in a fantasy land thinking they will do it. I have an s8 cause i am poor and can’t buy newest phones for over 1000 dollars. Reality is i need be able to quickly clear cache weekly or bi weekly and I do not have the free time to go through every app on my phone individually that actually would take over an… Read more »
There’s still a way to clear cache all at once, in recovery mode. Which is the way I prefer to do so as it formats your cache memory (cleaner slate). For instance, for my Moto Z2 play, I power down the phone, then I hit the power & volume down button simultaneously and hold it for like 2 seconds. This brings me to a boot option screen, I then use the volume keys to scroll to “Recovery Mode” and use the power button to select. After the little green android robot shows onto the center of the screen laying down… Read more »
I’ve been wondering for sometime why I couldn’t clear the cache in bulk for my installed apps and now I know the reason. I’m not a fan of cleaner apps, they do more harm than good so I’m just clearing the cache of each app individually, even though it’s more time consuming then before. Why do Google insist on making things more difficult by taking away useful features like being able to clear the cache with just one tap? It looks like being able to check my battery temperature has gone too so I’ve had to install an app to… Read more »Redmi 8 common issues and how to solve them

12Page 1 of 2Apple recently released the latest iOS 13.5.1 update. The update is available to users of all compatible iPhone Models. Unlike the previous update, this one doesn’t bring any new features but instead focuses on improving the overall security of the OS.
Although Apple’s update release notes aren’t very clear on what exactly the new update does, it does state that the update addresses the vulnerability exploited by the uncover jailbreak. With that being said, most jailbreakers would want to avoid this update. The rest of the users can comfortably install this release, and they won’t notice any difference in the way their iPhone works.
Or will they?
Although the new update brings zero new features, it actually causes some problems to users who installed it. Users are reporting battery drains, Bluetooth issues, connectivity problems, and more.
However, none of the problems seems to be widespread, as these are the individually reported cases. You have better chances of installing the update without any problems, than being stuck with an annoying issue. Nevertheless, I’m going to list some of the reported problems here, so you can see what could potentially go wrong.
iOS 13.5.1 battery drain
Reports about the battery drain caused by iOS 13.5.1 have been circulating on Twitter since the update’s release. Here’s one of the complaints:
@AppleSupport iphone battery draining like crazy after upgrading to iOS 13.5.1.
What’s going on? Is there a fix??
— Dorian Staps (@DorianStaps) June 5, 2020
Right now, the solution to this problem is unknown. It appears that users experiencing the battery drain issue will have to wait for Apple to release a follow-up update.
iOS 13.5.1 Bluetooth issues
Although reported by the smaller number of users, it appears that Bluetooth also doesn’t work for some people who installed iOS 13.5.1.
@Apple my phones Bluetooth just won’t connect to any device even though it’s turned on and discoverable? Any ideas
— ashleigh harrop (@HarropAshleigh) June 3, 2020
iOS 13.5.1 Face ID issues
Although iOS 13.5 improved Face ID to make it work with face masks, some people apparently have problems with it stretching to iOS 13.5.1.
@AppleSupport Why my face id isn’t working? I just updated to ios 13.5.1 and now it’s keep telling me that face id is not available! Can you help me?
— Pedro Henrique Vuolo (@PedroVuolo) June 3, 2020
Other problems
Besides the above-mentioned issues that appear to be more common, there are also a few more problems, including a camera problem, weird charging (though this one wasn’t specified, so I can’t tell you whether it was indeed caused by iOS 13.5.1, and a SIM card issue where the phone shows SIM cards as invalid.
Unfortunately, there are no confirmed solutions to any of these problems. Apple support usually recommends generic solutions to particular problems, by I doubt any of those will be helpful. Users that were hit by the update will probably have to wait for a patch.
Have you experienced any issues after installing iOS 13.5.1? If so, feel free to share them with us in the comments below.
After updating to iPad iOS 13.5.1 charging takes about twice as long, drains fast, safari has dumped my open tabs, and text entry suggestions have gone berserk! What a pile of rubbish!
Here’s one of the complaints:
@AppleSupport iphone battery draining like crazy after upgrading to iOS 13.5.1.
What’s going on?
After my update to iOS 13.5.1 my battery began to drain, my phone start to freeze and stuck up all the time. Can they hurry and fix this problem caz it’s my first time owning a apple and I’m soo pissed I feel like Amma switch back to my android.
My face id stopped working on my Iphone X after 13.5.1. Always tells me to raise the iphone, lower the iphone, and ends up not being able to be set up. Had other people also try it on my phone to make sure it wasn’t related to my face – I have a beard. Didn’t work for my other test person either. Super irritating – didn’t realize how much I relied on it. I’ve searched everywhere and can’t find a solution that fixes it. I check multiple times a day for the next update.
Ugh, this is such garbage! Does anyone know how to fix this or go to an older operating system for their iphone? I have a 5SE and was working perfectly fine on Friday, now it is overheating and battery drain, and apps aren’t working. When is the next update?
Any solutions/suggestions would be much appreciated!
My father-in-laws iPhone 8 has horrible battery life after the update. My wife’s new iPhone SE also has horrible battery life. Hoping Apple issues a fix soon.Samsung keeps on giving with its incredible line of flagship devices. While we’re awaiting the S9 to hit the global market, let’s not forget about the S8 and how well-developed handset it is. However, even though S8 checks all the boxes, there are some issues we can’t neglect. Today, we’ll try to address Bluetooth issue which is, surprisingly, quite common.
Namely, a hefty number of users reported a variety of Bluetooth errors — starting with the connection breaking and reaching to a complete inability to connect in the first place. In order to address this, we provided a list of most common solutions. If you’re a proud S8 user but Bluetooth aches won’t stop, make sure to check the steps we provided below.
Solution 1 – Update your device
First things first. Reset your phone? Done that to no avail? Ok, moving on. Even the manufacturer claims that the majority of seeming hardware issues are rather software bugs, and you can resolve them by simply updating your firmware. Now, we know that these updates are sometimes more of a problem than the solution, but there’s so much you can do with the outdated device nowadays.
In the Bluetooth case, we can say that the Bluetooth 5 data transfer protocol is a novelty and that the older devices will have a hard time pairing with it. Nonetheless, that doesn’t mean that, by adjusting the software, you won’t be able to connect your S8 to your car, headphones or PC.
Follow these instructions to update your firmware on Samsung Galaxy S8:
- Connect to a stable Wi-Fi network.
- Open Settings.
- Tap System Update and check for updates.
- If there’s an update available, make sure to install it as soon as possible.
Solution 2 – Make sure that the pairing device can connect with S8
This is the second side of the same coin. When it comes to Bluetooth, it’s important that both devices are compatible for pairing. Some older stereo systems or wireless speakers can have a hard time pairing with S8, just due to the incompatibility with the newer standard S8 enforces.
Therefore, make sure that the other device is compatible with S8 and, once you’re certain that it can, update its firmware, as well. Since this procedure is digressing from the smartphone area, we advise you to look it up and find how to do it on your system/device.
Solution 3 – Forget all pairings and restart Bluetooth service
Let’s move to a sphere of our common understanding. As you already know, there’s no a limitation on devices you can pair with. You can pair with one, a few, or dozens — it’ll give you the same result. However, since Android stores the data of every paired device, this can, in some sense, invoke Bluetooth issues.
- Open Settings.
- Choose Bluetooth.
- Tap Paired devices.
- Tap the cog-like settings icon and choose Unpair/Forget.
- Now, get back to Settings and open Application manager.
- Click on the upper-right menu and Show system processes.
- Open Bluetooth Application Manager and clear cache and data.
- Restart your S8 and look for changes.
Solution 4 – Disable NFC and Wi-Fi
This is a commonly recommended step for fixing Bluetooth issues. Namely, the premise is that the frequencies of other wireless data transfer methods affect Bluetooth. In this case, those are NFC and Wi-Fi.
It’s still a long shot, but you can at least try. So, before you enable Bluetooth radio on your S8, disable both NFC and Wireless. This can simply be done by swiping down the panel and tapping both NFC and Wi-Fi, respectively. Once you’ve done it, try reconnecting with Bluetooth and look for improvements.
Solution 5 – Reset Network settings
Even though there’s only so much it can wrong concerning network settings — Bluetooth settings in this particular case — you can try and reset them to factory settings. Namely, we are trying to avoid complete factory restore, and this is a good way to resolve connectivity issues while keeping your data intact.
In case you can’t find your way on your own, these steps should show you how to reset network settings on Samsung Galaxy S8:
- Open Backup and reset.
- Locate Reset Network settings.
- Tap on Reset Network settings to confirm the selection and restart your device.
If you run into any kind of issue with your handset and looked up for solutions, there’s a good chance that someone recommended wiping cache partition. As you might have heard, the internal storage has a special partition which deals with the temporary cache files. These files speed up the loading time and enable your Android OS to load faster.
However, they might as well, after some time, pile up and cause issues with various services. In this scenario, the abundance or corruption of cache in the dedicated partition might have broken Bluetooth.
By wiping cache partition on your S8, you should be able to resolve the error. Also, don’t worry about losing your data. Only the Factory reset will relieve you of everything you stored on your device.
If you’re not sure how to wipe cache partition on Galaxy S8, follow the instructions provided below:
- Power off the device.
- Press and hold continually Power button + Home button + Volume Down key until the Logo screen appears.
- Use Volume keys to locate Wipe cache partition in the Recovery menu.
- Press Power button to confirm the selection.
- Choose ”Yes” and press Power button again.
- Your device will restart and start the procedure.
- Once the cache partition is wiped, try connecting via Bluetooth again.
Finally, if none of the previous solutions failed to satisfy, we can recommend trying running your device in Safe Mode. This way you’ll basically eliminate the handset’s software from the equation. Basically, if you’re still unable to pair with other devices via Bluetooth, it’s safe to say that either that opposite device is the culprit or the hardware is the one which needs a thorough inspection.
Follow these steps to boot Samsung Galaxy S8 in Safe Mode:
- Turn off your S8.
- Press and hold Power button past the initial screen, until it reaches Samsung logo.
- Immediately after you release Power button, press and hold Volume Down key until the device restarts in the Safe mode. You should see the ”Safe mode” inscription.
- Try using Bluetooth in Safe mode. If it works, uninstall lately installed Bluetooth-dependant apps. If it doesn’t work, make sure to call your handset vendor or carrier.
That’s it. In case you have questions or suggestions of some kind, make sure to tell us in the comments section below.Home Authors Posts by Ivan Jenic

123...9Page 1 of 9Spotify is, for more than a few reasons, the most popular music streaming service in the world, especially on handheld devices run by iOS and Android. However, some Android users have had a hard time using media controls on the lock screen recently. More than a few Samsung Galaxy S10 users reported that Spotify Lock screen media controls are not working on their devices.
We made sure to search for applicable solutions and provide them below.
Table of contents:
- Check Lock Screen settings
- Clear cache and data from Spotify
- Disable Battery optimization
- Reinstall Spotify
Spotify lock screen media controls not working on Samsung S10
Solution 1 – Check Lock Screen settings
The first thing you should do is to check Lock Screen settings and allow Spotify to create its own widget. In order to do so, you should disable the stock MusicFace widget.
Follow these steps to disable MusicFace widget:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Lockscreen.
- Open FaceWidgets.
- Disable Music widget.
- Reboot your device and check for the resolution.
Solution 2 – Clear cache and data from Spotify
That way, you’ll basically reset the app. Although, have in mind that clearing the local data will delete all downloaded music.
Here’s how to clear cache and data from Spotify:
Solution 3 – Disable Battery optimization
Some users suggested that the best solution for the unresponsive media commands on S10’s lock screen is to disable battery optimization for Spotify. This will allow Spotify Lock screen media controls that are not working to start working in the background.
- Navigate to Settings > Apps.
- Open Spotify.
- Select Battery optimization.
- Disable Battery optimization for Spotify and reboot your device.
Solution 4 – Reinstall Spotify
Finally, if none of the previous steps worked for you, make sure to reinstall the Spotify and start from scratch.
With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below.Even though a lot of Android users are still waiting for an update to Nougat 7.0, Google announced brand new OS. Android Oreo or Oreos is the 8th Android installment and should be available for consumers in August or September 2017.
For the time being, Google released Developers Preview version that should showcase upcoming features. It’s available only for Google-powered devices, namely for:
So if you have one of these models, you can try out Android O. However, have in mind that this is not a stable version and you can encounter a large variety of issues. For that purpose, we listed some of the known issues for this preview release, so you can know what to expect.
Known issues of Android O Developer Preview
System User Interface Issues
With Android O, Google conducted various changes and improvements with UI. Sadly, you may have a hard time experiencing those when we consider these reported issues:
-
”System UI crash after toggling screen brightness, then going to Overview (recent) and selecting a new app.
-
Occasional issues navigating Home, with incomplete transition making the device unusable.
-
Taps in Quick Settings may be registered in another location.
-
When using Autofill, an “Android system app displaying on top” message is sometimes shown, but it can be ignored (if it’s turned off, it will disable Autofill).”
Google Cloud Messaging/Firebase Cloud Messaging
Cloud Messaging is also unstable in this preview version. These are the problems that occurred with some users:
-
”FCM doesn’t work in a secondary profile unless the app is also installed on the primary profile. If the app is not installed on the primary profile, an FCM token is not generated in the secondary profile.
-
Developers using FCM/GCM with Android O should update their Google Play services SDK to version 10.2.1, which is available from the SDK manager in Android Studio.”
Android TV Issues
The Nexus Player has specific issues on its own. We are bringing you whole detailed list below.
- ”Setting up a restricted profile then restarting the device causes the device to be unusable.
- Typing in the search bar causes a crash.
- PIP image does not fill the window.
- Launching applications via voice command does not work.
- Application size is not displayed in Application Settings.
- Microphone button on remote control does not work.
- Factory reset does not work on Fugu.
- Connected remote control device disconnects intermittently.
- USB connected drive cannot be formatted. The Setup as device storage formatting option does not work properly for drive attached via USB.
- Device may freeze with blank homescreen when plug is inserted.
- Location status in Settings may become disabled with user unable to re-enable.
- Not able to reorder games in the apps and games row.
- Content may not play after relaunching media apps.”
Android for Work and Device Manager Issues
Android for Work is a great feature that let you create and manage work-specific profile separately from the private one. At the moment, there is a single reported issue regarding Android for Work.
- ”Enabling a Work Profile may cause a crash in Settings app. To work around this issue, remove and re-add the Work Profile.”
Besides that, users reported occasional crashes while trying to access the Device Manager.
- ”Selecting the Settings > Security and Screen Lock > Android Device Manager menu item may cause a crash. Updating to the latest version of Google Play services will resolve this issue.”
Android Wear Issues
Besides handsets and Android TV, Android Wear has also support trough Android Emulator System Images. However, it’s not without issues.
- ”Embedded app installation from Play Store can sometimes crash. Side-loading can be used to work around this issue.
- Only the x86 emulator is currently supported.
- Default watch face complications may not load until you switch watch faces or otherwise touch watch face settings, or reboot the device.”
Wi-Fi Issues
Performance and Battery Issues
As you would expect, this is release is not advisable for everyday use. It is quite buggy and unstable performance-wise.
- ”System and app performance is known to be periodically slow / janky, and device may become occasionally unresponsive. These problems may become more acute with prolonged use.
- Some apps may not function normally on Developer Preview 1. This includes Google’s apps as well as other apps.
- This release has various stability and performance issues on all devices that make it not suitable for daily use on phone or tablet, especially for non-developers.”
Moreover, the same goes for battery. If you are willing to try out Android O Developer Preview, prepare for battery drainage.
And with the lack of percentage that is removed from UI, you won’t be able to determine consumption as easily as before.
Other Issues
Besides best-known issues, you may face a variety of secondary issues related to lack of optimization. Don’t forget that some of the apps/features you may use are still not compatible with novelties that Android O brings to the table.
- ”Using the Google Drive app’s PDF viewer to load a PDF document may cause the device to freeze.
- Apps or games may hit ANRs in GLThread, such as with
AssetManager::open , that cause crash or failure to load properly.
- Games using Google Play games services may have problems with sign-in.
- The latest release of Android Auto may not work properly on Developer Preview 1.
- The NDK cannot build targeting Android O DP1 (an upcoming r15 release will fix).”
Have in mind that these are only the ‘noticed’ issues since we are too early in this release phase. So, a large variety of unlisted issues can occur. Additionally, features like Android Pay are not available due to security reasons.
At the end, unless you’re a developer or knowledgeable enthusiast, we don’t advise you to install Developers Preview. Soon enough we should be able to download Beta version with CTS (Compatibility Test Suite) approval. That should be much safer to work with.
What are your first thoughts on Android O? What are the changes you eagerly await?
A lot of trouble using WiFi. Nearly unusable, but no problems with Mobile Data. On Pixel
Same here. And my phone no longer sees my Google Home, or any of my Chromecasts!
No internet when off of wifi even though mobile data enabled. Very slow recharge using USB A cable. Fast battery drain.

I went on here to see if anyone’s settings app crashes when opened Everytime. The only way I can get in there is though quick toggles and if I’m in airplane mode. WiFi and Bluetooth can be on but not service (cumsumer Cellular) hate it dont use switching to project fi when the Sim comes in. Other then that a super stable experience

So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you.
Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X:
- Go to Settings > System
- Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia)
Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates.
Thanks Georgi for the tip!
Original article:
Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version.
I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now.
It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier.
Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable!
As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly.
Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below.
Mine my dad’s and my brother’s 5x All had the big core failure :/ so ours doesn’t run at all.
Your Nexus 5x still works? We bought two when they came out– they both went black and we lost all of our valuable texts. LG admits to the defect. I recommend backing up your data, and buying another phone that isn’t LG
I came back. One solution, which is not a silver bullet, but seems to improve performance and battery life considerably, is to disable background usage for apps that are not optimized for Oreo (Yes… Even in 2018) You do that by going to settings, apps and notifications, going by each app, and clicking on battery usage . If there is a toggle slide for “background activity”, disable it. Do that for as many apps as possible. This shall not affect notifications (although don’t take my word for it).

Changing to OpenGL(Skia) solved the problem. But upon restarting the it changes to the default settings though.
I’ve solved it in limiting the number of inactive process (in dev options)
I did the update and the entire phone slowed down. Very very painfully. Cmon Google. Sort it out.
these dev options worked beautifully. thanks for the share.
Does this void my warranty?
Updated to 8.1.0 yesterday, Nexus 5X. Today it is so slow it’s painful.iOS 14 introduces all kinds of new features that make the users excited to download Apple’s latest OS. The redesigned Home Screen mechanics, changing default apps, and of course, widgets are just a few new features that make iOS 14 the most enticing iOS update in years.
And while most users love the new options, there are still those who aren’t excited about iOS 14. Mostly because they had some needless problems caused by the latest update.
The battery drain is one of the most frequent issues. Social media sites and multiple forums on iOS 14 are currently flooded with reports of poor battery life. If you’ve also noticed the decrease, I’m sure you’ll want to get things back to normal, or at least grasp what’s going on better. So, here we’ll try to clarify the situation and maybe find a viable solution.

Just wait…
As ZDNet’s Adrian Kingsley-Hughes points out, the worse battery life on a freshly-installed OS is more a rule than an exception. When you install a big update, like iOS 14, your phone has to do a lot of background work to get everything in order.
First, there’s battery calibration and indexing. These processes use more battery on their own, so that’s when the “initial” drain will probably happen. On top of that, a recalibrated battery can give you the impression that it drains faster when in reality it doesn’t.
Then, there are all those pending app updates. A new major iOS version is also a big thing for developers who’ve been improving their apps to work better with iOS 14. So naturally, most of your apps will receive updates within a few days of installing the new OS.
And, of course, the most probable reason for bad battery life on your iPhone: Bugs. We already know that the release of iOS 14 was a bit hurried by Apple, which led to all kinds of problems. First of all, there’s possibly something that triggers battery drainage within the iOS 14 code. On top of that, as developers didn’t have enough time to polish their apps, your iPhone’s battery life could also be shortened by an unoptimized third-party app.
So, with all these factors in mind, is there anything you can do to deal with the draining battery? Well, not so much. You can either sit and wait for Apple to release a fixing update or delete an app you assume consumes more power than usual (we’ll talk about it in a bit).
Solution 1 – Keep Low Power mode enabled
The signature battery-saving feature of the iPhone is its Low Power Mode. As you can tell from its name, when you enable this mode, your phone pauses all the battery-consuming background processes, like updating apps, syncing to iCloud, Background App Refresh, etc. By putting all these tasks on hold the phone consumes less power, hence the name.
By default, you’ll get the prompt to enable Low Power mode each time your battery percentage goes below 20%. But you can also manually activate it at any time, and your phone will remain in this “state” until you turn it back off, or until the battery percentage reaches at least 80% when charging.
To turn Low Power mode on go to Settings > Battery, and toggle the Low Power Mode option on.
Now, I know keeping Low Power mode constantly on can be frustrating (I personally find it very annoying), because your iPhone won’t be able to perform some basic functions, but it should theoretically extend your daily mileage until the fix arrives.
Solution 2 – Turn off Location Services
You’d be surprised to learn how many apps installed on your phone actually want to know your location. And to do so, each app needs to interact with iPhone’s Location Services, which is battery-consuming.
We’re not talking privacy here, but you should keep those apps in check for technical reasons, as well. While you probably won’t notice any difference when the battery situation is “normal”, keeping the Location Services usage in check could be very helpful in times like this.
You have two options here. Either deny access to Location Services to apps you don’t think really need it, or disable Location Services altogether. Whatever you choose, here’s how to do it
- Go to Settings.
- Head over to Privacy > Location Services.
- Here you can disable Location Services as a whole, or control each app’s usage of this feature individually.
Solution 3 – Delete power-consuming apps
IOS has made it so simple, easy, and even aesthetically stunning to use apps on the iPhone that we barely pay attention to what’s going on in the background. And we’re not supposed to, that’s the whole point of it. Apple’s job is to take care of the technicalities, yours is just to enjoy the end product.
But if you take the extra step and look under the hood (as much as Apple allows it), you could find some extra insight into how you use your apps. Of course, I’m talking, of course, about an app that could eat up your battery without you even knowing it. This is especially possible in the early days of a new iOS, since not every app has been updated to work seamlessly on the latest version.
But you use so many apps, how can you figure out which app uses more power than it should and whether that app even exists? Well, there’s no direct way, but you can use iOS battery reporting to get the closest idea.
Go to Settings > Battery. On this page, you’ll get detailed reports of your battery use for up to 10 days back. The best thing about this report is that it gives you battery usage by app, which is essential for our little investigation. Go through the list of apps carefully to see if you can find one that uses more battery than it does usually. If you identify such an app, your best bet is probably to delete that app and wait for its developer to deliver an updated version that won’t drain the battery on iOS 14.
Tip: Pay special attention to the background activity of apps. If an app constantly does something in the background, it’s probably a good idea to remove it for some time.
Solution 4 – Background App Refresh
As the name suggests, Background App Refresh is a feature that allows apps, even if you are not actually using them, to update and search for new content. This makes for a smooth experience, as you don’t have to wait for an app to load every time you switch back to it.
But as convenient as this feature is, it still consumes battery. A tiny chunk tho, but it might be noticeable when your battery life isn’t at its best. So, you can turn off this feature and see if the battery improves.
The obvious downside here is that you can’t seamlessly slide through apps anymore, as you’ll have to wait for each app to load new content. This will slightly slow you down and your iPhone won’t feel as fast, but the battery should last longer.
Here’s how to disable Background App Refresh in iOS 14:
- Go to Settings.
- Head over to General > Background App Refresh.
- Here you disable Background App Refresh completely of for individual apps.
Widgets are the biggest star of iOS 14. I’m almost positive most of you were caught by the “Home Screen fever” that has begun ravaging millions of iPhones starting September 16. I would’ve never thought that something as trivial as organizing Home Screen could turn into a legit competition for who’s going to be the most creative when arranging icons and widgets.
By the way, if you’ve created your own little piece of art on your Home Screen, feel free to share it with us in the comments, a lot of people would probably love to steal your ideas.
But, all the hype and creative work aside, there may be some widgets that are doing you more harm than good. At least for now. I keep blabbing about how Apple rushed iOS 14, leaving developers with little to no time to optimize their apps. Well, it’s possible that a certain app on your phone hasn’t been properly updated, which makes it, for example, eat more battery than it should. It’s unlikely, but still possible.
The only way you come close to finding out if that’s indeed the case is to get to the battery report (as shown in Solution 3). Once again, go through the list of apps and see if any of them is using an unusual amount of battery. If a widget of that app appears to be on your Home Screen maybe you found the culprit. So, perhaps instead of completely uninstalling that app, removing its widget form Home Screen would be enough. Just experiment and see what happens.
That would be all for our little investigation. I hope at least one of these tips will help you preserve some battery life. Until Apple gets its act together and delivers that fixing update, which is probably the only real solution to the battery draining problem. That can happen tomorrow or in a few months. We never know, so it’s a good idea to give your battery some remedy in the meantime.
You’ll probably sacrifice a feature or your iPhone’s signature smooth performance, but at least you won’t find it out of juice in the middle of your workday.Android Oreo has changed the way we clear cached data on our phones! Which left some users confused, as the process isn’t as straightforward and simple as it used to be in Android Nougat.
In Android Nougat, you could simply go to Storage settings, and bulk clear all the cache on your phone. That’s very practical, because users don’t have to bother clearing each app’s cache individually. A time-saving feature, we must say.
But that’s not the case anymore. When you go to Storage settings in Android Oreo, you won’t see this option anymore. That’s because Google decided to remove the traditional cache-clearing fature from Oreo.
So, how do we actually clear cache in Android Oreo now?
How is cached data cleared in Android Oreo
To understand what’s going on, we’ll have to include the whole picture. With Android O, Google wants to change the whole policy of using, storing, and clearing cached data. Google encourages developers to be more ‘efficient’ in developing their apps.
Here’s what the Android O developer preview release notes say:
“Android O gives better guidance and behaviors around cached data. Each app is now given a disk space quota for cached data….
When the system needs to free up disk space, it will start by deleting cached files from apps that are the most over their allocated quota. Thus, if you [the developer of an app] keep your cached data under your allocated quota, your cached files will be some of the last on the system to be cleared when necessary. When the system is deciding what cached files to delete inside your app, it will consider the oldest files first (as determined by modified time).”
Of course, this is for the developer preview. But as it appears, nothing has changed in the official version.
So, long story short. You don’t need to clear cached data at all, as the system should do that for you. Because of that, there’s no cache partition, which will put all cached data in one place.
In theory, this looks pretty good, because the system should do all the work for you, when there’s need to free up disk space. But in practice, it might not function as flawless as Google imagines it.
Clear cache for each app individually
Although the option to bulk clear your cached data on your phone is missing, you can still clear cache for each app individually, if you really want. And here’s how to do that:
- Go to Settings > Storage
- Navigate to Other apps
- Now, tap on the app you want to clear cache for
- Tap on Clear Cache
Use a third party app
Additionally, if you really want to buck clear cache on your Android phone, you can always use some third-party app. Some of the most popular apps for these purposes are CCleaner and Clean Master. But be careful, because some apps might actually slow down your device, or remove something you don’t want to be removed. So, just think about if it’s worth installing a third-party app for something your system would do on its own anyway.
That’s about it. I hope you understand the whole cache clearing philosophy better now. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, let me know in the comments, or reach me out on twitter.
I followed these directions. I have no “other apps”. I can’t find anything now with this stupid oreo update. I’m really hating these companies now. I’m hating technology right now.
I hate Oreo as well
sucks says delete cache one app at a time
but cache never deletes at all
Clear all cache option is far better than this. It is time consuming as well no such good use.
Tnx!!! FilesGo fine work on Oreo!
Use Microsoft launcher. It doesn’t hang any way in my mind a1. Good laucher
Hey Ivan!
My Oneplus 3 was very unresponsive after updating to Android Oreo. But after following your step by step guide and clearing the app cache it is like a new phone.
Thanks for this tutorial.
With the beta release of Files Go you can clear the cache for all apps in one fell swoop.

How to get IMEI on Android 10
123...22Page 1 of 22Android Oreo is finally here for some Pixel and Nexus devices. While Google promises the new Android version will improve the overall performance of your phone, it appears that’s not exactly the case. Because people have already encountered various issues caused by Android O.
According to some reports, Android Oreo breaks the OK Google feature on some devices. Even though everything was fine in Android Nougat, users are now unable to perform some sound commands.
I’ve searched online for potential solutions, and as it appears, there’s a way to fix the problem. Unlike some other issues, that users basically have to wait for Google to fix them through updates. So, Let’s see what can we do about OK Google issues in Android O.
Solution 1 – Retrain OK Google
The solution that helped the majority of Android users with the OK Google problem is simply retraining the assistant. It looks like installing the update somehow disrupted the assistant, so retraining is needed.
In case you’re not sure how to retrain Google Assistant, follow these instructions:
- Go to Settings
- Go to Apps & notifications > expand Advanced > Default apps > Assist & voice input
- Tap the settings (gear) icon next to Assist app
- Go to “Ok Google” detection
- Now, choose Delete voice model, to reset Google Now settings
- After that, choose Retrain voice model
- Finish the training
That’s all. After re-training your assistant, Google Now should be working seamlessly once again. However, if re-training didn’t get the job done, move on to the next solution.
Solution 2 – Check your language settings
There’s also a slight chance installing Android Oreo corrupted your language settings. So, check if your Voice language matches your system language, to be sure Google Now will work well.
To check Voice language settings, follow these instructions:
- Go to Settings
- Go to Apps & notifications > expand Advanced > Default apps > Assist & voice input
- Tap the settings (gear) icon next to Assist app
- Tap Languages
- Make sure the right language is selected
Solution 3 – Check for updates
And finally, maybe the update itself disrupt Google Now, with some internal bug. That’s not the case with the Nexus and Pixel devices, but could be with other manufacturers (this article was written at the time when only Nexus and Pixel devices had Android Oreo).
That’s about it. I certainly hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem with OK Google after installing the Oreo update. If not, let me know in the comments below, or reach me out on Twitter.
Yeah I have a G5 and my ok google has stopped as well…Really sucks when your job is driving for a living … TRIED EVERYTHING so frustrated
no more ok google and hey google on oreo now.
I have the Oreo 8.0 in a brand new Xiaomi A1 and ok Google is not an option. It appears in light grey, can’t turn on and when the system suggested me to use it, I clicked on it and the same as some users in the comments happened: connection fail… Me wifi works just fine. I can’t retrain it 🙁
O have the same problem in xiaomi mi a1 if you can fix that text me the solution please
I am using a Cubot X18 running Android 7 and everything was running perfectly, including the new ‘Hey Google’ Google Assistant feature. The Google app was updated and I suddenly noticed that voice commands were not working anymore. I tried to retrain the voice but although it was asking me to say ‘Ok Google’ the voice training wasn’t being accepted. The actual part of the menu where you turned the Google Assistant on was greyed out. As a last resort I uninstalled the latest update and then the phone would let me retrain the voice which gave me back ‘Ok… Read more »Protecting your iPhone apps with Face ID is a tempting concept. Especially if you value privacy and security, and don’t mind waiting an extra second or doing an extra step for the sake of keeping your data safe.
It’s possible to protect your iPhone apps with Face ID, but only to some extent. Namely, you can only use Face ID with the apps that support it. And you can count those apps on your fingers. For every other app, you’ll have to accept that you can’t secure it with Face ID. At least not without jailbreaking your phone.
I wish I could tell you about some way to hack the system, but it’s simply not possible. Whether you can lock an app with Face ID is strictly a developer’s choice. So I’ll try and explain why’s that the case, and how to at least protect the apps that support this feature.
Table of contents:
- Apps that natively support Face IDHow to protect WhatsApp with Face IDHow to protect Dropbox with Face IDHow to protect Google Drive with Face IDHow to protect Apple Notes with Face IDHow to protect Amazon with Face IDHow to protect Apple App Store with Face ID
- Why can’t you lock all apps with Face ID?
Apps that natively support Face ID
As I said, there’s only a small number of apps that allow you to lock them with Face ID. That’s because developers of these apps had to specifically integrate the Face ID support into the apps’ code. Other developers simply opted not to, as they assume such feature isn’t integral for the functioning of their apps.
Apple is one of those developers. Out of all the first-party apps, you can only secure Apple Notes with Face ID. No other Apple app supports this option. So, forget about protecting your Photos with Face ID.
But we’ll get to that later. For now, let’s focus on the apps that allow you to protect them with Face ID. Although there aren’t as many apps that support biometrics, I couldn’t list all of them. So, I’ll only go through some of the most popular apps. But you’ll get the idea of how its done, even if the app you’re looking for isn’t on the list.
Here are some of the most popular apps that support Face ID:
Now, let’s quickly run through some of the popular apps, and you’ll see.
If WhatsApp is your primary messaging app, and you don’t want anyone to access your messages, protecting WhatsApp with Face ID is a good idea. You can easily do that by following these instructions:
How to protect Dropbox with Face ID
For those of you who prefer storing your files to Dropbox over Google Drive or iCloud, you can add an extra layer of security with FaceID. Here’s how to protect Dropbox with Face ID:
- Open Dropbox.
- Go to Account from the bottom bar, and head over to Settings (the gear icon in the upper left corner).
- Choose Turn Passcode On.
- Choose your Dropbox passcode.
- Enable Use Face ID.
- Next time you open Dropbox, just allow it to use the Face ID data, and you’re good to go.
How to protect Google Drive with Face ID
If Google Drive is your preferred cloud storage service, setting up the Face ID lock is as simple as it gets. However, it only applies to the Google Drive app itself. So, it won’t lock other Google apps that are connected to Drive, like Photos.
Here’s how to protect Google Drive with Face ID:
How to protect Apple Notes with Face ID
You can’t protect most of Apple’s native apps with Face ID, but Apple Notes is an exception. In fact, the app even allows you to protect each note with biometrics data, for even more security.
Although the whole process requires a few more steps than protecting other apps, it’s as simple and straightforward as it gets. Here’s what you need to do:
- Go to Settings > Notes.
- Go to Password.
- Fill in the required password fields and enable Face ID. You just set the universal settings that will apply to each note you choose to lock.
- Now, head over to Notes, find the note you want to protect, tap and hold it to open the haptic menu and choose Lock note.
- The app will automatically lock the chosen note with the password you set beforehand and your Face ID data.
Amazon doesn’t exactly do the best job of protecting its app, but the Face ID integration is still there. While you can’t use Face ID when opening the app, Amazon requires Face ID (or password) when you’re accessing the sensitive parts of your account.
To make sure Face ID is enabled, head over to Settings > Amazon, and make sure the Use Biometrics authentication when available option is enabled.
You don’t need to do anything to protect the App Store with Face ID. That’s because the Face ID protection is already enabled by default. You can’t install an app or make a purchase without having to pass Face ID first.
But I’m going to show you how to turn this option on/off, just in case something goes wrong. I also don’t recommend disabling Face ID authentication in the App Store, because it’s just one extra step that may potentially save your skin in some extreme scenarios.
To enable/disable Face ID authentication in the App Store, do the following:
Naturally, you could ask: “Why can’t I use Face ID with every app?” It’s a legit question, but asking it neglects the important factor that makes the whole idea impossible.
Let’s start with Face ID itself. As soon as Apple introduced the technology with the iPhone X back in 2017, security alerts went red. The idea of giving their face data to a huge corporation scared a lot of people.
However, Apple was ready to tackle the suspicion by clarifying that one’s face data is only stored locally, in a special part of the processor called Security Enclave. Not a single bit of face data is being uploaded to Apple’s servers. Moreover, Face ID doesn’t use the visual image of your face, but only a mathematical representation of it.
I don’t want to get too technical here, so if you want to learn more about how Face ID works, check Apple’s official documentation.
In an era when businesses are being built around selling users’ data, Apple’s decision not to share sensitive face data was highly praised. It made perfect sense for Apple since the company makes most of its money selling hardware. The software just comes as a part of the package. Apple just doesn’t need to sell (all of the users’) data to turn a profit, as it’s already the richest company in the world. On top of that, promising users a sense of security is probably the best PR move a tech company can make today.
But when the original hype settled down, Apple spoiled the good impression to some extent. While keeping the actual Face ID data secured and stored locally, the company provided an API to third-party developers that will allow them to exploit some of the iPhone’s face recognition functionalities.
Using that API, developers can make apps that will turn your face into an emoji and mimic your expressions in real-time, add flashy filters for social media, etc. In essence, an app can capture your face’s visual image, and do basically anything with it. But that’s only allowed in-app. So, an app can “have” your face, but only if you willingly capture it. Other, more sensitive actions, like unlocking the phone or face authentication are beyond the reach.
To finally clarify the possible confusion, apps that use Face ID for protection never get to access the Face ID data. An app is only notified as to whether the authentication was successful. Once an app receives a positive “signal”, it lets you proceed.
You can read more about what apps can and can’t do with Face ID here.
That brings us to developers. With everything above being said, it’s obvious that the choice is solely on them. If developers think implementing the Face ID integration is necessary, they will have it. Using this feature makes sense for banking apps or storage services. However, developers of more casual apps simply don’t want to go through the extra trouble. Mostly for the sake of convenience.
From the users’ perspective, the only thing left for arguing is whether a certain app needs Face ID protection or not. And if you think about it, most of them don’t. Using Face ID with every single app will only bring unnecessary hassle. After all, the whole iOS experience is about convenience and simplicity.
On the other hand, I also understand those of you who are willing to trade convenience for security. But my question is, can you really do that today?
I have iphone 11 ios 13 and face id don’t work on dropbox despite of many updates to the most recently update.
My dropbox in basic not premium.
In setting at dropbox I activate 4 digits pin , activate Face id , then sign out.
When I open dropbox again the app don’t show me digits or face id , just login with email+ pass or google,facebook,apple accounts.
What is wrong?
Thank you.It appears that the problem with accessing the Contacts app in Android is an ongoing issue. And if you’re reading this article, chances are you have the same problem.
People don’t expect from such a simple app to cause any problems. And it’s very simplicity leaves us a very little space for troubleshooting. Contacts barely has a Settings page, which makes users wondering if there’s anything they can do to resolve this problem.
Luckily, the problem usually doesn’t lie in the Contacts app itself. It’s usually other apps or services that are blocking Contacts from opening. So, we’re going to investigate the case in this article and bring your precious contacts back to you.
Fix: Can’t open Contacts on Android
Solution 1 – Free up some memory
Believe it or not, contacts occupy memory, too. Unless you keep them in your Google account. So, if your contacts are stored locally, and your phone memory is low, there can be some interferences.
Before you do anything else, make sure you have enough free memory on your phone. If your phone’s memory is low, delete some unnecessary apps, or clear the cache, and you should be good.
On the other hand, if you have enough memory, but the contacts are still ‘broken’, move on to another solution.
Solution 2 – Disable the Google+ app
Some users who have encountered this problem before suggest that disabling or uninstalling the Google+ app solves the problem. I can’t tell why Google+ causes interferences with the Contacts. But, disabling it may solve the problem.
Here’s how to uninstall the Google+ app:
- Go to Settings.
- Navigate to Apps & notifications, and tap See all apps.
- Tap Google+, and go to Uninstall.
- Reboot your phone.
This is all good if you’re not using Google+. You won’t miss it. But if you do use Google’s social network, I doubt you’ll want to get rid off it for such a bizarre reason. In that case, just stop the app, reboot your phone, and hopefully, you’ll solve the problem.
- Go to Settings > Apps & notifications, and tap See all apps.
- Tap Google+, and go to Force stop.
- Don’t forget to reboot your device.
Solution 3 – Delete old voicemails
Another thing that can cause problems with contacts is your voicemail service. Numerous users say that deleting old voicemails actually solves this problem. So, if previous solutions didn’t work for you, go and delete your old voicemail messages. Maybe you’ll solve the problem.
This one’s actually a bit tricky. Because it depends on your carrier. Although we know old voicemails can actually cause the problem, nobody ever confirmed which carriers’ voicemail services cause the contacts issue. And I can’t tell you if your carrier is on ‘the list’.
Solution 4 – Check the app permissions
The Contacts app should have the permission to access your contacts by default. And that’s how it is most of the time. But the Contacts app may lose that permission for any reason. Maybe it’s a faulty update, or you just disabled the permission by accident.
Either way, you should go and check if such permission is granted. Here’s how to do that:
- Go to Settings.
- Navigate to Apps & notifications, and tap Permissions > Contacts.
- Make sure the Contacts app has the permission to use contacts by toggling it on.
That’s about it. At least one of these solutions should help you access the Contacts app on your Android phone again. But if you actually can access the app, but the concepts are just not there, don’t worry, we’ve got you covered, as well.
Fix: Contacts not showing on Android
If you can one the Concats app, the contacts are just not there, congratulations on your new phone! There are just two scenarios that come to my mind when it comes to vanished contacts. You either just got a new phone and have yet to set it up, or you simply logged out of your Google account.
Let’s break it down.
Solution 1 – Just log in to your Google Account
If you’re not signed in to your Google Account, your phone cannot import contacts associated with it. Well, just sign in with your Google Account, and you should be good.
Don’t worry your phone will remind you to that every second, so you don’t really need a tutorial on that one. Once you’ve set up your Google Account, contacts associated with it should appear automatically.
Unless…
Solution 2 – Sync your contacts with Google Account
If you’ve ever used your Google Account on an Android phone before, your contacts should sync automatically. However, there’s a chance you still cannot see your contacts, in which case you’ll have to sync them manually.
To do that, you’ll have to login with your Google Account to your old phone, and copy the contacts by yourself. Here’s how to do that:
- Go to Settings > Users & accounts.
- Find your Google Account (email).
- Tap Account Sync.
- Make sure Contacts are toggled.
- Wait a couple of minutes for Google to sync contacts.
Now, just log back in to your new phone, and synced contacts should be there.
Solution 3 – Import contacts
And finally, if you don’t keep your contacts in your Google Account, but prefer SIM or microSD card, you’ll have to import your contacts first, before being able to access them.
Here’s how to do that:
- Open the Contacts app.
- Tap the three-tabbed button and go to Settings.
- Tap Import and choose the source of your contacts.
- Wait a couple of minutes for contacts to sync.
That’s about it. I hope that at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem and that you can access and see all your contacts once again.
If you have any comments, suggestions, or additional questions, just let us know in the comments down below.
The Google Android Contacts App will not open your Google contact for editing, if the notes you saved online to your contact using your PC have to many characters (too long). Use your PC to edit your Google contact online and reduce the number of notes you have in the notes field. Once reduced, you will be able to edit your contact using your Google Contact Android App on your cellular device.

Google Play Store says Error Checking for updates
There are multiple reasons why the Google Play Store keeps checking for updates. To fix it, we suggest clearing cache and data from the Store or uninstalling updates.
If that doesn’t help, there are a few more steps here you should try.
Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from the Play Store
The first step to try is to clear the cache and data from the Play Store app within System Settings. Cached data might cause issues with the Play Store, especially if some significant changes are made to the Store recently via background updates.
Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from the Google Play Store:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps.
- Then open All apps or App Manager.
- Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose to show system processes.
- Locate the Google Play Store and open it.
- Open Storage.
- Clear cache first and then all data.
If the Google Play Store keeps checking for updates after this step, move to the next one.
Solution 2 – Check the network
The unstable network is usually not the primary reason for error like this one, but it’s worth checking it out. We’ll need you to ensure that your device is connected to a stable network. This can be tested within any other app that uses network connectivity (e.g. Chrome).
- Disable and re-enable Wi-Fi.
- Disable VPN or Proxy.
- Restart your device and router/modem.
- Enable Airplane mode and disable it after a minute or so.
- Reset the Network settings.
Additionally, if you are using Mobile Data to navigate through the Store and download/update apps, make sure to check the in-app Settings and allow Downloads over any network.
Here’s how to do it:
- Open Play Store. If it doesn’t open, boot your device in Safe mode. To access the Safe mode, press the Power button. Tap and hold on the Reboot button until you get the Safe mode prompt. Then tap Safe mode and your device will restart without third-party apps and services.
- Tap on the hamburger menu.
- Open Settings.
- Under the App download preference, select Over any network.
Solution 3 – Reset the Google Play Store
If the previous steps failed to address the issue and the Google Play Store still keeps checking for updates, we recommend resetting the Google Play Store. On basically all stock ROMs out there, users can’t reinstall the Store. What you can do, on the other hand, is reset all updates and wait until it updates again on its own.
Follow these instructions to reset the Google Play Store by uninstalling its updates:
- Open Settings > Apps > App Manager or Manage Apps > Google Play Store.
- Tap Uninstall updates and reboot your device.
- Connect to a network and install updates again.
- Look for improvements the next time you open the Store.
Solution 4 – Reset Google Play Services
Besides tackling the Google Play Store, you can also reset Google Play Services which are associated with the integration of all Google apps within the Android system. First, you should clear the cache and data. Alternatively, you can reset the app by uninstalling its updates.
Follow these instructions to clear cached data from Google Play Services or reset it by uninstalling updates:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps.
- Then, open App manager, Manage apps, or All apps (it depends on the phone’s OEM).
- Once there, tap on the 3-dot menu and enable all system processes. This will add hidden system apps and services to the App list.
- Now, locate Google Play Services entry and open it.
- Tap Storage.
- Finally, clear cache and data.
You can also try some of the steps we listed in this article dedicated to Google Play Services-related issues.
Solution 5 – Sign out and sign in again with your Google Account
The next step to try if the issue persists is to log out of your Google Account (or remove it) and log in again. It’s a long shot but it won’t cost you anything to give it a try. Don’t forget to reboot your device after removing the Google Account but, prior to that, make sure to create a back up to Google Drive.
With that in mind, here’s how to remove and add Google Account on Android:
- Open Settings.
- Select Accounts.
- Choose Google.
- Remove Google Account and restart your device.
- Get back to Settings > Accounts and sign in with your Google Account.
Finally, if none of the previous solutions helped you out with the problem at hand, we can only suggest resetting your device to factory settings. This especially applies to users who started getting the error when upgrading to Android 10. Don’t forget to back up everything on your device before performing the factory reset.
Follow these instructions to reset your Android device to factory settings:
And, on that note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to tell us about alternative solutions or post questions about the ones we listed. You can share your thoughts in the comments section below.Apple just released iOS 13.6 for all eligible devices. Unlike previous minor updates, this one actually introduces a few new features, along with fixes for some of the known problems reported in the previous iOS versions.
The highlight of the new iOS version is the introduction of Digital Car keys. This feature allows you to use your iPhone to unlock your car. It’s currently only compatible with the newest BMW models, with more options coming soon.
There’s also a revamped version of Apple News+ that introduces Audio Stories, along with some other improvements to the app. You can read the full iOS 13.6 changelog here.
But how does iOS 13.6 perform in terms of stability? The good news is that, unlike iOS 13.5.1, the new iOS release doesn’t cause too many problems for the users. At least for now. Although the new update is still young, and potential complaints are yet to be reported, I’m optimistic iOS 13.5.1 won’t be as troublesome.
Nevertheless, I’m going to tell you about a few problems that I managed to dig up. Now, you should keep in mind that these are individual cases, which means you may never encounter any of these problems on your iPhone.
iOS 13.6 connectivity issues
Connectivity seems to be the biggest and the most widespread problem for users on iOS 13.6 so far. While some users are reporting the problems with WiFi, others are complaining about mobile data issues.
Here’s what one user says on the forums:
“Good day. After installing iOS 13.6 my phone at times go offline ‘No Service’. I have to reboot my phone always.”
There aren’t any known solutions for the connectivity issues on iOS 13.6 right now. And I don’t think anyone will address this problem until more people report it. But let’s just hope you won’t encounter it in the first place.
iOS 13.6 Face ID issues
A few users also said on Twitter that they’re either having problems with Face ID on this update, or that the problem started with the previous update, but Apple still hasn’t addressed it. I personally noticed I couldn’t unlock my iPhone 11 with the face mask on, which is a bit strange since Apple redesigned Face ID to work with face masks two iOS versions ago.
Hey @AppleSupport @apple just downloaded iOS 13.6 and you still haven’t fixed face I.D. problems from the last disaster update ?! Come on ! This is getting ridiculous. #ios13 #apple pic.twitter.com/XpnR0Xk6ER

iOS 13.6 battery drain?
has resolved the annoying battery drain caused by Apple Music that used to be a big deal in the previous versions.
However, one user also reported that he experienced a battery drain upon installing iOS 13.6. Here’s what he says:
“I have an iPhone SE 2nd gen and I’ve been experiencing surprisingly hot temperatures and performance issues. I tested it in Geekbench a few days ago and got a CPU score of 1321 and today I got 789. I don’t know if this is because of the later iOS builds . However when using 13.5.1 I got great performance. And long battery life.
Could this be just my iPhone or are others experiencing this as well?”
At the time of writing this article, the cause of the battery drain issue is still unknown. Maybe if more users report the same problem, we’ll get a response from Apple. On the other hand, if no one else complains about it on iOS 13.6, this could end up being an isolated case that you shouldn’t have to worry about.
That’s about it. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t find too many reported issues. And even those listed above could easily be individual cases. That’s certainly a step in the right direction, especially if we take into account that users had way too many problems with some of the previous releases.
How’s iOS 13.6 working for you? Have you encountered any problems I didn’t list here? Make sure to let us know in the comments below.
I have been having FaceID problems on my iPhone X since the new update, and also the battery drains very fast.
I reset my FaceID a few times and rebooting without improvement. Is there a solution to this problem?
13.6 update has decreased battery life and I am unable to update contacts on my G5 iPAd nor my iPhone 7.
Face ID no longer works for me after updating to iOS 13.6. Tried rebooting, resetting Face ID, and setting up alternative appearance. Nothing helped.
Same here, using Xs Max and the worse thing is they removed my comments from their forum where I asked them to check their firmware and own the issue and release a fix. I myself a software developer and realising now apple just a name now quality is going downhill. visited the apple store too and young lad told me that face id sensor and replacement phone cost me for a price of new. my mistake to leave android never again.
Very disappointed in this update. When I call various contacts, I am getting a message that this call cannot be completed as dialed. The number I am calling worked just fine 2 days ago. I have about 6 contacts who I can no longer call with my cell phone. Went to Verizon store to get assistance, he finally used his iphone to call the number and he got the same message. He thought it was from update also. I hope they get a fix for this. Ridiculous.
only thing I’ve noticed with 13.6 is that the only “recent calls” that show up are Face Time videos, of which I have few.
13.6 is like everything else Apple does as soon as they start pushing to many updates I know I’m going to have a battery drain. After this I’m moving to another OS I have 1 POD 2 IPAD 2 IPHONES that are junk This is the last time I deal with Apple. I saw this coming again.If not for the YouTube Premium plan advantages and the fact that Google is discontinuing Google Play Music, many users would probably avoid YouTube Music like a plague. It’s not that Google’s music streaming service is bad per se, it’s just not good enough in succeeding Google Play Music (great Music Locker and ease-of-use) or competing with Spotify (better recommendations, UI.
Many premium users reported a plethora of issues, most of them being development shortcomings, and they feel like beta-testers for a service that’s soon going to become the only option. There’s a whole Reddit thread (thanks to user u/Bloody Mess and sub’s community) that covers all major issues. You can check it out, here. Hopefully, Google’s department is checking them, as well.
In the meantime, we listed the most prominent problems and, where possible, offered some solutions. Check them out below.
Table of contents:
- Can’t upload music to YouTube Music
- Downloaded tracks won’t play
- The app crashes
- Google Cast not working
- Missing music after GPM transfer
- The volume is different between tracks
- Can’t play uploaded tracks on smart speakers
- Liked videos on YouTube transfer to YouTube Music
1. Can’t upload music to YouTube Music
One of the biggest advantages of soon-to-be discontinued Google Play Music was the Music Locker with an astounding 50.000 tracks limit. Many music aficionados enjoyed purchasing music or digitalizing their music collection and making it accessible on a plethora of devices.
Sadly, Google decided to get rid of the classical app and replace it with YouTube-like music-streaming oriented YouTube Music. Now, Google guaranteed a safe transition, with the Music Transfer option that allows users to move their GPM libraries to YouTube Music.
And that was a painful experience, giving so many users, making old users (many of them early-adopters) started hating the successor from the get-go. Now, YouTube Music allows for the uploading of 100.000 tracks but the streaming quality is capped at AAC at 256kbps (allegedly equivalent to MP3 at 320kbps). With a catch as non-premium users are stuck at AAC at 128kbps.
To make matters even worse after the transition, it seems that uploading is not working all that well for many users. It is possible to only transfer music to your original account. So, people that want to avoid like-transfer from YouTube (big pain), won’t be able to do it. The perks of unsuccessfully separating two platforms.
Google is supposedly taking notes and trying to improve the service significantly before Google Play Music is no more. But it’s not really working at the moment, although they brought more changes in recent months than in 2 prior years.
For the time being, we have a few suggestions to help you upload tracks to YouTube Music. Here’s what you can try:
2. Downloaded tracks won’t play
In comparison to Spotify, YouTube Music is doing quite a mediocre job when it comes to offline playback of downloaded tracks. This applies to the Premium subscription of those respective services.
Yes, there’s the Smart Downloads option that can come in handy, but there’s no consistency as tracks are, seemingly, interchangeable so you’ll get a cover of an original song or a different track altogether.
Strange, considering YouTube Music should have a larger music base than Google Play Music. It might, but it lacks the simplicity and punctuality of the beloved GPM.
Now, it seems that some users can’t play downloaded tracks. This issue is not as common and definitely not an underlying problem as it’s probably individual. Firstly, make sure that Storage permission is granted to YouTube Music.
Alternatively, you can delete all downloaded tracks and try downloading them again. Finally, reinstalling the app might help, as well (if the previous steps failed).
3. The app crashes
The instability of a Google app on the Google-powered OS is completely intolerable. Reports state that YouTube Music is crashing for some, while its perma-loading for others even with a stable internet connection.
If this seems to be the case for you, make sure to update the app or reinstall it. This will delete all downloaded tracks but, don’t worry, the app keeps track of them so they’ll be auto-downloaded the next time you install the app and sign in.
4. Google Cast not working
Being unable to cast uploaded tracks if you are not a paying customer is another distinction from the OG Google’s music service. Sadly, even premium users are unable to use casting to smart speakers, as Google Cast is unstable and not even remotely (no pun intended) close to Spotify Connect.
For starters, you need to assure that your Wi-Fi network is shared by both devices and that your handset has permission to cast. Other than that, we can only suggest rebooting both your handset and the speaker and trying again.
5. Missing music after GPM transfer
Back to transition to YouTube Music from Google Play Music which is to meet its end by the end of 2020. Namely, some users are having a hard time with the long-awaited transfer from Google Play Music to YouTube Music.
Some long-time Google Play Music users run into issues with the grayed-out tracks in various playlists. The licensing issue Google run into due to switching between services is a definite problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.
For the time being, the only workaround for this is to look for and add missing tracks manually. Chances are that you won’t be able to find the exact track version but that’s how it is for the time being. A lot of work ahead for Google.
There are reports concerning the playback volume that constantly changes with every new track. Sometimes it’s too loud and sometimes it’s too quiet and the app lacks Sound normalization which Spotify does well.
At this moment, there’s nothing you can do but cherry-pick the original tracks and albums to overcome this.
This is another big problem, especially if we consider that YouTube Music and Google Home are first-party services. They promised updates that will allow this but we are not holding high hopes as the Google Play Music is soon to be discontinued and YouTube Music still isn’t a valid replacement. Especially when it comes to uploaded user-owned music.
One of the biggest grievances YouTube Music users frequently mention is the fact that YouTube Music is rather an extension of YouTube instead of a standalone app. This brings problems like pushing low-quality covers instead of original tracks or carrying over the like history from YouTube.
For the time being, and only if you are not transferring from Google Play Music, we can suggest creating a new YouTube channel and using it exclusively for music. That way, none of the likes will carry over from one service to another.
With that, we can wrap up this article. In case you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. If you report any additional issues or shortcomings, we’ll make sure to add them to the list.Picture-in-Picture is a multitasking feature on Android. It allows you to keep a video window open and playing while using another app. Although I personally find it annoying sometimes, (especially when listening to music on YouTube, when the video stays on the screen instead of minimizing), I’m sure many users find it to be quite convenient.
That’s why I’m going to say a few words about this feature here, so you can get the most out of it.
How to enable Picture-in-Picture on Android 10
The Picture-in-Picture feature should be enabled by default on your Android device (the only requirement is that you’re running at least Android 8 Oreo, which I assume you do). However, you can still go to settings and make sure it’s enabled for each individual app that supports it.
Here’s how to do that:
- Go to Settings.
- Head over to Apps & notifications > Special app access > Picture-in-picture.
- From the list of apps that support Picture-in-picture, find and tap the app you want to allow to use this feature.
- Toggle the Allow picture-in-picture option on.
There you go, now every time you minimize a select app while playing video, it will pop up on the screen.
The exception to this is YouTube. As you probably know, the free version of this service doesn’t allow you to play videos in the background. So, if you want to use the Picture-in-Picture mode with the YouTube app, you’ll have to subscribe to YouTube Premium.
Picture-in-Picture doesn’t work on Android 10
Enabling and using Picture-in-Picture is pretty straightforward, and there isn’t much more we can say about it. But what if this feature doesn’t work? Here are a few possible workarounds.
Check the app compatibility
Even though Picture-in-Picture has come a long way since it was first introduced in Android 8 Oreo, there are still some apps that don’t support it. You can easily check if an app supports this mode by going to Settings (as explained above). If the app isn’t on the list, it doesn’t support Picture-in-Picture.
However, this shouldn’t be the case for the most common apps for playing video content, like YouTube Premium, Netflix, Chrome, etc. If, for example, YouTube Premium doesn’t enter the PiP mode when minimized, you’ll probably have to adjust some in-app settings.
Check in-app settings
YouTube Premium is a great example of this. If the PiP mode doesn’t work, you’ll have to go to Settings > General, and enable Picture-in-picture. The same can be applied to other apps. Since there’s no way for me to know which exact app are you having problems with, I can only advise you to dive into that app’s settings, and look for the option to enable picture-in-picture.
That’s about it. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions regarding using Picture-in-Picture on Android 10, feel free to let us know in the comments below.

I still can’t use the video chat on instagram and my android is 10Android Oreo has been around for quite some time on Google’s phones. Nexus and Pixel owners already have the privilege of trying the latest Android version. But is it really a privilege?
Namely, as it appears the Oreo update is far more troublesome than anyone initially expected. We already reported that Android Oreo (among other problems) drastically slowed down the Nexus 5X. But according to the latest reports, things are even worse on Google Pixel and Pixel XL devices.
Forums all around the internet are simply flooded with various bug reports and complaints from Pixel users. I gathered some of the most common issues, so here’s what to expect if you haven’t installed the Oreo update on your Pixel device, yet.
Google Pixel and Pixel XL issues with Android Oreo
Random reboots
The first issue I stumbled up is the problem with random reboots. According to one user on the forums, his Pixel just reboots for no apparent reason. Here’s exactly what he said:
“I’ll start by saying my original 6p was replaced because it got stuck in the bootloop like so many others who got the 6p. I had it replaced a few months ago with a refurbished unit through Google and ever since I updated to Oreo, I am getting random reboots again while using the phone.
I’m curious if anyone else is experiencing this. If not, I’ll assume it’s not software related and I have yet another defective 6p which will definitely be disappointing”
Disrupted battery life
Battery drain appears to be the most widespread problem across all devices running Oreo. Here’s what one user said on the forums about the battery drain issue:
“My battery life on Nougat was very solid, on every full charge I get 6-7 hours of SOT. Now, I’m getting less than half of that (about 3 hours). Is it just me or are u guys having the problem?
Yeah, and this is the first time my pixel have continuous lags, it’s annoying”
Unfortunately, there’s still no confirmed solution for this issue. The only thing users with disrupted battery life can do is wait for Google to release a fixing update.
Can’t make phone calls
The problem with making phone calls appears to be another widespread problem in Android Oreo on Pixel devices. Here’s what one user said about it:
“I can’t make or receive phone calls after Oreo update. If I make a call, a prompt voice announce that I can’t complete the call right now to try later. Same prompt when somebody call me, that the y can’t complete the call right now, to try later. Anybody with the same issue/s?”
Apparently, Google’s Phone app doesn’t work properly in Android Oreo. But, a few users reported that resetting the app solved the problem. So, if you’re encountering this problem, simply go and delete the Phone app’s cache and data. If you don’t know how to do that, follow instructions from this article.
Ok Google problems
A couple of users also reported they’re unable to use the Ok Google command and Google Assistant upon installing Android Oreo:
-
“My Ok Google command does not work when screen is locked like it did before Oreo update. Anyone else have this issue?”
-
“My OK Google has been hit and miss since day one. I have retrained voice several dozen times. It always seems to fail when I am showing off the feature to someone.”
We’ve already talked about this issue last week. So, if you’re experiencing problems with Google Assistant upon installing Android O on your Pixel device, check out this article for solutions.
Bluetooth issues
And finally, another serious issue is the problem with Bluetooth pairing. Apparently, many users have issues with pairing their devices with peripherals via Bluetooth. Here’s what one of them said on the Google forums:
“I have been having Bluetooth issues with my Pixel for some time. I have been wishing that the recent update to Oreo would help but it’s made it worse. Bluetooth with my car audio stutters now, which didn’t happen before. Bluetooth with my Bose QC35 still stutters after 5 seconds of playing a song and continue. Any suggested workarounds?”
Unfortunately, there’s no solution for this problem, and users will probably have to wait for a proper patch. I can suggest you trying some solutions from this article, but can’t guarantee any of these will work.
That’s about it. As you can see, Android Oreo is still far from perfect. We hope Google will soon come up with new updates, because some of these issues are rather serious.
Have you encountered any issue upon installing Oreo on your device that we didn’t cover here? Let us know in the comments below, or reach me out on Twitter.
My xz1 campact has benen rebooting ever since i started it the first time. Ive had it for more than 1 month snd havent been able to use it.
The latest update from sony killed the Phone completely for 2 days. I wasnt even able to charge.
Now it works again for some strange reason.
I understand why people buy iphone.
I have been using Oreo since its release and It’s been absolutely fine on my Galaxy S8 except for some battery drain. And it also got solved after turn off the ambient display.

That’s why it designed the iPhone, along with iOS as its heart and soul, to be nearly impeccable. But as appealing as the whole “perfection concept” sounds, it’s a Sisyphean task. As you know, nothing’s perfect, including the iPhone. Users still have to deal with those little annoyances that can casually spoil the whole experience. Of course, one of these bugs will make you jump out of the iPhone wagon, but still…
One of these inconsistencies I personally, and I assume you too, find annoying is when the default keyboard sound unexpectedly becomes louder. This happens all of the sudden and initially seems unprovoked. The louder click is especially frustrating whey you have your earphones on, and the unexpected boom blows your ears off.
When doing the research for this article, I noticed that the problem has been around for years. And apparently, it still bugs users to this day. In fact, this is the first problem, or irritant if you would, I noticed when I switched from Android to iOS.
So, what’s it all about? Why does the keyboard click unpredictably go loud sometimes? Well as it appears, that happens because of the way your iOS works. Namely, when you receive a notification, your phone will turn the volume up by a bar to improve the chances of you hearing the incoming notification. But if you happen to be typing on your keyboard at the same time you receive the notification, the keyboard click will go louder, as well.
So, is there a solution? Apparently not. As I mentioned, this problem’s been around for years, and Apple still hasn’t done anything about it. Maybe we’ll eventually get a fix in the future, but judging on how much time has passed since this was originally reported, I’m not very optimistic.
Switch to haptics
That’s right, there’s no way deal with this, so if you want your keyboard to keep clicking, you’ll just have to live with it. But here’s the thing, you don’t have to. I recommend completely turning off the keyboard sound and switching to haptics instead.
Not only that you won’t develop a fear of incoming notifications, but it will also feel nice to your fingers. At least that’s how I like my keyboard.
In case you don’t know how to switch your iPhone keyboard to haptics, just follow these instructions:
- Go to Settings.
- Tap Sounds & Haptics.
- Scroll down and toggle the Keyboard Clicks option off.
- Make sure System Haptics is enabled.
That’s about it, the keyboard clicks are now off. From now on, the only thing you’ll feel is a gentle vibration.
That concludes this article. I know this is no good news for users who prefer keyboard clicks, but unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do about it.
How do you prefer to use your keyboard? Is it with clicks? Or haptics? Or completely silent? Let us know in the comments below.Opening external web links with an app has a lot of benefits. On Android 10, users will be prompted to choose the default app for certain links. So, it’s obvious to open YouTube links on the YouTube app for so many users. However, some of them reported that YouTube links are not working on Android 10. Learn how to resolve this problem below.
Table of contents:
- Clear cache and data
- Check in-app settings
- Reinstall YouTube
- Reset app preferences
- Update your firmware or perform a factory reset
YouTube app not opening links on Android 10
Solution 1 – Clear cache and data
Let’s start by clearing the cache and data from the YouTube app. There’s a chance that the locally-stored data is corrupted, causing the problem with links. This will also clean the default association with YouTube links so, the next time you try to open the YouTube link, the system will prompt you to select the default app.
Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from the YouTube app:
- Open Settings > Apps > All apps.
- Open YouTube. It should be at the bottom of the app list.
- Select Storage.
- Clear cache and then data.
Solution 2 – Check in-app settings
Another thing worth checking is related to opening web links within the app. Namely, many apps will use the WebView to open links within the app instead of switching to an actual default browser or YouTube.
So, make sure to open the app, choose Settings, and ensure that links are opened externally. That way, when you tap on a YouTube web link, it should open in the YouTube app.
Some apps that use WebView integration are official Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. Open Settings in those respective apps and ensure that links are not opened internally but rather in the associated apps you have installed on your device.
Solution 3 – Reinstall YouTube
The next step we can recommend is to reinstall the app. If the issues with YouTube links continue, reinstallation should help you address them. Coming from Android 9 to Android 10, issues like this might occur.
- Open Settings > Apps > All apps.
- Open YouTube. It should be at the bottom of the app list.
- Uninstall the app or, if YouTube is a system app, uninstall its updates.
- Reboot your device and install YouTube from the Play Store.
Solution 4 – Reset app preferences
You can also try and reset app preferences in system settings. This is a long-shot solution but chances are that opening of YouTube links is granted to another 3rd-party app which might be the cause of the problem.
Here’s how to reset app preferences on Android:
- Open Settings > Apps.
- Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Reset app preferences.
- After that, reboot your device and try opening YouTube links again.
Solution 5 – Update your firmware or perform a factory reset
Finally, if YouTube links are still not working on Android 10, make sure to update the firmware and keep the app up-to-date as well. If that doesn’t help and you are still experiencing issues, consider resetting your device to factory settings.
With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share questions or alternative solutions in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you.For a lot of Android users around the globe lies the dilemma: older flagship or brand new mid-budget. If you ask us, we are cheering on the side of the older flagship devices.
For example, Samsung Galaxy S6. Amazing device, great design, sleek but occasionally erratic TouchWiz, stunning camera. What more you would expect from an Android smartphone? Well, lack of the timely and functioning software updates may come in question, but only because that’s a general problem with Samsung and not an individual handset issue.
So, recently, users of S6 received the Nougat via OTA update. And then the hell broke loose. Many of them reported a lot of issues and today we provided a list of most common issues and possible workarounds for each individual reported the problem. If you have a hard time with your S6 after an update, make sure to check the list below.
Call issues
We had to start with the essential feature that some users reported as broken. Well, imagine that you own an amazing feature-rich device but, there’s a little negligible problem: you can’t answer your calls. That happened to some users. The phone is ringing but nothing is shown on the screen. This is how one user explained the problem:
”Since the Android update yesterday I go through periods where I cannot answer incoming calls. The phone rings but there is no indicator that there is an incoming call and icons or anything to even answer the incoming call. How do I correct this? I can restart my phone and I can answer incoming calls for a brief period then it start all over again where I can’t answer them. I have changed nothing on my phone. The only thing that has happened was the Android upgrade”
There’s an alternative, but the only permanent solution is a factory reset. At least, if you want to answer to your calls like you used to before the Nougat update. For an alternative solution, you can navigate to Settings > Accessibility > Answering and end calls > and enable “Answer calls by pressing the home key”.
However, you can perform a factory reset and have a good chance of resolving this issue. This is how to do it:
- Backup your data and make sure that the phone’s battery is at least on 30%.
- Tap Settings.
- Open Backup & restore.
- Tap Reset device.
- Tap Erase everything.
- Confirm selection.
Your device will restart and you should be able to answer calls just like before an update.
Wi-Fi issues
Even the fundamental connectivity was struck down for some users. Namely, some of them reported that they were unable to connect to both home or public networks after the update. One user offered a concise description of the problem at hand:
”Got the new Android upday today (I have an S6) and tonight I couldn’t connect to a public Wi-Fi network. How do i fix this? I had no issues connecting before the update.”
These are some steps you should take in order to address the Wi-Fi issues:
- Forget/reestablish network.
- Update router firmware.
- Reset Network Settings.
- Restart the router.
- Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz.
- Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data.
- Reset phone to factory settings.
Camera issues
It seems that some of the native camera features are gone with the latest update. Allegedly, after the update, some users lost filters that were available on the previous Android version. This is how one user described his/her concerns regarding the subject:
”I’ve only had my phone running for a day with the latest update, but the grayscale camera filter seems to be MIA and the low light resolution is sub par now. I always found the grayscale filter to give better photos in low light, so even though I can edit a color photo to make it grey…it’s not at all the same. I don’t see grayscale as an option for a filter to download, but has anyone else run into this and found a solution?”
As you would imagine, there isn’t a practical workaround for this. However, you can use an alternative app before the next system update to utilize your camera’s full potential with all the needed features.
Buttons/keys issues
Another key feature (no pun intended) is broken for some users. Namely, the Power and Home keys are unresponsive for some users periodically after the update rollout. This is how one S6 owner explained his problem and the way her/he resolved it:
”After the Nougat update my power button intermittently stopped working, i.e. unable to turn screen on or if it is on, turn it off. Holding it down does nothing. After charging it for a bit, the problem seemed to go away. It was over 60% charged when I noticed the problem. Similarly, the home button either did nothing or opened Google assistant (did not hold the button, simply tapped it). I powered off and on. I cleared the cache. Yet the problem still persisted. For NOW, it seems to have returned to working normally. Only thing I did was let it charge for about 30 minutes during a car ride. There is something unstable in the code.’‘
As you can see, this issue is somehow resolved by charging. On the other hand, if this strange occurrence is still there after a while, you should perform the factory reset.
Battery issues
Battery drains aren’t exactly a novelty for Samsung updates. After the S7 and S7 Edge battery issues, the battery life is substantially decreased on S6, as well. One user shared a thorough explanation behind this issue:
”I’ve had my Samsung Galaxy S6 for around 16 months now. It seems like over the past 3-4 months the battery life has gotten worse, I’ve experienced a weird problem a few times too. Today, I was surprised look at my phone and see that the battery life was much lower than it should have been, since I had not been using my phone, it had just been in my pocket. Looking at the battery life chart in settings confirmed that there was a sudden drop in battery life a couple hours ago.”
As you can see for yourself, sudden drops of battery percentage are not uncommon after the update. However, you can perform a few tweaks to improve your battery life and those can be found in this article.
Wireless charging issues
Wireless charging is also impacted by the update. Some users reported that they’re unable to charge their devices with wireless chargers as soon as the system updated. One user summarized the problem this way:
”Is anyone else having a problem with wireless charging after Nougat update? I keep my wireless charger on my desk at work. I did my update and then left. Came in the next day and the wireless isnt charging. Its not the charger because someone with an S7 and S8 have both tested it and they can charge on it. Any one else having this problem ?”
If you’re certain that the wireless charger is functional, you can wipe the cache partition and, if that’s not of any use, restore the factory settings.
Reboot/boot loop issues
Now, this is a dealbreaker for most of the users. Once they’ve installed the Nougat update, their respective devices get stuck on the welcome screen or the random resets started. One user presented the problem he has to cope with after the update:
”Hi, I tried to update my firmware with the new Nougat upgrade last night. When I retrieved my phone this morning, it was frozen on the Verizon screen. I tried all of the tricks: rebooting the system, rebooting to bootloader, wiping the cache partition, and even doing a hard factory reset. Nothing has worked – not even the factory reset! It still freezes on the Verizon screen. Any advice for a self fix before I take it to a repair shop? Thanks!”
It seems that there’s no solution at the moment, at least not the one that can be performed by users themselves. So, if you’ve experienced similar issues, make sure to take your device to a service center.
Voicemail issues
This issue is not as much connected to a voicemail as it is an interface bug that causes the message playback to stop after the phone is close to your ear. It seems that the sensor bug affects the voicemail playback. Here is the description of the problem provided by one user:
”I have visual voicemail and anytime I hit play and then put the phone to my ear to listen to the message the message pauses. The only way for me to listen to the voicemail is to put it on speaker phone. Anybody know a fix to this?”
Until now, the 3 workarounds proven as the best-suited for the job.
- Navigate to Settings > Apps > Voicemail app > Force stop, and restart your device.
- Disable all lock screen security measures (pattern, PIN, password).
- Perform a factory reset.
But, for most of the users, the problem is still there. So, we should expect some fixes in the upcoming app and system versions.
Summary
At the end, it’s important to say that some of these may be the isolated cases and the Nougat update work’s as intended on your Samsung handset. However, there’s also a possibility that we missed some of the issues, so you’re welcome to share them in the comments section.
Either way, we certainly hope that the Samsung and the carriers will work their way out of this in the next update that’s at the moment in the beta stage.
Hi. I had all but given up trying to find s solution to the problems i have had since the 7.0 upgrade. Im in Australia, so not sure where you guy’s are or if the upgrades were rolled out the same way. Ill try keep this brief as possible. I have, or did have, a galaxy s6 and loved it. Turned it on on one morning to find it in the process of an update, later to find out that it was a forced upgrade to the 7.0. Immediately all the problems started. it was stuck in a constant boot… Read more »
Why does my whatapp account appear ofline when the screen closes and the app is stil open
The advice like “factory reset is best shot” is piece of s#!t, not an advice.Apple announced the new software for the iPhones, iOS 14 during its annual WWDC conference on Monday. The updated iOS version will bring a plethora of new features, including redesigned widgets, improved Siri, an app drawer (lookalike), and more. The list of features promises that iOS 14 will be the most exciting iOS release in years.
One of the highlight features is definitely the long-awaited Picture-in-Picture mode. While iPad users got this feature years ago (and Android users even before them) the iPhone owners will have to wait until this fall to be able to minimize videos into a small window that runs over other apps.
As seen in the presentation, the Picture-in-Picture mode on iOS 14 functions as you would expect it. While in an app with video playback, just swipe up from the bottom of the phone to go to the home screen and a small window playing video will stay on. You can then move it around the screen, resize it, or close it. You can even pin it to a side of the screen if it gets in the way, and pull it back later to continue watching, which is definitely a nice touch.
Obviously, Apple used its AppleTV app to showcase the new Picture-in-Picture mode. And while it all seems to be working flawlessly with this first-party app, the question most people have still remained. Will the upcoming Picture-in-Picture mode work with YouTube’s iOS app?
Will iOS 14’s Picture-in-Picture mode work with YouTube?
To get straight to the point, I’m pessimistic YouTube for iOS will support the Picture-in-Picture mode. There are a few exhibits to back up this prediction.
First thing first, the YouTube app currently doesn’t support the Picture-in-Picture mode on iPadOS. Even with the Premium account, you’ll only get as far as playing audio in the background.
That’s solely Google’s choice. Since developers need to implement the Picture-in-Picture API provided by Apple, Google simply opted not to.
You have to understand that, as two of the most powerful companies in the world, Google and Apple are huge competitors. And while declaring war on one another will bring more harm than good in terms of profit, both sides are taking every chance they’ve got to trade blows. And usually, it’s the small details that tend to annoy users of the opposite platform. In this case, it’s the absence of the Picture-in-Picture support in the YouTube app for iOS.
You’ll probably still be able to use the Safari/Chrome “hack”to get YouTube to go into the Picture-in-Picture mode, but this method is quite inconvenient, and I doubt many people will do it regularly.
I’d certainly like to be wrong on this one.Apple recently released iOS 14.0.1, the first public update delivered after iOS 14. The new update arrived just eight days after the original major update. According to the release notes, the new update should fix some issues reported in the initial iOS 14 version and improve the overall security of the system.
Such a fast update is not a surprise and surely makes sense for Apple, as the company kind of rushed with releasing iOS 14. Not only that the new update caused all sorts of issues for users, but it also arrived just one day after its announcement, leaving developers with little to no time to prepare their apps, which have lead to even more problems.
Here’s the complete changelog of the iOS 14.0.1 update:
This update includes bug fixes for your iPhone.
– Fixes an issue that could cause default browser and mail settings to reset after restarting your iPhone
– Addresses an issue that could prevent camera previews from displaying on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus
– Fixes an issue that could prevent your iPhone from connecting to Wi-Fi networks
– Resolves an issue that could prevent sending email with some mail providers
– Addresses an issue that could prevent images from appearing in the News widget
– For information on the security content of Apple software updates, please visit this website: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201222
Even though the new update, on paper, deals with a lot of original issues, Apple Community forums are still flooded with complaints saying that many have persisted. There are even reports of new problems caused by the latest release.
I compiled a list of the most common problems caused by iOS 14.0.1. This should give you a better idea of what to expect from the update if you haven’t installed it yet.
iOS 14.0.1 won’t download
One of the main complaints about this update is that people are unable to download it. According to reports, the update either stops in the middle of downloading or doesn’t appear in the Settings app whatsoever.
I can’t think of any specific solution, except the generic ones. Make sure you have enough storage space for the update and make sure your phone has enough battery left.
Of course, you’ll only be able to install iOS 14.0.1 if you’re coming from iOS 14. So, if you’re running an older version of iOS on your iPhone, make sure to install iOS 14 first.
Problems with SMS and messages on iOS 14.0.1
The refreshed and improved messaging app surely didn’t make a stellar debut for a handful of unlucky users. Namely, people have been reporting various issues with the Messages app on iOS 14.0.1. From disappearing messages to notifications that won’t go away.
Hotspot not working on iOS 14.0.1
Sharing your internet connection with another person can be a lifesaver. For them more than for you, but you still get the satisfaction of doing a good deed. Unfortunately, that’s impossible on some iPhones running iOS 14.0.1.
If you were unlucky enough, your iPhone’s hotspot feature might not be identifiable or it could be missing completely. Here’s what one user said on Apple Forums about this problem:
“Hi there, Can you use hotspot in iOS 14.0.1? other devices don’t identify my hotspot! If you know anything, it would be appreciated to let me know about it. And I have an iPhone 7 by the way.”
Similar hotspot issues were reported in previous iOS 14 betas, so we could say the problem just transferred to the stable version for some users. Although there’s no universal solution that deals with the issue, a few testers reported they managed to overcome it by changing the hotspot APN, so you could try the same thing.
Here’s how to rename your hotspot on iOS 14.0.1:
- Go to Settings.
- Head over to Cellular > Cellular Data Network.
- Set the same APN for Hotspot as it is for Cellular data.
Widgets don’t work on iOS 14.0.1
The minute Apple announced widgets on Home Screen, everyone knew that’s going to be a big thing. As it turns out, widgets on Home Screen are even bigger than anyone expected. The new customization option sparked a whole new culture of alternating Home Screens. Users are crazy about the new widgets to the point where it’s a legit competition of who’s going to be more creative in combining widgets with Shortcuts to get the most unique Home Screen experience.
Unfortunately, not every user can participate in this “competition”, as people have reported that widgets don’t work for them on iOS 14.0.1. Now, these reports aren’t very clear, so I can’t tell whether it’s third-party or stock widgets people complain about. But I have a feeling it’s mixed.
Anyway, if you’re having problems with a third-party widget, you should probably give some more time to developers to polish it. As a reminder, Apple kind of rushed with releasing iOS 14 last week, leaving many developers with unfinished products.
On the other hand, if a first-party widget won’t show, or you can’t resize it, or it bugs you in any other way, you’ll probably have to wait for Apple to release a fixing update.
iOS 14.0.1 drains the battery
Battery life problems mostly date back to the original iOS 14 release, and it seems that the problem just hasn’t been solved yet. In fact, forums and social media sites are flooded with reports of “worse battery life”.
Right now, there isn’t too much you can do to prevent the battery drain. You can try some general measures that should help you preserve the battery life (low power mode, adaptive brightness, etc.) until the patch arrives. On the other hand, a big number of complaints could prove to be positive, as it should force Apple to deliver a fix sooner.
This isn’t the whole list of issues reported on iOS 14.0.1. However, I feel most of the problems I didn’t mention here occurred in the initial version, so I decided to leave them out. Since the new iOS version appears to be troublesome, we’ll dedicate a few articles to individual problems (and try to solve them, if possible).
What’s your experience with iOS 14.0.1 and iOS 14 in general so far? Feel free to let us know about your problems in the comments down below.
I’ve just experienced a complete system freezing and not responding to anything. I barely turned it off.
Drop down notifications for Facebook, emal and Twitter don’t appear anymore. All are turned on
Also the Find My doesn’t work anymore. I can’t see my families location. It’s just keeps buffering. New update date is horrible.
Since the update I can only use WiFi. If I’m out and using mobile data all I get is buffering. Nothing loads or refreshes. Which made for an awkward moment when my bank app wouldn’t load and I had to go in to a bank and pay to have money transferred. So I could make a purchase. Olden days style. I’ve tried every troubleshooting, reset, restart options I can find short of a full factory reset. Everything that it supposed to be on, is. I have plenty of data available. I can send texts and make phone calls without WiFi,… Read more »
my keyboard is horrible keys wont press and the screen is all over the place, does anyone have the same issue??
At this moment I have to fully recharge my iPhoneX 2/3 times a day! In this pandemic situation 99% of my communications are made throughout Teams at PC, having my iPhone connected to Carrier and Wifi at home. I am not almost using it through the day and even so the battery goes away in hours!!! Terrible
I have had nothing but problems since updating to 14.0.1 …. I’ve had email problems and mechanical problems and SLOWNESS FOR EVERYTHING! When online my auto install usernames and the few passwords I had chrome/safari remember are gone (yet still listed under passwords in settings). When I take a screenshot it takes 30-60 seconds for a photo to actually record if it even takes and saves a photo at all! Battery drainage, like you mentioned. If I’m in my email and leave the mail app to do something else then return to my email it’s wiped clean and won’t return… Read more »
After installing iOS 14 on iPhone 7 battery drain so fast, in 2 hours it go from 100% to 27%. And it continue every day.
I cannot get my emails AFTER the
14.0.1 update. It worked fine after the iOS 14 update but 14.0.1 has stopped emails from updating and I’ve checked and set all settings, rebooted, deleted email app and reinstalled and still NO emails!!!
iPhone X . I NEED HELP NOW!!!! Also the text suggestions are slow loading and the earpiece volume is low. I’ve cleaned the earpiece screen and all volumes are turned to highest levels. I have to use speaker to have a phone conversation which is not always good.iCloud is an essential part of iOS and a must-have backup and sync service for iPhone and iPad users. Just like the rest of iOS features, iCloud is well-designed, simplistic, user-friendly, and it does its job flawlessly. At least, most of the time.
Namely, some users reported a stall within iCloud Photo Library. They were unable to update recent photos or videos for no apparent reason. In order to help you, we enlisted a few trusted workarounds. If you have had alike or similar issues, make sure to check them out below.
Restart your device
In this and similar scenarios, it’s quite obvious to go for the restart. Even though iOS and iOS-powered devices are celebrated for overall stability in regard to pre-installed features, occasionally something goes wrong. So, the first step to take is to follow the instructions below and restart your device. After that, maybe the uploading deadlock ends.
- Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button.
- After it appears, use the slider to turn your device Off.
- After the device turns off, use the Sleep/Wake button to turn it ON again.
Disable Low Power Mode
Perhaps the most common cause of this issue is having the Low Power Mode. As you can tell, this feature disables some more power-consuming features in order to save the battery when the percentage is low. When this feature is on, Photos won’t upload to iCloud.
Since the phone automatically disables this feature once the battery is fully charged, basically all you need to do is charge your iPhone. But you can also manually disable it, and the photo sync will continue. To disable Low Power Mode, go to Settings > Battery, and disable Low Power Mode.
You can also put Low Power Mode in the Control Center for even easier access. To do so, head over to Settings > Control Centre > Customise Controls, and choose Low Power Mode.
Make sure you’re properly connected to the internet
Obviously, if you’re not properly connected to the internet, Photos will briefly stop uploading to iCloud. So, before proceeding to other solutions, make sure to check your internet connection.
We’re talking about WiFi, of course, because Photos will only upload to iCloud when you’re connected to a WiFi network. On the other hand, if you want to upload photos using mobile data, you can enable this option too. However, it’s not recommended, since uploading photos will eat up huge amounts of data.
Disable and re-enable iCloud Photo Library
If just a simple restart isn’t sufficient to address the issue at hand, you can always apply the same medicine to update-related features. Namely, you should navigate to iCloud and disable the iCloud Photo Library which is a cloud storage part dedicated to photos. After that, you can re-enable it and look for changes.
If you’re uncertain how to do it, follow the instructions below:
- Open the Settings app.
- Tap your account name/Apple ID.
- Open iCloud.
- Tap Photos.
- Toggle Off iCloud Photo Library.
- Restart your device.
- Follow the same path and re-enable iCloud Photo Library.
If even that fell short and your photos just won’t upload to iCloud Photo Library, there are additional steps you should take into consideration.
Delete all backed up photos
This procedure is screaming ”time-consuming annoyance!” but it is as it is. You’re stuck with your iCloud misbehaving like an obnoxious child and previous steps are, obviously, underwhelming. However, don’t worry, your Camera Roll photos are not endangered. We only need to clear photos and videos stored on iCloud. If you ask yourself ”why?”, the answer is simple: due to corrupted photo or video, all others suffer. One rotten apple (pun not intended) and everything suddenly goes south.
- Make sure that all photos you need are either on phone storage or safely backed up on PC or Mac.
- Open the Settings app.
- Tap your account name/Apple ID.
- Open iCloud.
- Tap Photos.
- Toggle Off iCloud Photo Library.
- Restart your device.
- Use your computer to access iCloud and delete all photos and videos.
- Re-enable iCloud Photo Library.
All photos from your device storage should start uploading and everything should be resolved.
Reset the device to factory settings
Finally, if you’re still stuck in the iCloud’s purgatory, you still have one last resort. Yes, it’s the factory reset. If the problem somehow surpassed reinitialization, the hard reset should be the right tool for the job.
Follow the instructions below to perform a factory reset:
- Go to Settings.
- Choose General.
- Tap Reset.
- Select Erase All Content and Settings.
- This will erase all of your data, so be sure to back it up before performing the reset.
- Confirm the selection and start the process.
- Later on, you should choose Restore from the iCloud Backup feature, and retrieve your data.
In addition, it might be more convenient to run with iTunes:
- Download and install the latest version of iTunes app on your PC.
- Connect your device to a PC.
- Start iTunes and choose Summary.
- Remember to backup your iPhone data.
- Select Restore iPhone.
- Move on to the restoring process.
That should be it. Don’t forget to share your questions or alternative solutions with us and other readers in the comments section below. We’ll appreciate it. Thanks for reading.
Thank you so much this website is so good and help me from the problem
Thank you for this article! It was very helpful!!!
If this type if problem arises with the iCloud then there is one option to off the Toggle for the iCloud Photo Library from the phone settings and restart your device.The due date is closer day by day. Google announced the 8th Android version for the 3rd quarter of 2017. It brings so many changes and improvements to a world’s most popular platform. While we eagerly expect Android O (that mysterious O’s meaning is still unclear, though) users that pack Google-powered handsets can obtain Developer Preview. Most certainly the final preview version goes by the number 4. If everything goes as intended, August or early September are reserved for the full version.
We already wrote about the first preview a while ago and advised you not to install it on your every day, primary device. It was unstable and could cause crashes and the malfunction of certain system features. However, that’s not the case with the Developers Preview 4. If it’s to believe to reports, it works great and it’s a viable option. Still, we would rather wait for the final version.
Even though Devs Preview 4 is a much better-optimized showcase of Android O, it’s far from flawless. For that purpose, we prepared a list of reported issues and bugs, so you can know what to expect from the final Preview. If you’re keen to give it a try, make sure to first check the list below.
Known issues of Android O Developer Preview 4
Battery drainage
Battery drainage was the problem from the start. It declined in the second release and erupted in the third Developer Preview. Many users reported much better battery longevity on Developer Preview 4 but it’s still not perfect. These are what users on Reddit’s dedicated thread said about that:
”Anyone else still experiencing battery drain issues? I’m still seeing it, just not as bad as DP3.”
”Agreed. Android O is suppose to be optimized and efficient for battery life, yet it has this problem”
”Some apps still drain battery insanely quickly. I just opened snapchat and it went from 43% to 37% in about a minute. The camera does this as well so is it something anyone else is experiencing with the camera?”
”Battery drains faster than when my device was on DP2 and DP3. 100% got drained in 3hrs or less. Didn’t have this issue in previous previews. Stats show 53% due to Google play services. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling play services. Didn’t help. Pixel XL”
As you can see, this still needs to be fixed by Google before the final release. The fact that the battery draining percentage is reduced, it still isn’t optimized and efficient enough when it comes to expected battery life.
Notification issue
Notifications are also the problem for some users. Some of them are experiencing a constant repetition of the same notification in the background while others are unable to see notifications whatsoever. These are some comments they posted on the dedicated Reddit’s thread:
”Notification dots doesn’t work on my N5X.”
”Anyone else getting a persistent Gmail running in background notification. Started this morning for me.”
”Still getting those notifications which can’t be disabled.”
As you can concur on your own, there is still a need for a final touch. It seems that in the final version, users will be able to disable those but the option is still unavailable.
Android Pay NFC issue
With the introduction of Android O, users will be able to utilize a nifty Android Pay over NFC protocol. However, it seems that for some users this still isn’t functioning in a flawless manner. One user reported that Android Pay failed him after he upgraded to Developer Preview 4 but it fixed on its own later. This is what he said about it on Reddit:
”NFC pay is broken on mine.
EDIT: it returned to normal, odd.”
Have in mind that this is an isolated case and that the Android Pay is mostly performing well. At least, for this phase of the OS development.
Missing options
Until then, these are some bug reports multiple users posted on Reddit’s Bug Reporting thread:
”Option “Turn on Wi-Fi automatically” is still not back. I can find it if I search for it in the settings, but if I tap on it in the search results it redirects me to the correct page but it’s not there.”
”This is weird. I had the change theme option show up under display > advanced options and I had the option to change it to one of my OMS themes (I couldn’t get substratum working yet but I had installed). I changed it and my settings menu changed to that theme. However, the notification pulldown turned white on white. Went to change it back and the option is gone. Welp.”
This isn’t unusual for the beta version, so it shouldn’t be a deal breaker. Moreover, these are, as we already stated, isolated cases and for the majority of users, every presented option is available to use.
Crashes
In this phase of the system development, we can’t expect a perfect behavior. Hell, even the general system updates are not always stable and can be clunky or prone to crashes. In this version, the majority of crashes come from unoptimized 3rd-party apps. But, occasionally, even the pre-installed software can be the culprit. These are some reports developers posted on Reddit’s Bug Tracking thread:
”360° videos in Facebook app makes the app crash.”
”HBO Go VR for Daydream doesn’t work properly. I can’t sign in. The app crashes at the sign in phase.”
”Contributing photos in google maps make the app crash.”
Luckily, once the final version is introduced to a general population, apps developers should be able to optimize and re-design their respective apps. That should reduce crashes and provide us with much more satisfying overall experience.
Google Play Store issue
One it comes to Android essentials, like Google Play Store, we shouldn’t expect issues. But, one user reported a problem that emerged after he switched to Developers Preview 4, and it concerns Play Store. This is how he elaborated his problem on Reddit:
”Google Play Store shows as Uncertified again”
As you can see, it seems that the OS can’t recognize Play Store as an official feature. Reboot resolved the problem, but we hope that the final version won’t have misconceptions like this.
Pink Text on YouTube app
This is already a common bug that was present on the previous iterations of the Android O Beta. Namely, it looks like the color of the text in the YouTube Search bar is garishly pink and it’s an unpleasant change from the standard black-colored fonts that are normally used. Now, this is what certain users said on Reddit:
”Anyone getting pink text for search history in YouTube? I don’t like it!”
”Yes, still pink for me in DP4.”
Luckily, this seems to be a bug that should be removed from the final product. Or at least, users should be able to customize their preferred font color.
Camera issue
One camera issue that was confusing users on Nougat is, allegedly, still present. Namely, users on Reddit reported that, once they access the previously recorded video or photo through the camera app, they see older entries instead of the last one. This is what they stated:
”Nexus 6P user here. There’s a bug in the camera app where if I go to view a video I just took, it shows the previous photo/video instead. Is this a common issue across devices?
Edit: I updated to DP4 a few hours ago”
”Just updated my 6P to DP4 a few hours ago. I’m getting a bug in the camera app where if I go to view a video, it shows the previous photo/video instead.”
Seemingly, this bug should be addressed before the final release.
Video playback issue
Videos streaming issues from the 3rd-party apps also found their spot on our round-up list. This is what a few users experienced after the update to Developer Preview 4. They posted their comments on the Reddit thread:
”On the Facebook app, maybe other apps, videos look pixelated because video resizing is not filtered. This was not happening in DP3. not a showstopper but quite noticeable.”
”Instagram videos not playing on Pixel XL.”
Multiple Redditors, including the original posters, concluded that the problem is related to 3rd-party apps that are still unoptimized. We can hope that the problems will resolve after the final version is introduced.
Volume issue
Even the sound is affected. Some users reported too low volume while talking on the phone. Others had trouble with customizing the media volume since some features were missing. Without further ado, we brought to you what they said on Reddit’s dedicated Bug thread:
”When I make a call the volume sounds really low even though I have it at its highest setting. Anyone else experiencing this??
So I reset my pixel XL thinking it might go away, pixel wouldn’t read my verizon sim. Couldn’t get any voice or data to work. Had to opt out of the DP and go back to nougat. Everything is fine now.”
”If I’m watching YouTube and I want to adjust the volume, it changes the call volume. I have to hit the down arrow and then adjust the media volume.”
”Using the volume buttons changes my “Call” noise level and not “Media.” I have to collapse the sound menu to adjust the volume. Also it is extremely low.”
Obviously, we’re looking at bug of some kind that, in our opinion, isn’t a major drawback. They’ll certainly resolve it before the official presentation of Android O.
Car Bluetooth issue
Many Android enthusiasts that were keen to give a try to the Developers Preview 4, have had issues with Bluetooth. Especially while using it for wireless connection with the car’s media board. These are their posts brought to you in wholly from Reddit:
”Fast forward over Bluetooth does not work anymore with car controls (mazda 3).”
”Since the last DP I’m not displaying audio info on my 2013 Mazda 3. But controls work fine.”
”Bluetooth is still very inconsistent in the car. Google Play Music starts a song and plays about three seconds and then starts the song over. Haven’t gotten it to play a full song yet. Pocketcasts will play for about four seconds and then pause, and then pickup playback for 3-4 seconds and then pause again. I can get it to smooth out and play normally if I toggle the play/pause buttons on both the phone and car until it syncs up. This is with a 6P and Dodge Charger with uConnect.
Yeah, I tried again on my lunch break to see if it would sync up better. It was actually worse this time. Also couldn’t get any calls to connect through bluetooth. So this one’s going back in the drawer until the final release!”
Picture in Picture issue
With Android O, Google is introducing ”Picture-in-Picture” mode that is, arguably, one of the best (or even the best) multitasking features ever presented in Android. It functions well in Preview 4, but it’s still unpolished and for the final version, we expect it to work great. Some users have had issues with the Picture-in-Picture mode, and this is what they said on Reddit:
”If I have a YouTube picture in picture video playing, turn the screen off, then turn it back on, it does a soft reboot.”
”Nexus 6p : I can’t get pic in pic to work, i have youtube open and playing video when i click on the home it closes the app”
That should be that. If you have additional issues or complaints, or possible solutions for some of the reported problems, make sure to give us a shout in the comments section below. All of us are eagerly waiting for the Android O and all included advancements that should improve the overall experience.

Also, it definitely comes in handy if you are buying a used (or refurbished) smartphone (shipped from abroad) to check for its seller’s legitimacy.
Besides that, and with a lot of similar (basically same and barely distinguishable) devices coming from China, you’ll probably want the Global version of the device unless you are in China (e.g. Mi 9T Pro instead of Redmi K20 Pro). The originality and legitimacy of these devices can be checked with IMEI, as well.
Learn how to get IMEI on Android 10 with two methods we provided below.
Table of contents:
How do I get my device IMEI on Android 10
Method 1: Use dialer shortcut
The first method is to use the dialer code which, when dialed, will show your IMEI number on Android 10. The code is usually universal, but there might be a few differences for some OEMs. If that’s the case for your device, go to the second method or Google IMEI for your particular OEM/device.
Just open the stock Dialer app (third-party dialer apps won’t work) and type *#06# and dial it. In case you have a dual-SIM device, you’ll see two numbers for each SIM card.
Method 2: Check IMEI in Settings
For the second method, you can navigate to Settings > About phone (or My phone > All specs > Status). Once there, just scroll to the bottom to get IMEI on Android 10.
But what to do with IMEI once you have it? Write it down just in case. This can be used by the police to track your device. Also, you can navigate to IMEI Info, here, or similar websites, put 15 IMEI numbers in, and confirm that you got what you paid for.
With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we hope this article helped you learn something new. Don’t forget to share your thoughts in the comments section below.

Thanks mr obviousEver since Xiaomi’s first handsets, their custom Android skin, MIUI, has been a hit or miss. In late October of 2019, Xiaomi started pushing MIUI 11, intended to initially stick to Android 9 Pie while Android 10 iterations were expected in the first quarter of 2020.
Some people completely avoid Xiaomi/Redmi devices because of MIUI, others learn to live with it after some tweaking (learning how to debloat MIUI can improve the experience significantly).
And the same hit-or-miss approach can be seen with the latest iteration of MIUI. Xiaomi pilled up features to MIUI 11 which, as a result, brought a lot of issues to their users around the world.
We decided to list common MIUI 11 issues here, the ones we can find online, and share them with you, our readers. Also, we made sure to offer some applicable solutions, too. You can read in-detail about various reported issues below.
Table of contents:
- Battery drains faster than on MIUI 10
- Battery calibration issues
- Picture-in-Picture mode (PiP) issues
- Lags and stutters
- Apps crashing or freezing
- Wi-Fi, Mobile Data, and Hotspot issues
- AOD and pulsating notifications issues
- Dark mode bugs
- Camera issues
- Game Turbo Mode crashes apps
- GPS issues
- Can’t install Netflix from the Play Store and Widevine is L3
- Google Assistant won’t start on Mi 9
- The fingerprint reader is inconsistent
- Google Pay not working
- Important troubleshooting steps for MIUI 11
1. Battery drains faster than on MIUI 10
This is probably the most commonly-reported bug on MIUI 11, no matter what iteration or Android version (Android 9 or Android 10). We read through a bunch of reports about battery drainage from users who updated from MIUI 10 to still-mint MIUI 11.
Now, before we move to some steps that should help you reduce battery drainage, especially when the device is idle (overnight), we must suggest something.
Namely, for this and similar MIUI 11 issues, it’s advised to reset your device to factory settings after you install a major update. Especially if Android versions are different.
Follow these steps to reduce battery draining on MIUI 11:
- Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight.
- Disable Face Unlock.
- Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps.
- Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery.
2. Battery calibration issues
Well, it seems that the battery percentage is changing erratically. Instead of gradually depleting, users state that battery suddenly drops (e.g. from 70% to 50% in a matter of minutes). This points towards false readings, as the battery is seemingly not calibrated.
Battery calibration is not something hard to do, although it is a process. You can learn how to calibrate your battery with ease by following steps in this article, here.
3. Picture-in-Picture mode (PiP) issues
There seems to be an issue with PiP mode as well. Based on reports, users who switch to Picture-in-Picture mode (on YouTube, VLC, or other supported apps) and then try to open Recent apps experienced crashes or black screens. It seems that this is, to this day, not fully addressed.
You can try clearing the app’s cache and ensuring that all necessary permissions are granted but, other than that, we can only wait for developers to address this.
Besides that and worth mentioning, it seems that the XS screen setting makes for quite a convoluted mess. You can navigate to Developer options and reduce DPI if you want to set text size and Font weight to XS.
4. Lags and stutters
Animation lags and small transition UI stutters were somewhat always an issue on MIUI ROMs. Nothing that grave but still noticeable and rather peculiar, especially if we consider hardware capabilities Xiaomi/Redmi devices have these days.
The problem makes overall experience bad as even the most regular transitions on the home screens or opening recent apps is slow. We can safely blame lack of optimization for this, especially on Android 10 versions of MIUI 11.
There are some things that you can do to mitigate this to some extent. An example being lowering the animation scale in Developer options. Not much, as only the developer can resolve the problem fully. Have in mind that Chinese ROM performs worse than the Global one.
5. Apps crashing or freezing
Another quite a catastrophic issue for those affected. As stated by users on various forums, certain third-party apps (system apps, like App Vault, too) keep crashing on MIUI 11, leading to a crash prompt and/or black screen. This especially appears to be the case when users minimize the app and try to get back to it from the Recent screen.
This is, again, hard to tackle with any troubleshooting step or workaround except with the factory reset. You can reinstall affected apps and give it a go, although we don’t believe this will address the issue. So, back up your data and reset the device to factory settings. If that doesn’t help, wait for updates. Alternatively, you can downgrade to MIUI 10.
MIUI 11 issues with connectivity are not that widespread, although the Hotspot inability to share connection succeded the same issue from MIUI 10. Some users said that the wireless speeds dropped significantly, others that they are unable to utilize mobile data and it even seems that VoLTE (and Wi-Fi Calling, for some) is missing.
Here are some troubleshooting steps to try to resolve connectivity issues, including Wi-Fi, Mobile Data, and Hotspot problems on MIUI 11:
- Enable Airplane mode and disable it after a minute.
- Reset APN.
- Reboot your phone and router.
- Reset Network Settings.
- Reset device to factory settings.
For other things, you can just wait for updates.
Xiaomi made another breakthrough in 2019 by adding more than a few devices with AMOLED displays into their lineup. And what’s an AMOLED-equipped device without Always-on display feature.
Thus, they decided to add AOD to MIUI 11 and, based on reports, they did a good job. Mostly. There are still things to work on, starting from brightness issues and overall usability of AOD on MIUI 11. They are still new to it but things like missing notifications are something users won’t tolerate.
Also, due to a lack of notification LEDs on contemporary devices, Xiaomi implemented pulsating notifications when the screen is off. They are also hit or miss since the brightness is too low for them to be of any use in light conditions.
Again, these are issues on the developer side. Update your device and hope that the next MIUI 11 iteration will address the problem. The community is quite vocal about these shortcomings so we can expect results soon enough.
8. Dark mode bugs
If there’s one thing that was (and still is) globally trending when it comes to feature additions in Android 10, that’s Dark mode. Xiaomi incorporated it in MIUI 11 with a wider approach than on MIUI 10, making most of the system apps compatible with it.
However, there are some problems with the Dark mode on MIUI 11 for users that upgraded to it from MIUI 10, where it was working as intended. They can’t enable it or, in some instances, disable its scheduling.
And again, it saddens us but the factory reset is your best bet to resolve this. Alternatively, there seems to be a way for rooted devices to enable VoLTE (as explained on XDE, here), but we don’t recommend it if you don’t know your way around unlocking bootloader or rooting.
Camera software seems to be one of the gravest problems on Xiaomi devices packed with capable lenses made by Sony or Samsung. It seems that some nifty additions to the Camera app were not enough to overlook stutters and overall general slow processing speeds, oversaturation, or preposterous audio recording quality.
Some of these are yet to be addressed by Xiaomi while others are minor bugs that should be gone before the official Android 10-based MIUI 11 hits the majority of supported devices. For the time being, try clearing the camera cache.
10. Game Turbo Mode crashes apps
One of the most advertised MIUI 11 features must be the Game Turbo 2.0 mode that optimizes background processes and provides an overlay with a plethora of interesting options. However, some users experienced issues with third-party apps working in the background while the Turbo Mode was on.
If you are having issues with the Game Turbo mode, we recommend adding affected apps to Memory exceptions and disabling Performance optimization. That should resolve the problem until they tweak the Game Turbo in the upcoming patches.
Follow these steps to disable Performance optimization and add affected apps to the Memory exceptions list:
- Open Settings and then Special features.
- Open the Game Turbo mode.
- Tap on the shield-like icon to open Settings.
- Once there, open toggle Performance optimization off.
- Then tap on the Memory exceptions and add apps you don’t want to limit while gaming (Facebook and WhatsApp are usually affected).
11. GPS issues
GPS on Android handsets has such a widespread use these days that many third-party apps depend on it. Luckily, on Android 10, you can limit access to Location Services. However, MIUI 11 seemingly has an issue with third-party apps with GPS readings that are not precise at all. Especially with Google Maps that barely work for some users.
If you are experiencing issues with GPS and Google Maps (or any other Location-dependent app), make sure to enable Assisted GPS and give Location permissions to affected apps. Also, you can test hardware in CIT by typing the *#*#6484#*#* code in the dialer.
12. Can’t install Netflix from the Play Store and Widevine is L3
Some users stated that they are unable to download and install Netflix via the Play Store for some reason. If you are using Chinese ROM, Netflix won’t be available for download. You can, of course, download an APK from any APK-aggregating website.
Netflix, like some other streaming services, uses various levels of Widevine DRM to limit the streaming quality to 480p or 720p on certain devices. If you have Widevine L1, you can stream 1080p, while the L3 allows only HD streaming (720p). MIUI 11 Global officially supports L3 but make sure that your bootloader is locked.
13. Google Assistant won’t start on Mi 9
Xiaomi’s flagship, Mi 9, comes with the dedicated AI button. This physical button worked great for users on MIUI 10, but it seems it stopped summoning Google Assistant on MIUI 11.
The best way to address this is to update your firmware. That should resolve the problem completely. But, beforehand, make sure to navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Default apps. Once there, ensure that Google’s services are set under the Voice assistant and Assist & voice input settings.
14. The fingerprint reader is inconsistent
The under-the-display fingerprint readers can be found on more than a few AMOLED devices Xiaomi presented in 2019. Based on the community’s feedback, they are hardly comparable in speeds to back-mounted fingerprint scanners and are not as precise. On the other hand, they are certainly an innovation in the evergrowing market.
Now, it seems that the already lackluster precision and speeds become even worse after an update to MIUI 11.
If that’s the case for you, check these instructions to improve fingerprint readings:
- Remove the protective tempered glass (or make sure you are using a supported one).
- Add fingerprints for a single finger multiple times.
- Remove and add fingerprints again.
- Disable always-on fingerprint icon.
- Reset device to factory settings.
15. Google Pay not working
Google Pay, like the aforementioned Netflix app, has certain security requirements in order to work. Some users stated that adding the card and configuring it is a walk in a park but, for no apparent reason, terminals won’t accept payments with MIUI 11-powered devices.
First of all, make sure to use the HCE wallet option. Alternatively, clear the app’s cache and data to resolve possible issues.
16. Important troubleshooting steps for MIUI 11
Enable access to Developer options
- Open Settings and then My device.
- Select All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number.
- Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options.
Reset Network settings
- Open Settings.
- Choose Connection & sharing.
- Scroll down and open “Reset WLAN, mobile networks, and Bluetooth“.
- Tap Reset settings.
Wipe cache partition
- Power off your device.
- Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button.
- Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection.
Reset device to factory settings
- Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage.
- Open Settings.
- Choose My device.
- Open Backup & reset.
- Choose Erase all data (factory reset).
- Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted.
With that said, we can (at least for the time being), conclude this article. Thank you for reading and make sure to add more MIUI 11 bugs or issues we forgot to mention in the comments section below. We’ll make sure to add them to the list and try and help you in solving them.

Not able to understand the exact reason for this behaviour.. Can some help
Download large file only in wifi.
GPS camera accepted to clickJust as everyone expected, Samsung Galaxy S8 took the market by the storm. It’s extremely well designed and produced, with the plethora of amazing novelties and great software to complete the picture. But, as some would say, the devil is in details.
One detail that somewhat corrupted the overall experience is the positioning of the lock screen clock. Namely, it seems that, by default, the numbers layout is stacked up, minutes above hours. That layout isn’t what most users are used to and they want to change it to standard form. But, as the case has shown, that’s harder to do than we expected. Don’t mix up the Always On Display with the lock screen, though. In Always on Display feature, you can customize the clock to your liking. The Lock screen is a completely different story.
Either way, we prepared some alternatives, or rather workarounds that should help you change the clock’s layout. At least, for the time being. If you’re not satisfied with the digital clock format on your Samsung Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus, make sure to check them out below.
Use different theme
Some users managed to get rid of the unusual clock by replacing the default theme for an alternative. This, of course, isn’t a solution but rather a workaround that might not be suiting everyone’s taste. However, for the time being, there are not so many things you can do, so it’s worth a try. There are some paid themes, but, since we can’t be sure that, after certain steps, the stack up format won’t return, it’s not advised to spend your money on those.
On the other hand, you can use a free theme and make your clock take a normal position that way. Follow the instructions below to do so:
- Tap Settings.
- Open Wallpapers and themes.
- Tap Themes in the bottom.
- Search for Simple Line Black theme.
- Install this theme and tap ”Apply”.
Moreover, if you’re not liking icon and background changes, you can always choose other wallpaper and restore icons to default. Make sure to check the steps below in order to change the wallpaper on both Home and Lock screen and restore default icons.
- Navigate to Gallery and choose the preferred photo individually for Home or Lock screen.
- Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Set as wallpaper.
- Now, navigate to Settings.
- Open Wallpapers and themes.
- Choose Icons.
- Tap Default and apply changes.
Try an app that sticks notifications the on lock screen
On the other hand, most of the users are already satisfied with the pre-installed theme and all they want to change is that silly annoyance of the lock screen clock. Or rather, make it vertical like on all Android-powered devices. But, until Samsung fix this and provide users with an option to choose the clock looks (just like in Always on Display features), there’s one, so to say, loophole you can take advantage of. Namely, if Lock screen notifications are enabled, you can place something like weather app to stick on the screen.
Due to its position, the clock changes its format to standard vertical positioning. If that works for you, it’s quite easy to set it up. In the example below, we’ll be using a weather app, called 1Weather. It’s small and subtle but will change your clock to a vertical position.
- Download 1Weather from Play Store.
- Tap Settings.
- Open Lockscreen and security.
- Enable Notifications.
- Tap Notifications.
- Open All Apps.
- Enable 1Weather.
As long as the notification stays on the Lock Screen, the annoying row-like position should be out of the picture.
That’s it. Since there are so many users that are complaining about this, we can expect that Samsung will do something in the upcoming period. Some of the future updates should change the clock to more natural state. Until then, you can use the above-mentioned workarounds.
In case you have questions or suggestions, make sure to post them in the comments section down below.

worked perfectly for me. Thank you Kimberly!
Same problem here.. don’t know if this is a Samsung or Android problem but they need to fix it.. every time there’s an os update something gets screwed up
I just restarted my phone and when it booted up a message said IMS stopped. I tapped on it and the clock left the ‘stacked’ position and came up normal. Have no idea what that means.Even though a lot of Android users are still waiting for an update to Nougat 7.0, Google announced brand new OS. Android Oreo or Oreos is the 8th Android installment and should be available for consumers in August or September 2017.
For the time being, Google released Developers Preview version that should showcase upcoming features. It’s available only for Google-powered devices, namely for:
So if you have one of these models, you can try out Android O. However, have in mind that this is not a stable version and you can encounter a large variety of issues. For that purpose, we listed some of the known issues for this preview release, so you can know what to expect.
Known issues of Android O Developer Preview
System User Interface Issues
With Android O, Google conducted various changes and improvements with UI. Sadly, you may have a hard time experiencing those when we consider these reported issues:
-
”System UI crash after toggling screen brightness, then going to Overview (recent) and selecting a new app.
-
Occasional issues navigating Home, with incomplete transition making the device unusable.
-
Taps in Quick Settings may be registered in another location.
-
When using Autofill, an “Android system app displaying on top” message is sometimes shown, but it can be ignored (if it’s turned off, it will disable Autofill).”
Google Cloud Messaging/Firebase Cloud Messaging
Cloud Messaging is also unstable in this preview version. These are the problems that occurred with some users:
-
”FCM doesn’t work in a secondary profile unless the app is also installed on the primary profile. If the app is not installed on the primary profile, an FCM token is not generated in the secondary profile.
-
Developers using FCM/GCM with Android O should update their Google Play services SDK to version 10.2.1, which is available from the SDK manager in Android Studio.”
Android TV Issues
The Nexus Player has specific issues on its own. We are bringing you whole detailed list below.
- ”Setting up a restricted profile then restarting the device causes the device to be unusable.
- Typing in the search bar causes a crash.
- PIP image does not fill the window.
- Launching applications via voice command does not work.
- Application size is not displayed in Application Settings.
- Microphone button on remote control does not work.
- Factory reset does not work on Fugu.
- Connected remote control device disconnects intermittently.
- USB connected drive cannot be formatted. The Setup as device storage formatting option does not work properly for drive attached via USB.
- Device may freeze with blank homescreen when plug is inserted.
- Location status in Settings may become disabled with user unable to re-enable.
- Not able to reorder games in the apps and games row.
- Content may not play after relaunching media apps.”
Android for Work and Device Manager Issues
Android for Work is a great feature that let you create and manage work-specific profile separately from the private one. At the moment, there is a single reported issue regarding Android for Work.
- ”Enabling a Work Profile may cause a crash in Settings app. To work around this issue, remove and re-add the Work Profile.”
Besides that, users reported occasional crashes while trying to access the Device Manager.
- ”Selecting the Settings > Security and Screen Lock > Android Device Manager menu item may cause a crash. Updating to the latest version of Google Play services will resolve this issue.”
Android Wear Issues
Besides handsets and Android TV, Android Wear has also support trough Android Emulator System Images. However, it’s not without issues.
- ”Embedded app installation from Play Store can sometimes crash. Side-loading can be used to work around this issue.
- Only the x86 emulator is currently supported.
- Default watch face complications may not load until you switch watch faces or otherwise touch watch face settings, or reboot the device.”
Wi-Fi Issues
Performance and Battery Issues
As you would expect, this is release is not advisable for everyday use. It is quite buggy and unstable performance-wise.
- ”System and app performance is known to be periodically slow / janky, and device may become occasionally unresponsive. These problems may become more acute with prolonged use.
- Some apps may not function normally on Developer Preview 1. This includes Google’s apps as well as other apps.
- This release has various stability and performance issues on all devices that make it not suitable for daily use on phone or tablet, especially for non-developers.”
Moreover, the same goes for battery. If you are willing to try out Android O Developer Preview, prepare for battery drainage.
And with the lack of percentage that is removed from UI, you won’t be able to determine consumption as easily as before.
Other Issues
Besides best-known issues, you may face a variety of secondary issues related to lack of optimization. Don’t forget that some of the apps/features you may use are still not compatible with novelties that Android O brings to the table.
- ”Using the Google Drive app’s PDF viewer to load a PDF document may cause the device to freeze.
- Apps or games may hit ANRs in GLThread, such as with
AssetManager::open , that cause crash or failure to load properly.
- Games using Google Play games services may have problems with sign-in.
- The latest release of Android Auto may not work properly on Developer Preview 1.
- The NDK cannot build targeting Android O DP1 (an upcoming r15 release will fix).”
Have in mind that these are only the ‘noticed’ issues since we are too early in this release phase. So, a large variety of unlisted issues can occur. Additionally, features like Android Pay are not available due to security reasons.
At the end, unless you’re a developer or knowledgeable enthusiast, we don’t advise you to install Developers Preview. Soon enough we should be able to download Beta version with CTS (Compatibility Test Suite) approval. That should be much safer to work with.
What are your first thoughts on Android O? What are the changes you eagerly await?
Nexus 5x – Android auto won’t launch on my car
Apple Music app crashes everytime i open.
Lots of strange bluetooth issues on my Nexus 6P – none of which I had on Android 7.x. I did the OTA Beta.
I went on here to see if anyone’s settings app crashes when opened Everytime. The only way I can get in there is though quick toggles and if I’m in airplane mode. WiFi and Bluetooth can be on but not service (cumsumer Cellular) hate it dont use switching to project fi when the Sim comes in. Other then that a super stable experience

When connected to my PC (Windows 10) Nexus 6P action drop down does not activate to apply actions.
I cannot attach a picture when using the messenger app…freezes and crashes. My Nexus 6p is still having the shut at 30% issue. Overall, the worst beta experience I have had.
No internet when off of wifi even though mobile data enabled. Very slow recharge using USB A cable. Fast battery drain.
Using Pixel XL, and since Android O the Google App itself is incredibly unstable. Most notably and specifically, the Assistant freezes the Google app upon a command (such as “call xyz”, or “send text to xyz”. The Google App freezes, then force close.

123...9Page 1 of 9LG in cooperation with Google has made some interesting phones that produced quite a stir in the market. The main reason for their instant popularity is stable Android support similar to the one for the Pixel phones. And the Nexus 5x, a successor of the Nexus 5, is one of the best Android devices produced by LG with reliable hardware and clean Android OS.
However, while this is an exquisite mid-budget phone, it isn’t without issues. Users around the world reported a large variety of problems and we’ll try to list the most important ones today. Have in mind that some of these issues are provoked by a hardware malfunction. On the other hand, the ones with the software background may have a solution and we’ll be sure to let you know about it.
Google Now broke feed
As we already stated, the best thing about Nexus phones is frequent Android support. You don’t get OS with bloatware but the latest Pixel-like upgrades. And it that’s not the same for a multitude of manufacturers. Android Nougat 7.0 upgrade has been available for a while with Google Now assistant.
However, comparing to the Pixel, Google Now on the Nexus 5x isn’t always remarkable. Few users reported a specific bug on Google AI personal assistant. Namely, the feed cards won’t load. The users are informed that this occurs due to lack of storage space. However, it seems that the storage space is not the problem. We advise you to try and update Google Now in the Play Store. If the problem is persistent, check the instructions below.
- Open Google app settings.
- Go to Your Feed section.
- Turn feed off.
- Restart your phone.
- Navigate to Your Feed section and enable feed.
If the problem is still persistent, delete your preferences in Your Feed section. That will clean your settings, but you’ll be able to see Feed cards again.
WiFi issues
It’s not as common as with some other handsets, but the Nexus 5x occasionally has an unstable connection or no connection at all. We advise you to follow these steps below in order to troubleshoot these issues and use the full potential of WiFi.
- Update firmware.
- Reset Network Settings.
- Restart your router.
- Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz.
- Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data.
- Reset phone to factory settings.
Additionally, crowded places like public WiFi spots can vastly affect connection stability. So, it’s not a viable option for testing/troubleshooting connectivity issues.
Bluetooth issues
- Reconnect the devices
- Delete all pairings and connect again.
- Disable other network services while using Bluetooth (Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G).
In case the problem is persistent on multiple pairing devices, even after an update, we advise you to take the Nexus 5x to the vendor for inspection.
Boot loop issue
One grave problem that is, luckily, not that common is the boot loop issue. Namely, a few users reported that their Nexus 5x freezes. That is allegedly followed by the shutdown and, after a restart, the device works for a couple of minutes and stop again. Additionally, it seems to occur after an update to Nougat.
You can easily find out the culprit for this issue by following these steps.
- While charging, restart your phone by holding Power button and Volume down key for a couple of seconds.
- Wait for a minute or so for the bootloader to start.
- If the bootloader starts – hardware is the culprit.
- In case the bootloader won’t start – Nougat update made a total chaos.
In both scenarios, you’ll need advanced practitioners to check your phone. It probably needs flashing. Too bad that users that got this problem had a lot of problems with responsible services. It’s their job to fix or replace your phone as soon as possible.
Proximity sensor issue
Some users reported issues with the proximity sensor’s behavior. Namely, as you may know, the proximity sensor’s (placed beside a speaker) main role is to regulate display on/off while you are talking and after the call is finished. So, every time you distance your phone from your ear, the display should turn on. But, it seems that this is isn’t functioning as supposed. You can’t hang up or, for example, use loudspeaker because the screen is off. You must press Power button multiple times in order to retrieve the screen commands.
This can be both software and hardware issue respectively. For hardware, you should check out for physical barrier your screen guard may create. Additionally, you may use certain diagnostic apps to check out sensor functionality. The near/far scale should vary from 0 to 2 inches.
When it comes to the software, things may take the wrong turn with the latest update. The smallest code error can render the proximity sensor faulty or unusable. What can you do? Well, besides waiting for the next update, you may also set up Power button as a go-to button to end calls. That way you’ll make a temporary solution before the things are resolved.
Keyboard issue
Besides the usual problems that occur occasionally with most of Android handsets, the Nexus 5x has an issue with the keyboard. Of course, we are talking about native Google keyboard since the alternative solutions can have specific errors of their own. According to some users, the keyboard is unresponsive or laggy while trying to input text, especially in 3rd-party apps (WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook Messanger etc.). Moreover, key sounds delay is noticed. Additionally, latency intensifies when the phone is charging.
This may be fixed with some of the upcoming updates. But, while you are waiting for developers to address this issue, you’ll probably want to try some of this workarounds.
- Restart your phone.
- Don’t use the phone while charging. Some users reported better performance after changing the charger.
- Disable autocorrect and autofill features.
- Clear personal dictionary and keyboard app cache and data.
- Wipe the system cache partition.
In addition, you may try 3rd-party keyboards that suit you best, like Swiftkey.
Even though the Nexus 5x packs a quite powerful CPU, some of you occasionally experienced stutters and lags. Since this is one of the best-optimized devices you’ll find on the market, third-party apps that work in the background are the main suspect. But, we won’t exclude the unoptimized firmware update, either.
With some users, this issue takes much larger proportions and the phone is mostly unusable. Have in mind that can be also related to hardware failure. Follow the instructions below to try and resolve lag issues.
- Reboot your phone.
- Uninstall recently installed apps.
- Wipe System Cache Partition
- Reset the phone to factory settings.
Follow these steps to Wipe System Cache Partition.
- Power off your device.
- Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously.
- When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate trough the menu.
- Select Recovery mode.
- Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear.
- Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear.
- Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button.
- The process should last for approximately 10 minutes. Do not interrupt it.
Follow these steps to perform a backup and Factory reset. You’ll need your Google username and password in order to backup your data. Also, all your data will be wiped out, so you should backup your data to PC. It is advised to clean the SD, as well.
- Go to Settings.
- Open Backup & Reset.
- Choose Backup Now to save your data to the cloud.
- After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone.
- Tap Erase All and confirm.
- The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes.
Apps crash
Besides the complex issues that impact the overall performance, some apps may be faulty on their own. Even though it’s not dangerous at first sight, app crashes can lead to stutters and lags mentioned above and there so affect workflow drastically. This mostly occurs with third-party rogue apps, but the built-in apps are not an exception.
You can fix crashing apps with few workarounds and prevent them from making larger issues.
- Clear apps Cache.
- Clear apps Data.
- Update apps via Play Store.
- Reinstall the app (roll back to factory version with built-in apps).
- Start the phone in Safe mode to look for interfering apps.
- Press and hold the power button while the screen is on.
- Tap and hold the Power off on the screen.
- When prompted, press OK to enter Safe mode.
Wrap-up
That should do it. For the end, please don’t this round-up trick you into thinking that Nexus 5x is a bad phone. It’s great. Most of the time. But, it isn’t Pixel, the Google’s favorite child, as well.
If you have any questions or additional issues you want to address, please do tell us in the comments. We’ll be glad to help.
Our Nexus 5X suddenly stopped working. Tried all the hard and soft resets and nothing happens. Can someone help p,ease?
Our Nexus 5X suddenly stopped working. Tried all the hard and soft resets and nothing happens. Can someone help p,ease?Xiaomi is standing firmly with other renowned manufacturers and reassuring us that you can get a flagship-like device for the modest price. Their handsets are as reliable as one would ask for while being quite affordable.
One of the models that established Xiaomi as a contender in the tough smartphone race is the Mi5. Even though the Chinese giant introduced its successor, the Mi6, the Mi5 is still a valid choice if you want a premium specs device for a small price.
However, even though the Xiaomi Mi5 is a good phone, you may encounter some problems from time to time. And sudden battery drains can be quite problematic to deal with. So, today we compiled a list of workarounds you should take into consideration. The ones that should help you retain your battery life and vastly improve your overall experience.
Disable background apps
First of all, you’ll need to take care of the background apps that are draining a lot of battery on the daily basis. You can identify the larger consumers and disable them from running in the background. That can be done under Settings > Additional settings > Battery. Once you’ve found out about exact culprits for battery leaks, follow these instructions to disable them from running in the background:
- Navigate to Apps.
- Open the main consumers and set the restrictions on for them.
- Wait for a couple of hours and look for battery improvements.
Although this will render some services unusable, like push mail or IM messaging, so make sure to exclude apps you frequently use in the background.
Prevent Wi-Fi from always scanning
Another feature that makes a great impact on battery drainage is Wi-Fi Always scanning. When enabled, this feature always scans for available Wi-Fi networks in your surroundings. This may be of use, but it can also substantially affect battery life. For that purpose, we advise you to disable it and move on trough the list:
- Tap and hold Wi-Fi icon under Notification pane.
- Open Advanced Settings.
- Turn off Wi-Fi Optimization and Scanning always available options.
Turn off Sync
The second feature that is worth checking out is Auto-sync. When it’s enabled, multiple apps will use the connection to download/upload data in the background and that will most of the time lead to battery drains. So, make sure to disable it.
You can enable sync once per day, but the permanent activity will, as we said, cause a battery leak.
Disable Performance mode
Performance mode will give a higher priority to performance instead of balanced use. That can lead to battery overconsumption which is the matter we are trying to prevent. So, make sure to disable it and that should, at least marginally, improve the battery life.
Switch GPS to Device only
- Tap Settings.
- Open Additional settings.
- Tap Privacy.
- Tap Location.
- Under Location, change to Device only.
This procedure should reduce battery leaks considerably.
Wipe cache partition
While the factory reset can be quite a trouble since all of your data is cleared, that’s not the case for the wipe of the cache partition. Basically, with this recovery procedure, you’ll only clear all of the temporary files, and presumably, fix a large variety of bugs or issues. Including the unusual battery leaks.
Follow the instructions below to clear the temporary files from cache partition:
- Power off your device.
- Hold Power button + Volume Up key until the Recovery screen appears.
- Press Volume Up to navigate trough the language menu and select the preferred language with Power button.
- In the same manner, select Wipe and reset.
- Choose Wipe cache data.
- After the procedure finishes, restart your device.
However, if the problem is still there and your battery on-screen time is gradually declining, make sure to check more steps.
Restore the factory settings
If you’ve done all of the previous steps but the battery durability is still subpar, you’ll probably want to perform a factory reset. First of all, make sure to backup your data before moving on with the following steps:
- Power off your handset.
- Press the Power button + Volume Up key until you see the Mi logo.
- Use the Volume Up key to highlight the preferred language and press Power button to confirm the selection.
- Choose Wipe & Reset.
- Select Wipe all data.
- Confirm selection with Power button.
- When it’s done, reboot the device.
That should restore your factory settings and, hopefully, increase battery on-screen time.
Recalibrate the battery
It may sound silly, but what if your battery is in perfect condition but the readings are plain wrong? You can always replace the battery but we advise you to try the recalibration procedure first in order to get the proper readings. Prepare yourself for the lengthy procedure and follow the instructions closely:
- Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off.
- Turn it on again and wait until it turns off..
- Plug your phone into a wall socket, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”.
- Unplug your device.
- Turn your device on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full.
- Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full.
- Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent.
- Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself.
- Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging.
It’s not advised to repeat this procedure too often. However, after you perform it, the readings should be spot on.
Switch ROM
A lot of more experienced Xiaomi users suggested a ROM switch. Most of the issues with the battery are mainly connected to a Global ROM, so you can obtain Chinese ROM or older version of the Global ROM release. You can find those here with the flashing guide. Make sure to handle this with care and stick to the explanation.
That should wrap up this article. If you have any additional suggestions or questions regarding the workarounds we presented, feel free to tell us in the comments section.
Wipe cache partition is no longer available on MIUI recoverySamsung’s Galaxy series are regarded as the top-of-the-line flagship devices. However, even the best of the best can have occasional issues, sometimes, quite the concerning ones. One frequently reported issue is the Samsung Galaxy S10 overheating. This usually happens during charging, however, some users experienced heat issues even when the device was idle. Learn how to address this in the step-by-step list below.
Table of contents:
- Remove the protective casing
- Disable some background services
- Stick to the factory charger
- Reduce animations and screen resolution
- Wipe cache partition or reset to factory settings
Why is my Samsung Galaxy s10 getting hot?
Solution 1 – Remove the protective casing
Start by removing the protective casing. Especially, when charging the device. Certain materials will heavily impact the heat-retention and your device won’t be able to cool down after charging or during heavy use.
Solution 2 – Disable some background services
Alternatively, if the device heats up even during regular use, make sure to disable some background processes. Many users reported that their device started overheating in the first 30 minutes of usage, so we suggest inspecting all apps that work in the background and limiting the activity of the non-essential ones.
Follow these instructions to check active apps and disable them from auto-starting:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps.
- Locate individual apps that are using more resources and disable auto-start or uninstall them. You can also boot into safe mode and look for improvements. If everything is working as intended, uninstalling recently-installed third-party apps is recommended.
After you’ve disabled some apps, make sure to reboot your Samsung Galaxy S10, and look for improvements.
Solution 3 – Stick to the factory charger
Even though, in theory, most of the chargers will work without issues but we still suggest sticking to the out-of-the-box charger and USB – Type C data cable.
The original cable and adapter won’t cause overheating issues on the Samsung Galaxy S10 as some third-party options might.
Solution 4 – Reduce animations and screen resolution
You can also try and reduce the animations and the screen resolution to FHD instead of QHD. This might reduce the processing and thus lower the overheating.
- Open Settings.
- Select “About phone”.
- Open Software information and locate the Build number.
- Once there, tap on the Build number 7 times and you should be prompted to enter your password in order to enable Developer options.
- Open Developer options from the main Settings menu (it should be at the bottom).
- Scroll down until you reach Animation options. Set animations to 0.5 and reboot your device.
And this is how to switch to FHD (1080p) from QHD (1440p) display settings:
Solution 5 – Wipe cache partition or reset to factory settings
Finally, if none of the previous steps helped resolve the Samsung Galaxy S10 overheating, we can only suggest two things before you return your device and ask for the replacement.
Firstly, try wiping the cache partition from the Recovery menu. Here’s how to do it:
- Power off your Samsung Galaxy S10.
- Simultaneously press and hold the Power button, Volume up, and the Bixby button until the Android logo appears.
- After that, you should see the Recovery menu.
- Once there, use the volume keys to navigate through the menu and press the Power button to select wipe cache partition.
- Choose Yes and press the Power button to wipe the cache partition.
On the other hand, if that doesn’t help, try resetting your device to factory settings and setting it up again. Follow these steps to reset the Samsung Galaxy S10 to factory settings:
- Back up everything from your internal storage to an SD card or cloud.
- Open Settings.
- Choose General management and then Reset.
- Select Factory data reset.
- Tap Reset and then tap Delete all.
If you are still experiencing overheating, make sure to ask for the replacement as your device probably has a flaw causing overheating.
With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and, if you have any questions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below.Nova Launcher Prime is one of those apps that, years after being purchased, keeps on giving. Many users run the non-premium version and still rate it above many other third-party launchers. However, this feature-rich custom launcher is not perfect. Some users have had a hard time with it, as their Android devices won’t keep Nova Launcher in RAM memory.
This results in longer-than-usual loading speeds on the home screen. Some users also reported issues with RAM management, when Nova uses up to 600 MB of RAM (normally, it should use no more than 200 with integrations). We made sure to list a few applicable solutions to address this without too much hassle.
Table of contents:
- Make sure Nova is the default launcher
- Check all permissions
- Reset Nova Launcher
- Prevent the stock launcher from working in the background
- Reinstall the launcher
Nova Launcher doesn’t stay in the memory
Solution 1 – Make sure Nova is the default launcher
The first thing you should do is just restart your device. Chances are this will fix the problem with Nova Launcher and keep it in memory in order to avoid constant redrawing.
If restarting didn’t help, you need to ensure that Nova Launcher is your default launcher. It might be that the system defaults on its own to stock launcher so it is really important to make Nova Launcher the default one.
Follow these instructions to set Nova as your default launcher:
- Open Settings and, in the search bar, type Launcher and open Default Launcher.
- Under the Default launcher, select Nova Launcher.
- Restart your device and look for improvements.
Solution 2 – Check all permissions
An app with such a wide usage on Android, as custom launchers, requires a lot of different permissions in order for everything to work as intended. Now, you don’t have to grant permissions you don’t feel safe giving, but remember that this will either limit certain features or affect the way the launcher is running on your device.
In addition, we suggest disabling RAM and Battery optimization for Nova Launcher in System Settings.
Here’s what to do in order to ensure Nova has all necessary permissions granted:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps > All apps.
- Open Nova Launcher from the list of all apps.
- Open Permissions. Some Android custom skins have Other permissions, as well. Don’t forget to access that menu as well.
- Grant all permissions to Nova and reboot your device.
- If that doesn’t help, navigate to Settings > Security > Special apps access (or Special access apps) and grant Nova Notification access, Display over other apps, and Usage access permissions.
Solution 3 – Reset Nova Launcher
recommended to enable the Restart widgets on resume option in Labs.
Here’s how to restart Launcher and enable restarting of widgets in order to lower the redrawing time:
- Tap and hold on the Home Screen to open Nova Launcher Menu.
- Select Settings.
- Tap and hold the Volume down button to bring up the Labs menu.
- Once there, enable the Restart widgets on resume option.
- Get back to Settings.
- Scroll to the bottom and expand Advanced.
- Tap Restart Nova Launcher.
Alternatively, clear cache and data and start from scratch. Of course, before clearing data, make sure to back up your Nova configuration.
Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Nova Launcher:
- Open Nova settings from the Home Screen.
- Select Backup & import settings.
- Back up Nova configuration either locally or upload it to Drive.
- Once you’ve done that, navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Nova Launcher. There, open Storage and clear cache and data from the app.
Solution 4 – Prevent the stock launcher from working in the background
Now, even though Nova Launcher is set as the default launcher, what we want to do is disable the system (stock) launcher from working in the background. Stock launchers, like Pixel or MIUI System launcher, will read notifications in the background and, potentially, disrupt Nova Launcher.
So, make sure to navigate to Special access apps and disable Notification access for the system launcher. As we already stated, granting Notification access to Nova, on the other hand, is a good idea.
Solution 5 – Reinstall the launcher
Finally, if after 4 steps, you still can’t keep Nova Launcher in memory and it’s frequently redrawing for a couple of seconds whenever you go to the home screen, you can reinstall the app. After removing Nova, download it again, load your back up, and look for improvements.
Additionally, we recommend leaving the Beta program for Nova Launcher. Although usually stable, Beta releases are not as stable as the public release.
With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share your questions or suggestions with us. You can do so in the comments section below.Samsung took its midrange game to a completely new level with the revamped A series. The update for their best-selling device, the Samsung Galaxy A50, was introduced not long after. The Samsung Galaxy A51 brings great AMOLED experience and overall reliability to users who don’t want to break the bank. Additionally, Samsung promised that this device, unlike the A50, will get 3 major OS updates, which is great.
However, we can’t turn our heads away from the numerous emerging issues that bother many Samsung Galaxy A51 users. For that reason, we made certain to bring all major issues to the table along with the applicable solutions. Check them out below.
Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration.
Table of contents:
- Battery draining fast
- Slow Wi-Fi
- 4G issues
- The Galaxy A51 won’t update
- Brightness issues
- Overheating
- Bluetooth issues
- UI freezing and animation lags
- VPN issues
- Spontaneous reboots
- Camera won’t focus, crashes, and Macro mode issues
- Low in-call volume and system sound
- The phone is not charging above 75%
- Troubleshooting steps for Samsung Galaxy A51
1. Battery draining fast
Since the device was introduced and first purchases were made, many users reported heavy battery drainage on the Samsung Galaxy A51.
Even though the battery capacity paired with the Super AMOLED display should provide a significant Screen-on Time, the battery drains a lot, even when idle. The probable reason for this is the somewhat outdated Exynos 9611 (10nm).
With that in mind, we can suggest a few things to improve battery life on your Samsung Galaxy A51. At least, to some extent. Follow these steps to reduce battery drainage and extend the Screen-on Time:
- Disable background apps.
- Disable Wi-Fi, Location Services, and Mobile Data overnight.
- Ensure that the network signal is strong. If the device is constantly searching for network coverage, it will deplete the battery quickly.
- Disable Auto-brightness and set the brightness manually.
2. Slow Wi-Fi
There are many reports coming from the Samsung Galaxy A51 users concerning Wi-Fi stability and speed on 2.4 GHz networks. Many of them tested several networks with different devices and got much better results than with Samsung’s mid-ranger.
We can’t say with certainty what’s exactly causing this problem or whether it’s a software or hardware issue. Some suspect Bluetooth is interfering with Wi-Fi. On the other hand, there are some troubleshooting steps you can try. Here’s what you can do:
- Enable Airplane mode and disable it.
- Restart your phone and router.
- Reset Network Settings.
- Disable Bluetooth.
3. 4G issues
In order to resolve this, we strongly suggest updating your device. Alternatively, you can back up your data and go for the factory reset. The latter option is the last resort as we all know how tedious can be setting up everything from a scratch.
4. The Galaxy A51 won’t update
Samsung recently promised 3 years of major updates to 10+ devices. Including the Galaxy A51. That can be a life-changer, especially considering the bad rap Samsung had with its mid-range lineups in the past. However, before the Samsung Galaxy A51 sees Android 11 or Android 12, it needs to be able to install updates in the first place.
Some users reported update issues, as the device won’t start the reboot-flash-boot sequence on the stock ROM. If this bothers you, we recommend ensuring that you have enough storage space firstly.
After that, navigate to the Updater app and clear its cache and data. If that doesn’t help and the device still won’t update, boot into recovery and wipe the cache partition clean.
5. Brightness issues
The Samsung Galaxy A51, like basically all Samsung handsets, has quite a remarkable Super AMOLED with great viewing angles and exquisite brightness reaching 565 nits outdoors while the Adaptive brightness is enabled. However, some users have encountered a bug with brightness.
Namely, it seems that the display dims on its own even with the adaptive brightness setting is disabled. We recommend restarting your device. In case that doesn’t help, try running the Test code in the dialer. The code is *#0*#. You can test your display there for possible factory errors.
In case you are still running into this system bug, we suggest resetting your device to factory settings.
This one issue is quite frequently reported on various forums. Exynos chips that widely used by Samsung are known to be prone to overheat. Especially if you are gaming for an extended period of time, have poor network coverage, or use the device while it’s charging.
Keeping your device up-to-date firmware-wise should help but, just to get in a clear, make sure to remove the protective casing while charging. Also, we strongly suggest using the included charger solely.
Having a stable Bluetooth connection is something many users are expecting in this day and age, considering that the wireless headphones (earbuds) are getting prominent. Sadly, some users are reporting scratchy sound. For some, Bluetooth is frequently disconnecting.
In case you are experiencing any Bluetooth issues, make sure to try all these steps in order to resolve the problem at hand:
- Restart your device.
- Unpair and pair your handset again with the device.
- Disable Bluetooth A2DP Hardware Offload in Developer Options.
- Reset Network Settings.
Can the optimized software compensate for the subpar chipset? Sometimes, the answer is yes (Google Pixel 3a is a good example), but that isn’t the case for many Samsung devices. Exynos 9611 paired with 4/6 GB of RAM should be good enough but that’s just not the case for some.
The Samsung Galaxy A51 users report a lot of issues with OneUI which freezes while transition animations are lagging, as well. We have a few suggestions that should help you, if not to resolve, then to at least mitigate problems lags.
Here’s what you should do if UI is freezing and animations are lagging on the Samsung Galaxy A51:
- Reboot your device.
- Try booting into Safe Mode and look for improvements. If the device performs better, continue with the steps.
- Lower the Animation scale in Developer options from 1 to 0.5 or disable them altogether.
- Limit the number of background apps in Developer options.
- Update the firmware.
- Reset the device to factory settings.
9. VPN issues on the Samsung Galaxy A51
These days, many users rely on VPNs for various reasons. Whether due to privacy concerns or removing geo-restrictions, it is a must for many users. Many OEMs (including Samsung) went as far as to give VPN a separate section in the Settings menu, with options like Always-on VPN to ensure that the VPN will work in the background.
However, some Samsung Galaxy A51 users have had a hard time connecting to a VPN. In case you are among the affected users, we can recommend a few things. Firstly, make sure that the VPN app of your choice has the necessary permission. Additionally, try reinstalling the app and forgetting VPN and re-adding it again.
10. Spontaneous reboots on the Samsung Galaxy A51
This is a serious one. More than a few Samsung Galaxy A51 users reported spontaneous reboots and there was no apparent reason why. Now, chances are that there’s some kind of system corruption at hand, although hardware failure is a more probable scenario.
You can try wiping the cache partition or booting into safe mode in order to troubleshoot, however, the best thing to do is to go for a factory reset. The problem seemingly started appearing after an OTA update and so factory reset should be a good next step.
Nonetheless, if the issue continues to bother you despite a clean-slate start, we suggest contacting your carrier or retailer. Asking for a replacement is an obvious step.
11. Camera won’t focus, crashes, and Macro mode issues
The quad-camera setup (48 MP wide, 12 MP ultrawide, Macro, and Depth sensor) on the Samsung Galaxy A51 should bring at least average photography experience. However, we learned so many times in recent times that it’s not all about hardware when it comes to smartphone cameras.
The camera software on the Samsung Galaxy A51 is far from being optimized. User reports talk about focus issues, Camera app crashes, Macro mode being an unreliable gimmick instead of a useful lense utilization, color smudges in low-light conditions, HDR issues, sound in recordings being muffled, and more.
We can suggest a few steps in order to try and address the majority of Camera issues on the Samsung Galaxy A51:
- Clear data and cache from the Camera app in Settings > Apps.
- Wipe cache partition.
- Check the in-app settings and ensure that HDR is disabled if you dislike it.
- Update your firmware.
12. Low in-call volume and system sound
A good on-device speaker is a good thing to have but there are many factors when it comes to reproduction. Some users are unable to get the device to play sounds at all when streaming or watching clips on YouTube. Others experience stutters which probably occur due to processor lags (we can’t be sure about that, though).
Additionally, the low in-call volume is another problem reported by numerous users. For the time being, your best bet to address these issues is to update your device to the latest firmware version and hope for the best. Alternatively, you can give the factory reset a go.
13. The phone is not charging above 75%
This problem is scarcely reported but we read a few comments explaining that the battery measuring started going crazy for some users. Now, there’s no need to worry as this, most likely, isn’t a hardware issue.
You can try wiping the cache partition but it’s advisable to calibrate your battery. That can be done by following the steps we presented in this dedicated article.
14. Troubleshooting steps for Samsung Galaxy A51

Namely, it seems that Facebook Messenger is not sending pictures on Android. Not after multiple tries. We made sure to help affected users resolve this as fast as possible.
Table of contents:
- Check permissions
- Clear cache and data from the Messenger
- Check Date and Time Settings
- Reinstall the app
- Check SD card
- Leave the Beta program
- Rollback to an older version of Facebook Messenger
Why won’t Facebook Messenger send pictures?
There are more than a few reasons why Facebook Messenger won’t send pictures on Android. The first one is server status, which might be down for all or some users. Additionally, the local cache might get corrupted or time/date settings are not right.
To tackle these and other possible culprits for this issue, make sure to go through the list below.
1. Check permissions
The common bug that’s causing this problem usually prevents users from sending pictures or even text messages to users that recently re-activated their Facebook accounts (Facebook Messenger accounts, too). What you should do is simply un-friend that user and be-friend him/her again. If pictures won’t go through after that, continue reading.
Let’s start by checking all permissions to ensure that Facebook Messenger has access to both your locale storage and the SD card. Sometimes, users accidentally dismiss the prompt which asks for the storage access. If that’s the case, you won’t be able to send or save images in Facebook Messenger.
With that said, navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Facebook Messenger. Once there, make sure that all related permissions are granted. You don’t have to grant Location, Contacts, or SMS permissions.
2. Clear cache and data from the Messenger
The second step is to clear cache and data from the Messenger and reset the app that way. Many issues in Android apps can be addressed by clearing the cache and data from the app.
Follow these steps, to clear cache and data from Facebook Messenger:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps.
- Tap All apps (App manager or Manage apps).
- Open Messenger.
- Tap Storage.
- Clear cache first and then data.
- Reboot your device, log in to your Messenger account again.
3. Check Date and Time Settings
To ensure that there are no issues with the dedicated servers, you’ll need to have proper time and date set.
Follow these instructions to check the time and date and set them accordingly:
- Open Settings.
- Choose System or Additional settings.
- Open Date & time.
- Toggle ON the “Use network-provided time” option.
- Reboot your device.
4. Reinstall the app
Moving on, you can also try reinstalling the app if the previous steps failed to resolve the problem. There’s no big difference between this and clearing cache and data, but it’s worth a try, especially because you’ll get the latest version of Facebook Messenger.
Here’s how to reinstall Facebook Messenger on Android:
- Navigate again to Settings > Apps > All apps > Messenger.
- Uninstall the app and clear cache and data when prompted.
- Navigate to Play Store and install the app.
- Reboot your device.
- Log in again.
5. Check SD card
There’s an extra layer of security and system permissions when it comes to accessing the external storage. We hope you covered that in the first step we listed here. However, your SD card can still cause issues, due to corruption or if not properly placed in the slot.
If you are unable to access files on the SD card on your Android device from any other app, make sure to format it. For the majority of apps, the better option is formatting SD cards as external storage rather than the internal one.
If you are part of the Beta program for Facebook Messenger, make sure to leave it and look for improvements. Early releases are great as they bring new features faster, but the app might be unstable and thus, the problems might occur.
If you are not sure how to leave the Beta program for Facebook Messenger, make sure to check these steps:
- Open Play Store.
- Search for and open Messenger and scroll down until you reach the You’re a beta tester section.
- Tap Leave and wait until you are removed from the Beta program.
- Restart your phone and update the Messenger.
Finally, if none of the previous steps helped you and Facebook Messenger is still not sending pictures, we suggest using an APK of an older version. With an APK, you can rollback to an older version of Facebook Messenger and address the problem that way.
Here’s how to do it:
- Uninstall Facebook Messenger.
- Navigate to APK Mirror, here, or use any APK aggregator and look for Facebook Messenger.
- Download the APK. We recommend that the APK is not older than 2 months and that it’s not Beta release.
- Run the APK and allow the installation of third-party apps on your device when prompted.
- Clear cache and data and then sign in with your credentials.
Alternatively, the server might be down for the time being and you can try sending pictures after a couple of hours. Most of the time, just waiting for the things to sort them selfs out is the best solution.
And, on that note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share your questions or suggestions (alternative solutions) in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you.Google Drive is the default Android cloud drive and probably the most used one by Android users around the world. It’s usually quite a reliable solution for both regular or paying users but it does have occasional issues from time to time. Recently, users reported that Google Drive keeps going offline even when they are connected to a Wi-Fi network.
Table of contents:
- Disable Offline files
- Check the connection
- Clear cache and data from Google Drive
- Reinstall Google Drive and check the permissions
- Install an older version of Google Drive via APK
- Sign out and then sign in with your Google Account
Why does my Google Drive keep going offline?
There are multiple reasons why Google Drive might keep going offline even if you want to access online content. Failing network connection and a temporary bug in the current version are just some of them.
If you are affected by this problem, make sure to check the steps we provided below.
Solution 1 – Disable Offline files
The first thing to do if you repetitively get this problem is to disable certain files that you made available offline. It seems that there’s a glitch that prevents online access for files that are made available offline.
Solution 2 – Check the connection
This goes without saying but Google Drive requires a stable Wi-Fi or mobile data network in order to access files. Now, most of the time the problem is not in the connection but we must, for the sake of troubleshooting, add it to the list.
Here are some things you should check:
- Reboot your router and phone/tablet.
- If you are using Mobile Data, open Google Drive > hamburger menu > Settings and disable the “Transfer files only over Wi-Fi” option.
- Disable and re-enable Wi-Fi.
Solution 3 – Clear cache and data from Google Drive
The next step is rather obvious, as well. Cached data can and will occasionally cause issues with Android apps. Cached data is locally stored and used to speed up loading when accessing apps. However, if it gets corrupt, it might lead to issues.
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps (Application Manager or Manage apps).
- Open Google Drive from the apps list.
- Open Storage.
- Clear Cache first and then Data.
- Reboot your device.
Solution 4 – Reinstall Google Drive and check the permission
In case previous steps were in vain, we recommend reinstalling the app and then checking permissions. If Google Drive comes as a system app, you won’t be able to uninstall it. However, you can uninstall all updates, reboot your device, and wait for it to update.
Follow these steps to reinstall (or reset) Google Drive on Android:
- Open Play Store.
- Search for Drive.
- Uninstall the Google Drive app.
- Install the app again and reboot your device.
Additionally, you should probably check the permissions after reinstalling the app. Make sure to grant every permission under Settings > Apps > All apps > Google Drive > Permissions.
Solution 5 – Install an older version of Google Drive via APK
Now, it’s not unusual for Google to release an unfinished app and that might, of course, lead to a variety of issues. In their defense, most major changes are added via server-side updates and in batches. That way, they can protect the majority of users.
Nonetheless, if the current version of Google Drive is not working for you no matter what you try, you can sideload an older version via an APK and fix it that way.
Follow these instructions to sideload an older version of Google Drive on your Android device:
- Uninstall Google Drive from your device as previously explained.
- Navigate to this APK Mirror page where all Google Drive versions are presented.
- Download an older APK (not older than 2 months preferably) and grant permission to install from third-party sources when prompted.
Also, some users who tend to use multiple Google Accounts on their Android device reported that signing out and signing back again to Google Account resolved the error completely. After that Google Drive stopped going offline.
Follow these instructions to sign out and sign back into your main Google Account:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Accounts.
- Select Google.
- Tap More and remove the Google account.
- Reboot your device and sign in again.
Solution 7 – Try Drive on the web
Finally, this might be a global issue that’s temporary preventing all users from accessing their cloud-based files. You can try and access your files from on the web-based client on your device, by checking the Desktop box before searching for Google Drive.
You can check if Google Drive is down by navigating, here. And, with that, we can call it a wrap. In case you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to share them with us in the comments section below.Gmail is easily the most used mail client on Android. Mostly because it comes with the OS and the fact that once-great Inbox is no more. Many people dislike it, as the app is not as intuitive as some other clients. To add insult to injury, it seems that Gmail keeps crashing for some Android users.
Table of contents:
- Clear cache and data from the Gmail app
- Disable and re-enable the app
- Sign out of your Google Account and sign in again
- Disable Dark mode
- Update the app
Why does my Gmail app keep crashing?
There are various reasons why the Gmail app might keep crashing repeatedly on Android. The most common reasons are the corruption of locally stored cache and a variety of bugs. One of the common reasons is the Dark theme.
In order to fix this, make sure to follow the steps we listed below.
Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from the Gmail app
The first step you should take to address the issue at hand is to clear cache and data from the Gmail app. Pilled up locally-stored data might cause this issue. Especially if the app is unstable to start with due to a bug.
Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Gmail for Android:
- Navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Gmail again.
- Select Storage.
- Clear the cache first and then clear the data.
- Reboot your device.
Solution 2 – Disable and re-enable the app
If the Gmail app keeps crashing, you can try to reinstall the app or, if it’s a system app, disable it and re-enable it again. Most users who run into issues with Gmail for Android fixed the problem this way.
Here’s how to reinstall or disable/re-enable Gmail for Android and prevent further crashes:
- Navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Gmail.
- Tap Uninstall or Uninstall updates.
- Now, open the Play Store and locate Gmail.
- Install Gmail and reboot your device.
Solution 3 – Sign out of your Google Account and sign in again
This solution might look like a long shot but it seemingly works for some. What you need to do is sign-out of your Android account and then sign in again. This, in combination with previous troubleshooting steps, should address the problem.
- Open Settings.
- Select Accounts & sync.
- Select Google.
- Tap on the menu at the bottom and remove the account.
- Reboot your device, add the account and check for improvements with Gmail notifications.
Solution 4 – Disable Dark mode
One frequent and well-documented reason for this occurrence is the dark mode for Gmail on Android. Namely, after Android 10 was introduced, Google made sure to provide the dark theme for the majority of its apps for Android. When the long-awaited dark them for Gmail was introduced, many users reported crashes.
Now, Google removed the dark theme temporarily and added it again after it was fixed, but we can’t say with certainty whether this feature is definitely stable on all those Android devices. It is currently exclusively available on Android 10.
So, we recommend disabling the dark theme and looking for improvements:
- Open Gmail.
- Tap on the hamburger menu and then open Settings.
- Choose General settings.
- Tap on Theme and select Light.
- Reboot your device and check for improvements.
Solution 5 – Update the app
Finally, this is more of a reminder and a continuation of the previous step. Always make sure to keep your apps up to date. You can open Play Store > hamburger menu > My apps & games. Once there, make sure to update all pending apps.
And, on that note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we certainly hope the here-provided steps helped you resolve the issue. If your Gmail still keeps on crashing, make sure to tell us in the comments section below.

How do you uninstall gmail? I only have Disable or Force Stop!Android Oreo has changed the way we clear cached data on our phones! Which left some users confused, as the process isn’t as straightforward and simple as it used to be in Android Nougat.
In Android Nougat, you could simply go to Storage settings, and bulk clear all the cache on your phone. That’s very practical, because users don’t have to bother clearing each app’s cache individually. A time-saving feature, we must say.
But that’s not the case anymore. When you go to Storage settings in Android Oreo, you won’t see this option anymore. That’s because Google decided to remove the traditional cache-clearing fature from Oreo.
So, how do we actually clear cache in Android Oreo now?
How is cached data cleared in Android Oreo
To understand what’s going on, we’ll have to include the whole picture. With Android O, Google wants to change the whole policy of using, storing, and clearing cached data. Google encourages developers to be more ‘efficient’ in developing their apps.
Here’s what the Android O developer preview release notes say:
“Android O gives better guidance and behaviors around cached data. Each app is now given a disk space quota for cached data….
When the system needs to free up disk space, it will start by deleting cached files from apps that are the most over their allocated quota. Thus, if you [the developer of an app] keep your cached data under your allocated quota, your cached files will be some of the last on the system to be cleared when necessary. When the system is deciding what cached files to delete inside your app, it will consider the oldest files first (as determined by modified time).”
Of course, this is for the developer preview. But as it appears, nothing has changed in the official version.
So, long story short. You don’t need to clear cached data at all, as the system should do that for you. Because of that, there’s no cache partition, which will put all cached data in one place.
In theory, this looks pretty good, because the system should do all the work for you, when there’s need to free up disk space. But in practice, it might not function as flawless as Google imagines it.
Clear cache for each app individually
Although the option to bulk clear your cached data on your phone is missing, you can still clear cache for each app individually, if you really want. And here’s how to do that:
- Go to Settings > Storage
- Navigate to Other apps
- Now, tap on the app you want to clear cache for
- Tap on Clear Cache
Use a third party app
Additionally, if you really want to buck clear cache on your Android phone, you can always use some third-party app. Some of the most popular apps for these purposes are CCleaner and Clean Master. But be careful, because some apps might actually slow down your device, or remove something you don’t want to be removed. So, just think about if it’s worth installing a third-party app for something your system would do on its own anyway.
That’s about it. I hope you understand the whole cache clearing philosophy better now. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, let me know in the comments, or reach me out on twitter.
This is complete bull****. Straight up its unacceptable i done weekly cache clearing to keep phone memory clear of excess forever. The apps don’t do it as google wants and Googles expectations are unrealistic and they living in a fantasy land thinking they will do it. I have an s8 cause i am poor and can’t buy newest phones for over 1000 dollars. Reality is i need be able to quickly clear cache weekly or bi weekly and I do not have the free time to go through every app on my phone individually that actually would take over an… Read more »
There’s still a way to clear cache all at once, in recovery mode. Which is the way I prefer to do so as it formats your cache memory (cleaner slate). For instance, for my Moto Z2 play, I power down the phone, then I hit the power & volume down button simultaneously and hold it for like 2 seconds. This brings me to a boot option screen, I then use the volume keys to scroll to “Recovery Mode” and use the power button to select. After the little green android robot shows onto the center of the screen laying down… Read more »
I’ve been wondering for sometime why I couldn’t clear the cache in bulk for my installed apps and now I know the reason. I’m not a fan of cleaner apps, they do more harm than good so I’m just clearing the cache of each app individually, even though it’s more time consuming then before. Why do Google insist on making things more difficult by taking away useful features like being able to clear the cache with just one tap? It looks like being able to check my battery temperature has gone too so I’ve had to install an app to… Read more »We are all aware that monoblock phones are the thing of past. Touchscreen smartphones are the technology peak of this era and they keep advancing every day. Nowadays, they utilize so many features that they are much easier to compare to a PC than to its predecessors. However, there is so much we gained with touchscreen smartphones, but is there something we lost?
Reasonably, it’s quite a short list. But, endurance must be at the top of that list. Everybody heard for the cult surrounding Nokia 3310 and it’s peers. Those ones were simple but sturdy. You could hit the wall with the 3310 and be scared for the wall’s safety. Because the phone would easily prevail.
Yes, we have Gorilla Glass or Saphire but there is so much they can do. Luckily, the manufacturers saw the opportunity and took it one step forward. If you are a bit clumsy or keen to use your handheld device as a multifunctional weapon, we prepared a list of 7 Android phones that proved themselves as a worthy acquisition.
Top 7 indestructible Android smartphones
Samsung Galaxy S6 Active
Samsung emerged as one of the leaders in smartphone manufacturing. They offer both reliable budget phones and high-end flagship devices. But our focus today is less on functionality and more one sturdiness. And Galaxy Active series are at the top of the food chain in those regards.
First on the list is Galaxy S6 Active. The phone was introduced back in the 2015 and it managed to establish itself as a go-to flagship device with remarkable endurance. With Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and all kind of resistance features. Namely, it provides you with resistance to dust, salt, rain, solar radiation and thermal shocks. Additionally, it is water-resistant to 5 ft (1.5 m) and can withstand in water for 30 minutes. Moreover, you won’t need any external protection to preserve it from damage. Even though additional protection can always come in handy.
Except for the obvious sturdiness, this phone is an upgrade over already great Galaxy S6. The battery is amazing (non-removable, sadly). The plastic casing is much better for heat reduction in comparing to a metal casing. If the lack of fingerprint scanner and disputable aesthetics are not a game-breaker for you, this phone is a viable solution for you. At least it won’t crack in your back pocket.
Samsung Galaxy S7 Active
Same as its predecessor, Galaxy S7 Active was presented with better-known S7 and S7 Edge. And just same as S6 Active, it utilizes high-end features with amazing sturdiness. Basically, Samsung just took on the same concept and improved it for customers around the world.
The certified resistance measures stayed the same: you can toss it in 5 ft of water and take it can last up to 30 minutes. Corning Gorilla Screen 4 that has two layers instead of one. That way your phone is, as Samsung claims, much safer from possible screen damage. In addition, it is just as well all other hardy features, like resistance to dust, salt, and other exterior effects.
When it comes to performance, the gap with S7 and S7 Edge is reduced. The fingerprint scanner is available with Samsung Pay addition. The ‘Active’ button, specific for this Samsung series is even better utilized as a shortcut to selected apps. Moreover, the battery is a monster in its class. The drawbacks? Well, it is still larger and heavier than its standard counterparts. And, sadly, it doesn’t support VR.
HTC Bolt/ HTC 10 evo
Android devices. As the case is with all big manufacturers, they also vastly improved resistibility of their phones. HTC Bolt (US) and HTC 10 evo (worldwide) are the synonyms for sturdiness, style, and great performance. Both models were introduced in November of 2016 and they are almost the same. The most noticeable difference is the presence of a 3.5 mm audio jack on Bolt, that is not available on HTC 10 evo.
Both devices are heavily rugged with Corning Gorilla Screen 5 (last generation) and full-metal unibody cases. That makes these phones crash-prove in most of the situations. Additionally, the phones are highly watering resistible. You can place them in the 1-meter deep water for up to 30 minutes. All of the standard protection is there so the dust and exterior effects shouldn’t cause any problems.
Performance-wise this dynamic duo is in the elite league with brilliant, stylish design and amazing screen and camera. In all manners, it is similar to other flagship models.
Motorola DROID Turbo 2
Motorola Droid Turbo 2 is the device with one of the most resistant displays you can think of. It is practically indestructible and fully shatterproof. Motorola presented this phone back in 2015 and, even though it is not a novelty anymore, it is still a viable option. If not for any other reason, then because of its sturdiness.
As we already mentioned, with this device Motorola implemented special Moto ShatterShield. The display is protected with 5 layers. Every layer has its purpose and all of them work in one favor – to protect your display from any damage. There are multiple tests online with different torture methods. The Droid prevails most of the time, only failing in ultimate tests. Since those are extreme conditions, and uncountable for the everyday use, the phone should do just fine.
Moreover, the screens endurance is not the sole good thing about Droid Turbo 2. The performs well and it is planned for an upgrade to Nougat 7.0. That should tell you enough about its hardware capabilities. Additionally, the 21 MP camera is one of the best in the market.
Toughpad FZ-N1
First 4 phones we listed are quite similar with others in their category. They are just enhanced for better protection. Next phone in our list is not created for everyday use, nor for everyday customers. It is Panasonic’s answer to a narrow but demanding market: specific work surroundings. This phone (or more tablet, on which Panasonic insists) is 3-in-1:
Jokes aside, the main use of this amazing device, besides standard smartphone features, is a utilization of well-placed barcode reader. So, its preferred surroundings are warehouses. Nevertheless, since the hardware-wise Toughpad is not remarkable, it’s tough (you would expect that from TOUGHpad) and packs a battery with amazing 6200 mAh.
The phone is covered with the hard rubber casing that will prevent damage from falls or the dust, with water resistance up to 4 meters for 30 minutes. The main difference between this and other similar devices is battery life. Toughpad offers the optional battery with 6200 mAh that can make the phone running for days. But, it is hard to imagine using this phone anywhere but for work.
Sonim XP7
We will continue in the same manner. Sonim XP7 is another android-powered rugged device worth acquiring for professional use. The phone, as you would expect, isn’t feature packed as some standard smartphones. Sonim is a company known for reliable solutions in ultra-rugged category and XP7 is their latest addition.
What differentiates it from it peers is small size. That makes it much better for everyday use. But, don’t let the size trick you into thinking that XP7 is not hardy. It is as tough as nails. The main protection for the phone is resistant rubber armor and improved Gorilla Glass 2. That makes this phone completely resistant to falls from formidable heights, dust, moderate heat and other hazardous environmental effects. You can run it over with truck and place in 5 ft deep water for 30 minutes. It will work like a charm, regardless.
Even though it is running on stock KitKat 4.4.2, the phone is quite stable with rare bugs that occur from time to time. The distinctive features are an antenna-like speaker that brings amazing sound and battery with great
CAT S60
What is your first association when someone mentions rugged phones for extreme conditions? Ours is Caterpillar. The company that is one of the leaders in creating sturdy heavy machinery and clothes, is more than few years present in technology innovations. And their go-to device must be the latest addition, CAT S60.
With all Android phones, you can find certain similarities but S60 is a category on its own. In the specific niche. Namely, the phone is made to last whatever the conditions. It can last in 16 ft ( 5 meters) deep water for up to an hour. It is completely protected from falling or pressuring. Additionally, the dust, dirt, shock and other hazardous exterior effects can’t touch it. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4. Both main (13 MP) and front (5 MP) camera can be used underwater for both selfies and adventuristic photos of the sea world.
Hardware-wise, S60 is not known for amazing configuration. However, even though the processor is underpowered and the display is not remarkable, it should work out just fine for most of the users. The most distinctive feature of S60 is thermal imaging. This is the first device that implements thermal vision in camera.
This phone is not comparable to most of the Android devices, but it has its specific features and is designed for specific use. To be fair, this device is pricey and you can find affordable phones with better specs. However, if your professional environment demands endurable phone or you are an extreme sports enthusiast, S60 will serve you good.
Conclusion
This was our list of indestructible phones. You ‘ll see that few of them are for everyday use and others for specific conditions. But all of them share manufacturers idea to give their costumers enhanced protection over standard models. Do you have some additions to our list? Tell us in the comments.One of the earliest problems of the Galaxy S8 is the LED light notification problem. This has been a widespread problem, as various forums across the internet are still flooded with various complaints by users.
If you’re still experiencing LED light bugs on your brand new Samsung Galaxy S8, you’ve come to the right place. We’re going to discuss the issue here, and look for potential workarounds for this annoying issue.
There are a few workarounds you can try to fix the S8 LED light problem:
Solution 1 – Install updates
As I already mentioned, this problem hit the Galaxy S8 community by storm in May this year. Users were desperate, and there was no confirmed solution on sigth.
Some time after that, users have started reporting that the issue gets resolved after updating the phone. Which means Samsung acknowledged the problem, and released the proper patch.
So, head over to Settigns > About, and update the phone. If the update is available, it will get installed on your computer, and (hopefully) the LED light bug will be resolved.
On the other hand, if the issue is still present after installing all updates, move on to another solution.
Solution 2 – Update apps
There’s also a chance some of your apps are simply incompatiblile with this feature. If that’s the case, there’s really nothing you can do. But wait for the app developer to release an update that will make the app compatible with S8’s LED light feature.
RELATED: How to change stack up clock format on Samsung Galaxy S8 lock screen
So, go to the Google Play Store or Samsung Store, and make sure all your apps are up to date. If developers found a way to resolve this irregularity, you’ll surely receive the fix through updates.
Solution 3 – Change the notification sound
In some cases, there’s no bug or issue at all. It’s just how Android and Samsung’s LED light work together. Namely, many people don’t know that LED notifications actually require sound to work. So, if your phone is set to silent, or notifications for a certain app are set to silent, your phone simply won’t get flashy.
So, the obvious solution in this case is to simply turn on the notification sound for the select app, and LED light should be working again.
To turn on the notification sound, do the following:
- Go to Settings
- Now, head over to Apps & notifications > Notifications > Notifications
- Now, find the app you want to customize and tap it
- Toggle Allow sound on
Solution 4 – Clear app cache and data
We’ll finsih with one general solution. A few users suggested on the forums that simple clearing of the app cache and data resolves the problem with LED light. So, if none of the solutions from above got the job done, you can try and clear app cache and data of the app that gives you problems.
That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you with the LED light problem. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, let us know in the comments below.Samsung instantly got itself into a lot of trouble in the US. Firstly, their premium flagships, Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, at last, received an OS upgrade after numerous postponements. Secondly, the long awaited Nougat upgrade is so full of issues, like we aren’t talking about the smartphone manufacturer giant and leader in many fields.
A lot of users reported various issues, starting with the ordinary glitches and leading to the completely disappointing deal-breaking havoc of the OS. For that purpose, we prepared a roundup of the most-reported issues so you can inform yourself about the newly appointed release. If you haven’t installed it yet, think twice before you do. On the other hand, if you already did, all you can do is wait for the upcoming patches or try some alternative workarounds. In both cases, check the list below.
Camera issue
Let’s start with the camera issues. Samsung Galaxy flagships are known for great cameras and remarkable support software. Now, after the update, the camera just isn’t the same. We are talking about underperformance, crashes, and unresponsive settings. This is what one user experienced:
”After my 7.0 update to Galaxy S7, the camera has no settings. And is shooting 352 x 480, which I can’t change. When I tap on the camera settings icon gear, the app stops. And no settings appear. Is there a fix for this, or am I stuck with no camera until the next update?”
This allegedly can be fixed by resetting camera app or restoring factory settings. Sadly, we are sure that this isn’t an isolated issue and that many users have similar or even same issues with the native Camera app.
Screen rotation issue
Another problem for some users is related to the Screen rotation feature. Namely, after the update, the screen rotation was automatically disabled. To make things worse, the standard option to toggle screen rotation on/off is missing, as well. One user expressed this matter well:
‘‘Since the recent big verizon android update, screen rotation on my phone no longer works properly. In games, which manually control screen rotation, it is still working, but it does not work for regular apps like the browser.
I went into Settings > Display and there is *no* option to enable/disable screen rotation. There used to be an option, but since the update, it is gone.”
Other users referred to Screen rotation in the Notification panel within Quick Settings. But that doesn’t change the fact that the settings are awkwardly changed in the Nougat update.
Wi-Fi issue
Another burning issue that surfaced after the update is related to Wi-Fi. If some other minor issues can be overlooked, this is a major problem for all users that have experienced it. To be precise, the Wi-Fi icon in the Notification area is grayish and the phone is unable to connect. This user shared his thoughts on the subject.
”I am no longer able to enable WIFI on my samsung S7, it is greyed out and it just says ‘turning on’, I updated the phone, did a factory reset also reset and clear devices on my router. And lastly also did a reset network settings on the phone. I am running out of data and the phone wont enable wifi.. any help? thanks !”
As you can conclude by yourself, this user tried all of the general fixes but to no avail. An epic smartphone without connection is unusable. We hope that the problem will be addressed timely.
Notification issue
While we’re at grave problems, the notification issues are well mentioned in a few forums related to Samsung products. After the update, the notification alerts are not working as intended for various apps. It seems that it’s worse with third-party apps, but even the native messaging is impacted by this bug. One user shared his troubles with notification alerts on Samsung Galaxy S7.
”After updating to android 7 on my S7 Edge, notifications have been extremely flaky. Mostly with twitter. I’m randomly getting these:
1) Normal notification sound
2) Extremely short vibration that’s unnoticeable unless the phone is in my hand
3) On screen notification but no sound
4) Nothing at all
I’ve tried turning it on and off, disabling and re-enabling notifications, reinstalling apps. Nothing helps.
Anyone have any ideas?”
Boot Loop issue
When it comes to a pressing matter, boot loop is at the top of the list. Yes, this problem may not be related to the Nougat update for some users, but, on the other hand, most of the boot loops are related to an OS glitch of some kind. A user called Leslj15 presented this issue concisely.
”Reboot won’t stop. Started at 10pm last night. Can not even turn phone off.”
Some folks are referring to power or overheating issues. But, we think that this kind of problem is strictly software-related. And the only solution is to take your device for a repair.
Advanced Calling issue
Advanced Calling is an interesting premium feature that allows you to perform phone calls by using Wi-Fi. Additionally, that way all of your calls (both Voice and Video calls) are in High Definition for a better experience. In order to use it, you’ll need an adequate device like Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge and carrier support. But, for some users, this feature is disabled and can’t be enabled after the update. Clare described her problems in detail.
”I’m trying to activate advanced calling on my s7 with Android 7.0. I have HDVoice on my account.When I go to Settings/Advanced Calling the Activate Advanced Calling is grayed out. In Advanced Calling I turned on HD Voice & Video Calling. In Wi-fi Calling I turned it to On and set my emergency address bu Still Activate Advanced Calling is gray.
I have wifi speeds in my house of 115.88 down and 3.22 upload so I don’t think that’s the issue.
Any suggestions on getting this to work?
thanks,
Clare”
Since the external culprits are removed from the equation, this issue is most certainly related to a Nougat on S7.
LED light issues
Besides the standard sound notifications, it seems that the LED lights are also affected with the latest update. For some users, the problem is strictly limited to Gmail notifications, while others are completely out of LED indicators for all other apps. This is how one user laid out his distress with this matter.
”After the Nougat upgrade that just happened a few days ago, the LED light on my phone no longer flashes when I get a text message. It will flash just one time as soon as I get a text but only if I happen to be looking right at the phone as soon as it comes through, which is hardly never. Afterwards, nothing. I rely on the flashing light to see if I have a message because I can’t always keep my phone right next to me. Also, after the upgrade, if I get a missed call, it flashes green and it used to flash blue so I could tell if I missed a call or had a text. I was COMPLETELY happy with the phone before the upgrade. My motto is, if it’s not broke, don’t fix it…”
So, if we get it right, this user not only have an issue with LED indicator, but he is not welcoming changes related to it, as well. We hope, at least for the first part, that this problem is getting fixed soon.
Fingerprint scanner issue
While we are at peripheral device features, the fingerprint scanner wasn’t spared, as well. Namely, the fingerprint sensor on S7 or S7 Edge is ineffective after the update to Nougat. At least, for some users. This is what one user experienced with a fingerprint scanner on S7 Edge.
”After setting up the pin an error message appears. I have already cleared cache in the fingerprint app , and I have tried a hard reset. It has worked perfect since I bought phone and after the update it is no longer working. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.”
As you can see, this is most certainly related to the latest update. We’ll keep you informed of the changes and fixes, but, at the moment there’s no a viable solution for this problem.
Fonts color issue
Users are also having a lot of problems with the new fonts in the notification area and SMS. Namely, they are saying that the settings and features are not as visible as before while the messages font is hard to read under the sunlight. This is what one individual who owns S7 had to say about it.
”And the thing that really annoys me the most is that no matter theme you use, there are certain parts of the text display that is completely blended into the background color. So you can’t read anything!!!!! When you turn on your Bluetooth, you can’t tell what devices are available. When you view a contact, it’s extremely hard to tell what number belongs where. The number and the name of the number assigned to it (example – ‘mobile’), can’t be read. So it’s sooo hard to actually tell what you are doing on your phone.”
Instead of the advancement, this seems like the step back from the well-designed Samsung user interface.
Speaker issues
Audio issues related to the speakers on Samsung flagships are not a novelty. However, this seems to be an annoyance specific for Nougat update. Some users reported that they are hearing distorted, the metallic sound coming out of the speaker. This user described his issue related to a speaker sound.
”I have the same issue. After recieving the update I noticed that the audio coming from the phone speaker (not loud speaker) is now have a metalic rambling tone while calling or talking to someone. But if someone calls me, or I use speaker, the metalic rambling ton is gone. Messenger calls are normal with no metalic tone.”
Some users managed to fix this issue temporarily by disabling some in-call features or decreasing the volume. But, it’s certainly something that Samsung needs to take into the consideration.
Missed Calls list
Additionally, after the update, some users have lost the bubble badges showing the number of missed calls. You’re still able to find the detailed listing in the call log, but this notification feature was quite handy for most of the users. Since it’s not officially excluded from Nougat, all the signs lead to the bug that somehow removed these badges. This is what one worried user had to say about it.
”Ever since the android 7.0 update in March, I no longer get the little number badge showing the number of missed calls next to the phone icon. This was very useful and I would like to get it back. I still get the one for voice mails so why not missed calls? Every time you have an update something always gets broke. I can’t stand it.”
We hope they’ll get it back. Is this supposed to be an upgrade or what?
Battery Issues
In case you’ve experienced drastic battery life drops after the update, don’t think that you are alone. A lot of users around the web reported a huge battery drains after upgrading to Nougat. To make the things even worse, the tech support claims that this will be fixed after the few days of device usage. When the device ‘gets used to’ a new system. Sadly, only a new patch or the factory reset can fix that. One user summarized his experience after the update.
”I have had HORRIBLE battery life after Updating to Nougat! My phone just dropped 23% in one hour! Has anyone found any fixes for this besides a Factory Reset? I have already cleared my cache.’‘
This is the grave problem for all of the users since they are deprived of everyday battery life they have been used to.
Wrap-up
That should conclude it. Have in mind that some of the issues are dependable on your carrier and their respective services. Don’t forget to send them a ticket and ask for a resolution.
Of course, we conducted a thorough research but probably missed something. So, if you have any additional issues we forgot or have any questions regarding the compiled list, feel free to tell us in the comments below. Or reach us out on Twitter
My problem is with messaging. I always gave my favorite contacts special notification tones for messaging (not ringtones just text messages) The special tones were all wiped out and they all reverted to the default tone. I tried to edit my contacts, but it looks like there is no way to edit the messaging notification tone on each contact.
I had the misfortune of the boot loop after trying to update my S7. Phone overheating and unresponsive. Vodafone store unable to fix, sent back to Samsung, unable to fix. Luckily phone still in warranty so now have brand new phone. My question is another software update has come through, do I update or not?
The Quick Settings option hasn’t helped me. Even when in “auto rotate,” my phone does not rotate orientation.We all remember that massively hyped battery issue with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Instead of a few isolated cases, this took a remarkable attention since it had been reported all around the world.
Of course, when a few elite aero companies prohibit the specific device from going onboard, you know that’s a serious matter. People were kind of joking about it, the internet went crazy, and Samsung withdrew the Note 7. Later on, similar cases occurred with S7. Luckily, not that frequent.
Exploding phones are not a novelty but, but the issue waited for recognition until 2016. Few distinct cases here and there were not enough until it becomes a dangerous trend that spreads all around the world. Now, many people would say that the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is the main culprit for this, but faulty exploding batteries are one of the not so sublime ways to remind us that manufacturers are sometimes moving too fast with hardware advancements.
How is that so? Well, the Lithium-ion batteries are not up to the task. The modern devices are the way too challenging for them. It’s just a simple fact. We present you 4 main reasons for this peculiar doings. Stay tuned.
How a smartphone transforms in DIY bomb with few easy steps
Faulty batteries that got approved
Essentially, we live in the consumeristic society that is quite demanding. We want all and we want it now. Manufacturers response to the society needs is creating quantity over quality. To speed up the process, various companies use a large variety of sub-companies production until the final product is ready for the market.
Smartphones are not excluded. So, parts for the infamous Note 7 are coming from different hardware producers around the world. Yes, they do the testing but that can’t be as thorough as they should be because of deadlines.
Long story short, the Samsung may get a faulty, untested batteries. The separators that are there to prevent collision of electrolytes in the battery are the most probable cause of fire and explosion. To be on point, they have to be rather resistant. According to Samsung that was the main reason for exploding Note 7. Additionally, only o,1% of sold devices have that issue. But the reliability questioned and damage has been done.
Let’s make underpowered battery to run overdemanding device
Lithium-ion batteries are already exhausted. It’s a technology that can’t withstand demanding hardware. And flagship models are quite demanding, to say the least. As the scientists in the matter stated, the Li-ion batteries can’t be improved. The new technology solution is needed to overcome the power consumption and life of the battery.
Additionally, why not make it charge for 20 minutes instead of hours
Charging your battery is an unwilling process. It requires you to be stationary and thus renders your use to one place. We like to move a lot and exploit the mobility of the phone. Charging is necessary but immensely dull. And those witty manufacturers have a brilliant idea to overcome hours of charging process.
Let’s charge them faster. Fast charge feature is great for obvious reasons but it will substantially lower the battery life expectancy. Over time, that leads to a faster discharging and possible issues with the battery. Is this the cause for the battery to burst into flames? Not on its own. But, once you combine overheating, shock and faulty battery, everything is possible.
At the end, maybe just a little higher voltage for ultimate results
We already mentioned that battery Li-ion batteries are hard to improve. One of the ways certain producers do is increasing voltage. That is done by adding other conductors besides lithium. That can improve their charging capacity but will result in additional instability.
Have in mind that stability is one of those features that are too often overlooked. There are some mentions of more stable batteries but they’ll probably lack the battery life. In our opinion, it is much better to prevent the catastrophe than taking unnecessary risks.
The Bottom Line
We don’t want to exclude consumers responsibility in the matter. By using your phone with care, you lower the chance of battery issues. Nevertheless, the production had to find an alternative energy solution in the upcoming years. Until then, we will use Li-ion batteries and challenge them effortlessly. And if the battery has even the slightest change, replace it for your sake.
If you have any question or suggestions, please tell us in the comments. We’ll be thankful.8 GB? RAM? On a mobile phone? You know, that thing that we used for the simple communication and those nifty short messages 15 years ago. And not so long ago skeptics used to say that 3 GB of RAM is enough for your desktop computer. What will those folks say to this? Is there a real need for this massive hardware upgrade or the smartphone manufacturers are in any kind of creative block?
Maybe the race they are all partaking on yearly base has taken a toll on them. So, in order to differentiate the upcoming flagships from their already amazing predecessors, they had to make a bold move. Or is it a necessity, a way to response to demanding software in the upcoming years?
It is a Shakespearean doubt, indeed. So today, we will try and give our humble opinion. An insight if you want, and answer to this question:
Is the 8 GB RAM a need or a useless overkill?
PROS
Well, we all can agree that these massive hardware updates have ambiguous nature. They can be both improvement and disadvantage. Let us start with the positive features this change will enable.
More is often better in tech world
First and foremost, the software developers will get more working space. With certain constraints they had, software coding was, occasionally, an overdemanding task. The task many of them are not up to. We all know how the Facebook app is subpar in all kind of ways. Resources hogging, instability, crashes, slow loading speeds, you name it. And instead of remodeling the app itself, they somehow managed to make it worse with every new update.
Have in mind that we are talking about a giant in its niche, world leader, and not an individual developer coding in his basement with limited funds. RAM upgrade will let them concentrate more on the performance without hardware constraints. This will speed up the software evolution with the special emphasis on innovative individuals and their impact in the app market.
In case of demanding advancements: Insert RAM
In addition, there are a lot of new technologies that are heavily hardware-dependent. First thing that crosses our mind is Virtual Reality and all advanced improvements it can utilize. Since this is still a developing technology only the sky is a boundary for its final reach. In 2017 we can expect a lot of VR/AR presence in the gaming industry and that should impact all systems, even the handheld devices.
Superbook is an interesting project by Sentio developing studio. Essentially, it can change the way we combine our devices for better use and more optimized performance.
Superbook is a small laptop shell that connects with your smartphone with cable. It completely uses phones software to run its system. The phone provides the brain while the laptop shell brings out the muscles to this dynamic duo. Since this is a quite affordable project, we will probably see a lot of alternative solutions from the third-party developers like Ubuntu, Lineage, or Remix. In addition, Motorola is still working on OneCompute Moto with similar characteristics.
At the end, the Android phones may need more power to fully utilize those novelty combo features. In that case, these RAM upgrade is a foreseeing of the producers.
CONS
And now, we are moving on to the dark side of this dispute. It always takes less effort to be negative about changes, but this may prove harder than it sounds.
Heavy hardware upgrade = poorly optimized software
We are all aware of the benefits for developers. They’ll have more freedom and can prioritize the performance over the RAM consumption. But, evidently, there are drawbacks that can and will impact the apps when the upgrade occurs. As the past has shown us on numerous occasions, the software optimization falls short where the hardware excels. This is just the case with vast of Android apps. The devs become careless, sloppy and tend to present unfinished products and patch them later.
For both device manufacturers and them, this seems like a win/win scenario. However, the customers are the ones that lose. Especially the ones that can’t afford to pay 700$ or even more for a smartphone. The best possible example is PC gaming. Namely, the modern games rely more on hardware than on developing structure. That way we get a game with more demanding requirements but the same or even lower quality than the 5-year-old titles. And that is just wrong.
That can be truly an issue with the smartphones, too. The availability of apps will be gradually reduced for the ones with budget phones.
But, everything runs smooth on 3 GB!
Eventually, we’ll have to ask ourselves is there the software appropriate for 8 GB of RAM? In a few years, probably. But at the moment 3 GB of RAM is quite sufficient for all the apps. Even for the most demanding, HD graphic intensive games. Then why to fix what isn’t broken? Instead of improvement, that can lead to a more bloatware and lack of optimization.
The battery, on the other hand, is something worth upgrading. We already talked about Li-Ion batteries as the underwhelming technology that needs to change. Why not address this issue rather than upgrading on already sufficient RAM memory? You won’t use your phone for complex demanding operations like some workstation PC. On the other hand, better battery life is an enormous upgrade to all handheld devices.
Additionally, with Nougat, Android introduced renewed ART (Android Runtime) feature called Just-In-Time (JIT). With this novelty smartphone boots faster, require less storage space, update faster and, eventually, optimize apps RAM consuming. So, one more reason to look at the 8 GB RAM like an overkill.
CONCLUSION
At the end, maybe the manufacturers know something we don’t and this is a reasonable move. Or they are just justifying the high prices by adding the cheapest hardware upgrades. Opinions are divided and the time will show who was right. We hope that we managed to vividly present both points of view on the subject.
What is your standpoint? Please share it with is in the comments section.Android 8 Oreo is far from a revolutionary OS that brings your wildest fantasies about future tech to life. In fact, Google focuses on the back-end here. Most changes were made under the hood, so an average user coming from Android Nougat can barely see the difference.
That’s why users who care about their phones debate about some ‘less important’ features way more than they would if there were some game-changers involved.
A particular feature that people usually complain about is the Adaptive Icons. In fact, I’ve barely seen a positive review of this feature. This tells us one thing. Android Oreo users are divided into two groups – those who hate Adaptive Icons and those who simply don’t care enough to talk about them.
Since the second group probably won’t even bother to search for this article, it’s for all of you who have a feud with Adaptive Icons in Android Oreo. For all of you who are frustrated for being trapped with Adaptive Icons and don’t really get why it has to be that way.
We’ll discuss it all here.
Why are Adaptive Icons there in the first place?
Unlike iOS, where Apple pretty much controls the whole ecosystem, Android (being an open source OS) gives each member of its family more liberties. Individually, that’s a great thing. But it may not be beneficial for the greater good.
Developers have the freedom to polish every single aspect of their apps to smallest details. Both in terms of aesthetics and functionality. But we’ll focus on the aesthetics here. Subjectively looking, even though a single app’s icon looks great, it may not fit in with the rest of the icons, giving your home screen an awkward uniquely biased look.
These inconsistencies usually irritate people. In fact, people have been complaining about this since the earliest days of Android. And the fact that different phones all have their own custom ROM brings even more inequality.
So, Google decided to normalize things by trying to satisfy everyone’s taste. That’s how the idea of the Adaptive Icons was born. In theory, the whole plan looks legit and doable. But the result we got with Android Oreo speaks differently.
What are Adaptive Icons
system feature that should make third-party apps’ icons in-line with default icons provided by OEM.
I won’t dig into technical details too much here, so here’s how Google explainsAdaptive Icons:
“Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduces adaptive launcher icons, which can display a variety of shapes across different device models. For example, an adaptive launcher icon can display a circular shape on one OEM device, and display a squircle on another device. Each device OEM provides a mask, which the system then uses to render all adaptive icons with the same shape. Adaptive launcher icons are also used in shortcuts, the Settings app, sharing dialogs, and the overview screen.”
In order to follow Google’s rules of Adaptive Icons developers have to submit their icons in two layers, a transparent foreground layer and a solid background layer. As explained above, the launcher then cuts the layers into a shape specified by OEM.
As the OS uses an already provided mask to shape the icons automatically, there’s nothing you can do about it. Even though you’re not satisfied with the outcome. It’s just how the system works.
Now you know that as long as you’re using Android Oreo, Adaptive Icons will be there. You can’t simply erase them from your phone in any way. But, there’s a way to at least change the appearance of Adaptive Icons on your phone.
Obviously, this can’t be done using your stock launcher, but if you really can’t stand the current look of Adaptive Icons on your phone, there’s a third-party solution.
Use Nova Launcher
Nova Launcher is arguably the most popular third-party launcher for Android. Mostly because of its wealth of customization features. This includes the ability to change the shape of Adaptive Icons, which was introduced last year.
So, if you want to at least do something about your ugly adaptive icons, you can change their shape. I know it’s not what you’re looking for, but it gives you some customization freedom. Here’s how to change Adaptive Icons in Nova Launcher:
- Open Nova Launcher Settings.
- Go to Look & Feel > Adaptive Icons.
- Choose the preffered shape of Adaptive Icons.
That’s about it. It is a bare minimum, but at least you’re able to adjust the icons to a more likable shape. That’s better than not being able to do anything about Adaptive Icons at all.
As it appears, Google still hasn’t solved the problem with unbiased icons on various Android phones. But we have another Android version ahead of us. As we still don’t know what will the new version bring, we can only hope Google will introduce a more viable solution for icons on your Home screen. Hopefully a better one.
What do you think about Adaptive Icons in Android Oreo and the way they function? Let us know in the comments below.
I absolutely hate this feature! Thank you Google, for shoving it down or throats (i guess you did learn something from Apple) and making every Android device look like a cheap iPhone ripoff.
I hate adaptive icons. Here’s why: The purpose of an icon is something visual for your brain to easily identify amongst a bunch of other icons. The brain has a couple things to work with: Shape and color. Making every icon have the same outline shape essentially cuts the information available in half, making it take much more effort to find the one icon you’re looking for amongst many. It’s an increased cognitive load to have every icon have the same shape, and it goes against the very purpose of icons.
Exactly. But the information is cut even more! The actual icon itself is much smaller – doesn’t usually even fill the circle, so that in difficult times – outside, bright sun, forgot glasses, – it gets even more difficult to find the icon you are looking for.One of the main traits of modern day society is unstoppable technological progress. Yes, it brought many good things in everyday life, but, on the other hand, there are plenty of disadvantages. Lack of individuality, lack of a self-improvement motivation or just common positive thought about yourself and your place in this fast paced world.
Is there any way to use technology to achieve the optimistic point of view? Yes, indeed, there is. Today, we prepared for you some apps. Apps that will mediate between your Android device and your aspiration to change something, improve yourself or just get a different perspective.
You should most definitely give it a try. Even if you procrastinate for ages, it’ll at least bring the smile on your face.

If you have some other motivation boosting apps, please be free to tell us in the comment section.Even though Android P (Peppermint is our best guess at the moment) is still in the development phase, Oreo is still the latest Android iteration. When it came out, it had some valuable additions but, seemingly, one of the most-promoted feature, PiP, is still having some issues.
Namely, a lot of Oreo 8.0 and 8.1 users are still experiencing various issues with Picture-in-picture mode. For that purpose, we prepared a list of solutions which should address the most common issues with the PiP mode. Make sure to check them out below.
Solution 1: Check the permission and compatibility
Firstly, let’s start with the prerequisites. Even though it got its share of hype when Oreo was introduced, PiP (Picture-in-Picture mode) isn’t all that special. Don’t get us wrong, we’re talking about more than a welcomed novelty, just there’s rather limited number of applications which support PiP. In order to play YouTube videos from the app (most common usage for this mode), you’ll need the YouTube Red subscription. Which isn’t an option for a lot of countries.
And that’s the main purpose of this app, in our humble opinion. Yes, you have other streaming services, but YouTube is probably what most users use to enjoy videos. So, the first thing you should do is to check the permissions and compatibility of the given app before we move to additional steps. The supported first-party apps are YouTube (with Red subscription), Chrome, Duo, and Maps.
The Picture-in-Picture mode has its own option within the Settings, so make sure that the compatible apps are enabled. Here’s how to do it in a few steps:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Picture-in-picture.
- Make sure all compatible apps from the list are enabled.
- Restart your device and give it another try.
Solution 2: Clear app’s cache
Another viable step you should take when addressing any app issues is clearing cache. After some time of extensive use, apps tend to pile up the cached data in order to speed up the loading process.
Since clearing cache in Android Oreo is different than in other versions of the OS, you can learn more about it in this article.
Solution 3: Update the device and apps
Making sure that all your apps and the device’s firmware are up to date is paramount. In Developer Previews of Oreo, a lot of apps had issues. However, we’re long past these issues since the final stable version fixed most of the issues. On the other hand, certain supported third-party apps are still revisited and patched on regular basis.
When it comes to device’s firmware, making sure that you have all patches should be of utmost importance. Most of the updates are provided in the automatized manner, but it won’t hurt to check for updates manually. In addition, make sure that the affected app isn’t in the Beta-testing variation. Those are buggy and unreliable.
And, these instructions are for updating apps over Play Store:
- Open Play Store.
- Tap on the hamburger menu and choose “My apps & games”.
- Check for updates and update all relevant apps.
Solution 4: Play YouTube via Chrome
Finally, we can’t wrap this app without offering a simple workaround for users that can’t (or won’t) obtain the YouTube Red subscription. You can still stream YouTube videos on your Android and use a nifty PiP mode.
Just, instead of using the YouTube app itself, you can utilize Chrome’s Desktop mode and play any video in the Picture-in-Picture mode. Here’s how to do it in a few simple steps:
- Open Chrome.
- Open YouTube clip you want to play and click on the 3-dot menu in the top right corner.
- Check the Desktop site box.
- Once you’ve done that, expand a video to full screen and click on the Home button.
- That’s it. Now you should be able to adjust position and control playback as you wish.
That’s a wrap. Don’t forget to share additional solutions or ask questions about the presented ones. You can do so in the comments section below.
I’m also having the same problem with my note 9 Samsung. I disabled anything that supports picture-in-picture, but it did only a little change. PLEASE ANDROID FIX THIS!!!!
My phone is Nokia 3.1. It uses android oreo 8.1. I have an issue with picture in picture mode in most apps supported this mode like chrome, firefox, youtube. It switchs from full screen to picture in picture mode without touching screen or pressing any button like home or any others. It’s really frustrated because it keeps change to picture in picture mode without any of my intention. I try to reinstall several times these apps and soft restart my phone but it didn’t work. I end up turning off this feature because it starts inconvient and trouble. And more… Read more »We tend to use the internet more on our smartphones than we do on our computers, that’s a fact. We use our phones for browsing the web, watching YouTube videos, chatting, updating our social profiles, and more.
However, one of the most common problems every Android user faces is the problem with the WiFi connection. There’s nothing more annoying than your WiFi stopping working when you need it, but unfortunately, that happens from time to time.
So in this article, we’re going to explore what can cause the WiFi connection to stop working on your Android device, and what are the possible ways to solve this serious issue.
How to solve WiFi connection problems on Android
Solution 1 – Reconnect to a WiFi network
As banal as it might sound, simply reconnecting to your current WiFi network can get the problem solved. There are various factors that can break the connection between your phone and the WiFi network, and the solution in most cases is to simply re-establish the connection.
So, go to WiFi settings on your Android phone, disconnect from the network you’re currently connected to, and connect again. If our theory was correct, everything should work fine this time, if not, try some of the solutions listed below.
Solution 2 – Check your router settings
In some occasions, the problem can occur because of your Wi-Fi router. If multiple devices are connected to the same wireless network, that can cause conflict and lead on to unstable connection. Additionally, you can tweak router settings.
Firstly, hook up your PC and router with LAN cable. Every internet provider has a specific way of entering router settings so you can inform before you start. Once you are logged in, take a good look at WLAN tab and make sure that it is enabled.
Solution 3 – Make sure you’re using a 2.4 GHz band
There are 2 main frequency bands used on Android Wi-Fi: 2.4 GHz or 5Ghz. The one you want to setup is 2.4 GHz because it has slower but longer range and will suit you better. To do so, follow the instructions:
- Go to Settings.
- Select Wi-Fi.
- Tap three dots icon.
- Choose Advanced.
- Tap Wi-Fi Frequency Band.
- Select 2.4 GHz.
This should repair broken connection and eventually secure stable one.
Solution 4 – Turn off Data Connection and Bluetooth
By disabling them, your device should connect with ease to the desired network.
Solution 5 – Turn off WiFi optimization
Wi-Fi Optimization is an option implemented in Android device with the task to optimize Wi-Fi usage in order to prolong battery life. Hefty usage of Wi-Fi will work against battery life but this option can suppress connection or make it unstable with certain apps. Our advice is to disable it. To do so, follow the instructions:
- Go to Settings.
- Select Wi-Fi.
- Tap three dots icon.
- Choose Advanced.
- In the bottom, you ‘ll find Wi-Fi optimization
- Disable it.
Maybe it will hit your battery for few percentages, but the connection will work better.
The question that always rests at the end is the possible hardware malfunction. The Wi-Fi module may be a defect and the reason why you are unable to connect to a network. Try out different routers and restore the phone to factory settings. If the problem persists, be sure to take your phone for a diagnose and repair in trusted hands.
We wouldn’t advise you to try repairing it by yourself since you can lose your warranty and make it worse.
We hope that this was helpful and that you ‘ll manage to use your Wi-Fi again in no time. If you are heaving any other solutions for the problem, be sure to tell us about it in the comment section.
Hello,
I followed your instructions in solution 3 to a point then, their was no 2.4 band with button to find.
Solution 5 followed your instructions to find their was no wi fi optimization spot.
Why is this?
Thank youAndroid 10 brought a lot of minor improvements and a few nifty features that some OEMs already had on previous iterations of Android. One of those is Gesture Navigation that allows you to hide 3 navigation buttons from the bottom. However, it seems that Android 10 gesture navigation is not working for some users.
Table of contents:
- Check settings
- Remove third-party apps
- Use ADB command
- Update your device
- Stick to the stock launcher or use a 3rd-party app
How do I turn on gestures on Android 10?
Now, have in mind that some third-party launchers are not supported. So, if the problem occurs on the 3rd-party launcher, there are some steps below to help you out.
On the other hand, if gesture navigation is not working even on the stock launcher, we can recommend wiping the cache partition or resetting your device to factory settings.
Solution 1 – Check settings
The first thing to do is to ensure that Navigation Gestures are enabled in System Settings. By default, most OEMs will stick to a 3-button navigation at the bottom. So, you’ll need to enable gestures before using them.
Follow these instructions to enable Gestures Navigation on Android 10:
- Open Settings.
- Choose System.
- Select Gestures.
- Choose Gesture Navigation and configure the sensitivity.
Solution 2 – Wipe cache partition
Moving on. If you have any third-party gesture apps installed, make sure to uninstall them. If the issues persist and gesture navigation is still not working, we recommend wiping the cache partition. The problem might lie in the transition from Android 9 to Android 10, which is why it is recommended to reset the device to factory settings after a major update.
If you are not sure how to wipe cache partition from the Recovery menu, follow these steps:
- Power off your device.
- Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button.
- Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection.
Solution 3 – Use ADB command
For some reason, Google decided to limit the new Gesture Navigation to stock launchers. Which means that gestures won’t work with 3rd-party launchers. This is, supposedly, mitigated later for a few major launchers, like Nova and Action launcher.
Follow these steps to utilize the command in ADB and enable Gesture Navigation with 3rd-party launchers:
- Enable Developer Options. Navigate to Settings > System or About phone > tap 7 times on the Build number and enter PIN/password when prompted.
- In the Developer options menu, enable USB Debugging and all USB debugging-related features.
- Download and extract SDK Platform Tools for Android on your PC, here.
- Connect your smartphone to your PC and grant access to your PC when prompted. You should see that the USB Debugging mode is enabled in the Notification shade.
- On your PC, open the extracted SDK Tools folder. Hold Shift and then right-click on an empty area within the folder. Select the “Open PowerShell window here” from the contextual menu.
- Copy the line below, paste it in the PowerShell window, and press Enter: adb shell cmd overlay enable com.android.internal.systemui.navbar.gestural
- Have in mind that this procedure needs to be applied after every reboot.
Solution 4 – Update your device
Like every year, OEMs try to reduce the fragmentation and update their premium devices as soon as possible. Surprisingly, they tend to provide an OTA update for an unfinished and bug-riddled Android just for the sake of following forced timelines. And that has been an issue for some Samsung and Nokia users who got Android 10.
The “get the unfinished product, polish it later” approach is definitely something welcome for Beta testers, not end-users who want the stable OS on their daily drivers. Therefore, we suggest reporting the bug and keeping your device up to date.
On the other hand, make sure that your custom launcher is also up-to-date. Open Play Store > hamburger menu > My apps & games and ensure that the custom launcher is up to date.
Solution 5 – Stick to the stock launcher or use a 3rd-party app
If Android 10 Gesture Navigation is still not working on your device, consider choosing between gestures and custom launchers. Whatever is your priority. You can use a 3rd-party app to simulate stock Gesture Navigation without problems.
You might need to use ADB again to grant it necessary permissions but, in return, you get more customization and features.
Now, if Gesture Navigation won’t work even on the Android 10 stock launcher, the only remaining thing we can recommend is the factory reset.
Solution 6 – Reset the device to factory settings
As we already explained in the introduction, this article tackles two similar problems –Android 10 Gesture Navigation not working with custom launchers and Gesture Navigation not working at all. If you are bothered by the latter and previous steps haven’t addressed the issue, we recommend resetting the device to factory settings.
Follow these instructions to reset your Android 10-powered device to factory settings:
- Back up your data from the internal storage (photos can be saved to Google Photos, other media can be saved to an external storage or a PC).
- Navigate to Settings > System > Reset.
- Select Factory data reset.
- Follow instructions to reset your device to factory values.
With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and make sure to tell us if the issue is resolved. The comments section is just below.Multiplatform reminders are one of the most used options for the users of Android. Especially, if your work demands to organize your time and to keep track of different valuable errands. Both enterprises or personal users can find a lot of use for them.
Google Calendar is one of the most popular solutions for the majority of users, because of its great usability and performance. However, it doesn’t seem to be the case every time. One of the repeating issues is syncing of Google Calendar on Android devices.
This user from Google Products Forum reported the following problem:
‘‘Until two weeks ago, I had no problem with using my Google calendar on my Samsung Galaxy S6. However, my boss uses a shared calendar to update our schedules, and for two weeks now I am only able to access the updated version on my laptop. My phone continues to show only the oldest calendar. I have tried all of the “help” section suggestions for syncing problems, including clearing my calendar data. Nothing seems to be working. Help, please!”
Sometimes Google Calendar won’t sync at all, sometimes it stops syncing without any special reason. We found some solutions that might be helpful.
Update Google Calendar app
Besides checking your Wi-Fi connection, the main step is updating Google Calendar app. To do so follow this instruction:
- Go to Settings.
- Tap Applications or Application manager.
- Find Google Calendar app and open it.
- Select Update if available.
Unsync Google Calendar app temporarily
Maybe the problem lies in the misfunctioning of the all-around synchronization. This way you can reset it and, possibly make it work again. To do so, follow presented instructions:
- Select Settings.
- Open Accounts tab.
- Tap Google.
- Choose your account.
- Uncheck Calendar.
- Reset your phone.
- Follow the same path and check previously unchecked Calendar tab.
Remove and re-establish your Gmail account
You can also try to reset your Gmail account because sometimes the problem occurs with Gmail synchronization. To do that, follow the instruction below:
- Go to Settings.
- Tap Accounts.
- Select Google.
- Choose your account.
- Tap Remove account
- Follow the same path and sign again with your Gmail account.
Enable Calendar Storage
If this option is disabled, Google Calendar won’t sync or show any events. So, be sure it is enabled. To enable Calendar Storage, follow the instructions:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps or Application manager.
- In the top right corner tap More
- Open Show System
- Select Calendar Storage
- Tap Enable.
Clear Google Calendar data
Clearing Google Calendar data may help you with re-establishing synchronization. However, have in mind that this may erase some unsynced data. To Clear Google Calendar data, follow the steps below:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps or Application manager.
- In list of the apps installed, select Google Calendar
- Tap Clear Data and confirm.
- Restart your device.
Stop any other app that uses connection
Reset your device to factory settings
Last resort in any problem related to Android is factory settings reset. Some of the issues tend to stack up over time. To do the factory reset, follow these steps:
- Open Settings.
- Tap Backup and Reset.
- Backup your settings and data to Google servers via Google account.
- Select Factory Data Reset.
- Tap Reset Device.
- Choose Erase Everything.
We hope you’ll find this fix-list satisfying and helpful. Do you have any other solutions for the Google Calendar syncing problem? Please tell us in the comments.
This is a bit lengthy, but absolutely worked for me and took me only 5 days to come up with a bonafide solution where all others failed. Please take 5 minutes to read carefully as it took me almost 40 minutes to write this all out after 5 days of “problem-solving.” It may look like a lot, but it only takes 20-30 minutes to attempt. Since this worked for me, I posted this solution to the Google community as well. If it works for you, please share and leave comment. “My Calendar” Sync issues truly SOLVED!!

Yes, this is a little LONG, but I hope it helps when trying to sync pre-installed calendar apps with Galaxy S series phones. Don’t know if it’ll work w/ all, but it did PERFECTLY w/ mine. I had a Galaxy S3 & it began hanging up during calls & suddenly shutting off for no reason, etc. Had it for abt 5 yrs, so I figured it was time for a “new” phone. I found a Galaxy Stellar (I know, it’s older than the S3) well worth the $$ & covered under my cell contract. I was trying to sync the… Read more »
Use the app Copy My Data. MUST BE INSTALLED ON BOTH DEVICES TO WORK! Copies ALL Calendar info, Contacts, Photos, & 1 other thing (can’t remember) (has a list of the ‘categories’ ie Calendar, w/ a check box beside it). Check the box next to the info you want to copy (it goes MUCH quicker if you copy 1 @ a time). MUCH EASIER & QUICKER THAN ANYTHING ELSE I’VE TRIED! Good luck folks!!
Sorry – none of these things seemed to work. I have a Samsung Galaxy S6.
THANKS MAN!! Could not find a solution anywhere else. It was a power saving mode problem for me too
Turning off ‘Power saving mode’ on my phone (Note 8), worked for me
Problem is, I removed and re-established my google account, and voila, everything is there. Three weeks later, still having the same problem and actually missed a meeting because it didn’t show on my phone. I shouldn’t have to reinstall the account every week.Last year’s Pixel 4 event was a peculiar one. Many experts and users agree that Google didn’t exactly hit the jackpot with its new line of Pixel devices. The Pixel 4 and 4 XL don’t have the best battery in the industry, rock a questionable design, and preach Google’s stand that an ultra-wide camera lens is overrated.
To even the scales, Google also released a little something that most people will agree is a useful feature. A voice-recording app. Now, can one app make up for all the questionable decisions? That’s up to you to decide, and is not a topic of this article.
As you probably know, Google’s Recorder is exclusive to Pixel devices (except Pixel 1). And you can’t use it on any other Android phone. That’s a shame because the app is quite well-made and practical. And if they had a chance, I’m sure many users of non-Pixel devices would also consider using it.
But here’s the thing: using Google’s Recorder app on non-Pixel devices is actually possible! You just can’t install it the traditional way.
As it turns out, Google released an official APK file of the Recorder app, and it’s available for download for free. The only downside is that it’s not the latest version, but all the signature features (recording and transcribing) are there.
But that’s not all! Mishaal Rahman of XDA Developers modified the latest version of the app, and shared it with everyone. So, props to him and the whole XDA team for always breaking the barriers to ensure users can have the best possible experience using their Android phones.
How to download and install Recorder on your Android device
Long story short, in order to use the Recorder app on your phone, all you need to do is to download and install the APK.
However, there are still a few “requirements” you’ll have to meet in order to run the app without any problems. For example, the app doesn’t work on Xiaomi devices running MIUI 10 or MIUI 11, although there are reports of Recording working on Android One devices, like the Xiaomi MI A3.
- Google Pixel and Pixel XL running Android 10
- Huawei and Honor phones running EMUI 9 (Android 9 Pie) or EMUI 10 (Android 10)
- LG phones running LG UX 8.0 (Android 9 Pie)
- Motorola phones running Android 9 Pie
- Nokia phones running Android 9 Pie
- Samsung Galaxy phones running One UI 1.0/1.5 (Android 9 Pie) or One UI 2.0 (Android 10)
- Sony Xperia phones running Android 9 Pie or Android 10
- Any phone running a custom ROM based on AOSP Android 9 Pie or Android 10
The app partially functions (the recording works, but the app fails to transcribe speech) on the following devices:
- ASUS phones running ROG UI 2.0/ZenUI 6.0 (Android 9 Pie or Android 10)
- OPPO and Realme phones running ColorOS 6 (Android 9 Pie)
- OnePlus phones running OxygenOS 10 (Android 10)
As I mentioned above, you can download both an official or modified version of the app, and it shouldn’t cause you any problems as long as you’re using a phone from the list above.
Make sure to tell us about your experience using Google’s Recorder app on your phone. Do you have any problems with it? Or does it run as smooth as on a Pixel device? Let us know in the comments below.
oh…Google Assistant is probably the best AI-powered digital voice assistant out there. And with the largest market share due to obvious reasons (every Android 5+ device has it). However, some users reported a certain error informing them that Google Assistant is not available on this device. If you are among them, you can find the swift solution below.
Table of contents:
- Make sure Google Assistant is enabled
- Disable Bixby or alternative assistants
- Check Default app settings
- Clear cache and data from the Google app
- Uninstall updates from the Google app
- Leave Beta program
Why is Google Assistant not available on my device?
There are multiple reasons why users are getting this error when trying to use Google Assistant on their Android devices. Of course, there are some limitations considering device specs and overall Google Services support.
Here are the system requirements for Google Assistant:
- Android 5.0+ with at least 1.0GB of available memory or
- Android 6.0+ with at least 1.5GB of available memory
- Google app 6.13 or higher
- Google Play services
- 720p or higher screen resolution
- Device’s language set to one of the supported languages.
Also, if you are using a custom ROM (or Chines ROM) with sideloaded Google Play services, sometimes the Assistant won’t work. So, the steps below only apply to stock official ROMs.
Solution 1 – Make sure Google Assistant is enabled
Most of the time, Google Assistant initializes and configures during the first startup. However, if you refused some of the license terms by accident, Google Assistant won’t work.
So, here’s how to enable Google Assistant on your device:
- Open Google Assistant from the Home screen.
- Tap on the Account icon in the top right corner.
- Choose the Assistant tab.
- Scroll down and select Phone.
- Make sure that both Google Assistant and Hey Google options are enabled.
- Reboot your device and give voice commands another go.
Solution 2 – Disable Bixby or alternative assistants
If you are using a Samsung handset, we recommend disabling Bixby and selecting Google Assistant as the default option. This way, you’ll not only resolve possible issues but also get the extra physical trigger button to use with Google Assistant instead of sub-par Bixby.
- Tap and hold on the Home screen until the launcher menu appears.
- Swipe right on the bottom to reach the -1 Bixby screen.
- Toggle the Bixby screen off.
- Now, from the Quick actions area, tap on the Power icon.
- Open Side key settings.
- Make sure that Bixby is not set under both Double-press and Press and hold sections.
Solution 3 – Check Default app settings
Another thing you should check in local settings are settings for the default Voice assistant and Assist & voice input. Both options should be set to Google in order for Google Assistant to work as intended.
With that in mind, here’s where to find and change the aforementioned settings on your Android device:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps.
- Open All apps (Manage apps or Apps Manager).
- Tap on the 3-dot menu and open Default apps.
- Under the Voice assistant and Assist & voice input sections, set Google as the preferred service.
Solution 4 – Clear cache and data from the Google app
If you are still stuck with the same error and the prompt is saying that Google Assistant is not available on your device, we suggest clearing the cache and data from the Google app and configuring everything from scratch.
Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from the Google app:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps.
- Select All apps (App manager or Manage apps).
- Open Google.
- Tap Storage.
- Clear cache and then data.
Solution 5 – Uninstall updates from the Google app
Alternatively, you can uninstall updates from the Google app and reset the app completely. Since the Google app is a pre-installed system app on the majority of Android devices, you won’t be able to remove it completely. What you can do is uninstall updates (reset it to stock version) and update it again. Hopefully, this will resolve the bug.
Follow these instructions to uninstall updates from the Google app on Android:
- Navigate yet again to the Google app via Settings > Apps.
- Tap Uninstall updates.
- Reboot your device and update the Google app from the Play Store.
Finally, if you are a part of the Beta program for the Google app, we suggest leaving it. Although Beta releases are fairly stable, they are not as stable as the public ones. There might be a bug at hand causing the “Google Assistant is not available on this device” error.
You can leave the Beta program for the Google app within the Google Play Store. Just look for the Google app, scroll down, and tap Leave under the “You’re a beta tester” section.
You can also reset the device to factory settings, although we can’t say with certainty that this will help.
And, on that note, we can wrap this article. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you.
I press drive on my tablet phone and it comes up and dispears
Google assistant has been disabled from Samsung galaxy s9plus permanently. Att rep confirmed. I used app everyday. Sux now because android auto cannot work or function properly with voice prompts.People usually criticize Apple for keeping its ecosystem closed and not allowing too many freedoms to its users. That might be true, depending on how you look at it, but there are certain aspects of iOS that are simply designed to be better or at least more convenient than on other platforms.
One of the things I think Apple does best in the business is managing built-in apps. In an era when manufacturers are keeping their phones flooded with bloatware, Apple allows you to stay in control of the stock apps. Not in full control, though, but certainly more than competitors do, with an exception of Google.
If you’ve ever owned an Android phone not made by Google, you were certainly annoyed by the number of pre-installed apps that you can’t delete. With all due respect, but who uses Galaxy Store?
You won’t have to deal with such annoyances on your iPhone. Believe it or not, you’re allowed to delete most of the built-in apps that come out of the box. And those you can’t delete are essential for using your phone anyway. For example, you can’t delete Messages, Safari, Phone, etc.
The reason why Apple and Google are different is that, unlike most of the other companies, they don’t have (need) any partnerships with third-parties. All of the apps that come pre-installed are Apple’s own. What’s even more important is that you’d use most of these apps anyway, so there’s no need to shove apps down your throat.
Now that you know a little background, let’s see which apps you can delete and how to do it.
These are the stock iPhone apps you can delete
Here’s a full list of the built-in apps you can delete from your iPhone:
- Activity
- Apple Books
- Calculator
- Calendar
- Compass
- Contacts
- FaceTime
- Files
- Find My Friends (iOS 12 only)
- Home
- iTunes Store
- Maps
- Measure
- Music
- News (where available)
- Notes
- Podcasts
- Reminders
- Stocks
- Tips
- TV (where available)
- Videos
- Voice Memos
- Watch app
- Weather
And here’s a much smaller list of the apps you can’t ever delete from your iPhone:
As you can see, most of the apps on this list are either incremental for the functioning of your phone or the ones you wouldn’t delete anyway. There are no third-party apps whatsoever.
How to delete built-in apps on iPhone
Delete App. And that’s it, the app is gone.
There are, however, a few things you should keep in mind when deleting built-in apps that you used before. For example, if you delete the Contacts app, all your contacts will remain on your phone but will be stored in the Phone app. There are a couple more of these rules, which you can check on Apple’s support page.
What are your thoughts on the current built-in apps situation? Are you satisfied with it, or you want to be able to delete even more first-party apps? Let us know in the comments below.Even though a lot of Android users are still waiting for an update to Nougat 7.0, Google announced brand new OS. Android Oreo or Oreos is the 8th Android installment and should be available for consumers in August or September 2017.
For the time being, Google released Developers Preview version that should showcase upcoming features. It’s available only for Google-powered devices, namely for:
So if you have one of these models, you can try out Android O. However, have in mind that this is not a stable version and you can encounter a large variety of issues. For that purpose, we listed some of the known issues for this preview release, so you can know what to expect.
Known issues of Android O Developer Preview
System User Interface Issues
With Android O, Google conducted various changes and improvements with UI. Sadly, you may have a hard time experiencing those when we consider these reported issues:
-
”System UI crash after toggling screen brightness, then going to Overview (recent) and selecting a new app.
-
Occasional issues navigating Home, with incomplete transition making the device unusable.
-
Taps in Quick Settings may be registered in another location.
-
When using Autofill, an “Android system app displaying on top” message is sometimes shown, but it can be ignored (if it’s turned off, it will disable Autofill).”
Google Cloud Messaging/Firebase Cloud Messaging
Cloud Messaging is also unstable in this preview version. These are the problems that occurred with some users:
-
”FCM doesn’t work in a secondary profile unless the app is also installed on the primary profile. If the app is not installed on the primary profile, an FCM token is not generated in the secondary profile.
-
Developers using FCM/GCM with Android O should update their Google Play services SDK to version 10.2.1, which is available from the SDK manager in Android Studio.”
Android TV Issues
The Nexus Player has specific issues on its own. We are bringing you whole detailed list below.
- ”Setting up a restricted profile then restarting the device causes the device to be unusable.
- Typing in the search bar causes a crash.
- PIP image does not fill the window.
- Launching applications via voice command does not work.
- Application size is not displayed in Application Settings.
- Microphone button on remote control does not work.
- Factory reset does not work on Fugu.
- Connected remote control device disconnects intermittently.
- USB connected drive cannot be formatted. The Setup as device storage formatting option does not work properly for drive attached via USB.
- Device may freeze with blank homescreen when plug is inserted.
- Location status in Settings may become disabled with user unable to re-enable.
- Not able to reorder games in the apps and games row.
- Content may not play after relaunching media apps.”
Android for Work and Device Manager Issues
Android for Work is a great feature that let you create and manage work-specific profile separately from the private one. At the moment, there is a single reported issue regarding Android for Work.
- ”Enabling a Work Profile may cause a crash in Settings app. To work around this issue, remove and re-add the Work Profile.”
Besides that, users reported occasional crashes while trying to access the Device Manager.
- ”Selecting the Settings > Security and Screen Lock > Android Device Manager menu item may cause a crash. Updating to the latest version of Google Play services will resolve this issue.”
Android Wear Issues
Besides handsets and Android TV, Android Wear has also support trough Android Emulator System Images. However, it’s not without issues.
- ”Embedded app installation from Play Store can sometimes crash. Side-loading can be used to work around this issue.
- Only the x86 emulator is currently supported.
- Default watch face complications may not load until you switch watch faces or otherwise touch watch face settings, or reboot the device.”
Wi-Fi Issues
Performance and Battery Issues
As you would expect, this is release is not advisable for everyday use. It is quite buggy and unstable performance-wise.
- ”System and app performance is known to be periodically slow / janky, and device may become occasionally unresponsive. These problems may become more acute with prolonged use.
- Some apps may not function normally on Developer Preview 1. This includes Google’s apps as well as other apps.
- This release has various stability and performance issues on all devices that make it not suitable for daily use on phone or tablet, especially for non-developers.”
Moreover, the same goes for battery. If you are willing to try out Android O Developer Preview, prepare for battery drainage.
And with the lack of percentage that is removed from UI, you won’t be able to determine consumption as easily as before.
Other Issues
Besides best-known issues, you may face a variety of secondary issues related to lack of optimization. Don’t forget that some of the apps/features you may use are still not compatible with novelties that Android O brings to the table.
- ”Using the Google Drive app’s PDF viewer to load a PDF document may cause the device to freeze.
- Apps or games may hit ANRs in GLThread, such as with
AssetManager::open , that cause crash or failure to load properly.
- Games using Google Play games services may have problems with sign-in.
- The latest release of Android Auto may not work properly on Developer Preview 1.
- The NDK cannot build targeting Android O DP1 (an upcoming r15 release will fix).”
Have in mind that these are only the ‘noticed’ issues since we are too early in this release phase. So, a large variety of unlisted issues can occur. Additionally, features like Android Pay are not available due to security reasons.
At the end, unless you’re a developer or knowledgeable enthusiast, we don’t advise you to install Developers Preview. Soon enough we should be able to download Beta version with CTS (Compatibility Test Suite) approval. That should be much safer to work with.
What are your first thoughts on Android O? What are the changes you eagerly await?
I was on speaker phone today and when I hung up the phone still take 5 min to perform the task of hanging up and return to the home screen.
When connected to my PC (Windows 10) Nexus 6P action drop down does not activate to apply actions.
wifi 5Ghz not available
I cannot attach a picture when using the messenger app…freezes and crashes. My Nexus 6p is still having the shut at 30% issue. Overall, the worst beta experience I have had.
Using Pixel XL, and since Android O the Google App itself is incredibly unstable. Most notably and specifically, the Assistant freezes the Google app upon a command (such as “call xyz”, or “send text to xyz”. The Google App freezes, then force close.
Lots of strange bluetooth issues on my Nexus 6P – none of which I had on Android 7.x. I did the OTA Beta.LATEST

However, there are some people who are actually annoyed by this feature. They simply want to start using their phones as soon as they tap the button, without entering complicated patterns, or passwords. So, if you’re one of them, we’ve got you covered.
In this article, you’ll find out how to disable the Lock Screen on your Android phone, and save a few seconds, that you would normally spend on unlocking it.
Remove the Lock Screen in Android
Disabling the Lock Screen in Android is as easy as unlocking your phone, you just need to change a few settings, and you won’t have to deal with this feature ever again. Here’s exactly what you need to do:
- Open the Settings app on your phone (you can find it in the menu, or in the Notifications bar, but you probably already know how to access it).
- Go to Security > Screen Lock.
- Now, just select None
- The phone will then ask you to enter your PIN or Password. Enter it, confirm, and the Lock Screen will be disabled.
There you go, after performing this action, the Lock Screen will be completely disabled on your Android device, and you’ll be able to use it when you want, immediately.
Why you shouldn’t disable the Lock Screen
Entering the password every time you want to access your phone can be annoying sometimes, but that’s not a reason good enough to convince you to completely disable the Lock Screen. If you don’t have any security method on your phone, it will be extremely vulnerable, and accessible to anyone.
Also, a lot of unwanted apps can be opened if you don’t have the Lock Screen turned on, depending on the screen sensitivity of your phone. You certainly don’t want to end up calling someone accidentally, or sending gibberish message to your Facebook friends. If you think unlocking your phone is time consuming, think again, because two seconds probably won’t mean anything.
As Android advances as the OS, the Lock Screen also becomes more and more customizable. Especially in Android Nougat, where you have a lot of amazing Lock Screen options, like the ability to set different wallpapers to your Lock Screen.
All in all, disabling the Lock Screen in Android is fairly easy, and it doesn’t require any big effort. However, it is recommended to keep this feature turned on. So, if you’re planning to turn off the Lock Screen, think about it once again.Mobile Internist is an online publication mainly focused on solving various problems on Android and iOS devices.

With some minor tweaking (icon pack and KWGT can come in handy, too), you can make your UI look any way you want. This includes support for the Google Now shortcut when swiping left from the home screen. However, it seems that Google Now is not working on Nova Launcher for some users.
Table of contents:
- Install Nova Google Companion
- Disable/re-enable Google Companion Feed
- Clear cache from the Google app
- Restart Nova Launcher
- Reset Google app
How do I enable Google now in Nova launcher?
If you already have Google Companion, it’s easy. If not, download and install the APK (link below). As simple as that.
Now, if Google Now is not working even after installing and configuring Nova Google Companion, check the steps below to address the problem with ease.
Solution 1 – Install Nova Google Companion
This step applies as a solution only if you don’t have Google Companion to start with. If you are not aware, Google Now (Google Feed) that’s usually accessible by swiping left from the home screen, is not available on Nova Launcher from the get-go.
In order to get it, you’ll need to install a companion app that integrates with the launcher. Now, Google doesn’t allow this app on the Play Store so you’ll need to download and install an APK. Once you’ve done that, the only thing remaining is to configure it in Nova Settings and that’s it.
Follow these instructions to download and install Nova Google Companion:
- Navigate to TeslaCoils’ official website with your smartphone/tablet, here.
- Scroll down and download Nova Google Companion by tapping the hyperlink.
- Run the APK and allow installation from 3rd-party sources when prompted.
- Make sure that Nova is your default launcher.
- Now, tap & hold on the home screen and open Settings.
- Tap Integrations.
- Under Google Discover, check both Google Discover and Edge Swipe (optionally) boxes. Select the preferred theme and transition animation and you are set.
Solution 2 – Disable/re-enable Google Companion Feed
On the other hand, if you already have the Google Companion but swiping to the left from the home screen doesn’t do a thing, there are some things you can try to fix it. First of all, you can disable it and then re-enable it immediately. This simple action usually resolves the problem completely.
Just navigate to Nova Settings, open Integrations, and then uncheck the Google Discover box. Reboot your device, get back to Google Discover settings and check the box again.
Solution 3 – Clear cache from the Google app
problem might be related to the Google app. Due to frequent updates and many (mostly minor) changes, bugs are expected.
The first thing concerning the Google app you can do is clear its cache. Once you remove locally-stored cached data, Google Now should start working.
Follow these steps to clear cache from the Google app:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps.
- Then, open App manager, Manage apps, or All apps (it depends on the phone’s OEM).
- Now, locate and open Google from the list of apps.
- Tap Storage.
- Finally, clear cache from the app.
Solution 4 – Restart Nova Launcher
Moving on, you can also try and just reboot your device. Alternatively, there’s an option in Nova Launcher to restart it. This is a long shot but it might help you resolve the problem at hand.
- Tap & hold on the home screen and open Settings.
- Scroll to the bottom and tap Advanced.
- Tap Restart Nova Launcher.
If Google Now is still not working on Nova Launcher, make sure to continue to the last step below.
Solution 5 – Reset Google app
Finally, we can only suggest to completely reset the Google app. The best thing to do (the most thorough one) is to uninstall all updates from the app and start from scratch. Just wait until it auto-updates (or update it through the Play Store manually) and open it again.
Configure in Google > hamburger bar > Settings what’s necessary first. Then, disable/re-enable Nova Google Companion and everything should be addressed.
Follow these instructions to reset the Google app completely:
- Open Play Store.
- Search for and expand Google.
- Uninstall Google (this will uninstall updates since the Google app is a system app).
- Reboot your device and update the app.
With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to tell us in the comments section below.We are already accustomed to yearly iterations of Motorola Moto G are fan favorites in the budget segment. Motorola Moto G Power is another version of battery-oriented handsets that we are seeing for a couple of years now and it’s hard to overlook the benefits that a 5000 mAh battery brings to the table.
Now, Motorola likes to run stock Android on their devices, adding an extra layer of quality over some heavily customized and bloatware-ridden OEMs. Nonetheless, it has a variety of small but significant issues. We made sure to look them up and list them below. Along with applicable solutions to help you out.
Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems.
Table of contents:
- Bad GPS quality
- Mobile data and call reception issues
- Wi-Fi and Hotspot issues
- No in-call sound
- Camera issues on the Moto G Power
- Moto G Power constantly refreshing apps
- Bluetooth issues on the Moto G Power
- Apps are not updating
- SMS messages are not coming through
- Slow performance and system lags
- Common troubleshooting steps for the Moto G Power
1. Bad GPS quality
Based on various reports from multiple support forums and online communities, the GPS seems to be the worst thing about this phone. The signal is lost after some time of use, making the usage of apps like Google Maps or Waze for navigation quite cumbersome. It appears this is resolved by adding Galileo satellites to the list.
In case you are having any issues with GPS readings, you can test GPS with a third-party app just to be sure. If the issue persists, consider giving these steps a try:
- Enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning.
- Check Location permissions for third-party apps.
- Reset your device to factory settings.
2. Mobile data and call reception issues
Mobile Data issues can render a device completely unusable, based on your usage and preferences. Some users reported that the LTE/4G is incredibly slow and unreliable. And, for some reason, especially when the device is charging.
To add an insult to injury, the device reception is far from being flawless. Users experienced in-call problems caused by bad reception, even in urban areas.
Now, this isn’t an as widespread problem as some others, but there are users who are having a hard time resolving it. If you are among those users, consider resetting APN and, if that fails, make sure to reset the Network Settings.
3. Wi-Fi and Hotspot issues
Similar to the aforementioned issues with the mobile reception and mobile data, some Moto G Power users have had a hard time with the Wi-Fi. It seems that the network speeds are subpar for some, while others experience frequent disconnections.
Additionally, the Hotspot doesn’t work for some, which is probably related to mobile data issues mentioned above. In both cases, we can suggest resetting your network settings and temporarily disabling Bluetooth. If that doesn’t help, consider resetting your device to factory settings.
4. No in-call sound
Sound issues on the Moto G series are not as common but, apparently, some users have had a hard time while conversing on the phone. Some reported stutters while others can’t hear the other side at all while being heard without problems.
To some extent, this can be related to network coverage issues but chances are that there’s a hardware issue or a conflict between Bluetooth and cellular antenna.
Try rebooting your device and, if that fails, reset the APN settings. If the issue persists, we suggest taking your device to the retailer or carrier support and asking for the replacement.
5. Camera issues on the Moto G Power
The camera quality is probably the biggest difference between super-expensive flagship devices and budget devices like Moto G Power. It seems that this handset has quite a capable camera setup but the software side can be rather underwhelming.
Users report slow shutter speeds, loading, camera app crashes, etc. We can suggest navigating to Settings > Apps > Camera and clearing cache and data from the app. Additionally, ensure that you are running the latest firmware.
There seems to be an issue, at least for some users, which completely made the Moto G Power unusable. Namely, it seems that apps are constantly refreshing and not being kept in RAM, which is hardly the software issue. Especially if we consider that affected users reset the device to factory values.
We recommend taking your device for the replacement or repairs as this is probably a RAM issue at hand.
Bluetooth problems are also present for some users. The audio reproduction via Bluetooth when connected to car media is plain awful for some users.
The playback is unreliable and it seems that it doesn’t get much better when connected to other audio devices like speakers or wireless buds/headphones.
If you are among those Moto G Power owners that have Bluetooth issues, check the steps below:
- Remove pairing and establish it again. Navigate to Settings >Bluetooth and delete all paired devices. Pair the handset with the device again and try again.
- Reset Network Settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings.
- Disable Automatic pairing. Pair individually with a device when you want to use it.
- Boot into a safe mode and try connecting via Bluetooth.
- Update the system.
- Reset your phone to factory settings.
Some users reported that certain apps (particularly Chrome for some reason) won’t update. There’s a chance that the locally-stored data might be corrupted so we recommend clearing the cache and data. Follow these steps to do so:
- Open Settings.
- Choose Apps.
- Navigate to the app that’s not updating.
- Select Storage.
- Clear cache and data. Do the same for the Google Play Store and Google Play Services (tap on the 3-dot menu and choose to Show system apps).
- Reboot your device, open the Play Store, and look for improvements.
If that fails, make sure to uninstall updates from the app (Chrome is a system app and can’t be removed), so navigate to Settings > Apps > Chrome and uninstall updates.
Again, we can blame the network coverage issues for this, as well. As mentioned above, we recommend resetting your APN in Settings, clearing data from the Messaging app, and rebooting your device. If that doesn’t help, make sure to check your SIM card placement.
In case the issues persist, we suggest resetting your device to factory settings as there’s hardly anything else you can do on your own. Of course, contacting your carrier is not the worst idea.
10. Slow performance and system lags
Finally, we couldn’t ignore lags and overall underwhelming performance some Moto G Power users experienced. The Snapdragon 665 and Adreno 10 graphics are just not good enough sometimes, especially if you are invested in 3D games like PUBG or Call of Duty. Occasionally, the device might stutter even when you are scrolling through online content.
This is a budget device with the main focus on battery longevity so it’s unrealistic to expect amazing results. However, with that said, there is some way that can help you speed up the Moto G Power significantly. Follow these steps to improve performance:
- Reboot the device.
- Limit the number of apps working in the background. You can do so in the Developer options, under the Background process limit.
- Lower the Animations in Developer options.
- Boot into Safe Mode and, if the device performs better, uninstall recently installed apps.
- Reset your Moto G Power to factory settings.
11. Common troubleshooting steps for the Moto G Power
Enter Developer Options
- Open Settings.
- Select System.
- Open About phone.
- Tap on Build number 7 times. You should get the message informing you that you are now a developer.
- Get back to the main menu of Settings and, at the bottom, you should see Developer options.
Boot into Safe Mode
- Press and hold the Power button to bring out the Power menu.
- Tap and hold on the Power off icon until you are prompted to enter Safe mode.
- Tap OK.
- To get out of Safe mode, just reboot your device again.
Reset Network settings
- Open Settings.
- Choose the Network & Internet.
- Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Network settings reset.
- Choose to reset your Network settings.
- Confirm when prompted.
Reset the device to factory settings
- First, navigate to Settings > System > Backup and back up all your settings and app data. Besides that, make sure to connect your device to a PC and back up all your media. You can also use Google Photos to backup all your photos from the device. You’ll need your Google Account password later.
- Once you are certain that everything can be safely deleted, in Settings > System > Advanced, choose Reset options.
- Select Erase all data (factory reset).
- Confirm the selection. Your device will reboot and after some time, you’ll start from scratch.
And with those instructions above, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and make sure to share additional issues or alternative solutions with us and other readers. You can do so in the comments section below.Even though a lot of Android users are still waiting for an update to Nougat 7.0, Google announced brand new OS. Android Oreo or Oreos is the 8th Android installment and should be available for consumers in August or September 2017.
For the time being, Google released Developers Preview version that should showcase upcoming features. It’s available only for Google-powered devices, namely for:
- Nexus 5X
- Nexus 6P
- Pixel
- Nexus Player
- Pixel XL
- Pixel C
So if you have one of these models, you can try out Android O. However, have in mind that this is not a stable version and you can encounter a large variety of issues. For that purpose, we listed some of the known issues for this preview release, so you can know what to expect.
Known issues of Android O Developer Preview
System User Interface Issues
With Android O, Google conducted various changes and improvements with UI. Sadly, you may have a hard time experiencing those when we consider these reported issues:
-
”System UI crash after toggling screen brightness, then going to Overview (recent) and selecting a new app.
-
Occasional issues navigating Home, with incomplete transition making the device unusable.
-
Taps in Quick Settings may be registered in another location.
-
When using Autofill, an “Android system app displaying on top” message is sometimes shown, but it can be ignored (if it’s turned off, it will disable Autofill).”
Google Cloud Messaging/Firebase Cloud Messaging
Cloud Messaging is also unstable in this preview version. These are the problems that occurred with some users:
-
”FCM doesn’t work in a secondary profile unless the app is also installed on the primary profile. If the app is not installed on the primary profile, an FCM token is not generated in the secondary profile.
-
Developers using FCM/GCM with Android O should update their Google Play services SDK to version 10.2.1, which is available from the SDK manager in Android Studio.”
Android TV Issues
The Nexus Player has specific issues on its own. We are bringing you whole detailed list below.
- ”Setting up a restricted profile then restarting the device causes the device to be unusable.
- Typing in the search bar causes a crash.
- PIP image does not fill the window.
- Launching applications via voice command does not work.
- Application size is not displayed in Application Settings.
- Microphone button on remote control does not work.
- Factory reset does not work on Fugu.
- Connected remote control device disconnects intermittently.
- USB connected drive cannot be formatted. The
- Device may freeze with blank homescreen when plug is inserted.
- Location status in Settings may become disabled with user unable to re-enable.
- Not able to reorder games in the apps and games row.
- Content may not play after relaunching media apps.”
Android for Work and Device Manager Issues
Android for Work is a great feature that let you create and manage work-specific profile separately from the private one. At the moment, there is a single reported issue regarding Android for Work.
- ”Enabling a Work Profile may cause a crash in Settings app. To work around this issue, remove and re-add the Work Profile.”
Besides that, users reported occasional crashes while trying to access the Device Manager.
- ”Selecting the
Android Wear Issues
Besides handsets and Android TV, Android Wear has also support trough Android Emulator System Images. However, it’s not without issues.
- ”Embedded app installation from Play Store can sometimes crash. Side-loading can be used to work around this issue.
- Only the x86 emulator is currently supported.
- Default watch face complications may not load until you switch watch faces or otherwise touch watch face settings, or reboot the device.”
Wi-Fi Issues
- ”611 call can’t be made on a Wi-Fi profile.”
Performance and Battery Issues
As you would expect, this is release is not advisable for everyday use. It is quite buggy and unstable performance-wise.
- ”System and app
- Some apps may not function normally on Developer Preview 1. This includes Google’s apps as well as other apps.
- This release has various stability and performance issues on all devices that make it
Moreover, the same goes for battery. If you are willing to try out Android O Developer Preview, prepare for battery drainage.
-
And with the lack of percentage that is removed from UI, you won’t be able to determine consumption as easily as before.
Other Issues
Besides best-known issues, you may face a variety of secondary issues related to lack of optimization. Don’t forget that some of the apps/features you may use are still not compatible with novelties that Android O brings to the table.
- ”Using the Google Drive app’s PDF viewer to load a PDF document may cause the device to freeze.
- Apps or games may hit ANRs in GLThread, such as with
- Games using Google Play games services may have problems with sign-in.
- The latest release of Android Auto may not work properly on Developer Preview 1.
- The NDK cannot build targeting Android O DP1 (an upcoming r15 release will fix).”
Have in mind that these are only the ‘noticed’ issues since we are too early in this release phase. So, a large variety of unlisted issues can occur. Additionally, features like Android Pay are not available due to security reasons.
At the end, unless you’re a developer or knowledgeable enthusiast, we don’t advise you to install Developers Preview. Soon enough we should be able to download Beta version with CTS (Compatibility Test Suite) approval. That should be much safer to work with.
What are your first thoughts on Android O? What are the changes you eagerly await?
I was on speaker phone today and when I hung up the phone still take 5 min to perform the task of hanging up and return to the home screen.
When connected to my PC (Windows 10) Nexus 6P action drop down does not activate to apply actions.
wifi 5Ghz not available
I cannot attach a picture when using the messenger app…freezes and crashes. My Nexus 6p is still having the shut at 30% issue. Overall, the worst beta experience I have had.
Using Pixel XL, and since Android O the Google App itself is incredibly unstable. Most notably and specifically, the Assistant freezes the Google app upon a command (such as “call xyz”, or “send text to xyz”. The Google App freezes, then force close.
Lots of strange bluetooth issues on my Nexus 6P – none of which I had on Android 7.x. I did the OTA Beta.Home Tags Android

123Page 1 of 3The Samsung Galaxy S10 series brought a lot of goods in a similar package as their predecessors, as expected for flagship series of probably best smartphone hardware manufacturers out there. However, the novel OneUI 2 needs some ironing. There seems to be a string of different S10 data issues (Wi-Fi issues, as well). The connection is either unstable (and super-slow) or the device won’t connect to 4G/LTE at all.
If you are experiencing data issues, make sure to check the steps below in order to fix them for good.
Table of contents:
- Reset your APN to default values
- Wipe cache partition
- Disable Adaptive data usage
- Reset Network settings
- Update the S10 firmware and contact your service provider
- Reset the device to factory settings
How do I fix my S10 connection?
Solution 1 – Reset your APN to default values
The first thing to try in order to resolve Samsung Galaxy S10 data issues is to reset your APN settings. There might be a problem with the local configuration. Also, make sure that your Preferred network type includes LTE/4G.
Follow these steps to reset APN to default values:
- Open Settings.
- Select Connections.
- Choose Mobile networks and then Access Point Names.
- Tap on the Menu and then select Reset to default.
If you are still experiencing issues, make sure to contact your carrier’s call center and ask for a new APN configuration.
Solution 2 – Wipe cache partition
Some users managed to resolve the issue by wiping the cache partition from the Recovery menu. Some suggested resetting network settings after this action, but we suggest taking additional steps only if the issue persists.
If you are not sure how to wipe cache partition on the Samsung Galaxy S10, make sure to follow the instructions below:
- Power off your Samsung Galaxy S10.
- Simultaneously press and hold the Power button, Volume up, and the Bixby button until the Android logo appears.
- After that, you should see the Recovery menu.
- Once there, use the volume keys to navigate through the menu and press the Power button to select wipe cache partition.
- Choose Yes and press the Power button to wipe the cache partition.
Solution 3 – Disable Adaptive data usage
Another thing we recommend doing is disabling the Adaptive data usage when Wi-Fi is unstable. When enabled, this option allows for smart switching between Wi-Fi networks and mobile data. However, it has caused some issues with Samsung’s OneUI 2 and the Samsung Galaxy S10.
- Open Settings.
- Choose Connections.
- Select Wi-Fi and enable it.
- Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Advanced.
- Disable the “Switch to mobile data” option.
Solution 4 – Reset Network settings
If the data issues persist on the S10, it would be a good idea to reset Network settings. Have in mind that this will erase all save SSIDs and Bluetooth pairings. Once you reset network settings, your carrier should provide you with configuration messages for 4G/LTE and MMS. Make sure to apply them.
Here’s how to reset your Samsung Galaxy S10 network settings:
- Open Settings.
- Choose General management.
- Tap Reset.
- Select Reset Network Settings.
- Confirm when prompted.
Solution 5 – Update the S10 firmware and contact your service provider
It is talked a lot about connectivity issues concerning Samsung’s flagship series. The OEM decided to address them and, based on multiple reports, most of the issues are fixed with a patch. So, ensure that your device’s firmware is up to date.
In addition, the problem might be associated with carrier coverage issues so, if the problem persists, make sure to contact your carrier. Especially if you got the carrier SIM-locked device. They should give you a better insight.
Finally, if none of the aforementioned steps proved fruitful, the only thing we can recommend is resetting your Samsung Galaxy S10 to factory settings. Just make sure to back up all your data prior to resetting your phone. This procedure will erase everything, including your internal storage.
Follow these steps to reset your Samsung Galaxy S10 to factory settings:
- Back up everything from your internal storage to an SD card or cloud.
- Open Settings.
- Choose General management and then Reset.
- Select Factory data reset.
- Tap Reset and then tap Delete all.
With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to tell us about alternative solutions or different issues you are experiencing. You can do so in the comments section below.
Thank you! Solution 3 works for me!Just as everyone expected, Samsung Galaxy S8 took the market by the storm. It’s extremely well designed and produced, with the plethora of amazing novelties and great software to complete the picture. But, as some would say, the devil is in details.
One detail that somewhat corrupted the overall experience is the positioning of the lock screen clock. Namely, it seems that, by default, the numbers layout is stacked up, minutes above hours. That layout isn’t what most users are used to and they want to change it to standard form. But, as the case has shown, that’s harder to do than we expected. Don’t mix up the Always On Display with the lock screen, though. In Always on Display feature, you can customize the clock to your liking. The Lock screen is a completely different story.
Either way, we prepared some alternatives, or rather workarounds that should help you change the clock’s layout. At least, for the time being. If you’re not satisfied with the digital clock format on your Samsung Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus, make sure to check them out below.
Use different theme
Some users managed to get rid of the unusual clock by replacing the default theme for an alternative. This, of course, isn’t a solution but rather a workaround that might not be suiting everyone’s taste. However, for the time being, there are not so many things you can do, so it’s worth a try. There are some paid themes, but, since we can’t be sure that, after certain steps, the stack up format won’t return, it’s not advised to spend your money on those.
On the other hand, you can use a free theme and make your clock take a normal position that way. Follow the instructions below to do so:
- Tap Settings.
- Open Wallpapers and themes.
- Tap Themes in the bottom.
- Search for Simple Line Black theme.
- Install this theme and tap ”Apply”.
Moreover, if you’re not liking icon and background changes, you can always choose other wallpaper and restore icons to default. Make sure to check the steps below in order to change the wallpaper on both Home and Lock screen and restore default icons.
- Navigate to Gallery and choose the preferred photo individually for Home or Lock screen.
- Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Set as wallpaper.
- Now, navigate to Settings.
- Open Wallpapers and themes.
- Choose Icons.
- Tap Default and apply changes.
Try an app that sticks notifications the on lock screen
On the other hand, most of the users are already satisfied with the pre-installed theme and all they want to change is that silly annoyance of the lock screen clock. Or rather, make it vertical like on all Android-powered devices. But, until Samsung fix this and provide users with an option to choose the clock looks (just like in Always on Display features), there’s one, so to say, loophole you can take advantage of. Namely, if Lock screen notifications are enabled, you can place something like weather app to stick on the screen.
Due to its position, the clock changes its format to standard vertical positioning. If that works for you, it’s quite easy to set it up. In the example below, we’ll be using a weather app, called 1Weather. It’s small and subtle but will change your clock to a vertical position.
- Download 1Weather from Play Store.
- Tap Settings.
- Open Lockscreen and security.
- Enable Notifications.
- Tap Notifications.
- Open All Apps.
- Enable 1Weather.
As long as the notification stays on the Lock Screen, the annoying row-like position should be out of the picture.
That’s it. Since there are so many users that are complaining about this, we can expect that Samsung will do something in the upcoming period. Some of the future updates should change the clock to more natural state. Until then, you can use the above-mentioned workarounds.
In case you have questions or suggestions, make sure to post them in the comments section down below.

Other solution is to use a lock screen app – I use the Microsoft Next lock screen which has a lot oc customisation and the more usual time fomat.
To change the digital clock on the lock screen:
They have a couple of clock styles to choose from.
“Settings” > “Lock Screen and Security” > TAP the “Always On Display” (like the words, not the switch) > TAP “Digital Clock” (or the other clock styles if you want analog or something) > on the bottom left there’s “Clock Styles” which give 4 different digital clock styles to choose from.
Or you can choose the other clock styles outside of the digital clock section.
I just did this on my S8+ right now.
this is for Always On Display (AOD) only. the article is talking the lock screen, since not all people use the AOD
Following the above steps for simple black line results in the message ‘Unable to download content in Show button shapes’ ! Also ironic that the default shown in My Themes shows the normal clock type but also l cannot apply this because of same error message , crap like this almost makes me want an iphone ! 😀
None of these options works for me.
option 1 with theme Simple Line Black theme: it doesn’t show up in my search list
option 2 with setting a custom wallpaper and changing icons to default doesn’t change clock format, still the horrible one
option 3 keep notifications on: well, this is not a solution, I like to clean up the list
Other solution is to use a lock screen app – I use the Microsoft Next lock screen which has a lot oc customisation and the more usual time fomat.
None of these options works for me.

But it seems that the Google is following those trends with Pixel and Nexus handsets that are light years in front other OEMs in terms of software support. For example, some Nougat-ready models are still running Marshmallow OS, while the Android O Beta is on the horizon for Pixel and Nexus models. And most of the times, the delay is OEMs’ fault.
However, even though Android O won’t be available until later this year, you’re already able to taste some of its features on your phone. Namely, it seems that there’s a way to use the Pixel Launcher featured in the Android O Preview (version 1) release on every Android-powered device past Marshmallow 6.0.1. So, without further ado, here is how to get this exclusive launcher on your device.
How to get Pixel Launcher from Android O on any device (Marshmallow and later)
These are new features of the brand new Pixel Launcher:
”Swipe right from your home screen to see personalized Google cards that bring you news and personalized information, at just the right time.
Quick access to Google Search on your primary home screen.
Swipe up on the bottom Favorites row to find your apps from A-Z.
App Suggestions bring the app you’re looking for to the top of your A-Z list.
Long-press on apps that support shortcuts to jump right into where you need to go or long-press on the shortcuts to drag them to the home screen.”
Before you download the APK, make sure you do the following:
Now, let’s move to download and installation procedure, shall we.
- Download APK here.
- Go to Settings.
- Open Lock Screen and Security.
- Enable ” Unknown sources” (Allow unknown sources to be installed).
- Use any file explorer to navigate to the Download folder on phone storage.
- Find PixelLauncher-7.1.2–O-3743572.apk and extract it wherever you want.
- Install APK.
- Restart your device to resolve any glitches you may encounter within initial use.
- If you set Pixel Launcher as a system app, you’ll be able to use Google Now.
- With that, your brand new launcher is ready to use.
Kudos to the creator of this great port, linuxct from XDA!
In case you have any issues or questions related to the subject, please tell us in the comments section.Nova Launcher is probably the one app that’s definitely, sooner or later, brought up when it comes to Android UI theming and customization. And, of course, like any other stock launcher, it allows home screen widgets. Not for all users, though, as there are reports that Nova Launcher widgets are not working for some.
If Nova can’t create (add) widgets or widgets are not updating, make sure to follow our instructions below to resolve these problems.
Table of contents:
- Remove and add the widget again
- Check Nova and apps permissions
- Make sure Nova is the default launcher
- Reinstall Nova, clear cache and update affected apps
Widgets are not updating on Nova Launcher
Solution 1 – Remove and add the widget again
Firstly, if the widget is static and not updating, you should remove it and add it again from the widget menu. If there’s an option within the app to configure its widget, make sure to check for update frequency availability.
Once you remove the widget, add it again from the Widgets menu, reboot your device. If the problem persists, move to the next step.
Solution 2 – Check Nova and apps permissions
In order for Nova Launcher to create widgets, you’ll need to grant it certain permissions. You are usually prompted to grant this particular permission upon installing the launcher and adding widgets for the first time.
In addition, the base apps (the ones that widgets belong to) need permissions as well. This has a special emphasis on Android 10 which deals with per-app permission in a more strict manner.
So, here are some things you should check out in order to fix Nova Launcher widgets that are not working:
- Navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Nova Launcher and grant all necessary permissions. You can also enable Nova Launcher Labs settings and find permissions there.
- Do the same for the app that provides the widget but won’t update (weather apps, step trackers, etc.).
- Open Nova Launcher settings and hold Volume down key to open the Labs option. Open Labs and check the “Restart widgets on resume” box.
Solution 3 – Make sure Nova is the default launcher
Some custom Android skins (many of them, actually) tend to aggressively limit the activity of the third-party apps. There are battery optimization and those pesky Phone Managers that can restrict apps from working in the background or updating. This applies to widgets of those respective apps.
- Open Settings and, in the search bar, type Launcher and open Default Launcher.
- Under the Default launcher, select Nova Launcher.
- Restart your device and test notifications to see whether notification badges appear.
- Now, navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps and select Nova and other apps respectively. Enable Autostart for Nova and all included apps (the ones that provide widgets) and disable Battery optimization.
Solution 4 – Reinstall Nova, clear cache and update affected apps
Finally, if widgets are still not working on Nova Launcher despite the aforementioned steps, we recommend starting from scratch. First, you should reinstall Nova. Secondly, try clearing cache and data from apps related to widgets. And, in the end, ensure that apps are up to date.
Here’s what you need to do, step-by-step:
- Open individual app settings (as explained above), select Storage, and clear cache and data. You can reinstall those apps, as well.
- Open Nova settings from the Home Screen.
- Select Backup & import settings.
- Back up Nova configuration either locally or upload it to Drive.
- From the Nova Settings menu, tap Select default launcher.
- Choose System launcher as the default one.
- Then open Play Store and uninstall Nova Launcher.
- Restart your device and reinstall Nova from the Play Store.
- Make it the default launcher, add widgets again, and look for improvements.
On that note, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and make sure to leave your feedback in the comments section below. It is more than welcome.
Option 2 worked for me like a charm!
Mobile: Xaomi Redmi Note 8
O. S.: 9 PKQ1. 190616.001
MIUI: 11.0.10 Stable
Nova Laucher: 6.2.12
This worked for me like a treat.
Great content! Super high-quality! Keep it up! 🙂In quick succession, Nokia HMD got a lot of Android One devices in various price segments. The successor to Nokia 2 (and, later, Nokia 2.1), Nokia 2.2, is the basic entry device that offers good build quality, slick design, and clean Android for an affordable price. And, today, we made sure to list all Nokia 2.2 common issues and help users around the world tackle them head-on.
Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems.
Table of contents:
- Sluggish performance
- Battery draining
- Dial pad disappeared from the Phone app
- Camera issues
- Proximity sensor issues
- Wi-Fi issues on Nokia 2.2
- Slow face unlock
- Display issues in certain apps
- Slow charging
- Nokia 2.2 stuck on factory reset
- Overheating
- Multi-touch not working properly
- Common troubleshooting steps for Nokia 2.2
1. Sluggish performance
We can all agree that 12GB or even 8GB of RAM is a tad too much, however, 2GB (3GB is, obviously, better) in the modern smartphone era is only for bareboned entry devices. Paired with a sub-par Mediatek chipset, Nokia 2.2 is by no means a snappy device, even in its price range. At least when it comes to gaming and extensive multitasking.
This, of course, doesn’t explain why some users are experiencing slow app transitions, sluggish animations or frequent screen freezes. The clean, close-to-stock Android OS shouldn’t be like that. Now, the problem is more in the software optimization than in the lackluster hardware. Hopefully, the Android 10 update (when it comes out) will fix these flaws.
In any case, here’s what we suggest in order to speed up your device and reduce stutters:
- Restart your phone.
- Reduce animations in Developer options from 1 to 0.5.
- Limit the number of background apps in Developer options.
- Clear cache and data from the Quickstep launcher in the Settings > Apps.
- Reset the device to factory settings.
2. Battery draining
We already mentioned that the Mediatek chipset is not the greatest but it is, at least, power-efficient and it doesn’t put a big strain on the 3000 mAh battery. That, along with a moderately-sized display (by today standards, at least) and clean Android, should get you through the day with 6-7 hours of Screen-on Time.
However, some users reported heavy battery drainage as their Nokia 2.2 barely made it for a couple of hours before needing to recharge.
We suspect that a monthly update broke the device, although some background apps might be draining the battery in the background.
- Disable Face unlock.
- Disable Adaptive brightness and set the brightness manually.
- Turn off the “Mobile Data always active” option in Developer options.
- Turn off Bluetooth and Location if they are not used.
- Restrict background usage for third-party apps.
- Disable Wi-Fi auto scan.
- Reset the device to factory settings.
3. Dial pad disappeared from the Phone app
There are multiple reported bugs with the pre-installed default Phone app. The most prominent problem is with the disappearing of the dial pad. This happens during calls so users are unable to utilize a dial pad for some services.
If you have a hard time with this, make sure to try the steps we suggested below and fix the Phone app on the Nokia 2.2:
- Open Settings > Apps > All apps > Phone. Clear cache and data from the app.
- Navigate to the same path and uninstall updates from the Phone app.
- Reset your device to factory settings.
4. Camera issues
Some users have had a hard time with the stock Camera app. Namely, it seems that the back camera is not working at all, with the weird RGB results showing in the viewfinder upon accessing the app.
Based on reports, third-party camera apps work just fine. This confirms that the problem isn’t in hardware but rather the Camera app is broken.
With that in mind, here’s how to troubleshoot camera issues on Nokia 2.2:
- Clear cache and data from the Camera app.
- Uninstall Camera updates.
- Reset your device to factory settings.
5. Proximity sensor issues
Another issue closely related to calls has a lot to do with the proximity sensor. As reports state, the proximity sensor is not working for some users and, when they answer the call, the screen doesn’t turn off. The screen is on during calls which shouldn’t happen.
This issue usually occurs due to badly optimized sensor but it might be a hardware problem, as well.
Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try in order to fix proximity sensor issues on the Nokia 2.2:
- Run the diagnostic in Service mode. Open dialer and enter *#*#372733#*#*. Scroll down to Proximity Test and test Proximity sensor.
- Remove the screen protector.
- Check the steps in this article to disable adaptive brightness and, hopefully, address the proximity sensor issues.
- Reset your device to factory settings.
Among many other issues, there are reports about Wi-Fi not working, even when it says that the device is connected to Wi-Fi. It breaks for a couple of minutes and then, apparently, continues working like before.
For this and all related Wi-Fi issues, we recommend taking these steps:
- Reboot your device and router/modem.
- Delete the SSID from the list of networks and connect again.
- Disable Bluetooth temporarily.
- Update the firmware.
- Reset Network Settings.
The close-to-stock Android experience on the Nokia 2.2 has a lot of advantages, keeping all that bloatware some OEMs bring at bay. However, besides the obvious advantages of clean Android, it definitely misses on some built-in features, like Face Unlock. It does support Google’s face recognition, which is rather slow for some users.
There’s nothing you can do with it, at the moment, except to try and remove/enroll your face again. Other than that, you can wait for the optimization that’s, allegedly, coming with Android 10.
Some users said that in the dedicated forum that the display on Nokia 2.2 is behaving strangely in certain apps, with the yellow stripe on the side of the screen. Many suggested disabling adaptive brightness.
However, if this doesn’t work, we can only recommend resetting your device to factory settings. If this glitch re-appears even after this action, make sure to take your device to service and ask for the replacement.
9. Slow charging
The slow charging is another frequently mentioned problem. The out-of-the-box 5W charger is not ideal, but that’s nothing unexpected at this price point.
If you are experiencing slower than usual charging, try enabling Airplane mode while charging the device.
10. Nokia 2.2 stuck on factory reset
There are many software problems that require a factory reset. And, thanks to cloud storage, backing up and restoring your files and settings is much simpler. However, what to do if the ultimate solution fails you? A few users got stuck on factory reset while trying to reset their handsets.
If that happens, you can only try and access the factory reset again from the Recovery menu. Here’s what you need to do:
- Press and hold the Power button to turn off your device.
- While Off, plug Micro USB-to-USB cable into your PC.
- Press and hold Volume down and connect your phone to the PC while still holding the Volume down key.
- Keep holding the key until the Android Robot appears.
- Press together Volume up and Power.
- Once you’ve gained access to Recovery, use volume keys to navigate to Wipe data/factory reset and tap Power to select it. Tap Power again to confirm the reset.
11. Overheating
Besides slow charging, the Nokia 2.2 tends to heat during charging sessions more than it should. At least, based on reports of a few users. We need to remind you to stick to a stock charger and, if you need to replace the adapter or cable, make sure to replace it with the original one.
You might reduce overheating by removing the protective case from the back of the phone and avoid using the device while it’s charging.
12. Multi-touch not working properly
Besides the display issues in apps we already mentioned, multi-touch is also not working properly for some users. Some of them suggested enabling GPU rendering (the Disable HW overlays option) in Developer options.
If that doesn’t help, you can also test the device in Safe mode. Finally, if multi-touch issues on the Nokia 2.2 persist, resetting your device to factory settings is our best bet to resolve them.
13. Common troubleshooting steps for Nokia 2.2
Hard-reset the device
Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Up key until the device restarts.
Access Developer options
- Open Settings.
- Tap System.
- Choose the About Phone.
- Tap on the Build Number 7 times until the Developer options menu is available.
- Get back to the About phone section and Developer options should be there.
Reset Network Settings
- Open Settings.
- Tap System.
- Choose Reset options.
- Tap Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth.
- Confirm selection.

123...9Page 1 of 9Xiaomi Mi 5 is one of those devices that, after you take a look at the specs and price correlation, can make you doubt. Premium flagship device for such a low price? Sounds strange but it’s indeed true.
However, the Chinese manufacturer is still lacking some of the experience the greater players have. There are some issues reported on the official forums that need to be addressed if they want to maintain the status of market contenders. On the other hand, some of those can be addressed with a few tweaks here and there. The nature of software available on Xiaomi Mi 5 enables users to troubleshoot certain issues on their own.
For that purpose, we conducted a research and provided you with the list of most common issues on Mi 5. If you’re troubled with certain problems, it may be worth a while to take a look.
Battery draining
We already wrote a dedicated article about the battery drainage on Xiaomi Mi 5, but it’s worth to mention it again. This seems to be a really grave problem for many users since the beginning. To make the things even worse, updates that were presented lately barely touch on this issue. It’s hard to determine which is the main reason behind the battery drains. Some users advise switching to Chinese ROM, others are more in favor of unlocking bootloader and flashing with custom ROM as Cyanogen. We’ll make sure to explain everything in our future writings, but, for the time being, you can check these steps and hopefully decrease the battery consumption to tolerable levels.
- Disabling background apps is always a good idea. If you’re not in need of push notifications from a mail client or similar apps, you should disable them. Instead of them working continuously while the phone is idle, you can use them only when needed.
- Disable Wi-Fi scanning. This is great if you’re willing to know all available networks all the time. But, it utilizes more battery resources and you should try to disable it and look for changes.
- Auto-sync is another feature that vastly affects the battery life. You can sync manually from time to time and there so avoid battery drainage.
- Switch to Balanced mode. The Performance mode might be useful if you’re playing GPU-intensive games. If that’s not always the case, the Balanced mode is much better suited and it preserves your battery substantially.
- Change GPS mode to Device Only. Other 2 modes are using either Wi-Fi and Mobile Data and they are more precise. But, if your main concern is battery life, it’s better to keep it local.
- Switch ROM. As we already stated, there are different experiences with the different ROM’s. It’s worth a shot to change your ROM for an alternative and look for changes.
- Wipe a cache partition.
- Reset to factory settings.
Mobile Data issues
Another serious problem that emerged for some users relates to Mobile Data. As you already know, Xiaomi Mi 5 is a LTE-ready device. But, users reported complete inability to use nothing except the 3G on their devices. Moreover, even then the signal is bad and overall connection quality sub par. Frequent disconnections are making this phone completely unusable in this department. We are not sure what’s the cause of the problem, but there are still some things you can do in order to improve your experience with the device.
- Switch Network type.
- TurnAirplane mode ON and then OFF.
- Reset APN settings.
- Reset Network Settings.
- Remove SIM card and put it back again
- Wipe cache partition.
- Reset to factory settings.
- Switch the ROM.
Low network coverage
A similar problem that troubles the mobile networking affects the GSM network, as well. Namely, users are experiencing unusual drops of network coverage. If you’re using (as most people do) GSM network to make and receive calls, this is a debilitating problem since it reduces the overall call quality and denies phone’s primary function. In other words, this is a deal-breaker for many users and it completely negates the flagship status that Mi 5 has.
Since the problem is obviously similar to LTE-3G usage, we advise you to take the above-mentioned steps. Maybe through troubleshooting, you manage to improve GSM network coverage.
GPS crashes and lacks precision
This is an unusual issue to start with. Most of the modern devices rarely have GPS problems, or at least, not as grave as Mi 5. Some users measured the precision of the GPS location and it’s up to 5 times less precise than on other handsets. Others have had issues with frequent crashes of GPS which suddenly lose signal.
Most of the time, these are hardware problems and it’s only so much you can do in the software department. However, there are some workarounds that might help you to some extent:
Overheating
Overheating is always a serious problem, especially if it’s not addressed on time. Xiaomi Mi 5 users reported frequent overheating, and some of them experienced prompts that informed them about critical temperatures. There are so many things that can affect this occurrence, starting from battery behavior and intensive use while charging, and even the extended exposure to heat sources.
One way or another, you need to do something or the internal hardware parts might be affected. This can cause critical damage and render the device completely unusable. Things you should take into consideration are presented below:
- Don’t use your device during charging.
- Make sure to use only supported charger.
- Keep your device off the sunlight exposure.
- Remove the protective casing.
- Check the battery activity and kill intensive background processes.
- Take a break from time to time after intensive gaming.
Camera issues
The primary camera on Mi 5 is solid. It’s not amazing, but it should, according to specs, take above-average photos and record vivid videos. Sadly, that’s not the case for all users. They have experienced blurry photos, especially in the low-light surroundings. In addition, the front-facing camera crashes occasionally.
There’s only so much you can do, but test the camera for bugs and/or restore factory settings and switch to other ROM. Some users reported improvements on Chinese ROM.
- Restart Camera settings to default values.
- Take a hardware check of the camera.
- Wipe cache partition.
- Perform a reset to factory settings.
- Download the third-party camera app and give it a try.
- Take a device to repair since the sensor might be faulty.
Screen rotation issue
Screen rotation is present for ages, but it never was as important as nowadays with the large phablet-like screens the modern handsets pack. Vertical view enables you to enjoy more in a plethora of features, especially the video playback and certain games. Sadly, some users can’t enjoy the vertical screen as, allegedly, the screen rotation won’t work for them.
There are some things you can do in this case, and we’re presenting them below:
- Make sure that the Screen rotation is enabled.
- Reboot your device.
- Wipe cache partition.
- Switch ROM from Global to Chinese and vice versa.
- Update MIUI.
- Restore factory settings.
Additionally, it’s advised to try a custom ROM that’s not MIUI. This requires some tampering with the bootloader, so it’s highly recommended to inform yourself before you get to business.
Some users who use Mi PC Suite for backup have had issues with the backup process. Namely, they were prompted to update the phone before the backing up process commences. The awkward thing is that both their Mi 5 and system are up to date. This can be instigated by various causes, and we prepared a list of possible workarounds for the problem at hand:
- Enable USB debugging.
- Restart your device and PC prior to connecting them.
- Use Photos mode instead of File modes once prompted.
- Restore factory settings.
- Download the latest version of the Mi PC suite.
- Backup your files manually.
Sadly, this is an enormous issue that isn’t officially resolved by the Xiaomi technical support. So, all of these are more workarounds and long shots. Until they decide to resolve it, you can either manually backup your data or use cloud services to do so.
That should conclude this article. We hope that you found something useful. In case you have any questions or suggestions, we’ll be glad to answer to those. You can post them in the comments section below. Have a nice day and thanks for reading.

123...15Page 1 of 15Managing contacts is as old as phones themselves. If your first handset wasn’t a smartphone, you probably remember manually transferring all contacts from phone to phone or asking everyone for their numbers over and over again.
Luckily, these days are long gone. Technology advancements usually make many things easier for us, and so they do the way we manage contacts. Nowadays, you just need a Google account, and all your contacts will go with you. No matter how many phones you change.
The process of transferring all your contacts to your Google account is quite simple and straightforward. So, if you haven’t already, I’m sure you won’t have a hard time backing up your contacts to your Google account.
How to back up contacts in Android
Backing up your contacts to your Google account is the easiest way of keeping all your contacts in check. For this, you only need to be signed in to your Google account on your phone.
Plus, once you enable the contact sync, it will always back up your contacts, so there’s no need to repeat the procedure every time you create a new contact. Just enable the sync, and rest assured that all your contacts are permanently synced an safe.
- Go to Settings.
- Tap Accounts > Google (your email address).
- Tap Account sync.
- Make sure Contacts are enabled.
That’s it. Now all your contacts are stored in your Google account, so you can access them anywhere, not just from your phone. It’s certainly a step forward from manual transferring we had to deal with just 10 years ago.
How to export your contacts to your Google Account
If you want to export your contacts from your Google account, so you can, for example, upload them to another account, Google’s got you covered.
All you need for exporting your contacts is Google’s Contacts app. If you didn’t get this app pre-installed to your phone, go to the Play Store, and download it.
Contacts, and you’ll see the list of all the contacts stored in your Google account. To transfer your contacts from your Google Account to your phone, do the following:
If you want to import that .vcf file to another Google account, repeat the procedure above, but go to Import, and select the .vcf file you just saved.
That’s about it. As you can see, it couldn’t be simpler. If you have any comments or additional questions, just let us know in the comments below.
My transaction error my Google play store.If you’re an avid Android user and you never had the urge to check what’s eating RAM on your device, well, you’re a rarity and we salute you. For some of us, checking on background-working, RAM-hoggin apps is a must. But, once Oreo hit the deck, it’s rather hard to do it on stock Android devices.
Don’t worry, RAM usage readings aren’t completely out of the picture. They are well-hidden and today we’ll show you how to access them without trouble.
Besides the processing power, RAM was always the issue back in the days. The lack of the optimization caused the outbursts of RAM-hogging applications. But those days are in the past. Modern smartphones have a lot of RAM. Mid-budget phones with as much as 4 gigs of RAM are rather common. It’s really, like really hard to deplete the memory. And it’s a part of the muscle memory to check and clear, nonetheless.
On that note, a lot of Nougat users run various third-party applications (provided by the individual OEMs most of the time) to control the background activity and reduce the redundant RAM usage. Google is kind of going in the other, purist direction. With Oreo, they prefer the system making these changes on its own. No simple manual access, no simple prevention of the RAM-hungry background apps. And that system role seems to work just fine. Except when it doesn’t.
Even though the user’s interference is rather limiting on Android Oreo, there are still ways to check, track, or clear RAM memory. The first one concerns hidden Developer Options. The second requires a few tweaks with the built-in widget.
Check memory within the Developer Options
Developers Options are there from the start. They’re, for some reason, hidden and require a gimmicky sequence to access them. However, once you’re there, you can check and track the RAM usage, starting from the system and reaching to individual apps.
This aforementioned sequence mostly requires accessing the System settings > About phone on your device and tapping the Build number 7 times. We said ‘mostly’ because there are some OEMs which require different input in order to access the Developer Options. You might want to look up your device online if the conventional way won’t work.
Here’s how to check the RAM usage on Oreo with Developer Options:
- Tap Settings
- Open System settings.
- Tap About phone.
- Tap 7 times continuously on the Build number to enable the Developer Options.
- Open Developer Options and look for Memory or Running processes.
- Tap this option and you should see the RAM usage with real-time readings.
In addition, you can choose to track RAM usage at different intervals, starting with the hourly check.
Use a widget to monitor RAM usage
With that said, we’ll focus only on the system provided tools. In the end – that’s the main idea behind this article. What you’ll need to do in this scenario is to create a Settings widget and choose Memory from the list. After that, you’ll have the complete insight in largest RAM consumers.
Here’s how to do it in a few simple steps:
- Tap and hold on the Home screen empty space until the Customization menu pops up.
- Choose Widgets.
- Find Settings and drag Settings icon to empty Home screen space.
- From there, select Memory from the list of various shortcuts.
- That’s it. Now you can check RAM whenever you want.
This should give you enough insight on RAM-hogging apps so you can disable them timely. Have in mind that some system apps can’t be disabled or if they can, it won’t perform as usual. Concerning the third-party apps, if they make your RAM usage hit the ceiling, navigate to Settings > Apps and eliminate them.
On that note, we can wrap it up. In case you have some questions or points to make concerning the RAM usage on Oreo, speak your mind. The comments section is just below.
why can’t we have a mobile data switch in the notifications drop dow like it used to be on earlier versions of Android? I have a very limited data plan, but a lot of wifi.Samsung is at the top of the smartphone market for a reason. Besides their flagship devices, they went for an overhaul in the mid-range and budget departments last year, by introducing a revamped A series. Later in 2019, they expanded the formation with the Samsung Galaxy A51 and A71. In all accounts, the Samsung Galaxy A71 is one of the most competitive devices in the mid-range segment to date.
There are good and there are great devices but there’s no device without any issues. For all Samsung Galaxy A71 users out there, we decided to roam the interweb and check for reports, complaints, and straight-up rants concerning this device. The issues along with solutions can be found below.

- Troubleshooting steps for the Samsung Galaxy A71
1. Battery draining
Based on many test ratings, the Samsung Galaxy A71 is at the top of the endurance list in its category. Despite it packs a large display, the 4500 mAh battery and quite a power-efficient Snapdragon 730 (Exynos 980 on the 5G variation) should bring great Screen-on Time.
Sadly, that’s not the case for many users who reported battery drains and underwhelming endurance. For some, the device drains the battery even in the idle mode, when the screen is off for some time. Others have strange battery percentage spikes which lead us to believe that the battery isn’t calibrated.
We have a standard list of tweaks you can follow to prolong the battery life. Here’s what you need to do:
- Disable background apps.
- Disable Wi-Fi, Location Services, and Mobile Data overnight.
- Ensure that the network signal is strong. If the device is constantly searching for network coverage, it will deplete the battery quickly.
- Disable Auto-brightness and set the brightness manually.
You can learn how to calibrate the battery in this dedicated article.
2. Apps crashing on the Samsung Galaxy A71
This is a major problem for some users and, based on reports, the built-in SMS app is mostly the one crashing. Apparently, this started occurring after a system update. Firstly, you’ll need to ensure that your device is up to date. Secondly, navigating to Settings > Apps > Messages and clear the data from the app.
3. Headphone jack issues
Unlike many devices in this pricing segment, Samsung decided to keep the headphone jack on the Samsung Galaxy A71. However, some users are unable to use their headphones for no apparent reason.
All and every headphone with a 3.5 mm jack should work on the device. If that’s not the case for you, make sure to inspect the state of the headphone or buds. If the issue persists, the hardware is likely the problem so we recommend asking for the replacement.
4. Bluetooth issues
Bluetooth issues on recent Samsung devices are widely acknowledged, even by Samsung, but they are not fixed for everyone. Users are still experiencing unstable pairing and frequent disconnections. Especially when playing wireless audio on headphones, buds, or in-car systems.
We have a few recommendations to try in order to fix or improve the Bluetooth connectivity on your Samsung Galaxy A71. Follow the steps below:
- Restart your device.
- Unpair and pair your handset again with the device.
- Disable Bluetooth A2DP Hardware Offload in Developer Options.
- Reset Network Settings.
5. Mobile data issues on the Samsung Galaxy A71
As seen on multiple user forums, connectivity problems keep piling on Samsung mid-range devices. Some users have had a hard time with network signal coverage while others simply can get mobile data to work consistently. Seemingly, the device disconnects once the screen is off.
We can’t say with certainty why this problem occurs but here are some tricks you can try in order to fix it:
Also, don’t forget that the carrier can have a part in this so make sure to contact your carrier support if the issue persists.
As we said in the previous paragraph, the issues with connectivity are quite common on the Samsung Galaxy A71. And the worst one concerns Wi-Fi connectivity that falls short of expectations considering this is, all-around, a great device.
Constant disconnections (especially with the screen off), slow Wi-Fi connection, or instances when the device won’t connect at all. With that in mind, we read about some updates pushed by Samsung that addressed the problem. On the other hand, some reports are quite recent which makes us believe that Wi-Fi still needs some tweaking done on this device.
In the meanwhile, try these steps in order to, if not fix, at least mitigate the problem at hand:
- Enable Airplane mode and disable it.
- Forget the network and re-connect.
- Restart your phone and router.
- Reset Network Settings.
If you are unable to install the Samsung Pay app on your device, chances are that the service isn’t available in your region. The app usually comes pre-installed in supported regions.
You can try to sideload the APK or use a VPN but we don’t recommend the former as it is risky and can lead to data theft. On the other hand, if you are certain that Samsung Pay is indeed supported in your region, make sure to update your device and check Samsung’s Store.
Like many other OEMs, besides the on-screen optical fingerprint, the Samsung A71 offers face recognition as an alternative biometric authentication. Wake the screen, look at it, and the device should unlock without in no time. However, some users have had a hard time utilizing this option, as the device can’t recognize them, even after numerous tries.
What we suggest is deleting your face data and enrolling it again. Make sure to add glasses if you are wearing them. Also, keep the distance from the screen and make sure that you are in a well-light area.
9. No system sound or in-call sound
In comparison to issues with the headphones jack, the complete or partial absence of system sounds is definitely a bigger problem. Namely, some user reports state that there’s no notification sound while others have problems with charging sound.
Make sure to navigate to Settings > Apps and check Notification settings for each app that doesn’t come with sound. Alternatively, if you are having issues with the in-call sound, make sure to clear the mic and restart the device. If that doesn’t help, consider resetting your device to factory settings.
10. The camera freezing and video issues
We can’t argue about the multi-lens camera setup on the Samsung Galaxy A71, but the software part seems to be quite underwhelming for some users. It seems that the Camera app freezes when switching lenses and modes, it takes a lot of time to capture a photo when the HDR is enabled, etc.
To add insult to injury, video mode won’t work for many users, as well. If you are experiencing any issues with the Camera app, make sure to check the steps we listed below:
- Clear data and cache from the Camera app in Settings > Apps.
- Wipe cache partition.
- Check the in-app settings and ensure that HDR is disabled if you dislike it.
- Update your firmware.
11. Random shutdowns after update
Random shutdowns, bootloops, or system crashes are something no one wants to see. However, based on reports, that’s exactly what some users experienced on the Samsung Galaxy A71 as soon as they updated the device.
We can only suggest wiping the cache partition and, if that fails, resetting your device to factory settings. Just in case the issue persists, make sure to send a ticket to your carrier or retailer.
12. Display multitouch and black spot issues
Besides possible burn-in issues, Super AMOLED displays rarely have anything else going against them. However, some Samsung Galaxy A71 users reported multitouch issues, as the screen won’t respond to more inputs than 2.
Additionally, in certain conditions (both Dark Mode and Night Light modes enabled while brightness is low), some users noticed black spots in the background.
Our recommended solution for the multitouch issues is testing first (insert the *#0*# code in the Dialer) and then resetting the device if the issue persists. It doesn’t mean that this is a system-wide problem. Some third-party apps might be affected only.
For the black spots in the background, we can only recommend replacing the device. This is a panel issue and it’s hardly anything you can do except to try and ignore it (if it doesn’t bother you) or take it for the repair or replacement.
13. Gyroscope and proximity sensor issues
Some users have had a hard time with both gyroscope and magnetic sensors. Now, judging by reports, this is probably a software optimization issue and, by updating your device, you should be able to resolve it. You can also access the *#0*# code in the Dialer (Phone app) and try and calibrate both sensors.
The same goes for the proximity sensor that is hit or miss sometimes. It won’t turn off the screen during calls for some users occasionally. Try restarting your device, make sure to keep it up to date and, if sensor issues persist, backing up everything, and resetting the device isn’t the worse idea.
14. The Samsung Galaxy A71 is overheating
Another problem that occasionally bothers Samsung Galaxy A71 users. It seems that the device is getting quite hot when charging and during extensive gaming sessions. Now, there might be some problem with the kernel on your firmware, so make sure to report the problem to Samsung support.
On the other hand, you can reduce overheating by removing the protective casing while charging or playing demanding games. Also, we don’t recommend using your device while fast charging.

Theoretically, this feature would enable playing YouTube videos outside the app. But only if YouTube allows it.
Turns out, YouTube doesn’t allow it. Users who installed iOS 14 were fast to discover that nothing changed. If you’re a premium subscriber, the app will only play background sound. If you’re a free user, you got nothing. You’ll only see and hear a video inside the YouTube app.
Those persistent enough even found a trick used by Android folks for years. That is to play YouTube in a browser, preferably Safari, and get back to Home Screen to leave the playback in PIP. But YouTube was ready. When you try to do this, the playback stops immediately, regardless of your Premium status. There are some reports, however, that this method works on iPads running iOS 14, but iPhone users were left hanging.
Even though it left many users in disappointment, this move from YouTube’s side should come as no surprise. The ongoing (silent) war between Apple and Google is well-known. As two of the most influential companies in the world, both sides are fighting for dominance. And amid that fight, users are usually caught in-between. While it doesn’t make sense for each company to ban its products on the rival’s platform, they still limit their products just enough to strike a blow, but not enough to drive the users off.
That’s exactly what YouTube’s doing here. The whole experience is almost equal on both iOS and Android, but the Android version is a bit more equal. And if we take into account that YouTube even considers background playback to be a highlight premium feature, the picture gets clear.
Will YouTube ever allow Picture-in-Picture on iOS? It’s hard to say. The way things are looking now, I don’t think it’ll happen soon. In fact, I was pessimistic about this even when Apple announced iOS 14, and noting’s changed since then.
How to play YouTube Picture-in-Picture on iOS 14
Where does this whole situation leave us? Is it really impossible to play YouTube in the PiP mode whatsoever? Well, as it turns out, there is a way. However, it requires some work and it’ll make you wonder whether it’s even worth the hassle. Nevertheless, I’ll show you the trick, and leave it to you to decide if it’s worth doing or not.
