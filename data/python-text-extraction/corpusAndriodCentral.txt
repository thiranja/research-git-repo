Oculus Quest 2 64GB
Extra room
Oculus Quest 2 256GB
Both versions of the Oculus Quest 2 support the same features and have the same library of games. The only difference is the amount of storage available and the price of each device. The Oculus Quest 2 is available now starting at $299.
Oculus Quest 2 64GB vs. Oculus Quest 2 256GB: What's the difference?
Storage and price: Those are the only factors to look at when comparing these devices. They both support all of the same games and features, and the form factor is also the same, so they work with the same accessories. They're even the same colors. The only difference is the amount of storage available and the price.
The price jump might be the main deciding factor for users because you don't give anything up when you opt for the option with more abundant storage.

The Oculus Quest 2 can be used for gaming and media, but many people will only store games directly on the device. Oculus Quest games vary in size, but even large ones are small enough that you can keep several on the Quest. For example, on my original Oculus Quest, Robo Recall: Unplugged takes up 2.87GB, Vader Immortal: Episode I takes up 2.58GB, and SUPERHOT VR uses 5.17GB.
Some well-recognized games are even smaller. Beat Saber only took up 2.95GB on my original Oculus Quest when I had songs sideloaded onto it. Media apps are relatively tiny, though the media you play on them can take up space.
Oculus Quest 2 64GB vs. Oculus Quest 2 256GB: How much storage do you really need?
If you're trying to be savvy with your money, or you don't want to pay for the storage you won't use, then it's crucial to examine how you plan to use the Oculus Quest 2 and figure out how much room you need.
If you're a hardcore gamer and you want to download a lot of titles on your Oculus Quest 2, then you should opt for the 256GB variant of the headset. The Oculus Quest 2 doesn't have a microSD card slot, so once it's full, you'll have to delete games or media to free up space.
If you plan to uninstall games as you get bored with them or finish them, then you're probably going to be just fine with the 64GB version.
One important thing to note is that games requiring Oculus Link, such as Half-Life: Alyx, don't take up additional storage on your Oculus Quest 2. This is a good thing since PCVR games can be massive. The games are stored on whatever PC you use to power your Oculus Link games, so you'll need to have space on your PC. Both the 64GB and 256GB versions of the Oculus Quest 2 can run games through Oculus Link, so if you're looking to connect your Oculus Quest 2 to your PC, either will work.
Oculus Quest 2 64GB vs. Oculus Quest 2 256GB: 64GB is enough (for most)
While games vary in size, they aren't large enough to require the 256GB variant of the Oculus Quest 2 for most people.
If you're the type of user that plays a specific set of games at a time and then removes them from a device, then you probably don't need to spend the extra money for an additional 192GB of storage.
If budget isn't a factor for you, or you want to make it more likely that you can always store your games and media on your VR headset, then you should get the 256GB variant. You don't give up any features when you increase storage size, so it's a one-time investment to get a better device.
As a bonus, Facebook upped the storage maximum for the Oculus Quest 2 when compared to the original Oculus Quest. Spending an extra $100 on an Oculus Quest 2 gets you for times the storage of the cheaper variant. Again, you might not need that extra storage, but it's a good bargain.
No matter which storage variant of the headset you choose, you'll get a great device. The Oculus Quest 2 earned an excellent score in our review and builds upon the already great original Oculus Quest.
Enough for most
Oculus Quest 2 64GB
Budget-friendly with enough storage for many users
The 64GB version of the Oculus Quest 2 supports all the same features and games as the larger version. While it's unfortunate that there isn't a microSD card slot, it has enough space for users who only keep specific games on their device at a time.
Room to work with
Oculus Quest 2 256GB
Enough storage for a larger library
This version with a larger storage capacity will be able to keep more games and media on your device at once. While it still doesn't have a microSD slot, it can store multiple games and several larger media files.

With so many choices staring you in the face, it can be difficult to know which ones are actually worth your time. After spending several hours testing the ENACFIRE E60 Wireless Earbuds, I can say that these are indeed worthwhile earbuds to consider. They provide really good sound for the cost and the design makes them a great choice whether you're working out, commuting, or traveling.
Music buddies
ENACFIRE E60 Wireless Earbuds

ENACFIRE E60 Wireless Earbuds What I like
These are really impressive earphones given their low cost. If you like them enough that you want to buy them, they come in five different colors: black, white, grey, blue, and red.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
Great fit Three different sizes
I have relatively small earholes, so finding a set of wireless earbuds that actually fit without hurting is often a challenge. The ENACFIRE E60 comes with six sets, two pairs for each of the three sizes. Not only was I able to choose the set that fit me best, but I also have a backup pair in case something happens to the ones I'm currently using.
You can adjust music volume, skip tracks, answer/hang-up phone calls, or even pause your tunes simply by tapping the side of the earbuds.
Touch controls Just a tap away
Syncing the earbuds to my phone was a cinch. You simply pull one of the earbuds out of the case when you first get it and the pairing process begins. Once connected, you can adjust music volume, skip tracks, answer/hang-up phone calls, or even pause your tunes simply by tapping the side of the earbuds.
The earphones have CVC8.0 noise-canceling, so while they don't cancel incoming sounds for me when I'm wearing them, anyone I talk to via phone or computer has a better listening experience. That of course makes these great for business or professional use. I tested the CVC noise canceling by initiating a phone call while standing next to a running robot vacuum. The hum of the vacuum completely canceled out when I wasn't talking. However when I spoke, those on the phone could only hear a faint humming. It won't keep out the sounds of screaming children or loud vehicles driving by, but it will significantly reduce them. Additionally, the microphone allows my voice to travel clearly and loudly for others to hear. These earbuds are really rather impressive given how cheap they are.
Sound quality & battery life Excellent given the price
The sound quality isn't mind-blowing, but considering that these devices only cost $40 they're very good. The volume has a decent range and the speakers handle both high and low tones quite nicely. I had my husband wear them while I was standing next to him and barely could hear any sounds coming from them, even though they were at a relatively high volume. Because of this, they are a great option for those who frequently travel via plane or use public transportation.
I never once ran out of juice while using these buds. That's thanks to the impressive eight-hour battery life and the convenient charging case. To charge, you simply place the buds into their slots and they'll receive juice during transit. The charging case has a USB-C port on the backside and it also supports wireless charging, so you just have to plug it in every night or place it on a charging pad to prepare it for the next day's use.
ENACFIRE E60 Wireless Earbuds What I don't like
Though they are impressive earbuds overall, the ENACFIRE E60 aren't perfect.
Accidental taps A little too easy to adjust
Wearing earbuds isn't the most comfortable experience for me. I tend to press the earbuds into my ears every few seconds to get rid of pressure or air bubbles. However, since the ENACFIRE E60 has touch controls, I often accidentally paused my music or ended phone calls when I didn't mean to. This wouldn't be a problem if the command space was smaller, but since it takes up the entire flat surface, it's very easy to accidentally press. Now, I eventually got used to pressing it further into my ears by grasping the sides of the earbud, but it was an adjustment.
Waterproof but not worth getting wet A frustrating shower experience
It's starting to get a bit chilly outside, so instead of jumping into a river I opted to test the waterproof claim by using them in the shower. While the ENACFIRE E60 Earbuds have a waterproof rating of IPX8, I don't recommend using them in the shower or pool. Once my head got wet, it became difficult to keep them from sliding out of my ears. One of them even fell to the floor and made me worry that it might have sustained permanent damage.
Plus, the falling droplets changed the volume of my music and even stopped songs in their tracks multiple times when they hit the ENACFIRE's touch sensors. The one good thing that came from wearing them was that they prevented shampoo and conditioner from getting in my ears, but you shouldn't spend $40 for water plugs.
You can use them if it's sprinkling outside or if you're getting a little sweaty at the gym, but I'd refrain from really getting these wet.
No app Cannot adjust sound balance
This isn't too surprising considering that these aren't top of the line earbuds, but the ENACFIRE E60 doesn't have an app, nor does it have equalizing controls to help you balance out the sound of your music. If that's something you really want, you're going to have to look at another more-expensive option.
ENACFIRE E60 Wireless Earbuds Competition
If you're wanting to stick with a low price point, then you should also consider the Anker Soundcore Liberty Neo. Battery life only lasts for about five hours, but they offer really good sound, have a IPX7 water resistance rating, and also come with a charging case.
Anyone looking for a high-end set of wireless earbuds should definitely consider Samsung Galaxy Buds+. They come in four different colors, have great sound quality, last up to 11 hours, and you can customize controls.
The Jabra Elite 65t are quite a bit more expensive than the ENACFIRE E60, but they offer great sound quality, have roughly 7.5 hours of battery life, work with an intuitive app, and also come with a charging case.
ENACFIRE E60 Wireless Earbuds Should you buy it?
You should buy this if...
Anyone looking for something inexpensive
Considering the ENACFIRE has touch controls, decent sound quality, and comes with a charging case it's really well priced. You could spend a lot more money for something with more options, but this is the perfect choice for anyone wanting something quality at a low price.
People who travel or commute regularly
The small charging case slips perfectly into your pocket, bag, or purse so you can take them with you just about anywhere. What's more, hardly any sound bleeds from the speakers while you're in place, so you won't disturb others with your music while wearing them.
Anyone looking for earbuds with easy touch controls
There are plenty of cheap earbuds out there, but these ones allow you to adjust the volume and skip tracks simply by tapping the sides.
You should not buy this if...
Anyone looking for the very best sound quality
While these have good sound quality for the cost, they definitely aren't the best money can buy. For more astute music consumers, you'll likely want something else.
People who want wireless earbuds that work with an app
Unlike some other wireless earbuds out there, these ones do not integrate with their own personal app. So if you want a pair that you can make adjustments to or add specific setting options to while using your phone, you might want to look elsewhere.
Music lovers who want to adjust sound balance
Sometimes the default settings on music devices aren't perfect and need tweaking before they're good to go. Unfortunately, there's no way to adjust the sound balance on these earbuds, so if that's something you absolutely need then these won't be a good fit.
If you're looking for the very best sound quality you can buy, these probably won't fit your needs. However, the ENACFIRE E60 Wireless earbuds are impressive little devices that produce good sound quality and provide plenty of conveniences at a low cost. If you're looking for something cheap to make video calls and listen to your music these are a great option to go with.
They offer a long battery life, have an IPX8 waterproof rating, and come with a convenient charging case that works with both a USB-C cable or wireless charging pads. They'll stay in during your working out, are perfect for your regular commute, and since they hardly leak any sound, they're great while traveling on a plane.

Everything you need is in the box, and its sensors are built into the headset. The device even now supports Playspace Scanning, which helps you even more to avoid tripping on your environment.
- Standalone virtual reality: Oculus Quest ($399 at Amazon)
Insight tracking
The Oculus Quest has an array of four wide-angle cameras built into the device. These are in lieu of any external sensors, towers, or cameras that are common among other headsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. These cameras help power Oculus Insight, the headset's tracking system that maps out the area you're in real life, tracks your movement, and tracks your Touch Controllers.
The Oculus Quest supports six degrees of freedom tracking. This means that the Oculus Quest can track your movement up, down, left, right, forward, and back. As a result, the Oculus Quest can track your movements as you move around a room in any direction. It's an essential part of gameplay for games like SUPERHOT VR, which requires you to twist around, dodge bullets, and maneuver around enemies.
In addition to the headset tracking your movements, the Oculus Quest tracks your controllers. All of these sensors work together to create an immersive experience without requiring any external sensors.
While you don't need any external sensors, you do need to make sure that there's light in the room that you use the Oculus Quest. It doesn't have to be extremely bright, but as the device relies on cameras, they need to be able to "see" things. You can use the Oculus Quest in a room with a single overhead lightbulb though, so in most cases, you don't need to set up any additional lighting specifically for VR.
Guardian protection
Because the Oculus Quest doesn't need any external sensors, you're going to use it in a much wider variety of spaces than a headset that requires tethering to a computer and external sensors to track movement. You can use it in your living room, pop it in a case, and take it to a party, and then bring it home and play games in your office. Because of this, the Oculus Guardian system is arguably more important on the Oculus Quest than it is on any other headset.
The Guardian system allows you to map out a room and tell your Oculus Quest what area is safe to play in. You can set this up quickly and easily and then the device remembers the boundaries you've set up, even as you move around. It's easy to lose track of where you are in reality, so having a virtual grid helps make sure you don't end up punching a wall or kicking a sofa.
Any time you turn on the Oculus Quest, it will scan its surroundings and attempt to identify any saved playspaces. Each time you power the Quest on, it will either ask you to confirm the existing boundary that it found, or draw a new boundary in the room. This works by using the cameras on the headset and gives you a visual look at the room, complete with a grid on the floor. You'll use your controller or hands to draw a line around the border of your playspace, and the Oculus Quest will remember this boundary no matter where you walk in your room.
A new feature, found in Oculus firmware version 17 and beyond, gives the Oculus Quest the ability to detect objects that have made their way into your playspace and then warn you before they get in your way. This new Playspace Scanning feature will highlight errant objects in red and urge you to move them out of the playspace before running into them. You can also now choose between three different colors for your Guardian grid, as seen in the image above. It's a great way to ensure you are safe while playing roomscale VR. You can read more about the feature here.

- NordVPN: Well known option which is reliable, secure, and has clients for everything.
- PIA VPN: Perfect for beginners and experienced users.

Overall, the best Android VPN is ExpressVPN. It has the most servers in the most locations worldwide but has 100Mbps download speeds, the fastest available of any VPN service. You get unmatched customer support, easy to use apps, and more as well.
1. ExpressVPN
Best Android VPN for most users
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 3,000+ | Server Locations: 160 in 94 countries | Trial Period: 30 days
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$12.95||0%||$12.95 at ExpressVPN|
|6 Months||$9.99||23%||$59.95 at ExpressVPN|
|15 Months||$6.67||49%||$99.95 at ExpressVPN|
Pros:
- Servers in 94 countries
- Fast download speed
- Great customer support
- App support for various platforms
Cons:
ExpressVPN has over 3,000 servers in 94 countries. This is the most servers and locations than any other VPN service. Plus, when connected you will have access to download speeds of up to 100Mbps. This is over 40 percent faster than other VPNs and is fast enough to support TV and movie watching without experiencing buffering or slowdown on your device. On top of protecting your online identity, ExpressVPN also ensures your texts and instant messages are kept secure from being intercepted by encrypting all outgoing information from your device. You can tunnel the VPN service on your device to designate which apps use the VPN and which you're comfortable using without the added VPN protection.
All information sent from your device and through ExpressVPN is encrypted using the highest encryption code available. There is an automatic kill switch with this VPN that will block your personal information when either your internet or VPN connection goes down. My only complaint is that ExpressVPN is much more expensive compared to other VPN services I checked out. Even with the discount for paying a year in advance rather than month-to-month is pricier than other programs. However, with unlimited bandwidth and no cap on how many devices can be connected at once, the cost may be ultimately worth it.
Be sure to check out our full ExpressVPN review and get started with the service today.
ExpressVPN
ExpressVPN has more servers in more countries to help you tap into any information you need while keeping your online activity secure and private.
The rest of the best Android VPN options
There are a lot of VPN providers out there, each of them offering something a little different in an attempt to stand out above the others. While ExpressVPN is our best Android VPN pick for most people, that doesn't mean it ticks every box for every person. It's not the cheapest, not quite the fastest, may not have the most servers, but that's where you need to decide what the most important part to you is. Each service offers some good and some sacrifice.
Luckily, we've taken the guesswork out of finding another VPN provider beyond ExpressVPN. Here are the rest of the best Android VPN options that you can sign up for now. We also highlighted all the best free Android VPNs in case you are looking to get started without spending any money.
2. Surfshark
The best affordable Android VPN option
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, BBC iPlayer, Amazon | Servers: 1,700+ | Server Locations: 100+ in 63 countries | Trial Period: 30 days
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$11.95||0%||$11.95 at Surfshark|
|6 Months||$6.49||50%||$38.94 at Surfshark|
|24 Months||$2.49||81%||$59.76 at Surfshark|
Pros:
- Fast download speeds
- Unlimited device connections
- One of the most affordable options
Cons:
- Not compatible with streaming apps
- Privacy policy is vague
Surfshark's download speeds vary between 68Mbps and 70Mbps, but that is fast and consistent enough to not experience a slowdown or buffering while using this VPN. Plus, you get unlimited device connects with a single account, so everyone in your family can use Surfshark on their cellphones, tablets, and even home computers.
This VPN doesn't work well with streaming apps. It better designed to work with devices like the Amazon Fire Stick and Roku. It does work if you log into your TV streaming service through a web browser. The biggest caution with Surfshark, however, is its no-log policy. While Surfshark is located outside of the U.S. and has a no-log policy, it's worded strangely and isn't clear at all. It sounds and feels like there are loopholes in the policy that may allow some logs to be kept. Surfshark may not be aware of how confusing its official policy is, and it may not keep any user information at all. I wish it was a bit more clearly written out it Surfshark's official policy.
Surfshark
Surfshark has impressive download speeds and automatically connects to the fastest available server. Also, connect unlimited devices at once.
3. NordVPN
Top-notch security from well-known brand
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, iPlayer, Amazon | Servers: 5,300+ | Server Locations: 80+ in 59 countries | Trial Period: 30 days
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$11.95||0%||$11.95 at NordVPN|
|12 Months||$6.99||41%||$83.88 at NordVPN|
|24 Months||$3.49||70%||$83.76 at NordVPN|
|36 Months||$3.49||70%||$125.64 at NordVPN|
Pros:
- Dual encryption
- 1,000 servers in 57 countries
- No logging
Cons:
No VPN is as secure as NordVPN. While every VPN service encrypts your data, NordVPN sends it through a second server and encrypts it again, just to make sure if it is intercepted your information can't be stolen. Because of this double encryption, it does cause some slowdown to your connection, especially during the initial startup or when downloading large files. But the average download speeds for NordVPN is still 70Mbps, which is still really impressive and fast.
NordVPN has 5,600 servers in 54 countries. This isn't the most servers or locations, but it's up there in the top five. Each time you log in with this VPN service, you are given the choice of being assigned a random IP address or to have a dedicated IP address. In both cases, your information is encrypted as it leaves your computer making it hard for adware, trackers, and snoops to figure out your location and IP address. However, it's a little easier to break through when using a dedicated IP address.
NordVPN
NordVPN passes your info through one server then sends the encrypted data through a second server to ensure it's hard to decipher.
4. Private Internet Access
Easy to use and get started with
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 3,300+ | Server Locations: 65+ in 45+ countries | Trial Period: 30 days
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$9.95||0%||$9.95 at PIA|
|6 Months||$5.99||23$||$35.95 at PIA|
|12 Months||$2.85||49%||$39.95 at PIA|
Pros:
- Military-grade encryption
- Connect 10 devices
- Unlimited bandwidth
Cons:
- Fewer locations than other services
- Based in the U.S.
Private Internet Access connects quickly to one of its 3,300 servers in 29 countries and encrypts all outgoing and incoming information to keep your online identity private and secure. It has an average download speed of 25Mbps, which is fast enough for use with TV streaming services and allows up to 10 devices to be connected at one time before requiring you to purchase another account. And you get unlimited bandwidth, so you don't' have to worry about your connection slowing down after reaching a monthly data cap.
Private Internet Access includes a firewall to monitor and block unwanted internet communications with your computer and internet connection. This is especially helpful when connected to public WiFi. This VPN service is based in the U.S., however. Because of this, there may be personal information and some activity logs kept by Private Internet Access. Usually, this information isn't held for very long when a VPN service does collect information, 30 days max.
Private Internet Access
This VPN service will never throttle or stop your service because it doesn't place usage restrictions on your VPN account.
5. PureVPN
Great for those who stream a lot of media
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 3,000+ | Server Locations: 160 in 94 countries | Trial Period: 31 days
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|7-Day Trial||$0.99||NA||$1 at PureVPN|
|1 Month||$10.95||0%||$10.95 at PureVPN|
|6 Months||$8.33||24%||$49.95 at PureVPN|
|Annual||$6.49||40%||$77.88 at PureVPN|
Pros:
- Good for TV streaming
- 300,000 IP addresses
- Automatic kill switch
Cons:
- Caps number of devices
- Few servers and locations
PureVPN is one of our favorite services. It's easy to use, secure, quick to connect to, and stays connected without a problem. You can get it for a decent price, it allows five devices to connect at once, and has an impressive download speed average of 60Mbps. This is fast enough to support streaming services and devices, including AndroidTV. Plus, PureVPN is one of the few services that will give you a dedicated IP address. This is helpful when streaming some live TV services, like Hulu, that rely on a static IP address.
You can choose to connect to any of PureVPN's over 2,000 servers. And since it has more than 300,000 IP addresses, it will be very hard for any website, cookies, trackers, etc., to monitor your online activity. Plus, it has an automatic kill switch that will block personal information, including your physical IP address, if your connection drops. The only reason PureVPN doesn't make it to the top is that it has fewer servers and locations than my number one choice. Its download speeds are also slower by 40Mbps. But PureVPN is still a solid choice for keeping your online identity safe and is excellent for tapping into tv streaming services.
PureVPN
PureVPN protects you as you stream TV apps. It's compatible with most viewing apps, devices, and browser accounts.
6. TunnelBear
Best Android VPN for beginners
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 1,000+ | Server Locations: 23+ | Trial Period: 30 days
|Plan Options||Total Price|
|Free||Free at TunnelBear|
|Unlimited||From $3.33/mo at TunnelBear|
|Teams||$5.75 per user/mo at TunnelBear|
Pros:
- Free option
- Easy interface
- Flexible
- Choose IP address location
Cons:
- No torrent support
- No automatic kill switch
- Fewer servers than other picks
If you want to try out a VPN without providing a credit card or other personal information, we suggest looking at TunnelBear. Its free version caps access at 500MB per month, which goes quickly, but it's enough to get a feel and idea of how a VPN works. You can always upgrade to a paid account to get unlimited access or downgrade back to the free service. With a paid subscription, you will always be connected to the TunnelBear VPN when your cell phone is on. If it detects an unsafe network attempting to connect to your phone, or if something happens to your internet connection, TunnelBear automatically blocks sensitive files and information on your device from being swiped.
TunnelBear doesn't have as many servers or locations compared to my top pick. It has servers in 20 countries total. It also doesn't support torrenting, which is a person-to-person file sharing technique. TunnelBear also isn't the best VPN to use if you're trying to use one to stream TV. However, if you're just starting out in the VPN world and want to test the waters, TunnelBear is a great way to do it.
TunnelBear
This is a good app to get your feet wet using a VPN with its free service and easy-to-use interface.
7. Hotspot Shield
A fully-featured free VPN for Android
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, YouTube | Servers: 3,200+ | Server Locations: 130+ in 80+ countries | Trial Period: 45 days
|Plan Options||Total Price|
|Basic||Free at Hotspot Shield|
|Premium||$2.99/mo at Hotspot Shield|
Pros:
- Automatically connects
- Secure encryption
- Good for securing public Wi-Fi
Cons:
- No direct app protection
- Reps hard to connect with
Hotspot Shield is a neat little VPN app that looks closely at your connection and information leaving and coming into your device, especially when connected to public Wi-Fi. Hotspot Shield encrypts all of your outgoing information using AES 256-bit encryption, the same level used by military organizations and financial institutions to secure their data. Hotspot Shield has over 3,200 servers in 80 countries to ensure you can connect quickly and easily to its service. You can set this VPN to automatically connect each time to open a browser or when you start your phone, so you don't have to remember to do it manually.
This VPN service doesn't work well to secure individual apps. This isn't a problem normally since apps are technically covered and secured when the VPN is enabled on the device itself. However, it does interfere with TV streaming apps, like Hulu, Netflix, and others. The workaround to watch these programs is through a browser.
Hotspot Shield
It doesn't take much for Hotspot Shield to automatically enable its VPN protections and secure all your data with military-grade encryption.
8. ProtonVPN
The most secure VPN for Android users
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 800+ | Server Locations: 50+ | Trial Period: 30 days
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|Monthly||Free||NA||Free at ProtonVPN|
|1 Month||$10||0%||$10 at ProtonVPN|
|12 Months||$8||20%||$96 at ProtonVPN|
|24 Months||$6.63||34%||$159 at ProtonVPN|
Pros:
Cons:
- Free customers get lower speeds during peak times
Odds are that you've heard of ProtonMail before, the ultra-secure email service that offers full encryption. Well, the same company offers a VPN service that brings the same level of security-focus to your Android device. There are free and paid plans, which is awesome since you can get started with a free plan and then upgrade if you want more features. The free plan doesn't require a payment method, but does have some limitations like you can only use it on a single device at a time and you'll notice slower speeds during peak hours.
The company is Swiss-based so you don't have to worry about logging laws or anything silly like that. If you are unsure about a VPN or the benefits that it could bring to you, we highly recommend checking this one out.
ProtonVPN
ProtonVPN offers a free VPN connection for a single device with no data limis, but the company does offer lower speeds to free customers during peak times.
Bottom Line
Using a (VPN) when you're online is becoming increasingly important these days. While the internet is a public space, a VPN adds an extra layer of privacy to all your connections. Not everyone out there has bad intentions, but do you want to leave all of your personal banking information, passwords, and more unsecured in hopes that everyone around is minding their own business? We think not.
We have already looked at and tested the best VPN services across all platforms, and ExpressVPN is the top pick for anyone looking for an Android VPN. It handles encrypting your data, securing your connection and keeping download speed fast so you can't even tell your internet connection is filtering through a VPN. It has over 3,000 servers in nearly 100 countries, and offers excellent customer service.

Android VPN FAQs
Now that we've gone over alll the best Android VPN provider options, you may be a little confused still about why you need a VPN or what it could do to improve your life. Let's take a look at some of the basics about VPNs and help you in the right direction.
Should you get a free or paid Android VPN?
Whether you use a free VPN or paid VPN is a bit of a personal preference, but there are things that you'll need to consider. There are a few great VPN providers that offer free services, but it's worth noting that these companies often have some restrictions in place or less features than a paid counterpart. Sometimes companies will only offer 500MB of data for each month, or 2GB per month, which means that you won't be able to protect as much data through the service each month.
Can you leave an Android VPN connected at all times?
Short answer: yes. You can opt to leave your Android device connected to a VPN at all times without worry, as long as you pick the provider. You will need to make sure that the service that you sign up for does not have a limited bandwidth option for each month. Some of them only offer 5GB per month while others offer an unlimited amount of bandwidth per month.
We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:
1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).
2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad.
We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services. Consuming pirated content that is paid-for is neither endorsed nor approved by Future Publishing.

With them installed, you can automatically lock doors at night, get an instant live view of your porch when motion is detected, and receive an alert if someone unlocks your door, among other useful features. We've rounded up the best doorbells and locks with SmartThings integration.
- Top Pick: Ring Video Doorbell Pro
- Battery-powered protection: Ring Video Doorbell 3
- Easy installation, tough security: August Smart Lock Pro
- Upgrade on a favorite: August Wi-Fi Smart Lock
- Keyless entry: Yale Assure Lock SL
- Affordable Pinpad: Kwikset Smart Code 888
Top Pick: Ring Video Doorbell Pro
This wired doorbell has a 160º FOV, pre-roll video footage, adjustable motion, and privacy zones, and both Alexa and SmartThings support. Whenever it senses motion or someone presses the button, you can trigger notifications, turn on lights automatically, or whatever other customizations you want. Even outside of SmartThings, it's one of the best doorbells available.
Battery-powered protection: Ring Video Doorbell 3
With no more wiring required, the Video Doorbell 3 has a simple installation but requires occasional battery recharges. You get the same SmartThings automations as the Video Doorbell Pro at a lower price point, though you'll need to upgrade to the Video Doorbell 3 Plus to enable 4 seconds of pre-roll. It's easily one of the best SmartThings doorbells available today.
Easy installation, tough security: August Smart Lock Pro
Many smart locks make you remove the old lock to install, but the August Smart Lock Pro attaches to your deadbolt and lets you use your keys, making it a good choice for renters (or anyone, really). Using SmartThings, you can auto-lock it when geofencing senses you're away from home, send alerts whenever it's unlocked, remotely lock or unlock, and more.
Upgrade on a favorite: August Wi-Fi Smart Lock
The 4th-generation August Smart Lock is one of the best SmartThings locks available, improving on its predecessor with a smaller build (that also attaches to your deadbolt), has Wi-Fi built-in (the Pro requires an external bridge), and ridges along the edge that makes it much easier to turn. The only downside: the smaller size means a shorter battery life.
Keyless entry: Yale Assure Lock SL
Simplify your security and get rid of the need for keys altogether. The Yale Assure Lock SL with Zigbee has proximity or remote lock / unlock, DoorSense to let you know if a door is or isn't closed, and compatibility with Alexa and, of course, SmartThings automations. Plus, it comes in multiple pretty color options. Make sure you buy the Zigbee edition, as the HomeKit edition doesn't work with SmartThings.
Affordable Pinpad: Kwikset Smart Code 888
One of our favorite cheap smart locks, the Kwikset 888 has plenty of SmartThings functionality to make it useful. You can automate it to lock when you leave, or at certain times of day with Good Morning, Goodbye, and Good Night SmartThings Routines. Plus, you can use the SmartThings app to turn on other smart devices once you unlock it. It's an excellent choice for SmartThings tech at a much better price than usual.
Protect your home with SmartThings
When choosing the best SmartThings doorbell, what you really mean is the best Ring doorbell, since only Ring gives you that front porch feed and pairs it with Samsung's tech. And on that front, when we compared the Ring Video Doorbell 3 vs. Ring Video Doorbell Pro, the Video Doorbell Plus won the matchup despite being an older model. While you may not want to bother with wiring, it does mean you'll never have to change the battery; the smaller size looks more attractive, and the four seconds of pre-roll footage before every doorbell ring gives you useful context. However, renters may prefer the Video Doorbell 3 to avoid losing their security deposit.
As for picking the best SmartThings lock, you have far more options, but once again, we had to pit our top picks against one another: the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock vs. August Smart Lock Pro. Both are easy to install and have the same SmartThings functionality, but the August Smart Lock Pro's Z-Wave tech means you can still access it if your Wi-Fi goes down, and its longer battery justifies its larger size. If, however, you want to ditch the traditional key lock entirely, try the Yale Assure Lock SL and try keyless entry.
With your new SmartThings in hand, your smart home is that much more secure. But if you want to add even more protection and smarts, check out the best motion sensors for Samsung SmartThings, or SmartThings-enabled Smart Bulbs to turn on in response to video doorbell alerts.

Prices fluctuate all year round so there's always a good deal to be found. That being said, shopping seasons like the Black Friday and upcoming holiday sales offer some of the best chances to save with hundreds of dollars off at most retailers.
Smart Robot Vacuum Cleaner: Which should you buy?
There's no one correct answer for every prospective smart robot vacuum cleaner buyer and, given the breadth of options out there, there's pretty much a model at every price point from $100 to $1,000 (and up, actually).
If you're price-sensitive, there are several sub-$200 options that are reliable but these tend to be lighter on smart features and slightly worse on performance. They are good for a general clean, but might not offer the deep-cleaning capabilities and smart home integration you desire. If that's all you want, or you want to give your first smart vacuum a try, these cheaper models are worth considering.
Stepping up to around $300 will generally get you a better experience. Models at this price range tend to feature more smarts like Wi-Fi, app- and voice-control, scheduling, and some will even be pretty powerful when it comes to suction power. It's worth reading feature sets carefully to ensure the capabilities you want are included, though.
If you're looking at devices nearer $500, you can get pretty much all of the features you want without overpaying for things that might be too much of a luxury (even for someone looking for, essentially, a robot butler). You'll get great suction power at this sort of price, support for carpets as well as hard floors, smart home integration, and more. You'll also get some improved home mapping tech that makes the devices way more efficient and allow you to set no-go areas without the need for physical boundary strips.
If money is no object and you just want the best of the best, you can spend as much as $1,300 on a smart vacuum cleaner that will work with basically any smart home system and even empty itself meaning you probably don't have to think about vacuuming for months at a time. If time is worth more than money, go for it.

Your legs aren't tracked in the game, but that won't stop you from throwing out a kick now and then. It's a lot of cardio that will feel less like a VR workout and more like a night out, especially with the in-game multiplayer lounge where you can challenge friends to dance-offs.
Full on cardio: Beat Saber
If Guitar Hero were a rhythm game with a sword as the instrument, it would be Beat Saber. Slash and dodge cubes to the beat of techno music, or shell out for add-ons from more famous bands like Imagine Dragons and Timbaland. Beginner levels are plenty of fun, but progress to Expert+ and you'll really begin to sweat. Get your daily dose of cardio, squats, and arm workouts while going for high scores and combos.
Tai Chi meets fast paced action: SUPERHOT VR
Time moves when you do. Each level is a puzzle that requires you to move very quickly and sometimes move very slowly to defeat your foes. Some parts of the game require you to hold a pose perfectly still to figure out your next move. It's a full-body workout that combines the action of a shooter game with Tai Chi. With plenty of replayable challenges and endless levels, you'll never lack for bullets to dodge.
Let's get ready to rumble: The Thrill of the Fight
This simulator introduces you to actual boxing mechanics while giving you a properly sweaty workout. Bob and weave, block blows, and throw a variety of punches across multi-round bouts. Its visuals won't impress, but its collection of opponents with unique fighting styles will provide a proper challenge. This game is an arm, body, legs, and full-on cardio experience.
Always on the move: Space Pirate Trainer
This is a fun VR game that resembles the classic arcade game, Galaga, and will have you moving, squatting, jumping, and bending in many directions throughout the entire game. Since the enemy attacks you from above, your arms are always above your head, giving your shoulders a great workout.
A classic in VR: Fruit Ninja
Slash like crazy to gain some big points and work up an awesome sweat with Fruit Ninja. Your arms and shoulders will feel it as well as your heart. It's a great workout. Are you ready for a post-workout cooldown? There's a zen mode to help you with that.
Strike a pose: OhShape
Power pose your way to a healthier body. Inspired by Japanese TV show Hole in the Wall, in OhShape you must move your whole body to fit inside a series of rapidly changing holes with fast-paced music egging you on. Jump to dodge some obstacles, punch through others, and squeeze through the rest in a variety of challenging stances that strain your whole body. Despite only 21 official workouts, the level editor lets you play other people's custom sets or create your own.
Racquetball meets Breakout: Racket NX
Imagine playing racquetball inside of a giant pinball machine and then adding the fun of the classic game, Breakout. The game starts at a slow pace, but as you progress, the ball moves faster and faster; the harder you hit the ball, the faster it'll ricochet back your direction. The 360º arena forces you to keep spinning in search of the ball, and you'll need both arm strength and precision to get a high score. All of the sweat-inducing intensity of playing racquetball is here.
VR exercise workouts show results
Getting a gym worthy workout is absolutely possible through the Oculus Quest, and you don't even have to leave the house to do it. But instead of watching 2D workout videos on YouTube, the Quest can immerse you into a 3D video game where you become part of the experience in ways that will make you forget that you're working out.
Using BOXVR for an hour a day at home, at work, or even at the gym will have you punching, moving, and squatting. Your entire body will feel this one, where your legs and arms will feel the burn, and you rev up your heart rate, increasing your body temperature, and work up a great sweat.
Jake Robinson, a Certified Personal Trainer with a bachelor of science in Exercise Science from Skidmore College who tried BOXVR and VR for the first time, said, "BOXVR is a really awesome workout. It gets your heart rate going, and it's a great way to get people into the gym who normally don't like to go to the gym," Robinson adds, "you could even add 5 pounds wrist and ankle weights to elevate the experience and give people some resistance."
Dance Central will have you movin' and groovin' to a non-stop virtual dance-off that will give you a full-blown calorie-burning cardio blast that will feel more like an adrenaline-fueled Saturday night with your friends, and less like a dance class at your local gym. Any of the Quest games listed here will put you on track to your fitness goals as long as you stay committed to a regular workout routine and a healthy diet.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!In this guide, we're going to show you how to set up Alexa Guard, a service from Amazon that helps to leverage Amazon Echo devices' listening abilities. The service monitors other security products that work with Alexa. When enabled, Alexa Guard can take advantage of the microphones in your Echo devices to listen for signs of intrusion or distress. If you have an Amazon Echo device, current or previous generations, then setting up this feature is quick and easy.
Products recommended in this guide
- Smart home security: Ring Alarm Security System ($200 at Amazon)
- Show me safety: Amazon Echo Show 5 ($75 at Amazon)
What is Alexa Guard?
Alexa Guard uses your Echo devices to enhance security in your home. It may pick up sounds like a window breaking or signs of danger like the alarms from carbon monoxide or smoke detectors. With Alexa Guard Away mode enabled, you'll receive alerts via the Alexa app. This service also works with select Ring and ADT security system products. So Alexa can arm your system when you set Guard to Away mode and disarm the system when you return it to Home mode.
If you are using the ADT monitoring service, Alexa can forward smart alerts to ADT. If you subscribe to the Ring monitoring service, an Alexa push alert allows you to connect with Ring emergency responders through the Ring app quickly.
Amazon's list of Echo devices that work with Alexa Guard include the Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Dot with Clock, Echo Plus, Echo Studio, Echo Show (2nd Gen), Echo Show 5, Echo Show 8, Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen), and Echo Flex, as well as most older versions of these devices.
At its fall 2020 hardware event, Amazon announced that it would be adding capabilities to Alexa Guard, as well as a paid subscription called Alexa Guard Plus. This new tier will cost $4.99/month or $49/year and can listen for additional kinds of sounds, and even reactively play sounds from your Echo speakers to discourage would-be burglars. The premium service will also offer 27/7/365 emergency response to customers.
How to set up Alexa Guard
- Ensure you are logged into your Amazon account in the Alexa app on your smartphone. Open the app.
- Tap on the More tab on the bottom right.
- Scroll down and tap on Settings.
Scroll down the list of settings options and tap on Guard.
- From here, tap on the gear-shaped icon in the top right corner. The Guard settings menu will appear, which will show you which of your Echo devices can work with Alexa Guard.
- Tap the toggle to activate Smoke & CO Alarm Sounds so that you will be notified if Alexa hears your carbon monoxide or smoke alarms sound off when set to Away mode.
- Tap the toggle to activate Glass Break Sounds so that you will be notified if Alexa hears the sound of glass breaking when set to Away mode.
Tap on Security System to connect your Alexa Guard-enabled Ring or ADT security systems.
- Tap on Lights to connect your Alexa-enabled light products to turn on when Alexa Guard is set to Away mode.
You will need to enter your Zip Code so that Away mode works properly for your smart lights.
- Tap on Notifications to have Alexa notify you when the system switches to Home mode or Away Mode.
Tap on Guard Preview to sign up to be notified when the new Alexa Guard and Guard Plus features become available.
- Finally, from the main Guard Settings menu (back in Step 3), click on Alexa Privacy at the bottom of that menu screen to access the Amazon Privacy Hub. Read more about these features in our article about How to access the Amazon Privacy Hub.
Now when you're ready to leave the house, you can simply say "Alexa, I'm leaving" to arm Alexa Guard. When you return, you can say "Alexa, I'm home" and she'll disable the feature. If you are away from the house and forgot to set Alexa Guard mode before you left, you can do so easily from the Alexa app. Alternatively, you can create an Alexa Routine to automatically enable Alexa Guard mode when you're away from the house.
Add Alexa Guard to your routines
In early 2020 Amazon announced that it had extended support for Alexa Guard in its Routines feature. This means that users can now easily create a Routine in the Alexa app or online to do things like automatically set Alexa to Guard mode every day at 9:00 AM when you have left for work, or to automatically set Alexa to Guard mode every night at 10:00 PM and turn on your exterior lights when you are ready to go to bed. Check out this great article on how to create Routines in the Alexa app and get your Alexa Guard preferences updated today.
Our top equipment picks
Now that you know how to set up Alexa Guard, it is a good time to consider building out your smart home security suite.
We recommend the Ring Alarm Security System paired with an Amazon Echo Show 5 as a strong base for getting the most out of your Alexa Guard system. The basic Ring package listed below is the cheaper of the Alexa Guard security system options, and you can always add on additional components as you go. Amazon also owns Ring, and some may find it to be more tightly integrated into the Alexa experience. Plus, you can purchase the entire system (and monitoring service) directly through Amazon.
Home Security
Ring Alarm Security System
An inexpensive Alexa guardian
With Ring, you can secure your home with an affordable and fully-functional security system. This 5-piece kit comes with a base station, contact sensor, motion detector, keypad, and range extender, and you can always add more modules as needed. You can ask Alexa to arm, disarm, and check your system's status, and there is the option of adding 24/7 professional monitoring for $10/month.
If you are an ADT customer and prefer their service, you can sign up for an ADT Command with Alexa Guard bundle on ADT's website. This package includes a video doorbell, smart bulbs, sensors, and a 3rd Generation Echo Dot for around $250 (not including monitoring and other associated fees).
See Your Security Setup
Amazon Echo Show 5
The most secure Echo
Not only can you ask Alexa to enable Alexa Guard through your Echo Show 5, but you can view your Ring security camera feeds on the device. The device itself has some nifty security features, like a physical mute switch and camera cover, and on-screen access to the Amazon Privacy Hub.
The Amazon Echo Show is the most capable Alexa device yet. Thanks to its built-in display, your Alexa skills get even more useful, and Alexa becomes the true center of your smart home.
Additional Equipment
To take full advantage of the Alexa Guard service, we recommend that you pick up some compatible accessories. Some smart lights from Ring or a smoke/carbon monoxide detector from First Alert are great options. We also think that the Echo Show 5 Adjustable Stand makes using the Show 5 an even better smart home monitoring experience.
Ring Pathlight ($30 at Amazon)
The Ring Pathlight is a great way to add some external illumination to your home security mix. You can purchase these individually or in bundles of 2 or 4 lights.
First Alert Smoke Dectector and Carbon Monoxide Detector Alarm ($41 at Amazon)
Every home needs good smoke detectors, and we recommend that you have a few carbon monoxide detectors as well. This alarm from First Alert combines both functions in one device - and you can have Alexa listen for an alarm they sound through Alexa Guard.
Amazon Echo Show 5 Adjustable Stand ($20 at Amazon)
This stand is the perfect complement to your new Echo Show 5. It allows for better viewing angles and snaps on magnetically for easy assembly.

It's the time of year that Amazon puts so many products on sale, from stainless steel cups to computers and so much more. This year, I'll be watching for a few different items to pick up, but I'm for sure getting one or two Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablets — and since you can get them for up to 45% off, now's the time.
I bought my son the Fire HD 8 Kids Edition nearly three years ago, and it's starting to show its age. He is now eight, and my youngest is five, and they both are in the market for a tablet — well, I am for them. The Kids Edition tablets are wonderful devices from a technology perspective as they offer the same solid hardware as the standard Fire tablets, with some fantastic bonuses for younger children.
Why get a Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet?
If you've been considering a tablet for your child, then you have most certainly come across the Amazon options — and for a good reason. Aside from being well-performing devices, they are also packed with software parents want and kids love. This comes in the form of the Kids and Kids+ software.
It's the software and benefits of a "no questions asked" two-year warranty that makes Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablets such an fantastic option for children.
Thanks to Kids and Kids+, parents can limit the type of content their child can choose from while also restricting access to the internet browser, apps, and device settings. They can also set time limits to keep screen time at an appropriate level. For the kid learning to read, parents can also set a requirement that a certain amount of reading has to be completed before they can access games or videos.
There are over 20,000 options in the Kids and Kids+ library for said books, games, and videos. All of this content is curated from Amazon to ensure that it's age-appropriate. As the parent, you get to set the age range for what your child can see. This feature lets you rest easy knowing that your 5-year-old isn't going to see a video that is intended for a 13-year-old.
Sure, I could save a few bucks up front and pick up the non-kids version of the tablet, put a heavy-duty case on it, and pay for the Amazon Kids or Kids+ software to make it a kids tablet. However, by the time I've done all of that, I'm getting awfully close to the Kids Edition price and won't have the two-year "worry-free" guarantee. Plus, when purchasing the Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet, you get a year of the Kids+ free, so that's a savings right there.
What's the difference between each tablet model?
Each of the Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablets shares much of the same DNA, but there are some key differences to be aware of to make the most of the device and your budget.

A good amount of the info in the table above is identical on each tablet option. With 10.1, 8, and 7-inch screen optiona available, there's a perfect size for almost any type of kid. The smallest tablet is a great entry-level device, but it may feel too slow for older kids due to the smaller storage and lower amount of RAM. If your child is big into media consumption, then the 10.1-inch model may be the one to go with. The Fire HD 8 Kids Edition fits right in the middle with excellent performance and a more manageable screen size.
These incredible software features are then wrapped up into some great hardware and a durable foam rubber case. Amazon makes three different options for Kids Edition tablets to cover different budgets and various children's needs. You get to choose from the entry-level Fire 7 Kids Edition, the excellent Fire HD 8 Kids Edition, and the big' un — the Fire HD 10 Kids Edition, each with the same great warranty and software.
Now that Prime Day has finally arrived, I can upgrade one tablet and delight my youngest with his first tablet. Since these are Amazon products, these are likely the best prices we'll see on them. While Black Friday is nipping at the heels of Amazon's big day this year, you might as well strike while the iron's hot and make your move.
Top of the line parental controls
Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition
On a budget
The Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition may not have the most impressive spec list, but it is a fantastic device to start a child off with, especially since it gets all of the same content and parental controls as the more expensive options.
The sweet spot
Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition
Good size, better performance
The Fire HD 8 Kids Edition isn't the biggest tablet offered by Amazon, but it does get many of the same features. With 2GB RAM and expandable 32GB storage, along with great speakers and an easier to handle screen, it's a great choice for a lot of kids.
Going big
Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Edition
Big screen for big fun
The Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Edition brings all of your child's favorite movies and games to the big screen. Packed with a full HD display and Dolby Atmos speakers, the entertainment options are seemingly endless.

Many of these deals begin on Wednesday, November 4, however there are several days in which Walmart is releasing new offers throughout November. You'll want to keep an eye out for the specific time and date of any deals you're interested in.

In need of a TV upgrade? TCL's 55-inch 4K Series 4 Roku Smart TV is dropping to $148 at Walmart beginning Wednesday, November 11 at 7PM ET. This TV deal surely won't last for long, so we'd recommend being online right when the deal starts if you're hoping to grab this one — especially when you consider that this model normally sells for more than $300 otherwise. Best of all, since it has Roku functionality built-in, you'll have no problems accessing streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and more.

However, there are a few discounts that aren't big enough to worry about when there's so much else to save on. Plus, there can always be a few dud products you shouldn't touch at any price point.

Store information
Walmart's "Deals for Days" event begins soon! However, there are a few important things to keep in mind including that there are various days when deals are going live.

More deals will be released online that same day at 12AM ET. It's certainly wiser to shop online this year especially because there's more opportunity to do so and less chance of catching an illness by staying out of the crowds as well.

Charging is better than ever on the Pixel 5 with these wireless chargers

Mesh Wi-Fi systems are the networking versions of working smarter, not harder. Compared to a traditional router, mesh systems use several smaller Wi-Fi routers placed around your home to cover you from multiple angles and dodge things like thick walls that can kill your signal. Whether you want top speed and customizability or simplicity and consistency, there's a mesh system that will work in any home. The Eero hits all of the sweet spots of a Wi-Fi system in a small understated housing that loses obtrusive articulating antennas.
- Best Overall: Eero (3-pack)
- Best Value: TP-Link Deco M5 (3-pack)
- Great Security: Nest Wifi
- Most Flexible: Asus ZenWiFi AC (CT8)
- Best Tri-Band: Linksys Velop Tri-band (2-pack)
- Best with Powerline Link: TP-Link Deco P9
- Best Wi-Fi 6: Netgear Nighthawk MK62
- Best Wi-Fi 6 Upgrade: Netgear Orbi RBK752
Best Overall: eero
Eero made one of the first consumer mesh Wi-Fi systems and the company keeps making them better with each revision. The current generation has the best blend of advanced networking features of any system available thanks to the small size and compatibility with the wall-plug Eero Beacon.
Eero isn't trying to be the fastest router. Its main goal is to offer a solid and reliable connection. To most people, the speeds will be fast enough for all browsing and streaming, including 4K content. There are also two Ethernet ports on each unit if you need it.
If you need a bit more speed, you can go and step up and start with the faster Eero Pro. The best part is that all eeros are compatible so you can focus on speed where you need it and keep things compact where you don't need as much.
Pros:
- Can use an unlimited amount of beacons
- Small and easy to place
- Two Ethernet on each unit
- Great Android and iOS app
Cons:
Best Overall
Eero (3-pack)
Small and powerful
Eero creates a great Wi-Fi experience with a simple and stylish appearance and flexible expansion.
Best Value: TP-Link Deco M5
If you want to set up a mesh network that covers the whole house (up to 5,500 square feet) and don't want to break the bank, grab a TP-Link Deco three-pack. You'll get whole-house coverage without ever-changing networks or hopping onto an extender, plus features like prioritizing and parental control. TP-Link also uses adaptive routing to make sure the whole network is as fast as it can be.
From a hardware perspective, you get plenty of speed on Wi-Fi with AC Wi-Fi delivering 400Mbps at 2.4Ghz and 867Mbps at 5Ghz. Two ethernet ports on each help you keep all of your devices connected, even the older ones. Not to mention, it's a smaller size than some, which makes this an easy router to hide in any room's decor.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Value
TP-Link Deco M5 (3-pack)
Fast Wi-Fi on the cheap
The TP-Link's Deco M5 mesh offers the most important features in a mesh system for less. It looks good and has great coverage.
Great Security: Nest Wifi
Nest Wifi starts where Google Wifi left off with a subtle circular design that takes the internal specifications to the next level. The speed gets an upgrade to dual-band AC2200 speeds in the 802.11s standard created for mesh networks with 2,200 square feet of coverage. This helps a remote Nest Wifi router or point connect to the strongest possible path whether that be directly to the base router or through another mesh point.
Google pushed security updates automatically to the routers as well as supporting the newest WPA3 encryption standard. WPA3 has a more authenticating way of authenticating new devices to prevent unauthorized access to the network. It is backward compatible with previous standards to keep working with your older devices.
You can expand your Nest Wifi system with additional Nest Wifi routers, which is the fastest option with the greatest coverage. You can also connect Nest Wifi points or Google Wifi points in areas that don't need as much speed. The Nest Wifi points are siginificantly slower with an AC1200 connection and don't offer quite as much coverage at 1,600 square feet. If you want wired Ethernet ports on your node, you will need to use a Nest Wifi router or Google Wifi as the Nest Wifi point does not have any Ethernet ports.
Pros:
- Each router has two Ethernet ports
- Wired backhauk is available on routers (points are completely wireless)
- Excellent Google Assistant integration
- Fast security updates
- Up to date security with WPA3
Cons:
- Google collects analytical data
- Most settings require an active internet connection
- Google account required to set up and use
Great Security
Nest Wifi
Fast updates
Nest Wifi has a subtle appearance with great performance and features like WPA3 support, frequent updates, and AC2200 Wi-Fi speed.
Most Flexible: Asus ZenWiFi AC (CT8)
The ZenWiFi AC (CT8) from Asus is a balanced entry compared to the large range of AiMesh compatible routers. It has good capacity thanks to a tri-band setup, allowing 400Mbps on the 2.4GHz channel, 867Mbps on one 5GHz channel, and 1,733Mbps on the second 5GHz channel. Having a fast extra 5GHz band allows the mesh points to connect to the base router without sacrificing speed to your Wi-Fi devices.
Unlike many mesh systems, Asus lets you choose whether you want a single unified Wi-Fi name for all Wi-Fi bands or want to name them individually. While a single name will be best for many people, as well as much simpler, having the option to force certain devices to use only the faster bands can be useful.
As for expansion, each ZenWiFi unit has three open gigabit Ethernet ports for wired devices plus one for input. Asus allows you to connect any of its AiMesh routers together in software to improve coverage including its older Lyra series of mesh routers. The Asus ZenWiFi AC (CT8) is a great option for someone that wants speed and flexibility with plenty of room to customize.
Pros:
- Fast AC3000 speeds
- Consistent speeds with tri-band Wi-Fi
- Customize the band names
- Up to date security with WPA 3
- Expand with AiMesh
Cons:

The ZenWiFi AC from Asus delivers fast Wi-Fi 5 performance with a powerful and flexible mesh solution.
Best Tri-Band: Linksys Velop Tri-band
Linksys has been making routers for ages so it's no surprise that it makes some of the best mesh systems around. The Velop Tri-band is a great option for getting your whole home covered with the consistent connection and speed that comes with a tri-band connection. AC2200 speeds are achieved on each node with two 5GHz bands delivering 867Mbps each plus a 2.4GHz band at 400Mbps. This speed will be enough for any streaming up to 4K resolution with plenty left over for other devices.
You also get two Ethernet ports hidden on the bottom of the nodes to keep things looking neat. With a tall but understated matte white design with all ventilation on the rear, these routers should be easy to blend in. Another interesting feature is Linksys Aware, which uses the routers to detect motion in your home as a security feature with no additional equipment. If you find this feature useful outside of the 90 day trial period, it's available for a super low cost per month. Even without that feature, this mesh system is a great value.

The Velop Tri-band adds speed and improves the connection quality without giving up the sleek design or adding external antennas.
Best with Powerline Link: TP-Link Deco P9
Not every building will have been constructed with Wi-Fi in mind. If you live somewhere with concrete or block walls, it may be nearly impossible to get a good Wi-Fi signal with a standard router. Most mesh systems will allow you to run an Ethernet cable to improve your connection but that can be more trouble than it's worth. TP-Link's Deco P9 seeks to solve this issue by using your home's power lines to form its backhaul.
The AV1000 powerline connection between nodes should be capable of keeping up with most internet connections. The overall top speed will be variable depending on the quality of your home's wiring as well as electrical interference but the Deco P9 can automatically switch to the strongest connection if it turns out Wi-Fi forms a stronger connection. The Wi-Fi connection is a fairly standard AC1200 dual-band connection with enough speed for most people.
Each node comes with dual Ethernet ports on the back making it easy to get devices connected. If you're looking to play online games with your connection, connect your console or PC directly to the main router as the powerline adapter can introduce additional lag.
Pros:
- Wired backhaul with no additional cables
- Ethernet on each node
- Works with other Deco systems
- Large 6,000-square-foot coverage
Cons:

Strengthen your backhaul without additional wires
The Deco P9 can create a strong mesh Wi-Fi network by using your home's power lines to link nodes.
Best Wi-Fi 6: Netgear Nighthawk MK62
The Netgear Nighthawk MK62 wasn't the first Wi-Fi 6 mesh to make it to market but it's one of the smallest examples to date. Housed in a compact black cube and offering a fairly standard 3,000 square feet of coverage with two units, this is Wi-Fi 6 for the masses. The speeds are also in line with something this size at AX1800 from a dual-band connection. These speeds are more than enough for most homes while being able to support many more connections than an older router. This is thanks to Wi-F 6, which can more consistently deliver content to all connected devices.
With only one spare gigabit Ethernet port per unit, you will need to add in another switch if you have a lot of wired connections but if you have made the transition to a wirelessly connected home, you shouldn't have any issues. You get WPA3 security and easy future expansion thanks to Wi-Fi EasyMesh compatibility.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Wi-Fi 6
Netgear Nighthawk MK62
Wi-Fi 6 for more people
The Nighthawk MK62 makes upgrading to a Wi-Fi 6 mesh easy thanks to compact nodes, a lower price, and enough speed.
Best Wi-Fi 6 Upgrade: Netgear Orbi RBK752
The Orbi RBK752 is a great option for someone that wants fast wireless speeds on wired and wireless devices without giving up any coverage. One router and satellite with this system can cover up to 5,000 square feet. This Orbi has a tri-band AX4200 connection with a 2,400Mbps, 5GHz channel dedicated to connecting the nodes. The other 5GHz and 2.4GHz channels are left for devices operating at up to 1,200Mbps and 600Mbps, respectively. For most people, this will be more than enough speed.
The main router has three Ethernet ports for connecting wired devices at up to gigabit speeds. The satellite has two Ethernet ports making it a great option for a home office setup. If you have a gigabit internet connection and want to make the most of it, the Orbi RBK752 is a great option. Keep in mind that compared to many mesh systems, the router and satellites are much larger at 9.1 inches tall and 7.2 inches wide.
Pros:
- Wi-Fi 6 with plenty of speed
- Dedicated backhaul
- Five total open Ethernet ports
- Easy app setup and management
Cons:

Netgear Orbi RBK752
Tri-band Wi-Fi 6 speeds with a dedicated backhaul
The Orbi RBK752 offers great coverage and performance with Wi-Fi 6 and a tri-band connection running at AX4200 speeds.
Bottom line
Mesh wireless systems need to do two things right: be reliable and provide coverage everywhere you need it. It's also worth considering if you even need a mesh system since many of the best wireless routers will be a big enough upgrade without any kind of mesh support. If you do need the extra coverage, there's a mesh system for just about any set of needs, and all the kits on our list do a great job at both. Sometimes, though, it's the tiny details that decide which product is best for you.
Overall, eero offers the best total package in our opinion. It has enough speed for most average users while keeping its physical footprint small enough to blend in with the decor in any room. Eero also has an excellent app that guides you through everything from setting it all up to adding more units or changing the user settings. The time and attention to detail in both the hardware and the app is impressive, and we think anyone in the market for a new WI-Fi setup would love what Eero has to offer.

Whatever your reasons may be, these cheap office desks will ensure you have the best experience possible.Best answer: While the Galaxy S20 FE is really a Galaxy S20 Lite, Samsung didn't want consumers to mistake it for a less phone — which it is. So it went with 'Fan Edition', which was first used with a phone you may have heard of.
- One for the fans: Samsung Galaxy S20 FE ($600 at Amazon)
Why did Samsung call the Galaxy S20 FE 'Fan Edition'?
Whether you follow tech news or not, you're likely to hear about this phone's name and wonder: what is the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE?! Well, it's the Galaxy S20 that came out this spring in a slightly different, more plasticky package.
The naming convention of Samsung calling one of its phones a Fan Edition, or FE, goes back to the Note 7 Fan Edition — yes, that Note 7. We'll forgive you if you don't recall the Note 7 Fan Edition, because it was a limited release and didn't make it outside of Samsung's home market of South Korea. This phone was a refurbished version of the recalled device with a completely different battery, but otherwise, it was the same phone.
The 'Fan Edition' name was only used once by Samsung, on the Note 7. Then the company went with a similar strategy of slightly paring down a device and releasing it with a smaller price tag on the Galaxy S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite, released in 2019. But by surveying customers through focus groups, Samsung learned that the 'Lite' moniker represents a "lesser" phone, something that Samsung wanted to avoid. The Galaxy S20 FE is a cheaper phone, sure, but it definitely holds its own.
This is why Samsung brought back the Fan Edition naming convention. By releasing a phone that has nearly everything the Galaxy S20 offers at a lower price, Samsung covers many bases with its phones. The combination of price, design, and performance makes the Galaxy S20 FE one of the best Android phones you can buy today.
Like most phone manufacturers, Samsung generally releases new phones in a couple of colors, and that's it. With the S20 FE, there are six color choices for the plastic-backed phone. While the use of plastic on the back does offer more protection, the front is still glass, and a drop can break it and cause internal damage to your phone. So popping on a a great Galaxy S20 FE case for the times when you get to leave the house is still a wise choice.

Spruce up your Galaxy S20 Ultra with these leather cases

LIFX Z LED Strip
Extremely nice, for a price
Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip
Adding a colorful lightstrip to the back of your TV, also known as bias lighting, can help create an immersive environment that would otherwise be devoid of light and color. While Bias lighting was originally used to increase poor contrast on LCD televisions, OLED TVs and some newer LED TVs don't suffer from the same contrast issues as TVs of old.
In fact, many newer LED strips, like the Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip, can even sync with what's on your TV, adding amazing depth of color to your wall that complement and enhances what you're watching or playing games. But while the Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip can sync with your TV's imagery, it requires a Philips Hue Sync box, which may price this option out for some folks.
LIFX Z LED Lightstrip A very different Hue
The Philips Hue line of products has a pedigree for greatness but, along with that greatness comes a certain price to pay. Hue bulbs have long depended on a Zigbee hub to connect to each other and to the internet, and the Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip bears the same requirement. If you want it to sync to your TV, though, you'll also need to purchase a Philips Hue Sync box, which retails for around $230. That means if you have no other Philips Hue products, you'll need to spend in upwards of $500 just to get full functionality out of these lights.
|LIFX Z LED Strip||Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip|
|Price||$99||$229|
|Length||9.8ft||6.6ft|
|Colors||16 million||16 million|
|Color Zones||Yes||Yes|
|Brightness||2100 lumens||1650 lumens|
|Wattage||25W||20W|
|Life Expectancy||25,000 hours||25,000 hours|
|Warranty||2 Years||2 Years|
|Extendable||Yes||No|
|Hub required||No||Yes|
|TV image sync||No||Yes (Hue Sync box required)|
|Smart home integration||Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit||Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit|
That's a pretty massive gulf in price compared to the $100 LiFX Z LED lightstrips, which also require no hub to connect to your home's Wi-Fi network. At full functionality, LiFX's solution is around $400 cheaper than the Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip. Regardless of your budget, saving around $400 is a major positive for LiFX, even if the capabilities of the LiFX Z LED Lightstrips are lower than what Philips offers.
Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip Syncing with your entertainment
While the price of the full Play Gradient Lightstrip package borders on ludicrous when compared to products like the LiFX Z LED Lightstrip, the experience you'll get is substantially better than any other commercially-available product. That's because Philips Hue products all offer the fastest response times to commands, have impeccible quality control, and, in this particular case, also can change color based on what's playing on your TV.
As said before, you'll need the Philips Hue Sync box in order to gain this functionality. That Sync box connects to your TV via an HDMI cable and can interperet what's happening on the screen, translating that picture into beautiful colors on the Play Gradient Lightstrip. The Play Gradient Lightstrip features individual color zones and seamless transition between colors, helping to create an atmosphere in your living room that goes above and beyond what you'll get even in a movie theater. Most other lightstrips, like the LiFX Z LED Lightstrip, use prebaked colors that don't sync to your entertainment.
LIFX Z LED Lightstrip Expanding your horizons
While the LiFX Z LED Lightstrip can't sync its colors to your entertainment, it can be expanded to fit an incredibly wide range of TV sizes and scenarios. The Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip only comes in one size that's made for TVs between 55-65 inches with no way to expand the lightstrip. That's a stark contrast to Philips' other Hue lightstrips, as the Play Gradient Lighstrip is designed for one very specific purpose in mind.
Meanwhile, the LiFX Z LED Lightstrip can be used as a way to light your home, and it's actually bright enough to get the job done. Many older LED lightstrips were just for mood lighting, creating pretty colors or accents under and around furniture. LiFX has created an LED strip that provides 700 lumens of light per meter, for a maximum of 2,800 lumens per light strip. That's equivalent to a 160W incandescent bulb, which is enough to light up a room on its own.
This is better than a single bulb because the light is evenly spaced out across the strip. You can even connect LiFX Z LED Lightstrips together, spreading out that 2,800 lumen maximum across a 32-foot (10-meter) distance. On top of that, you won't need to worry about buying a hub or keeping it in range of the hub, as the LiFX Z LED Lightstrips can directly connect to your home's Wi-Fi network.
Both lightstrips are able to connect to each company's app and range of products, meaning it makes sense to stay in a certain ecosystem if you're already invested. LiFX and Philips both support "scenes" that allow you to customize colors and brightness levels. When connected with your favorite virtual assistant, it's easy to use commands like "it's movie time" to turn off all the lights and let the lighstrip set the mood. You can also set the colors and brightness levels manually from within the app or via your favorite virtual assistant at any time with either LiFX or Philips.
Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip vs. LIFX Z LED Lightstrip A simple math problem
When you boil it all down, it's hard to argue with the price difference between these two products. Yes, the Philips Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip will give you the ultimate in lighting entertainment, but for around $400 more, it's very difficult to justify the price of entry. If you've already invested in a Philips Hue Sync box, that cost drops significantly but, even then, the Hue Lightstrip is still twice the price of the LiFX Z LED Lighstrip on its own.
LiFX provides a product that's ready to go out of the box and costs significantly less. The LiFX Z LED Lightstrip can also be connected to other Z LED Lightstrips. That means LiFX can provide entire room lighting in addition to a stunning glow behind your TV. LiFX also has a great app and powerful tie-ins with your favorite virtual assistant and all your favorite smart home services, thanks to IFTTT interconnection.

Can't go wrong: Wepro Band
Want to keep things as simple as possible? Pick up this silicone band from Wepro. The band itself is pretty basic, featuring a premium silicone material that's lightweight and sweat resistant. The stainless steel buckle is easy to use, there are small and large sizes, and a metric ton of colors to choose from.
Affordable fabric: KIMILAR Woven Fabric Band
For around the same price as what Wepro's offering, you can get the KIMILAR Woven Fabric Band. The fabric material is classier than silicone and is a nicer choice for wearing your Versa to the office or while out on the town. There are a few different colors available.
Loops for days: HAPAW Stainless Steel Band
Few things dress a watch up as nicely as a stainless steel band, and with this one from HAPAW, you can get a quality Milanese loop stainless steel band without breaking the bank. This band uses a strong magnetic locking system, comes in a few different colors, and is available in small and large sizes.
Friendship bracelet: Kim Shui Braided Suede Bracelet
If you have deeper pockets and want something truly unique, we'd recommend taking a look at the Braided Suede Bracelet that's sold directly by Fitbit itself. This band was created in collaboration with designer Kim Shui and is meant to replicate a "modern friendship bracelet." The band is soft, comfortable, and looks incredible.
Visible in the dark: Fitbit Woven Reflective Band
Another first-party band worth checking out is the Fitbit Woven Reflective Band. Along with the premium fabric material, the real reason to get this band is the reflective strip the runs along the middle of it — allowing you to be clearly visible at night. We also love that the band is made out of recycled fiber!
Genuine leather: Fitbit Perforated Horween Leather
If leather is more your thing, Fitbit has you covered with its Perforated Horween Leather band. Made from genuine Horween leather and available in Moss Suede and Charcoal, this watch band justifies its high price with a premium look and feel. The perforated design also does a great job allowing your wrist to breathe throughout the day.
Perfect for the gym: Fitbit Sport Band
Do you take your Versa to the gym a lot? If so, the Fitbit Sport Band should be right up your alley. It's made out of durable yet breathable silicone that feels soft on the wrist. This waterproof band is available in a variety of colors and features a perforated design that aims to keep your wrist cool during even the most intense workouts.
Sporty nylon: HAPAW Nylon Sport Band
Sporty watch bands are usually made out of silicone, but that's not always the case. This band from HAPAW is designed for sport, but it features a sturdy nylon construction. The band is soft, breathable, and comfortable to wear. It's also easily adjustable and comes in a bunch of colors — including the stunning aqua shown here.
Floral designs: REEYEAR Printed Floral Band
Do you want to spruce up the look of your Fitbit Versa? Look no further than the REEYEAR Printed Floral Band. The band itself is a typical silicone sport band, but it stands out thanks to the wide array of floral patterns that are available for it. From the black and pink design pictured here to a lovely sunflower design, there are plenty of options.
Stay classy: Mosstek Genuine Leather Band
Want to dress up your Fitbit Versa with a leather band that's reasonably priced? This option from Mosstek will do the trick. There are many colors to choose from, including brown, black, burgundy, and more. The soft genuine leather is made of hypoallergenic material and a durable stainless steel buckle. You can stay classy without breaking the bank.
Best Fitbit Versa bands If we had to choose
If you're having trouble choosing the best Fitbit Versa band for your smartwatch, we don't blame you. There are a lot of great options out there, but we think the best choice for most people is the Wepro Band. This is essentially a more affordable version of the band that comes with the Versa out of the box, the silicone material is comfortable to wear, and the variety of colors you have to choose from allows you to find something that fits your personal style/taste just right.
We also really like the HAPAW Stainless Steel Band. The stainless steel construction looks and feels fantastic and dresses the Versa up perfectly for a fancy date night. Plus, we think most people will like the low price tag that comes with it.
Then again, if you have a more flexible budget, the Kim Shui Braided Suede Bracelet is more than worth a look. While it's quite expensive, the band has an incredibly unique design, is extremely comfortable, and is built for all-day wear. There really isn't anything else quite like it.

Charging is better than ever on the Pixel 5 with these wireless chargers
Wireless charging on past Pixels was always a bit of a guessing game. Unique profiles and speeds meant that you had to search high and low to find chargers that worked. Thankfully with the Pixel 5, things are much more mainstream and chargers are more widely available.Best answer: Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it. Setting up wireless headphones with the Oculus Quest requires enabling developer mode, sideloading apps, and using the command prompt on a PC. Even then, it doesn't work with all Bluetooth headphones.
- Flexible virtual reality: Oculus Quest ($399 at Amazon)
Not worth the hassle
The Oculus Quest is a revolutionary VR device because it can run popular VR titles without needing any external hardware or wires. Unfortunately, the wireless nature of the Oculus Quest does not extend to headphones. You can plug wired headphones into the headphone jack on the left side of the device, but using wireless headphones requires jumping through hoops and doesn't always work.
The problem with wireless headphones
To enable your Oculus Quest's settings to pair with a pair of Bluetooth headphones, you'll have to enable developer mode, enable sideloading apps, and sideload a settings app onto your device that allows you to change the Android settings of the device. Not only is this inelegant, but it also won't work with all Bluetooth headphones. There are cases where it's worked for users, but it isn't going to work with all headphones. That means you could go through all that trouble and extra work with nothing to show for it. If you want to try to use wireless headphones with your Oculus Quest, you can use our guide.
When asked about Bluetooth headphone support for the Oculus Quest, John Carmack, the CTO of Oculus, stated that added latency was still an issue. The Oculus Quest often relies on spatial audio in games, so latency would be frustrating and make some games less playable.
The Oculus Quest doesn't have native support for Bluetooth headphones, and that might not change in the future. That being said, developers have overcome barriers such as when Genki created the Bluetooth adapter for the Nintendo Switch. There might be some alternatives in the future that allow you to use wireless audio.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!Carriers like to cover their ads with phrases that you may have never heard unless you've been following 5G news closely. 5G technology uses wireless resources in a more sophisticated and efficient way than LTE ever did. It also brings in many new technical phrases to explain its coverage and speed. These are some of the phrases you should know to fully understand how 5G is going to work on every carrier.
5G NR
5G New Radio is the name of the standard being used to build out 5G coverage. When it comes down to it, all 5G equipment needs to work together consistently and for years to come. Anything you see today called 5G is going to be using this standard, except for one major outlier.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
5GE
The major outlier when it comes to 5G is 5GE, which isn't 5G NR. It actually isn't 5G at all. 5G Evolution is the name AT&T has given to its LTE Advanced network. While this represents the best of 4G with MIMO support and fiber optic backhauls, it really has nothing to do with 5G.
5G NSA or non-standalone
Some 5G NR deployments are working as 5G non-standalone, which means it relies on the existence of a 4G network to function properly. This 4G network can be used for certain information that's necessary for establishing a connection to a tower. The early stages of 5G deployment had phones falling back on 4G for uploads mainly but have started to move towards a standalone 5G network.
5G SA or Standalone
Standalone 5G or 5G SA is the future of 5G NR deployment since it will be able to operate on its own. This will make deployments simpler and cheaper. It can also lead to an overall stronger network since the entire infrastructure will be new.
DSS or Dynamic spectrum switching
When a carrier wants to use its 4G spectrum for 5G, it has to decide whether to discontinue 4G service or share it with 5G. The best way to get this done right now is DSS or dynamic spectrum switching. With DSS, equipment on the tower changes how much of the available spectrum should be available for each connection type on the fly. Within milliseconds, the network can be adjusted to fit different types of loads.
AT&T has begun to use DSS in a small area to improve the quality of its sub-6 5G. It's likely other carriers will eventually use this same technique as the need for 5G capacity increases.
RAN or Radio Access Network
A Radio Access Network refers to the equipment that sits between your wireless device and the internet connection at large. This tech has been evolving with wireless networks to efficiently and quickly connect your device to the internet or your carrier's wireless network. Once you connect to the closest tower, the RAN connects you through to the core network. 5G RAN does offer a bit more since it aims to bring more of your services closer to you improving speed and latency.
Core network
The core network is where your connection is taken after it has been directed by the other equipment in the tower. This can be a connection to a subnetwork, such as a network that provides a connection to a building or a larger network that can direct traffic all over the world.
Latency
When your device tries to load online content, a request is sent from your device to the server and then the server sends back an appropriate file. The amount of time this takes is called latency. Latency depends on a lot of variables, but one significant piece of the puzzle has long been the cell tower serving all the devices connected to it since it has to juggle and prioritize every connection from every connected device. Measured in milliseconds, this transmission time greatly affects the responsiveness of a connection. Lower latency has been at the core design of 5G and will likely prove to be one of the biggest upgrades over older tech.
Bands
Even older wireless technologies like 3G and 4G operated on wireless bands. These bands are just chunks of frequency reserved for a company that has licensed them from the FCC. Think of it like using between 600Mhz and 610Mhz as a single band, or collection, of all the frequencies that can be utilized effectively for one purpose.
5G tech can utilize a very wide range of bands and from low bands offering the sort of coverage we have become used to with 3G and 4G up to very high-frequency bands that offer enormous speeds thanks to being available in large chunks but with a few significant compromises. Most carriers will utilize several different bands at once to add capacity or simply to have more flexibility for local restrictions. T-Mobile for example has 5G on bands n41, n71, n260, and n261.
Millimeter-wave
Living in the space at 28Ghz and higher, millimeter-wave 5G has access to huge chunks of data allowing speeds in excess of 1Gbps. Referred to as high-band by the FCC, and mmWave by Qualcomm and AT&T, this is the current spectrum utilized by Verizon for its Ultra Wideband 5G as well as part of T-Mobile and AT&T's 5G networks. One issue with these frequencies is immediately apparent when it comes to coverage.
5G in the high-band requires a lot of smaller, lower-range nodes increasing the cost of deployment but also allowing for a far larger number of connections in dense urban areas. While millimeter wave highlights the benefits of 5G immediately with its immense speed and capacity, as time goes on, a combination of all of the above will make up the future of 5G coverage.
5G on mmWave has led some people to believe it is the cause of health problems or will have long term negative effects due to the cell nodes being much lower and closer to people than older cell towers. There is no evidence to support that mmWave 5G is harmful to people, at least not at the power levels these nodes operate at.
UWB or Ultra Wideband
Ultra Wideband is the phrase that Verizon Wireless is using to describe its use of high-band mmWave 5G technology. Referencing the ability to use a much larger band at higher frequencies, Verizon's particular brand of 5G should look very similar to other mmWave deployments. Verizon has been hard at work expanding this deployment and has even started using it for high-speed home internet.
This has led to some phone fragmentation since many phones equipped with only sub-6 support on other carriers will need additional equipment leading to a Verizon-only UW edition of phones such as the OnePlus 8 5G UW.
Sub-6
Sub-6 5G references any 5G NR deployed on frequencies under 6GHz. Sub-6 5G will have better coverage than millimeter-wave but isn't as available making the potential top speed lower. Currently AT&T, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular utilize sub-6 5G in the United States.
Low-band
The FCC says that low-band frequencies are those at 600Mhz, 800Mhz, and 900Mhz. Lower frequency signals are less susceptible to interference from things like walls and atmospheric conditions, which makes it a great choice for covering a lot of geographic space.
These frequencies were preferred by many cell providers for years since they allow for large coverage areas with fewer towers. Today, however, people are using more data than ever and the high value of these lower bands means that there isn't any growing room and even with newer tech like 5G, they won't be able to keep up with the growing demand for data. For that, you need more frequency, and that is found in higher bands.
T-Mobile and AT&T have deployed a low-band 5G network at 600MHz and 850MHz respectively. This has helped increase 5G coverage massively over millimeter wave deployments. In fact, in June of 2020, T-Mobile covers more than 200 million people and AT&T covers more than 120 million.
Mid-band
Mid-band refers to the frequencies under 6GHz but above the low-band frequencies. This currently includes 2.5Ghz, 3.5Ghz, and 3.7-4.2Ghz. As time passes, more frequencies can be utilized that were previously reserved for defunct technologies like over the air television.
Sprint, now part of T-Mobile, deployed 5G service on its 2.5Ghz n41 band. This has proven to be a great balance of speed and coverage for urban and suburban areas. T-Mobile and Sprint subscribers with compatible equipment can now access any of T-Mobile's four available bands.
C-band
There is a constant battle for more spectrum between every industry that needs it. And there are quite a few industries that need it. The C-band is a communications band between 3.5 and 4.2 GHz that is being cleared for use with 5G. This mid-band spectrum will help 5G providers more quickly expand service with enough spectrum for high speeds, approximately 300 MHz.
Since it's part of the mid-band, this C-band spectrum will be helpful for quick 5G deployment thanks to its ability to deliver high speeds while still offering better building penetration than millimeter-wave.
CBRS
This refers to the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service. CBRS aims to use the spectrum between 3.5 GHz and 3.7 GHz to deliver faster, more reliable mobile broadband service for LTE and 5G. Many phones already support this frequency and will be able to benefit as soon as service is deployed. This spectrum also means that there should be better compatibility with other countries that are using 3.5GHz spectrum for 5G.
OnGo is one of the main services to make use of CBRS and is already being prepared for use in places like airports or on transit systems like the train system in Dallas. This service can allow for faster and more reliable connections than Wi-Fi can provide.
Unlicensed
Depending on location, there are unused and unlicensed chunks of spectrum. With new agreements, these spaces can be utilized for 5G and even 4G in the case of AT&T's 4G LTE LAA service. While it's not certain yet how much of this spectrum will become available for 5G use, the flexibility of 5G tech makes it a candidate.
MIMO
Multiple-input, multiple-output technology, or MIMO, is being used on towers to help manage large amounts of traffic. This has been in use on upgraded LTE Advanced towers as well, but it's a big part of how 5G is going to deliver a smooth and consistent experience even when managing a lot of connections. In short, it manages connections to prioritize keeping connections active and moving without getting backed up due to heavier users.
Beamforming
Used to combat the reduced penetration on higher frequencies, beamforming is a technology that can use multiple sources of a signal to actively switch to a stronger and faster tower if one signal is blocked. This will be utilized to keep connections strong even when traveling between different cell sites.
Small cells
Finally, one of the most literal phrases on the list, small cells are cell phone sites much smaller than a traditional tower. These cell sites often reside on street light poles or on the ceiling of a large indoor area. The weaker penetration of higher band signals makes it necessary to install many more, but significantly faster, cell sites in dense areas. While possible to use with LTE coverage, these small cells will see much greater use with 5G.

The Oculus Quest experience went beyond what was expected of a VR headset by being more than just affordable — it was as easy to use as a video game console. Since that launch, Facebook has acquired several VR game development studios, brought several developers onboard with its Oculus Store, and changed the paradigm of what people expect from the standalone VR experience.
The Oculus Quest 2 promises to one-up that experience in every way, with a processor that's three entire generations newer than the one in the original Oculus Quest, enhanced ergonomics with a lighter and smaller headset, a significantly higher-resolution display, brand new lens design, redesigned controllers, and more accessories than you can shake a stick at. Facebook also has ramped up its stock this time around and, unlike the PS5 or Xbox Series S/X, seems to be actually obtainable this year.
On top of all this, the Oculus Quest 2 is $100 cheaper than the original Oculus Quest, and the more expensive model features double the storage. Is this the VR console we've all been waiting for?
The VR console
Oculus Quest 2
Bottom line: The Oculus Quest 2 is a huge improvement over the original, and it promises to get even better over time. Forced Facebook integration is going to upset some people (and parents) but, for most people, this is going to be the best VR experience you've ever had.
Pros
- Huge performance improvements
- Impressive display clarity
- Truly amazing price
- Super easy to set up and use
- Portable
- Lots of developer support already
Cons
- IPD adjustment won't work for everyone
- Display black levels are noticeably worse than Quest 1
- Forced Facebook login
- Battery life is disappointing
Oculus Quest 2 The basics
If you've never used the original Oculus Quest (or played anything in VR), here's the lowdown. Like a PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch, the Oculus Quest 2 is a standalone console, one designed with VR in mind. It doesn't require a TV, but it can display a flat version of what's happening in VR by casting to popular smart TVs and Google Cast devices (so that everyone in the room can see what's happening).
The first time you turn on your Oculus Quest 2, you'll need to sign in with a Facebook account using the Oculus app on your smartphone. Once you've logged in, you'll need to decide if you want to experience VR while standing or while seated. If you choose a standing (room-scale) experience, you'll be asked to use your controller (and the built-in cameras) to draw safe boundaries around your room so that you don't crash into anything valuable. It's a lot less intimidating than that might make it sound.
In general, you'll be getting your games and apps from the official Oculus Store, which can be accessed either on the Quest 2 or via the Oculus app on your smartphone. The box comes with everything you need to play: the Oculus Quest 2 headset, two controllers, a USB Type-C cable, and a charging adapter to plug into an outlet.
That's it. You don't need external sensors or cameras, nothing to power the thing (other than a full battery, of course), and nothing else to experience amazing VR anywhere you want.
A next-gen upgrade
Oculus Quest 2 Display and graphics
Every new console generation has, historically, delivered a certain wow-factor the first time you play it. We often find ourselves muttering How are these graphics so good? every time the on-screen character moves around the next corner or into that wide-open field, grass waving in the wind. While the Oculus Quest 2 doesn't yet have games made exclusively for its new powerhouse processor, the difference between the two generations of Oculus Quest systems couldn't be starker to the human eye.
The most noticeable difference here isn't the powerful new processor — it's the new pixel-packed display. At 1832 x 1920 pixels-per-eye, this brand new "almost 4K" single LCD display packs in 50% more pixels than the PenTile OLED on the Oculus Quest. Being a single LCD instead of two separate displays connected to lenses, the Oculus Quest 2 melds the positives of the Oculus Rift S with those of the original Oculus Quest for a superbly crisp experience.
But it's not just the number of pixels that make this display crisper — it's the arrangement of them. The Oculus Quest used a PenTile arrangement, which places subpixels in a diamond shape: two small green subpixels on the left and right corners, and larger red and blue subpixels on the top and bottom corners. When put into a square grid, these diamonds leave a black space in-between, creating large gaps that human eyes can easily see in VR since the display is just centimeters from our eyes. The images above give you a good idea of what to expect, but the Quest 2 is even sharper than these images portrait.
The Oculus Quest 2 utilizes an RGB-stripe display, which puts a tall green, red, and blue subpixel right next to each other to create a proper square. These squares fit much more neatly together in a grid, resulting in pixels that are closer together. Combine that with the fact that there are 50% more pixels on the Oculus Quest 2's display and you'll quickly understand just how much crisper this display looks. Everything from distance detail to up-close text is ridiculously easier to see, and it makes worlds so much more immersive because it doesn't feel like you're always looking through a mesh filter.

The best part about having a significantly higher-resolution display is that all games, even the ones that aren't specifically optimized yet for the Oculus Quest 2, will get an immediate upgrade. This new display isn't just more pixel-dense though, it also runs at a higher framerate than the original Quest. At 90Hz, the Oculus Quest 2 feels palpably smoother than the Oculus Rift S, and dramatically smoother than the original Oculus Quest, which ran at 80Hz and 72Hz, respectively.
At 90Hz, the Oculus Quest 2 feels palpably smoother than the Oculus Rift S, and dramatically smoother than the original Oculus Quest
As of launch, Facebook has yet to roll 90Hz out support for developers officially, but many apps and experiences from Facebook (and developers on Sidequest) are already running in 90Hz, and the difference is readily apparent. Absolutely everything feels immediately smoother and more realistic, and a higher refresh rate also means that fewer people will have difficulty with motion sickness. While motion sickness hasn't been a widespread problem in VR for half a decade now, there are still a few folks that experience it with lower refresh rates.
Just as you would expect from a brand new video game console, the Oculus Quest 2 features a significant improvement in graphics quality when compared to the original Oculus Quest and is very much a "next-generation" console that's launching alongside the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X. Much of these improvements come from the brand-new Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2, a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that's more than three generations newer than the Snapdragon 835 found in the original Oculus Quest.
The Oculus Quest 2 is very much a "next-generation" console launching alongside the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X.
For reference, the Snapdragon 835 was a smartphone chipset released in March 2017, while the Snapdragon XR2 is a custom VR chipset based on 2020's Snapdragon 865. Along with the assumed performance difference expected in a chipset that's three years newer, Qualcomm has packed some brand new abilities like new shaders, support for 90Hz displays, the ability to push 3x higher resolution, and an 11x improvement in AI calculations.
Right now, there aren't any games built from the ground-up for the Quest 2 — Facebook isn't allowing this right now, anyway, but will in the future. Until then, we'll see Quest games get enhancements here and there throughout. In addition to a higher resolution and a smoother framerate, you'll notice changes like higher quality models, higher resolution textures, more distance and up-close detail everywhere, real-time lighting, bloom effects, better particles, and improved shaders.
We've put together a graphics comparison between the initial batch of games with enhancements for the Oculus Quest 2. While these are certainly noteworthy for several reasons, you should expect the gulf in visual quality to grow wider as developers have more time with the Quest 2.
A better experience
Oculus Quest 2 Performance and battery life
The original Oculus Quest, while amazing in its own right, was very obviously held back by the aging mobile chipset that powered it. Even though the Oculus Quest 2 is also powered by a mobile chipset, three years of silicone advancements and a partnership with Facebook's own research division has yielded something even more impressive than I expected. Despite bumping the resolution up by 50% and increasing the refresh rate by 25%, the Quest 2 is lightning fast at everything it does.
From menus to loading times, the Quest 2 is a substantial improvement over the original in every way. While playing games, pressing the Oculus Home button instantly brings up the universal home menu. Likewise, clicking record video or take screenshot results in an instant response from the system, while the original might have taken a second or two (sometimes longer). Plus you'd occasionally see hitching and stuttering along the way — something I didn't experience on the Quest 2 at all.
I can recall several times, even during the review period when I was directly comparing games between the two headsets, where the recorded video from the original Oculus Quest would become corrupted for no apparent reason. This is yet another thing I didn't experience on the Quest 2, and it all adds up to a more consistently flawless execution of what you might hope or expect from a VR console.
Casting to a TV or Chromecast has also seen a significant improvement in some games, while just a slight improvement in others. Regardless of the reason, you'll find that people in the same room as you will also have a more enjoyable experience watching a 2D version of what's happening in VR thanks to higher quality video output and significantly lower latency between your actions and what's happening on the TV.
Support for Wi-Fi 6 means faster downloads, a more consistent connection, and even better wireless streaming. We'll cover streaming performance in depth below, but know this: Wi-Fi 6 makes a substantial difference in wireless streaming performance.
Just about the only thing that's not better is the battery life.
Just about the only thing that's not better is the battery life. Ironically enough, estimates show that the battery life on the Quest 2 is roughly 30 minutes shorter than the original Quest. That puts it at around 2-3 hours of gameplay before you'll have to charge it up again. You can get around that limitation by getting one of the great accessories for the Quest 2, like the Elite Strap with built-in battery, or even plugging a regular USB Type-C power bank into it while playing.
Something old, something new
Oculus Quest 2 Comfort, design, and sound
When comparing the Oculus Quest 2 against the original Oculus Quest, almost everything about the Quest 2 screams newer tech. It's smaller! It's lighter! It's more powerful! It uses a cloth and velcro head strap — wait, what?
While it seems a bit bizarre for Facebook to have reverted from a more rigid headstrap to what feels like an "old" VR standby, I was pleasantly surprised to find my initial thoughts on the strap to be incorrect. Let's get the negatives out of the first though, shall we? I hate resizing this thing. On the back of the strap, you'll find two plastic pieces that can be pulled apart or brought closer together to tighten or loosen the strap.
While this sounds great in practice, and rather simple to boot, the fact that there's hair on most people's heads turns this simple task into a rather difficult one and, if you clumsily grab your hair and pull, a painful one. If you're the only one using the Quest 2 in your home, it's not likely you'll have an issue. The new straps are super comfortable to wear, do a great job of balancing the weight of the headset across your entire skull, and actually hold their position rather nicely.
The strap adjustment issue really only rears its ugly head when passing it around for others to play, as it's just more complicated than I would like. You'll also likely struggle a bit with it at first if you have long hair (as evidenced by the awkward photos above), but after a period of time it becomes second nature.
Still, despite the annoyance with adjusting it, these straps are quite a bit better than the ones on the original Quest because they actually grip the back of your cranium instead of the mid-point. The Oculus Quest 2 fit all head sizes quite nicely in my testing, all the way down to my 6-year-old son's head.
Aside from being lighter and smaller, I also really liked the redesigned foam facial interface, which significantly helped pad the headset against my cheeks and forehead. These pads are thicker and more supportive, yet just as easy to remove as the original ones. That makes changing these pads out nice and easy when multiple people are playing, making things a whole lot more sanitary. There's even an adapter that comes in each box to add additional space for folks that need glasses while playing.
if you've got an IPD over 70mm, you're out of luck.
The lenses on the inside feature a brand new housing design, including a new physical spacing adjustment system. Everyone's head is just a little different, and that difference includes the distance between eyes. The average distance between pupils, or inter-pupillary distance (IPD), is somewhere around 63mm. As such, the Oculus Quest 2 comes out of the box using this setting. Users who have eyes spaced closer together can push the lenses inward toward each other, while users with eyes slightly farther apart can push them out.
The lenses snap into three preset positions, the default 63mm distance being denoted by a "2" right in-between the lenses. Pushing them outward to the "3" preset spaces them out at 68mm, while pushing them inward to the "1" preset makes them 58mm apart. Notice something missing here? That's right, if you've got an IPD over 70mm, you're out of luck.
While Facebook's new lenses are designed to fit approximately a 3mm range within each preset, it gets really uncomfortable if you're playing cross-eyed. IPD over 70mm is a small minority, but it's still a minority of gamers that are going to be shut out because of a design decision. Since the Quest 2 utilizes a single LCD display, like the Oculus Rift S, we're hoping Facebook will figure out a way to bridge the gap for these gamers.
Even when you've got an IPD between 56mm and 70mm though, you're going to find that the "sweet spot" might be a little hard to find at first. That's the position on your face that makes the lenses the clearest. For me, this always felt like the headset was sitting ever-so-slightly too high on my face, but I forgot about it after a few seconds.
The Oculus Quest 2 sports built-in speakers, just like the original Oculus Quest, but this time around they're built around the idea of replacing the head strap. You'll find these speakers on the inside of the rotating strap arm, one on each side of the headset, and can be used with any compatible Oculus Quest 2 head strap. Yes, that means you can remove the strap and replace it without performing some wacky wiring hijinx and worrying about ruining your headset.
The quality of the speakers is a notable jump from the original Quest, with louder volume, better bass, fuller sound (read: less tinny), and even better 3D audio. Unlike the Quest or Rift S, I found playing rhythm games like Beat Saber were actually pretty enjoyable using these speakers. Previously, the sound quality was far too lacking to even bother. If you want the absolute best sound though, you should slap on a pair of wired headphones and plug them into that 3.5mm jack on the side.
The Quest 2 does not support Bluetooth headphones because there is too much latency introduced, which would result in some strange human sensory issues and general no-no's in the world of VR comfort.
Some surprising changes
Oculus Quest 2 New controllers and hand tracking
The Oculus Touch controllers have long been some of the best controllers in the VR industry. For the most part, the 3rd-generation Oculus Touch controllers that ship with the Oculus Quest 2 further improve upon an already excellent design, but they do feature one negative — they're a tad bigger. While that's good in some areas of the design, I found the wider grips to be uncomfortable for the first week of usage. Thankfully, my hand adjusted to the size difference, but some people might not have that experience.
Overall, these controllers feel a lot more solid than the previous Touch controllers, with plastic that feels like it would withstand more hits over time. The 2nd-gen Touch controllers were infamous for having a broken light ring, as the design tended to split when hit too hard. While you can do a lot to keep from hitting people, walls, or other objects while in VR, sometimes it's simply not possible to avoid clacking the controllers together.
Unlike the previous controllers, the new design makes it impossible to accidentally press the home and menu buttons.
Up top, you'll find that the spacing between buttons is a lot wider, and there's now a dedicated thumbrest for games that don't often use the face buttons for input. In addition to that, the Oculus Home and menu buttons have been moved directly under the joystick on each controller and are now concave. This design makes it essentially impossible to accidentally press during play, which is a godsend if you've ever played a game like Beat Saber and got regularly interrupted by pressing the menu or home buttons.
Each controller button, as well as each joystick, features a capacitive sensor to detect the difference between just touching the button and actually pressing it. The Trigger and Grip buttons are smoother than the 2nd-gen Touch controllers and feel really great to push in. In addition to this, Facebook packed in some more advanced haptic motors inside the controller. We don't have any examples of how these new motors could enhance future games, but expect games to take advantage of them sometime in the future.
For me, the absolute best part of the new controllers is the battery door. Yes, that sound crazy but, once again, if you've ever used the 2nd-gen Touch controllers from the Oculus Quest or Rift S, you'll know how easily they would slide off. This time around, Facebook is utilizing good old fashioned clips to lock the battery door into place instead of magnets. That was a way, way better decision, and I'm glad they made it.
The absolute best part of the new controllers is the battery door, which no longer falls off during play.
In the last 2 weeks, I didn't have the battery door fall off once during play. Contrast that with the 2nd-gen Touch controllers, where the compartment would come off practically every 30 seconds and you'll quickly understand how massive of a quality-of-life change this really is. On top of that, Facebook enhanced the design of the wrist straps to make them more durable and connect them to the controllers more easily (read: no tools required to remove).
Even though these 3rd-gen Touch controllers still use a single AA battery for power, Facebook was able to quadruple the battery life on the controllers, ensuring you won't be regularly changing out batteries. It's easy to use rechargeable AA batteries in place of those environmentally unfriendly disposables, thankfully, and removable batteries make it easy to change out if you forget to charge them.
Battery life enhancements were made, in part, by reducing the number of LEDs on the outer ring of the controller. While this could theoretically reduce tracking performance, I never once felt like these controllers were any less accurate than the 2nd-gen ones.
Just as we saw on the Oculus Quest, hand tracking on the Oculus Quest 2 is a rather sublime experience, even if it is a very limited one. By default, the Oculus Quest 2 will look for controllers at all times. When it doesn't find them, it'll automatically enable hand tracking, which uses the same front-cameras to see your hands and translate them into VR. The term is highly over-used in tech, but the first time your hands appear in VR it truly feels magical.
Hand tracking works best in a well-lit room and is generally a more pleasant experience when used for simple tasks. You can also choose to manually toggle between controllers and hand tracking, opting to press a button in the Quick Actions panel in settings instead.
Just putting on your Quest 2 to watch a movie or virtually hang out with friends is better done when you don't even have to bother with controllers. There are a handful of games that support hand tracking, but since it's not the most accurate tracking experience in the world, most games are best when using controllers. Yes, even the ones designed with hand tracking in mind.
RIP
Oculus Quest 2 Replacing the Oculus Rift
Facebook has officially discontinued the Oculus Rift S and the Oculus Quest, leaving the Oculus Quest 2 as the single way forward for the company's VR strategy. We saw Nintendo finally move to this model in the past few years with the Switch, which combined both portable and console divisions of the company and, like Nintendo, Facebook has now combined its portable and PC divisions into one solid product.
While the Oculus Quest 2 is most effective as a completely standalone, wireless headset, it can be hooked up to the computer officially via the $80 Oculus Link cable. Oculus Link is a 15-foot cable that plugs into your PC's USB Type-C port and turns the Oculus Quest 2 into a bonafide Oculus Rift, complete with the Oculus Rift home screen and all. In fact, you'll need to disconnect the cable completely just to get back to the Quest 2's home screen.
By default, the streaming quality through the Oculus Link cable is surprisingly soft. It's clearly a lower resolution (or more compressed) than what you'll get from a native Quest 2 game, which is a bit perplexing. Changing the quality settings in the Oculus App on the PC to high quality fixes this issue and makes it feel identical to an Oculus Rift S. That means, for $380, you can get a high-quality PC VR experience without any real hassle.
For me, the real killer app was Virtual Desktop, a 3rd-party app that costs $20 on the Oculus Quest store and enables you to wirelessly stream your PC's desktop to your Oculus Quest 2. While it sounds cool to see your PC's desktop in VR on an unimaginably huge screen, that's not the real draw of the app (in this case).
Wireless PC VR was a better experience through Virtual Desktop than the wired Oculus Link cable.
Instead, the focus is on Virtual Desktop's ability to wirelessly stream PC VR games to your Oculus Quest 2. That makes the Oculus Quest 2 the preferred way to experience VR on a PC without any wires at all, and the experience only gets better when you've got a faster Wi-Fi 6 router. In my case, I'm using the same Linksys AX6000 that I reviewed back in June. At the time, I wasn't too impressed with its abilities. Now that I've got an Oculus Quest 2, however, I've found that routers like the Linksys AX6000 are the perfect pair and create a nigh-perfect wireless VR experience.
In fact, playing PC VR games via Virtual Desktop was often a quicker and more pleasant experience than plugging in the Oculus Link cable, and it even provided a higher quality experience to boot. Let that sink in for a moment — wireless PC VR was a better and higher-quality experience through Virtual Desktop over a Wi-Fi 6 connection than the wired Oculus Link cable could provide. This truly feels like a next-gen VR experience all around, and that includes the PC VR streaming experience, even if it is an unofficial one.
A problematic variable
Oculus Quest 2 The Facebook equation
I know you're supposed to save the best for last, but conventions are boring and I like to defy them. Thus far, I've had mostly very, very positive things to say about the Oculus Quest 2. It's better than the original in basically every way, but there's one thing that the Quest 2 is launching alongside and bringing to the future of Oculus: forced Facebook login.
As of October 1, all new Oculus customers have to sign into their headsets with a Facebook account. If you're buying an Oculus Quest 2, that means you, regardless of whether you currently use an Oculus account. Simply put, you can't use the Oculus Quest 2 at all without a Facebook account. You can't even get to the home screen to play a game without one. This is officially, completely a Facebook product, and that's how it's going to stay.
If you hate Facebook and don't want any part of it, here's where you get off the train.
Good as it may be, the requirement to use a Facebook account is going to deter some people. It also means that you can't just create some alias account without your real name, because that's against Facebook's policies.
It also means that folks under 13 are going to have to use a parent's account if they want to use the Oculus Quest 2. That's also going to be a problem for some parents, and it makes it difficult to get younger ones into VR. Granted, Facebook (and many VR companies) recommend staying away from VR until you're 13, anyway. I'm not someone who subscribes to this train of thought, but the account situation fits the rest of the narrative, so at least they're consistent.
In the end, it's going to boil down to whether or not you trust Facebook to any degree. I'd wager to say that most people don't care and are going to use Facebook, regardless. Having to use a Facebook account is likely more a convenience than anything, and automatically having a list of friends populate in your headset is a big plus as well. After all, Sony requires you to use a Sony account on a PlayStation, Microsoft uses Microsoft accounts on an Xbox, and Nintendo uses Nintendo accounts on the Switch. Why shouldn't Facebook use Facebook accounts on Oculus, a company owned by Facebook?
Should you buy Oculus Quest 2
Yes. Absolutely and emphatically, you should buy an Oculus Quest 2 if you're at all even remotely interested in VR gaming. It's a massive step in the right direction and, ultimately, represents the future of the VR industry at large. While there will likely always be a market for PC VR, just as there is for regular "pancake" gaming on a TV, the Oculus Quest 2 is the culmination of everything the VR industry has been working toward for the better part of the last decade.
It's truly a console-quality experience. One that will have you wondering why you would ever deal with a more complicated experience ever again, even if the extra power of a PC can bring about more detailed visuals. That's because it's about more than just an easy experience — it's ultimately about a better experience that allows you to throw away the cares of the real world (annoying technology that never seems to work included) and experience a different reality. A virtual reality.
Based on the negatives, I would normally have docked a full point (for a total of four out of five stars), but the potential of the Oculus Quest 2 easily adds a half-star back to the score. It's one of those times where you can recognize the flaws of a product, understand that these will be deal-breaking flaws for some people, but can look past that because it's going to be the best experience for the vast majority of gamers. That's what makes the Oculus Quest 2 one of the best gaming buys in all of 2020.
Shifting the paradigm of reality
Oculus Quest 2
Ease of a console, power of VR
The Oculus Quest 2 is the latest standalone VR headset from Facebook, and it offers a compelling way to get into VR gaming and apps without all the hassle and expense of a PC. With better graphics, better ergonomics, faster loading, and more immersive games, the Oculus Quest 2 is the VR console you need.

- The latest Beat Saber update includes the long-awaited multiplayer mode with support for up to 5 players.
- The update is available now for Steam and Oculus platforms, and is coming soon to PlayStation VR.
- Players can customize their avatars in a new arena-like environment built specifically for multiplayer.
- Multiplayer is not cross-platform at this time.
It's been what feels like forever, but Beat Saber multiplayer has finally arrived via update v1.12.1. for both Steam and Oculus platforms. PlayStation VR players will have to wait a bit longer for the update to go live because of the differences in Sony's certification program, but the same multiplayer update is coming to PSVR in the very near future. In the mean time, Steam and Oculus players can jump into their headset of choice, be it a brand-new Oculus Quest 2 or something else, and challenge each other to a high-score duel of block slicing to the beat.
This might be a great time to get some Beat Saber grips for your controllers to give you an added advantage over your friends! The new multiplayer mode can be played via quick-play or a private server, so you can easily choose between friends and random gamers online. A new arena-like environment has been made specifically for the new multiplayer mode, which we first saw unveiled at Facebook Connect alongside a ton of other games. Right now, multiplayer is restricted to each respective platform, so Steam players can only play with Steam players, Oculus players against Oculus players, and so on and so forth.

All available original OSTs and official DLCs can be played in multiplayer, and Beat Games confirms that any upcoming official songs and DLCs will be supported, as well. A nice little nugget of wisdom to note there is that we'll be getting more official song packs and DLCs in the near future. Aside from that, players will find a brand new avatar to customize, and a snazzy new arena to play multiplayer in. Beat Games has also overhauled the menu with a new visual design, as well as tweaked several lighting effects throughout the game.
Oddly enough, the player statistic pane has been temporarily removed, so if you don't see that don't worry, it'll be back soon. There's currently no voice chat in multiplayer, as Beat Games cites that each VR platform already has voice chat and it would be redundant. More than likely, you wouldn't want people screaming over your songs while trying to play, anyway, so that's probably a good move on their part. So what are you waiting for? Strap your VR headset on and get to slicing!

Explore the vast world of Teyvat
Genshin Impact
A Ghibli-esque open-world adventure
Genshin Impact puts you in the shoes of the Traveler, a world-hopping protagonist stranded in the world of Teyvat, which is stuffed with elemental magic and mystical beings. As you search for your lost siblings, you'll meet new companions with elemental powers, seven deities, and a strange sprite named Paimon who will help you hone your abilities and meet your destiny.
Genshin Impact is a brand new, free-to-play, open-world title that has taken off in the last few weeks since it first launched. Because the game is free-to-play, it's easy to jump into, and its similarities with other action-adventure titles give it a lot of appeal while its Ghibli-like setting helps it stand out. So what is Genshin Impact, and should you be checking it out, too?
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
What is Genshin Impact?
Genshin Impact is a new action-adventure title from Chinese developer MiHoYo. It takes place in the fictional world of Teyvat, where elemental magic, dragons, monsters, spirits, and other fantastical elements are a part of everyday life. You play as a young man or woman called the Traveler who, at the start of the adventure, has been traveling between different worlds alongside your twin sibling before a mysterious woman separates you and strands you in Teyvat alone.
Using your magical abilities and aided by allies you meet in Teyvat including the spite-like creature Paimon, you as the Traveler will explore the world, grow your power, and search for your sibling and the powerful woman who separated you.
What do you do in Genshin Impact?
After a series of tutorial quests, you'll be allowed to freely (mostly) explore the world of Teyvat as the Traveler and his or her companions. You'll receive three party members — Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa — as part of the early story, while others are obtained by engaging with gacha mechanics that you can either pay real money for or earn currency through gameplay to use. Each character plays differently with different weapons and elemental magic, and swapping between them comfortably will be key to solving many of the game's puzzles.
When you're not following the game's story, you play Genshin Impact by exploring Teyvat. Your character can walk and run, find wild ingredients for cooking and crafting, climb cliffs to reach high places, and fight enemies you encounter using a combination of your weapons and elemental magic. Opening treasure chests you find will increase your "Adventure Level," opening up more things to do in the world, while you'll need to fight enemies and use special tomes to level up your individual party members' combat abilities.
Hey, this looks like Breath of the Wild!
Sure, it kind of does! Genshin Impact does take a lot of visual inspiration from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and some of the mechanics are similar too, such as the ability to climb with the limitation of a Stamina meter, enemies like the Hilichurls (which look like Moblins), and the ways in which fire, wind, water, and ice combine in the environment.
However, Genshin Impact is nonetheless a very different game. The elemental system of interactions is more complex than Breath of the Wild's, and easier for the player to manipulate as you'll have access to a number of different characters with each element rather than having to rely on weapons or environmental effects. It also has far more dialogue and overt plot than Breath of the Wild does. This is not to say it's a better game in every way — just that it has some very distinct elements that differentiate it.
However, if you enjoyed Breath of the Wild, you stand a decent chance of liking Genshin Impact too.
How much does Genshin Impact cost?
Genshin Impact is completely free to play. However, it does include microtransactions that allow you to acquire more characters and equipment.
You'll be introduced to these through the game's tutorial, but here's the basic rundown: You can play Genshin Impact in full without spending any real money at all. However, if you want more characters and weapons beyond the handful the game gives you automatically, you'll need to engage with the game's gotcha mechanics and currencies. Genshin Impact will give you lots of currency for free just for logging in and playing the game, but eventually, you'll run dry and you might want more.
Spending real money in Genshin Impact's shop will get you Genesis Crystals, at a rate of 60 crystals for $.99, 300 crystals for $4.99, 980 crystals for $14.99, 1980 for $29.99, and so forth. You can then convert Genesis Crystals into Primogems at a rate of 1:1. And then spend 160 Primogems to buy either an Acquaint Fate or an Intertwined Fate.
You can spend your Fates for a random item, which will usually be a weapon but will sometimes be a new character to play as in the game. Weapons are more common than characters, but every ten times you spend a Fate, you're guaranteed a character or a high-level item.
This is a lot of obfuscating to say that for about $30, you are pretty likely to get a new character to play as. But as mentioned above, you don't really ever need to engage with this. Genshin Impact will give you plenty of Primogems just for playing the game and logging in daily, and there are also constantly rotating specials that will guarantee you certain characters. There's one going on around the game's launch that will guarantee you the powerful earth magic user Noelle the first time you spend eight Intertwined Fates.
Ultimately, Genshin Impact wants you to spend money, which is why it has so many levels of currency. But just keep an eye on how many Primogems you have, and when you have 160, spend them on a Fate, then use the Fates to roll for new characters and weapons.
Can I play Genshin Impact with friends?
You can play Genshin Impact with friends, but it will take you a while to do so. Though the game looks like an MMO, Genshin Impact is a solo adventure until you reach adventure level 16.
At adventure level 16, you'll unlock the ability to team up with other friends who are also at that level or higher. You can explore the world together, fight enemies, undertake Adventurer's Guild commissions, and delve into dungeons. However, you cannot progress the story alongside another person, so you'll be stuck doing that part of your adventure by yourself.
Should I play Genshin Impact?
Genshin Impact is completely free and has tons of content to explore, including an ongoing story that spans at least 20 hours currently and has the potential to go on even longer, and a huge open world with plenty of secrets that you can explore with your friends. There's really no downside to at least giving it a try, and because the tutorial hands you all the story characters it's going to give you in the first hour or two, you'll pretty quickly get a grasp of whether you like the game or not.
If you like open-world games, and especially if you liked Breath of the Wild, it's worth giving a shot.
Where can I play Genshin Impact?
Genshin Impact is available for a free download on the App Store and Google Play, as well as on the PlayStation 4 and PC.

These are the very best Android TVs you can buy in 2020
Remembering Google Play Music: A mixtape for my favorite streaming service
How are you liking the Pixel 5 so far?
Find the right controller to pair with your NVIDIA Shield TV Pro (2019)
The NVIDIA Shield TV Pro continues to offer the best Android TV experience for gamers, but you'll need to supply your own controller to get in on the fun. Luckily, there are more than just a few options that fit the bill and will enhance your gaming experience on the living room TV.For years now, big phones like the Samsung Note 20 Ultra have been popular, but lately, smaller phones have been making a comeback — which is why we decided to do a Unihertz Atom XL review. While that name does have XL in the title, this phone is not extra-large in the slightest when compared to most modern smartphones.
The Atom XL is not only smaller in stature, but it's also a very durable option. Something else that is lacking in most smartphones these days. I have been a large phone user for years and recently made the crazy leap and picked up the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2, which is neither small nor durable. Now I live out in the country in rural Kansas, on a gravel road, and am routinely doing things that are not conducive to the Fold 2's health.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
So when the chance to check out a small and rugged phone came up, I thought I would be a great chance to put it to the test. Here's how the Atom XL held up over my review period that consisted of camping, tractor and gravel road rides on my Polaris Ranger, and regular daily use.
Unihertz Atom XL
Bottom line: If you want a small phone that you don't have to worry about being extra careful about, this is a great option. While it can be a fine daily phone, just be sure to keep your performance expectations adequately set. Also, don't plan on this being a phone to take beautiful sunset photos with.
The Good
- Great size and durability
- Solid two-day battery life
- Runs Android 10 out of the box
- Optional walkie-talkie
The Bad
- Photo quality is bad
- Screen brightness could be better
- Screen touch-sensitivity is inconsistent
No worries
Unihertz Atom XL What I like
I like the idea of a small, rugged phone. By nature, I love being outdoors as much as possible, and carrying around a large device that's fragile seems like too much effort. However, my nerdy side, more often than not, wins the argument as to which phone ends up in my pocket — hence the Galaxy Fold 2. I knew that the Atom XL was not going to become my daily device, but I thought it could definitely be my outdoor option.

When I opened the box and took out the phone, the very first thing I thought was, "Wow, this thing is dense." In no way does the Atom XL seem like it is fragile. There is zero creakiness in the build-quality, and with a large 4300mAh battery packed inside, this small package has some heft. Speaking of the battery, you get an easy two days of usage from it — which is something you want if you were to be out hiking. With its exposed screws and the metal accents, rubber bumpers on the corners, and aggressive texture on the back, this phone exudes toughness.
You get Android 10 out of the box; it's unclear if Android 11 will make its way to the phone though. There is a fingerprint reader on the front that doubles as a home button, and though you can enable gestures, you can't disable the capacitive buttons.
Unihertz includes a toolbox app that has some, well, tools in it. You'll find things like a bubble level, protractor, decibel gauge, compass, and other handy apps to help get things done using your phone. There's even an IR blaster on the phone to control various appliances, but there isn't a learn function in the included app to add a device that isn't already supported.
The phone runs well using a Mediatek Helio P60 processor with 6GB RAM. Of course, it isn't going to win any benchmark battles, but it's not designed to. Its IP68 water and dust resistance and MIL-STD-810G durability are intended to be something that goes to the job site, hiking, or for the person who wants a small phone that they don't have to worry about. With features like built-in FM radio receivers and a place to screw in the included antenna to use the phone as a DMR Walkie-Talkie, it is perfect for outdoor use.
If unfamiliar, DMR stands for digital mobile radio. These radios are used in various ways, from families on vacation to construction workers and hikers. When in the right conditions, radios like this can have a pretty impressive range, and the Atom XL can communicate up to a distance of nearly 5 miles with someone using a compatible radio.
The phone is unlocked and has a dual-SIM tray, that when not using both SIM slots, supports microSD for expanding the onboard 128GB. I was using the phone on T-Mobile, and even in my spotty coverage at home, did an admirable job of holding onto a signal. At a glance, the phone looks like it has front-facing stereo speakers, which would make sense as a walkie-talkie. It only has a rear-firing, albeit loud, speaker. Though it is uncommon these days to find on most smartphones, the Atom XL does include a 3.5mm audio jack.
Hold the photo
Unihertz Atom XL What I don't like
As I mentioned in the above section, proper expectations need to be set when using this phone. It is a compact, durable smartphone that can do almost all smartphone things pretty well. What it doesn't do well is take photos.
For me, this is by far the biggest letdown. As a device that is meant to go on adventures, I want to capture good photos of things that I come across. Yes, there is a 48MP rear and 8MP front camera, but as we have learned, a quality photo is about more than the megapixels. Google Pixel phones have been taking excellent pictures with a 12MP sensor for years. No, I don't expect the Atom XL to take Pixel, Galaxy, OnePlus, level photos. I want it to capture good quality photos that don't require much, if any, editing to use.
Even in the best lighting conditions, the exposure is very uneven, colors are bad, and overall the image is blurry. The camera software does offer a Pro mode that lets you adjust white balance, ISO, and exposure. You can also select specific lighting conditions like daylight, cloudy, twilight, and more, which seemed to do little more than adding a filter. Video, well, you can take a video, but you may or may not want to keep the results — quality is terrible.
Something else that really bugged me when using this phone outdoors was the display. It's not the quality of the screen, as I don't expect it to be top-notch. However, I do want to be able to see what is on the screen when using it. Again, for a device with outdoor usage aspirations, it doesn't get nearly bright enough. I also had some inconsistent touch responsiveness while trying to use the phone. I'm not sure if it's a feature or not, but input needs to be very deliberate to get the expected results.
Unihertz Atom XL The competition
For a device that is similar in size, price, and offers a rugged style, the CAT S41 is a good option to consider. It's from Caterpillar, the makers of bulldozers, excavators, and other heavy-duty equipment. This is a phone for those with the same mindset.
With a 5000mAh battery, it can get up to 38 hours of talk time and 44 days of standby. Since the battery is so large, there is a built-in feature that allows you to share your power with other devices. Not only is the CAT S41 water, dust, and shock-resistant, it's also been designed to withstand thermal shock and salt mists.
While there's no dual-SIM or walkie-talkie support on the CAT S41, it does feature a higher resolution 5-inch display that works even if you are wearing gloves or your fingers are wet.
Samsung's Galaxy Xcover PRO Rugged is nowhere near the size, or price, of the Atom XL, but it still packs in the same rugged features. While most Samsung devices aren't thought of as durable, this phone is not only IP68 rated but also certified with the same MIL-STD-810G durability rating as the Atom XL.
Samsung also has built-in tech into the bright 6.3-inch display that allows you to keep using it even when you have on gloves or wet fingers. While the screen is larger, the phone is overall thinner and thus only has a 4,050mAh battery. Though smaller, you can still expect to get a day or more from a single charge.
Even though the Pixel 4a isn't a phone manufactured as a rugged device, it is a budget-minded phone that can take a few bumps, especially when paired with a durable case.
This phone solves one of my most significant issues with the Atom XL, and that's photo quality. The Pixel 4a brings good battery life and cameras that can always be trusted to get an excellent photo regardless of the lighting. The no-frills design of the 4a is a great on the go companion when using the proper case since the phone has no dust or water-resistance ratings.
Though the display size is 5.8-inches, well over the 4-inch screen of the Atom XL, the slimmer bezels and overall thinner body make the phone comfortable to hold. Another benefit of a Pixel device is you are assured three-years of software updates, something that is doubtful of the Atom XL.
Unihertz Atom XL Should you buy
You should buy this if ...
You are tired of large smartphones and want something you can easily hold.
While there are other small(ish) phones available, few reach the sub-5-inch screen size. Everyone that I showed this phone to immediately commented on how nice it was to use a phone that wasn't a strain to operate. The phone is almost too small for my hands — that and I've been conditioned to big phones.
You want a phone that you aren't constantly afraid of breaking.
While the screen is still glass and breakable, the rest of this phone is not. The Atom XL is a tank, and you can feel that the moment you pick it up. From its solid construction to the materials used, it is a phone that almost asks for you to toss it around. Thanks to its IP68 dust and water-resistance rating on top of the MIL-STD-810G durability rating, you can.
You want a phone with a battery that can be charged and forgotten about.
Well, almost forgotten about. When I took the Atom XL on a weekend camping trip, I brought the charger but didn't really need to use it. I topped the phone up before hitting the road on a Friday afternoon and didn't charge it until I headed home mid-Sunday morning. While it isn't quite at the level where I'd leave the charger behind, it is nice not to need to worry about plugging it in every evening.
You should not buy this if ...
You want to take good photos
If you love taking photos of, well, almost anything, this phone isn't for you. If you spend a good amount of time editing the pictures, you might be able to get something you can be satisfied with, but it's hard to remove the blur — but who wants to edit every photo they take. Even with the anti-shake mode enabled, I was never happy with a result right from the camera.
You spend a lot of time in bright lighting conditions
Simply put, the display doesn't get bright enough. Too many times, I found myself cupping my hand over the screen to read something on it. While the lower brightness may help with saving battery, with a 4300mAh battery, I'm willing to sacrifice some of that longevity for readability.
You wear tight pants
This may sound a bit strange, but the combo of the textured back and the thickness of this phone will not work well for skinny jeans. While the phone is small top to bottom and left to right, it is a thick one. The phone is nearly as thick as two Galaxy S20s stacked and thicker than the Galaxy Fold 2 when closed.
The Atom XL is a specific kind of phone for a particular type of person or scenario. If you want a small phone and have low expectations from it that you can make calls and send messages from, you'll likely enjoy this device. Perhaps if you want a secondary companion phone for your outdoor adventures or for environments that may not be conducive to most phones, the Atom XL will be great.
However, if you plan to take photos on those adventures, you'll want to be sure to bring a dedicated camera with you. With photo-quality reminiscent of a time when all phones were only 4-inches, you don't want the Atom XL to be the only camera you have.
The Atom XL is a niche product with a particular purpose — be small and durable. The phone does a great job of filling that niche. You can add in the DMR feature if you happen to work at a position where those radios are used, and you don't want to carry two devices or hikers in a similar situation. It runs clean software and offers connectivity and storage flexibility that much more expensive phones don't.
However, it's hard to get over how poor the camera is. There were many times where I was glad that this wasn't my only phone and that I had another one nearby to take an actual photo with. If you just need a picture and don't really care about it being sharp, clear, or represent the colors as they were — the phone takes photos.
I don't recommend the Atom XL for everyone, or really anyone unless you need a long-lasting phone that is really small, has DMR walkie-talkie functionality, and can take a beating. For everyone else, other options will likely better suit you.
Unihertz Atom XL
Bottom line: Easy to hold and ready to work, the Atom XL is the perfect small and rugged smartphone. Great battery life and a DMR walkie-talkie feature for easy communications. However, it is hampered by a bad camera and dim display.

How are you liking the Pixel 5 so far?
Charging is better than ever on the Pixel 5 with these wireless chargers
Wireless charging on past Pixels was always a bit of a guessing game. Unique profiles and speeds meant that you had to search high and low to find chargers that worked. Thankfully with the Pixel 5, things are much more mainstream and chargers are more widely available.Since I'm lucky enough to have a corgi and a grey tabby as members of my family, I'm also unfortunately cursed with the excessive amount of fur that gathers on my carpets. To keep things in check, I happily run a robot vacuum every morning. In my experience, some of these devices are much more suited to pet homes than others.
While testing the ECOVACS Deebot U2 Pro, I was really happy with the overall results. It comes with an extra-large dustbin for gathering up pet debris and even has a special brush that allows it to pick up fur more effectively from out of my carpets and hard floors.
Great for pet homes
ECOVACS Deebot OZMO U2 Pro
Bottom line: It won't have the fancy features of more expensive robot vacuums, but it does an excellent job of picking up pet hair and other debris out of your floors. And since it has an extra-large dustbin, it can actually hold a big ball of fluff.
Pros
- Replacement side brushes
- Special "tangle-free" brush
- Extra-large dust bin
- Runs up to 150 minutes
- Vacuums and mops
Cons
- Doesn't clean in back and forth fashion
- Can get lost if you have another robot vacuum in the home
ECOVACS Deebot OZMO U2 Pro What I like
When I opened the box for the U2 Pro, I was surprised by all of the things that it came with. Of the more common things, there are two replacement side brushes, a mop attachment, extra filters, and a handful of disposable mop pads. But there are also a few extra things that will make this an excellent choice for pet owners.

XL Dustbin Perfect for pet fur
There are actually two different dustbin attachments in the box. One has both a dustbin as well as a water tank connected to it for vacuuming and mopping. The other is solely for vacuuming and at a 0.8-liter capacity, is the largest dustbin I've ever seen in a robot vacuum. You'll just have to remember to swap out the dustbins if you want to go back to mopping.
Now I've tested dozens of vacuums, and most of them have such small dustbins that they fill to the brink with pet hair far before a cleaning session has ended. Because of that, I'm used to emptying the dustbins regularly.
I've run the U2 Pro dozens of times. It has really good suction, but it has never filled to capacity in one go due to the larger dustbin. Remember, this is coming from someone who owns a constantly-shedding corgi and cat. As you can see in the pictures, this device can handle more fur and fine dust particles, which means it continues to effectively clean longer than some other vacuums out there. Pair that with the vacuum's ability to run for up to 150 minutes before needing a recharge, and this becomes a very appealing option for large homes or especially furry homes.
Additionally, instead of having a small emptying slot like many other dustbins, this extra-large one opens like a clamshell. This design makes it so that I can easily dump out all of the fur and debris instead of hopelessly rattling it around over my dumpster and trying to get the little bits to dislodge from the corners through a tiny opening.
Special tangle-free brush Don't need to free it as often
Something about the brush's design really does reduce the amount of hair that gets wrapped around it.
To be fair to my pets, I'm also a guilty party when it comes to littering my floors with hair. I honestly don't know how many times I've had the arduous task of cutting my thickly wrapped locks off from around various vacuums' brushes. So when I saw that the U2 Pro came with a supposedly "tangle-free" brush, I was curious. I instantly swapped it out for the regular one that was already inside the vacuum and let 'er loose.
To my surprise, something about the brush's design really does reduce the amount of hair that gets wrapped around it. It isn't perfect, but it's much better than average while still being able to pick up gobs of fur and hair. With that being the case, I haven't yet had to cut off any hair. But if I needed to, there's a razor that attaches to both dustbins, so I could easily use it to free any unwanted objects from the bristles.
ECOVACS Deebot OZMO U2 Pro What I don't like
While I really like how well the U2 Pro does at picking up pet hair, it isn't a completely perfect device.
Random cleaning No perfect vacuum lines
It doesn't move back and forth in orderly lines.
While Deebot U2 Pro definitely cleans intelligently, it doesn't move back and forth in orderly lines during cleaning sessions. This means that instead of perfect vacuum lines in your carpets, you'll have zigzags going every which way. Now, if this might not be a problem for you if you don't care about how your carpets look after a cleaning session.
The app allows you to set up cleaning schedules, determine how powerful the vacuum's suction is, or influence how much water is used while mopping. However, since this vacuum does random cleaning, you won't be able to track your vacuum's location on a map.
Crossed signals Got confused by another ECOVAC
In addition to this robot vacuum, I also have an ECOVACS OZMO T8 AIVI robot vacuum set up in my living room. The first several times I tested the U2 Pro, it never returned to the dock. I'd either find that it had gotten lost and had just stopped in the middle of a room, or I'd find it stranded on the ECOVACS Auto-Empty Station. However, once I unplugged this other ECOVACS and only had the U2 Pro running, it never got lost.
The other ECOVACS dock's signals likely confused the U2 Pro, so it couldn't find its way back to its own dock to charge. I've tested several robot vacuums, and in my experience, this doesn't happen that often. With this being the case, you should probably only get this vacuum if you don't currently have another one in your home.
ECOVACS Deebot OZMO U2 Pro Competition
The 360 S5 maps your home, works in perfect back and forth lines, and also lets you set up no-go zones. Even so, it's only a bit more expensive than the Deebot OZMO U2 Pro.
The Eufy RoboVac 11S is a relatively inexpensive robot vacuum with powerful suction. It comes with a remote and doesn't work with an app. However, it cannot be used to mop your hard floors.
If you'd really rather that your vacuum cleaned your floors in tidy lines, you really can't go wrong with the Roborock S4. It cannot mop, but it has powerful suction, and you can adjust various settings using the app.
ECOVACS Deebot OZMO U2 Pro Should you buy it?
You should buy this if...
Pet homes with lots of fur
With a special no-tangle brush and an extra-large dustbin, the U2 Pro can pick up much more fur than other options out there.
Anyone who wants a vacuum and a mop
Some vacuums within this price range only offer vacuuming, but this one has two dustbins for you to use: One with a mopping mechanism and one without. You determine which one you want to have attached at any given moment.
Larger homes
With an impressive run time and the largest dustbin I've ever seen on a robot vacuum, the U2 Pro is a great option for larger homes as it can reach more space and clean more thoroughly before needing someone to empty it.
People with allergies
Every time I dump out the dustbin, I'm surprised by how much fine dust the vacuum is able to pick up along the way. Reducing the number of small particles on your floors might just reduce allergies and prevent you from sneezing quite as much.
You should not buy this if...
Those who want perfect carpet lines
Unlike other robot vacuums, this one does random cleaning and leaves zigzag lines all over your carpets. If you're looking for something that will make your floors look tidier, you should look elsewhere.
Anyone looking for an extensive app
The U2 Pro's app is functional but bare bones. You cannot see a map of your home or set no-go zones using the app.
People who already have another ECOVAC in their homes
The U2 Pro seemed to have issues operating while my other ECOVAC was plugged in. It kept trying to dock to the other vacuum's station and got stuck several times because of this. It did not have issues with the other robot vacuums I've been testing, however.
There are definitely other robot vacuums out there that will give you better app controls and perfect vacuum lines. However, if you're looking for something a little less expensive that can really help clean up after your pets, then you should really consider the ECOVACS Deebot OZMO U2 Pro. Due to its large battery life and large dustbin capacity, this is the perfect option for pet homes or for those with more floor to cover.
It comes with an extra-large dustbin to hold more balls of fur, runs for a relatively long time before needing a recharge, and even comes with a tangle-free brush. With this device running regularly through your home, your floors will be a lot cleaner.

Secure your home with these SmartThings doorbells and locks
One of the best things about SmartThings is that you can use a slew of other third-party devices on your system, doorbells and locks included. Since they all essentially share the same SmartThings support, we've focused on which devices have the best specs and tricks to justify adding them to your SmartThings arsenal.Of the many upgrades Facebook made from one generation to the next, the Oculus Quest 2's 90Hz display is probably one of the biggest. The refresh rate provides a 25% improvement over the original Oculus Quest, along with a smoother, much more realistic VR experience. But did you know that the Oculus Quest 2 only runs most games at 72Hz at launch? That's the same refresh rate as the original Oculus Quest. Thankfully, you can enable the 90Hz mode for all games and apps, but it takes a bit of tinkering to get there.
Note: While the following steps are straightforward, there's always the chance that modifying your Oculus Quest 2 with ADB commands could mess something up. If that bothers you, it's probably best to skip this process. After all, Facebook said that 90Hz is coming officially to all apps in the future, so it's just a matter of time before an official fool-proof solution is available.
Products used in this guide
- The best in VR: Oculus Quest 2 (From $299 at Amazon)
- A longer cable means less hassle: Shample Oculus Link USB cable ($28 at Amazon)
How to unlock developer mode
In order to send ADB commands to your Oculus Quest 2, you'll need to put it in developer mode. If you already had an Oculus Quest and followed the steps in our how to sideload apps on the Oculus Quest guide, you probably already have developer mode enabled.
For those that haven't enabled developer mode yet, the following steps will help you get everything squared away. For this guide, you'll need a PC in order to get things setup properly. We also recommend downloading SideQuest, which is a free utility that makes connecting the Oculus Quest 2 to a PC an easier process. It also unlocks a world of indie games that you can't get on the official Oculus Store.
- Open the Oculus app on your phone.
- Select Settings.
Select your Oculus Quest 2 headset.
- Tap the arrow to the right of your device name to drop down more options if they don't show up immediately after selecting your device.
- Select more settings.
- Select developer mode.
Toggle the developer mode setting to on.
- This opens a website (unless you've unlocked developer options on an Oculus device before).
- Scroll down and select the link below create an organization.
- Log in to your Oculus account.
- Enter the name of your "organization" (this can be anything).
- Select submit
- Agree to the terms of the agreement.
- Open the Oculus app again.
- Select Settings.
Select your Oculus Quest 2 headset.
- Tap the arrow to the right of your device name to drop down more options if they do not show up immediately after selecting your device.
- Select more settings.
- Select developer mode.
- Toggle the developer mode setting to on if it isn't already switched on.
How to set up SideQuest on your PC
Next, you'll need to get SideQuest ready on your PC. You'll have to download SideQuest from GitHub and install it. It's an executable file, so if you've used those before, it should work like any other. You can download it on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process on Windows.
- Go to SideQuestVR.com.
- Click on the GET SIDEQUEST button at the top of the page.
- Select the version for your computer's operating system, either Windows, Mac, or Linux.
- Open the downloaded installer file.
Accept any security dialogs that appear and run through the installation process.
Once the installer has completed, launch SideQuest from your Start Menu, applications menu, or quick launch bar.
How to connect your Oculus Quest 2 and SideQuest
To set up SideQuest and to install any applications, you'll need to connect your Oculus Quest 2 and your PC.
- Connect your Oculus Quest 2 to your PC using a USB cable.
SideQuest should recognize the headset and show a green circle with the name of your headset on the top bar.
- Put on your headset, and select Allow USB debugging.
- Make sure to check Always allow from this computer.
Time to enable 90Hz
Now for the easiest part. With the SideQuest app opened on your computer and your Oculus Quest 2 connected, follow these steps.
Click the Run ADB Commands button at the top of the SideQuest window. The icon looks like a box with an arrow inside pointing right.
In the pop-up dialog box, click the Enable USB ADB button. You should receive a restarting in USB mode message in SideQuest.
- Delete the adb usb text in the Command to Run line.
- Enter the following command (without quotes): "adb shell setprop debug.oculus.refreshRate 90"
- Click the pink RUN COMMAND button.
- Unplug your Oculus Quest 2 from your computer and put it on your head.
- Press the power button once to turn off the display. Press it again to turn the display back on.
- Enjoy 90Hz VR gaming!
How to go back to 72Hz
If you're experiencing problems or performance issues in some games, it might be best to go back to the default 72Hz setting. To do this, you'll follow the same steps as before, only replacing 90 with 72 for the refresh rate command.
Click the Run ADB Commands button at the top of the SideQuest window.
In the pop-up dialog box, click the Enable USB ADB button. You should receive a restarting in USB mode message in SideQuest.
- Delete the adb usb text in the Command to Run line.
- Enter the following command (without quotes): "adb shell setprop debug.oculus.refreshRate 72"
- Click the pink RUN COMMAND button.
- Unplug your Oculus Quest 2 from your computer and put it on your head.
- Press the power button once to turn off the display. Press it again to turn the display back on.
- Everything will be back to the 72Hz mode that ships on the Oculus Quest 2
90Hz is a huge upgrade for VR games, even if the number jump from 72Hz to 90Hz doesn't seem like a lot. Every increase in refresh rate with a VR headset means a more comfortable experience, less motion sickness, and a more realistic feeling.

Oculus Quest 2
An incredible experience
Facebook has improved seemingly everything with the second-generation Oculus Quest, making this the VR system to get.
Additional Equipment
While the Oculus Quest 2 comes with everything you need to get started, you might want to pick up a longer USB-C cable to connect to your computer. In addition to making it more convenient to connect to your PC, a long 16-foot cable like the one found below will enable Oculus Link functionality. If you've got a VR-ready gaming PC, this turns your Oculus Quest 2 into an Oculus Rift, enabling even more immersive games thanks to a PC's extra horsepower.
Shample Oculus Link 16ft USB cable
The official Oculus Link cable is great, but it costs a lot and is only USB-C. This USB-A to USB-C cable is longer, cheaper, and more versatile.

Find the right controller to pair with your NVIDIA Shield TV Pro (2019)
The NVIDIA Shield TV Pro continues to offer the best Android TV experience for gamers, but you'll need to supply your own controller to get in on the fun. Luckily, there are more than just a few options that fit the bill and will enhance your gaming experience on the living room TV.Samsung rolled out One UI 2.5 with the Galaxy Note 20 series, and the update is now making its way to the Galaxy S20 and older Samsung phones. One UI 2.5 doesn't bring radical changes to the UI, but there are plenty of new feature additions to the camera, DeX, gesture navigation, and other services.
One UI 2.5 is still based on Android 10, with Samsung planning a more wholesale set of changes with the upcoming Android 11-based One UI 3.0 update. That particular update is still in a closed beta and won't be available until the end of the year, so for now, let's focus on the new features in One UI 2.5 and when your Galaxy phone will receive the update.
The new hotness
Samsung Galaxy Note 20
Great from all angles
The Galaxy Note 20 series offers a new design and the latest internal hardware money can buy. The rear camera housing has a bold new look, you get a gorgeous AMOLED display with excellent colors, global 5G connectivity, S Pen with lower latency than before, and all-day battery life.
One UI 2.5 brings exciting changes to the camera
The One UI 2.5 feature I'm most excited about is Pro Video mode. Think of it as a manual mode for videos, with the feature offering granular control over white balance, exposure settings, autofocus, audio sources, and more. You can plug in a USB-C mic and use that as the audio source when shooting videos, or use the built-in omnidirectional mic on your phone.
The Pro Video mode is a great addition to the Samsung camera app, and Samsung is also introducing the option to shoot videos in a cinematic 21:9 format. You can use the default 16:9 ratio or switch to 21:9, with 8K recording options available for both modes on Galaxy Note 20 and S20 devices.
One UI 2.5 adds gestures for third-party launchers
One of the biggest drawbacks in One UI 2.1 was that the built-in gesture navigation system was limited to Samsung's launcher. You could not use gesture navigation with Action Launcher, Lawnchair, or other third-party launchers, but that is changing with One UI 2.5. Now you can use Android 10's full-screen navigation gestures with just about any third-party launcher.
Built-in screen recording gets much more useful in One UI 2.5
Samsung has a native screen recorder, and in One UI 2.5 you'll be able to select the audio source for the recording. You get to choose from the media sounds or use both the media sounds and the built-in mic to easily record a voice-over to your screen recordings.
Samsung Keyboard in One UI 2.5 lets you search YouTube directly
Samsung Keyboard is getting an update in One UI 2.5 that allows you to search for YouTube videos directly. You'll see a YouTube shortcut in the keyboard's settings, and selecting the icon lets search for videos on YouTube directly from the keyboard. The feature makes it convenient to share YouTube videos in conversations without having to manually look for a video within YouTube.
One UI 2.5 lets you use Samsung DeX without any wires
DeX is one of the best features in One UI, giving you the ability to access a desktop view of your Galaxy phone and use it with a mouse and keyboard. With One UI 2.5, Samsung is introducing a wireless DeX mode that lets you mirror your phone's screen to a TV and use the phone as a gesture pad for navigation.
Wireless DeX works over the Miracast protocol, so if you have a smart TV or monitor with Miracast enabled, you'll be able to use DeX wirelessly. Most recent Samsung TVs come with the feature — as do other smart TVs — and if you have a device with Miracast enabled, it will automatically show up as a cast target for DeX.
One UI 2.5 brings powerful features to Samsung Notes
Samsung Notes is picking up a huge update in One UI 2.5 that brings a host of new features. It now offers better organization with individual page numbers, you get the ability to underline phrases and draw on notes, and annotate PDFs from within the app.
Notes also has a nifty feature that automatically syncs notes with voice recordings, with notes time-stamped to audio recordings. If you're using a device with an S Pen, you also get automatic handwriting recognition and the ability to straighten text or make changes easily.
One UI 2.5 lets you easily share Wi-Fi passwords
Finally, One UI 2.5 comes with a few changes to Wi-Fi management. There's the option to share Wi-Fi credentials via a QR code, and you'll also see a notification for nearby Galaxy devices that are in your contacts list. So if a friend is visiting and they're also using a Galaxy phone, you can easily share your home network's Wi-Fi password with them.
These Galaxy phones are getting the One UI 2.5 update
The One UI 2.5 update is now available on the Galaxy S20 series, and Samsung is rolling it out to the Note 10 series and the Galaxy S10 lineup. Samsung makes some of the best Android phones you can buy today, and with the brand committing to three years of Android version updates, you can look forward to your phone getting regular updates for longer.

Pair that snazzy Galaxy S20 FE with an awesome case to keep it protected
Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S20 FE and the device is sure to turn plenty of heads for the next few months. With stiff competition in the mid-range market, it's clear that Samsung wants to compete and the S20 FE is fantastic. If you're picking one of these awesome new devices up, make sure you pair it with a case to keep it looking awesome.Most people don't put enough thought into their wireless router. Things like the layout of your house, the materials, and how many stories it is all matter when you want good Wi-Fi from one end to the other. Or maybe you need to plug something into a router with a network cable in one room but still want great Wi-Fi everywhere else. Finding a networking solution that's flexible enough to meet your current and future needs can be a challenge, and it can be a huge pain to change your router every time you need some more coverage.
This is where wireless mesh networking makes the most sense. Sometimes one central wireless access point that sends out a powerful omnidirectional signal is perfect but often a mesh system delivers a better experience without giving up anything you need. There's a big difference between Wi-Fi in your house that works and Wi-Fi in your house that works well.
If you've decided to go with a mesh system, you're then faced with the question of which you should buy. While many of the best wireless routers have mesh support, these systems are focused on the mesh. We're going to look at four popular models and give you some information so you can make the right choice.
Mesh Wi-Fi Router Face-off Nest Wifi
Google's Nest Wifi is a follow-up to the successful Google Wifi system which provided a simple mesh system that was easy to expand and offered enough speed for most people. Nest Wi-Fi continues that trend and as such, Google has elected to only support Wi-Fi 5 with it since most people have yet to upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 devices. Still, it delivers enough speed for standard usage and should keep up with anything short of a gigabit connection.
The Wi-Fi 5 option Nest Wifi
Google has a vested interest in everyone being on the internet, and it's made a great wireless mesh system to help make it happen no matter where in your house you happen to be sitting. Nest Wifi is fast, easy to set up, and even easier to get into the settings thanks to its robust smartphone app for first time setup and adding more mesh points.
Pros
- It looks good — this matters because ideally, you'll have the satellites out in the open where everyone can see them.
- Constant updates
- Setup is so easy it's almost automatic
- Expand with Nest Wifi points, routers or Google Wifi
Cons
- Few advanced features
- Requires a Google account
- If you lose a connection to the internet, settings and options are very limited
Nest Wifi is the newest addition to the Google Wifi family, increasing the number of compatible Wi-Fi devices to three, which all fill different needs. The Nest Wifi router is the fastest with the most coverage, while the Nest Wifi point and Google Wifi routers are slower with less coverage. Even so, the lower cost on these other devices makes them a great option for mesh expansion.
If you use Google products, you'll probably love Nest Wifi. Everything about the product will be familiar, from the way it looks to the way the app works.
Setup is simple. Power up one of the units and connect it to your modem, then download the app. You'll get a notification that starts the process with a single tap, then walks you through setting up the other two and gives performance tips.
Each Nest Wifi router covers about 2,200 square feet with a strong signal and moving through your house switches you from one to the next seamlessly. The Nest Wifi points add 1,600 square feet while Google Wifi routers add 1,500 square feet. The app has some extra features like being able to prioritize one device over the others for a set amount of time (perfect for streaming HD video) or parental controls, It, however, lacks advanced networking features like dedicated port forwarding. The biggest drawback is what happens if you lose your internet connection — you have limited access to the settings as they are hosted on your online Google account.
Perhaps the biggest draw of Nest Wifi is the prompt updates. They're seamless and a proper update schedule means your network is more secure even if they aren't always filled with new features.
Our pick
Nest Wifi router and point
The Nest Wifi router is the newest addition to the Google Wifi family with faster speeds and greater coverage. It's also compatible with Nest Wifi points as well as Google Wifi for easy and cheap expansion.
Nest Wifi vs. Orbi vs. Eero vs. AmpliFi Netgear Orbi
The Wi-Fi 5 option Orbi RBK50
Netgear's Orbi isn't a mesh wireless system, but it acts the same way and extends your network by using satellite units. Those satellites just aren't connected to each other, only the base. It's still a tri-band system that will give you fast network speeds everywhere in your house, which is what really matters.
Pros
- No account required
- No speed loss from mesh forwarding
- The base and satellite are pre-programmed to work together
Cons
- It's big
- It's expensive if you need a second satellite
- Setup can be confusing because there are so many options
First thing's first — if you need advanced settings on your Wi-Fi network and want a mesh(-like) system, Orbi is the one you want to buy, no questions asked. Using your web browser to log into the router brings you to the familiar Netgear setup and admin page that you're probably already familiar with, including options that no other consumer mesh product offers like advanced QoS and forwarding.
With that out of the way, the Orbi system has one other thing going for it that might make a difference — no speed loss because of bi-directional communication. Orbi uses a dedicated band for communication between the units, while some other consumer mesh products use the same band your network data does, which causes a 50% loss in throughput for each "hop." This isn't noticeable for most of us as it's still faster than data can be processed after the loss, but it could make a difference when transferring large files or streaming data inside your network.
Two things aren't great — the sheer size of each unit (easily three times bigger than the others on this list) and the price. It can be more difficult to hide an Orbi satellite and adding more can be more expensive than its competition. Still, the Orbi line has a lot of options, so a cheaper and slower unit can be added to parts of the home where speed isn't a big deal.
Prosumer Choice
Netgear Orbi RBK50
Netgear's Orbi system isn't the smallest or most elegant solution when it comes to mesh Wi-Fi, but it does offer more advanced controls and a long-range. It's the best choice for prosumers and enthusiasts.
The Wi-Fi 6 option Orbi RBK752
The Orbi RBK752 brings Wi-Fi 6 speeds to an Orbi mesh. With AX4200 speeds, this router has a 2.4GHz and 5Ghz band dedicated to devices capable of 600Mbps and 1200Mbps, respectively. A third 5GHz band is dedicated to connecting the Orbi satellite to the base router. This Orbi really isn't designed to be a standalone unit.
Around the back of the main router, there are three vacant Ethernet ports with an additional WAN port to connect to the modem. The satellites have two vacant Ethernet ports as well. If you have a home with poor wireless signal, you can run an Ethernet cable from the main router to the satellite and it will be automatically utilized for a more consistent backhaul.
This system is still overkill for most people, but if you want to have fast Wi-Fi 6 connectivity all over your home, there aren't many other routers that can do better.
Next-gen Orbi
Orbi RBK752
A fast Orbi with support for the newest devices
The Orbi RBK752 brings the newest Wi-Fi tech to the Orbi line with consistent speeds up to 1.2Gbps thanks to a tri-band design.
Let's face it, as cool as gigabit connections are, some people are going ever faster. The Orbi RBK852 system is even faster. 2.4GHz speeds are upgraded to 1200Mbps and the 5GHz band for devices gets an upgrade to 2400Mbps. This AX6000 mesh is one of the fastest I've ever tested and with a 2.5G WAN port on the back, it's ready for the next generation of fiber connections.
Mesh Wi-Fi Router Face-off Eero
The Wi-Fi 5 option Eero
The third-generation Eero is the complete package. It comes equipped with a dual-band AC1300 connection and can cover up to 1,500 sq ft with a single router. A mesh made up of this base Wi-Fi 5 Eero is only recommended for internet connections up to 350Mbps, though our testing showed speed closer to 400Mbps. This speed is a result of splitting the 866.6Mbps 5GHz band between the mesh connection and connected device. Still, this is fast enough for most of what people do on their internet connections.
Pros
- Each beacon looks great
- Easy and secure setup
- Expands with any Eero
Cons
- Requires a smartphone to set up
- Limited settings
This Eero can also be added to an existing Eero mesh made up of any previous Eero or even the newer Eero 6 variants. Eero's intergenerational compatibility is thanks to a great software experience that keeps all Eeros up to data automatically.
The software experience keeps it up during setup and management which is simple and robust with the Eero app. You can change the setting most people care about such as security type and even some port forwarding. Beyond that, Eero is a bit more limited aiming for consistency over flexibility. Still, for the majority of people, this is preferable.
Entry-level mesh
Eero
Enough speed for most
For internet connection up to 350Mbps, Eero is a great choice thanks to its AC1300 Wi-Fi that keeps the mesh coverage strong.
The Wi-Fi 6 option Eero 6
Eero has continued to update its mesh solutions consistently without dropping compatibility in the Eero line. With Wi-Fi 6 onboard, this is one of the cheapest mesh systems you can get that can confidently deliver 500Mbps or more. While it's dual-band, its AX1800 speed should be able to keep up with even heavy usage. Even if you don't have Wi-Fi 6 devices yet, you'll get some advantage thanks to a Wi-Fi 6 backhaul connecting the mesh points.
Pros
- Wi-Fi 6 support improves speed and coverage
- Can use an unlimited amount of extenders
- Easy and secure setup
- Expands with any eero
Cons
- Extenders have no Ethernet ports
Eero 6 comes with a respectable speed upgrade over the base Eero jumping up from AC1300 to AX1800. What that means is up to 1200Mbps on the 5GHz bands and a solid 400Mbps at 2.4GHz. While the Eero 6 will need to share that 5GHz connection between devices, 500Mbps should be consistently possible even for older Wi-Fi 5 devices. If you've got a gigabit connection and want to get those speeds all over your home, you'll need to step up to the tri-band Eero Pro 6.
Unlike previous Eeros, the Eero 6 comes packed with Eero 6 extenders rather than identical routers. This brings the package cost down but does mean giving up an Ethernet connection on the extenders. This rules out a wired backhaul for the extenders. Like the older Eero Beacons, these simply extend the mesh; however, they take up way more room. You can build a system out of individual Eero 6 routers if you really need wired features, though.
Despite its shortfalls, Eero manages to deliver a great networking experience, and it largely comes down to its app. The Eero app works consistently and smoothly, whether you're adding new Eeros to your mesh or monitoring your usage. If you want it, there's a subscription service that brings along antivirus software and more advanced parental controls.
Looking good
Eero 6 with two extenders
Eero brings the cleanest look of any mesh router available with small satellites that don't look too out of place once plugged in. You'll need to spend more if you want LAN ports, though.
If you want to stick with an Eero mesh but need a little more speed, you can upgrade to the Eero Pro 6. This router adds an additional 5GHz band with a bandwidth of 2400Mbps. Since mesh systems need to share their communication resources with devices and communication with the other nodes in the mesh, a dual-band router like Eero or Eero 6 will need to share its speed between the mesh and wireless devices.
If you need to access your gigabit connection all over your home and a wired connection isn't possible, Eero Pro 6 can deliver. Keep in mind that you'll need a Wi-Fi 6 capable device to access this router full speed.
Mesh Wi-Fi Router Face-off AmpliFi
The Wi-Fi 5 option AmpliFi HD
The AmpliFi HD, from Wi-Fi legends Ubiquiti, looks different from the other products on this list. Each satellite plugs directly into a wall outlet but each AmpliFi satellite has a large antenna. This makes it easier to find a place for them or harder, depending on where you need them. It delivers good, strong whole-house Wi-Fi like the other products on this list.
Pros
- Five Gigabit Ethernet ports on the base like a traditional router
- Smartphone app or account not required
- More advanced settings than Eero or Google Wifi
- Connection information displayed on the router
Cons
- Satellites are large and require mounting on a wall outlet
- Satellites have no Ethernet ports
- Satellites aren't as attractive as the competition (but are interesting to some)
The AmpliFi HD boasts a 20,000-square-foot coverage area from a single base and two satellites. Our testing leads us to believe it, as a usable signal extended further down the street than we thought possible. That's enough reason for some of us to buy it — you might also be able to have great Wi-Fi in your workshop or any outbuilding (or share Wi-Fi with your neighbor). Part of this is because of the unique satellite configuration. Rather than a smallish puck designed to sit on a table somewhere, each is a tall, two-piece wand that needs to be plugged directly into an outlet.
There's also a coolness factor missing from the others on our list with AmpliFi's touchscreen display on the base that can monitor network speeds or show the time (it can also be shut off). This can be quite handy if the base is set somewhere like a desk in a home office and can double as a clock, besides having access to some user settings. Speaking of settings, you'll find more advanced ones on the AmpliFi HD than you will on Google Wifi or Eero, but not as many as the Orbi. It's a good balance for the average home user with something like a dedicated media server.
If you're looking for more speed, AmpliFi also makes the Alien, which features Wi-Fi 6 and one of the fastest and most capable Wi-Fi 6 mesh setups. It's quite a bit more expensive, however, and overkill for most people.
One thing to consider here is that the AmpliFi HD isn't exactly childproof. The satellites will be plugged in where a curious little one can reach them and look interesting enough to make sure they notice them. The newest version of the AmpliFi HD ditches the original beacons' swiveling antenna, making them a bit less flexible but more robust.
Long range king
AmpliFi HD WiFi System
Ubiquiti's Amplifi HD system delivers the most coverage of the mesh routers we've tested and delivered a fast and dependable Wi-Fi network without any fuss or a tedious setup. It does have some big satellites, though, so know that before you buy.
AmpliFi also has a slower but much more compact option. AmpliFi Instant comes in a relatively compact puck shape measuring just under four inches wide and 1.3 inches tall. Still, it manages to pack in an Ethernet port on every node and covers up to 2,000 sq ft with each one.
The Wi-Fi 6 option AmpliFi Alien
AmpliFi Alien is Ubiquiti's newest edition to the AmpliFi lineup, and it aims to regain its mesh coverage and speed dominance. With a total wireless capacity of 7685Mbps, this is one of the fastest Wi-Fi 6 routers in a mesh system. This speed is possible thanks to the 16 spatial streams divided into a 2.4GHz and 5GHz set of Wi-Fi 6 bands and another Wi-Fi 5 band at 5GHz.
If you like keeping up to date on the status of your Wi-Fi without opening an app, you'll love the Alien's large color touch screen. Four Ethernet ports on the back of the router allow you to connect your wired devices but all of the ports, including the WAN port, max out at 1Gbps, making that the maximum internet speed you'll ever see.
The Alien does come in at a fairly massive 9.84 inches tall and 2.65 pounds, which isn't that much more than comparable fast routers from other companies, is still considerable. For all that size, you get great coverage. A single Alien router covers up to 3,000 sq ft and adding in a MeshPoint takes that up to 6,000 sq ft.
Out of this world
AmpliFi Alien
Tons of speed in a sleek package
AmpliFi Alien is fast even compared to other Wi-Fi 6 routers thanks to16 spatial streams. It can keep up with any home network.
Nest Wifi vs. Orbi vs. Eero vs. AmpliFi Which should you buy
Which is best depends a lot on what you're looking for. If you want the most plug-and-play model, Nest Wifi is one of those gems that anyone can install. Nest Wifi does require a Google account, and internet access is almost a must (and absolutely required for setup).
Eero 6 has managed a significant speed upgrade over the standard Eero bringing your mesh link speed much closer to your gigabit connection and confidently handling 500Mbps. Eero is also compatible with the older Eero routers and Beacons for plenty of expansion options. You can also confidently upgrade since your older Eeros can expand the mesh further. Orbi is great for someone running a server or has other needs for advanced QoS and forwarding options, but is big, bulky, and expensive. Finally, AmpliFi covers your house, yard, and maybe even your neighbor but isn't perfect for homes with small children.
In the end, I choose Nest Wifi even though the requirement of having a Google account and losing features if you aren't connected to the internet are things I don't care for. I'm OK with the information Google collects and the methods they use to do it (you can read that right here), but I disagree with it in principle. The "good" outweighs the "bad" or me, though.
- Nest Wifi is cheap, and expansion is easy. And also cheap.
- Nest Wifi routers have a network port for a Cat 5/Cat 6 cable.
I was able to extend my network out to an outbuilding area by running a cable underground in some conduit and plugging each end into a Nest Wifi or Google Wifi unit. The two "meshes" work this way seamlessly, and I saved a good bit of money. Most people won't need anything like this, but the same idea applies if you want a wired connection to something like an Xbox or television and still extend the mesh network in the room it's in.
But really, you can't go wrong with any of these choices. Each has one or two drawbacks as well as a few strong points, but they all deliver where it counts: providing a strong, fast network connection.

Keep your Eero out of harm's way with the best wall mounts
Having a mount for your Eero Wi-Fi router may not be the first thing on your mind, but it'll save you a lot of trouble in the long run. After all, who doesn't want to keep their Wi-Fi as safe as can be?By now, most of us have used a phone with contactless payments, or if not, we've seen such devices in the wild. Samsung Pay first got its start in Korea in 2015 before being rolled out worldwide the following year. Paying with our phones is a great feature, but Samsung Pay can do so much more than that! We'll show you how to add credit/debit cards, gift cards, and membership cards to this handy virtual wallet on your Samsung Galaxy phone.
What is Samsung Pay?
As mentioned above, Samsung Pay has been around for about five years now, and in addition to offering users a secure digital wallet to store their payment, membership, and gift cards, it has utility above and beyond other mobile payment systems. For example, Samsung offers users the ability to purchase gift cards at a discount, and partners with retailers for promotions as well. You can store your transit payment cards, and you can even pay at traditional swipe credit card terminals that do not support other NFC payment options.
How to add credit cards and gift cards to the Samsung Pay app
- Open the Samsung Pay app.
- If you haven't previously done so, create a PIN for your Samsung Pay account.
- At the top of the screen, you should see a Cards section. To add a new credit or debit card, tap the + sign above Credit/debit.
- A popup will ask which kind of payment card you wish to add. Tap on Add credit/debit card, Samsung Pay Cash, or PayPal.
Follow the prompts to add your card and validate it.
- To add a new membership card (like for a local grocery store or pharmacy), tap the + sign above Membership.
Search by the various categories and options for membership cards, or tap Add a card not listed here at the bottom of the screen.
- To add a new gift card (like for a retail store or something like Visa), tap the + sign above Gift.
- Tap on either Load gift cards or Buy gift cards depending on whether you want to add one you were given, or purchase a card for someone else.
- If you tapped Load gift cards, scroll through the list of options or search to find the vendor whose card you've received.
If you tapped Buy gift cards, scroll through the categories and list of options or search in the search field to find the card you wish to purchase.
Samsung often partners with vendors and retailers to offer discounts on gift cards purchased through Samsung Pay, so be sure to check out those options. They could save you 10-20% or more! There are also deals on the Samsung Pay home screen for discounts on purchases made through the app from retailers like Nike, Groupon, Disney, and many more.
While you're setting up your cards in the Samsung Pay app, be sure to check out all of the other available features and resources. There is information on how to use Samsung Pay, Samsung Pay privacy controls, as well as promotions, rewards, and even the ability to host your transit payment cards.

|Dimensions||161.6 x 71.1 x 9.3mm|
|Weight||190g|
Pros
- Flat 120Hz display is terrific
- All-day battery life
- Promised three years of software updates
- Impressive cameras with 3x optical zoom
- Sturdy design with fun color options
Cons
Samsung clearly understands that 2020 is a year for people to pare back their expenses because the Galaxy S20 FE is a value flagship that really doesn't skimp. It's based on the successful foundation of the $1,200 Galaxy S20+, featuring a spacious 6.5-inch 1080p AMOLED display with a luxurious 120Hz refresh rate, a Snapdragon 865, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and an all-day 4,500mAh battery.
Of course, to hit that $700 price point, Samsung needed to make some sacrifices, so it traded the Galaxy S20 series' back glass for colorful plastic — the FE is available in six delicious colors — and cut back on the quality of the triple-camera setup ever-so-slightly.
Still, the phone has everything you'd expect in a high-end phone, and performs just as well. We especially love the IP68 water resistance and wireless charging, two features rare in this price bracket. Plus, it shares the same primary camera sensor as the Galaxy S20 and S20+, which ensures beautiful results in good light and bad.
Samsung's One UI 2.5 is also on-board, and the company's promising three years of platform and security updates, ensuring that you'll be getting the latest Android features well into the next decade.
Finally, Samsung includes sub-6Ghz 5G in all variants of the Galaxy S20 FE, and we found performance to be excellent on both AT&T's and T-Mobile's 5G networks. If you want a Verizon version that supports mmWave, it's also available.

Samsung Galaxy S20 FE
The Galaxy S20 FE offers nearly everything you'd find on the more expensive S20 variants, with high-end specs and impressive cameras.
2. OnePlus 8 Pro
The best premium Android phone
Bottom line: Have a bit more cash to spend? The OnePlus 8 Pro is every bit as good as the S20 FE, though it steps up to better cameras, a nicer design, and faster wireless charging.
|Category||OnePlus 8 Pro|
|Display||6.78-inch AMOLED, 3168 x 1440, 120Hz refresh rate|
|Processor||Qualcomm Snapdragon 865|
|RAM||8 or 12GB|
|Storage||128 or 256GB|
|Cameras||48MP primary, 8MP telephoto|
|Charging||30W wired and wireless|
|Battery||4,510 mAh|
|Water Resistance||IP68|
|Dimensions||165.3 x 74.4 x 8.5mm|

48MP ultra-wide, 5MP color filter
Pros:
- 120Hz display is incredible
- Super-fast performance
- Very good cameras
- Large battery and fast charge speeds
- IP68 rating for dust/water resistance
Cons:
The OnePlus 8 Pro is impressive and well-designed as any high-end smartphone can be. If you know anything about OnePlus phones, you'll be happy to know it doesn't upend the traditional OnePlus formula. Instead, it extends it to its logical place in the world of 2020 flagships with more features and a higher price.
The hardware goes toe-to-toe with any phone out there, and it's punctuated by the best display OnePlus has ever used. It's bright, colorful and has a 120Hz refresh rate. Inside, there are exceptional specs, and that leads to fantastic performance thanks to the super-smooth OxygenOS software — it's just a joy to use.
The 8 Pro also brings the best cameras yet to the OnePlus phone, with a new primary sensor that steps up its game to a true flagship level. The entire camera experience is a small step behind the likes of the Galaxy S20+, but then again, it's also a little less expensive. Rounding out the hardware side of things, the OnePlus 8 Pro delivers great battery life and super-fast charge speeds (including support for both 30W wired and wireless charging).
Overall, the OnePlus 8 Pro earns one of our top recommendation because it's just so easy to recommend to anyone looking for a flagship smartphone. It has a beautiful display, incredible performance, very good cameras, and long-lasting battery life. There's no major drawback to any aspect of the phone, making its price tag that much more appealing. It's not quite as good of a deal as the Galaxy S20 FE, but it's a great phone regardless.

3. Google Pixel 4a
The best value Android phone
Bottom line There are a lot of good smartphone deals out there, but done of them are as amazing as the Pixel 4a. From its flagship-grade camera, fast performance, reliable battery life, and long-term software support, no other phone gives you this much for so little.
|Category||Google Pixel 4a|
|Display||5.81-inch OLED, 2340 x 1080, 60Hz refresh rate|
|Processor||Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G|
|RAM||6GB|
|Storage||128GB|
|Cameras||12.2MP primary|
|Charging||18W wired|
|Battery||3,140 mAh|
|Water Resistance||❌|
|Dimensions||144 x 69.4 x 8.2mm|
|Weight||143g|
Pros:
- Flagship camera on a budget phone
- Easy to use in one hand
- AMOLED display looks great
- Snappy performance
- Three years of software support
Cons:
The Pixel 4a is the best phone value available today, period. Google's packed most of what makes the Pixel 4 series good into a smartphone that costs over 50% less. You also get a compact device that, in spite of its size, excels in the battery life department. Seriously, this phone lasts all day and then some.
Perhaps the most impressive part of the 4a is its camera, which is nearly on par with the Pixel 4. The main camera shoots exceptional photos in all lighting conditions, with Night Sight really showing its strength in poor lighting. Google even added Astrophotography mode this time around and improved the already-impressive Portrait Mode. The front-facing camera is also tack-sharp and focuses more quickly than on the Pixel 3a from last year. Both front and back, you're getting flagship-level camera quality out of a phone that's a fraction of the price. Google's also improved the video quality this year, thanks to an improved Snapdragon 730 SoC and 6GB of RAM standard.
So what do you lose by spending three hundred and fifty dollars instead of eight hundred or a thousand? Well, the Pixel 4a is made of plastic and lacks both water resistance and wireless charging, features you can take for granted at a higher price point. It also only comes in one size, a 5.8-inch variant, and one color, black. There are no storage size options, either: you get 128GB of internal memory, which should be plenty for most people, but a lack of microSD expansion may be a problem for the content collectors out there. And it should go without saying that the Pixel 4a lacks 5G support, but Google has unveiled the Pixel 4a 5G, which is coming on Nov. 19 for just under $500 with 5G support, a larger battery, an ultrawide camera, and more.
All of these limitations shouldn't impede your desire to buy the Pixel 4a, which has been one of the best smartphone surprises of 2020 so far— even if it did launch a few months late. From the size to the performance to the battery life and camera quality, Google's latest budget phone is a winner.

The Pixel 4a has flagship camera quality at a fraction of the price. It's also one of the few legitimately compact phones available.
4. Moto G Power
The best Android phone on a budget
Bottom line The Moto G Power doesn't have the best specs or design, but for people that are shopping with a tight budget, it delivers a thoroughly enjoyable Android experience for a shockingly small amount of money.
|Category||Moto G Power|
|Display||6.4-inch LCD, 2300 x 1080, 60Hz refresh rate|
|Processor||Qualcomm Snapdragon 665|
|RAM||4GB|
|Storage||64GB|
|Cameras||16MP primary, 8MP ultra-wide, 2MP macro|
|Charging||10W wired|
|Battery||5,000 mAh|
|Water Resistance||Water-repellant coating|
|Dimensions||159.9 x 75.8 x 9.6mm|
|Weight||199g|
Pros:
- Easy on the wallet
- Up to three-day battery life
- Runs most apps/games just fine
- Clean, intuitive software
- Works with every U.S. carrier
Cons:
While a lot of this list focuses on high-end Android phones, the "best" you can buy doesn't necessarily mean the most expensive or most premium. For a lot of people, the best Android phone is the one that runs all of their apps and games, keeps them connected with loved ones, and does so while costing as little as possible. If that's the kind of phone you're shopping for, you'd like to steer your attention towards the Moto G Power.
Compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro and Galaxy S20+, the Moto G Power isn't nearly as impressive. It has an LCD display that's only 60Hz, it features a plastic construction that scratches fairly easily, and the cameras won't blow you away any time soon. Here's the thing, though — none of that stuff matters. If you want a phone that'll work the way you want it to and not make you want to tear your hair out, the Moto G Power fits the bill perfectly.
Despite its lower specs, there's nothing about the Moto G Power that's a deal-breaker. The display looks more than good enough given the phone's low price, it can handle just about any app or game without serious issues, and the cameras (while not amazing) are perfectly fine for sharing quick pictures on Twitter and Instagram. There's also the gigantic 5,000 mAh battery, which can get you through two or three days of full use on a single charge. Seriously.
The lack of NFC for Google Pay is disappointing, as is the fact that Android 11 is the only major update the Moto G Power will ever see. If those two things don't matter to you, however, this is one of the best Android phones you can buy for this cheap of a price.

5. Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
The best ultra premium Android phone
Bottom line The Note 20 Ultra is a phone that was made to do it all. It has top-of-the-line performance, a huge display that looks outstanding, and an ultra-powerful S Pen that can be used to drawing, note-taking, and so much more.
|Category||Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra|
|Display||6.9-inch AMOLED, 3088 x 1440, 120Hz refresh rate|
|Processor||Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+|
|RAM||12GB|
|Storage||128 or 512GB|
|Cameras||108MP primary, 12MP telephoto, 12MP ultra-wide|
|Charging||25W wired and 15W wireless|
|Battery||4,500 mAh|
|Water Resistance||IP68|
|Dimensions||164.8 x 77.2 x 8.1mm|
|Weight||208g|
Pros:
- Samsung's best design in years
- 120Hz AMOLED screen
- S Pen is more powerful than ever
- Really excellent cameras
- All-day battery
Cons:
The world turns, seasons change, and Samsung updates its Note lineup. It's an annual constant, and yet Samsung went and made some massive changes to the Note lineup this year. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is an imposing and beautiful object, arrayed in a matte glass back finish with a massive camera bump located in the top left corner. The camera, which has three lenses, is one of the most impressive updates to this Note 10+ successor, but the real story starts, as always, with the display.
The 6.9-inch AMOLED display on the Note 20 Ultra is absolutely stunning, among the brightest, most colorful and accurate ever made. It's also the canvas for the new-and-improved S Pen, which now boasts latency three times less than the previous generation Note. That means text, sketches, and other S Pen-related activities feel more like real paper than ever. The Snapdragon 865+ SoC and 12GB of RAM inside the phone attempt to justify the imposing price tag, but Samsung's cut absolutely no corners here. The 4,500mAh battery lasts all day (most of the time), and the dual speakers are just as impressive as ever.
Getting back to the cameras, here's where the Note 20 Ultra really tries to differentiate itself from previous Note phones. The main 108MP sensor is just huge, physically and artistically, allowing you to take beautiful portraits and close-ups with shallow depth of field. Samsung's also fixed the autofocus issues that plagued the Galaxy S20 Ultra, too, so this is easily the company's best camera ever. Even better, you get a true 5x telephoto camera that cuts no corners thanks to an engineering marvel in the form of a prism.
Samsung's also cleaned up its software game in the form of One UI 2.5. It's still based on Android 10, but the company's made some subtle tweaks to the way everything coheres, and it finally feels like Samsung has a unified approach to software. Plus, Samsung's promised three years of software updates, so it's likely the Note 20 Ultra will get Android 13 sometime in 2022 or 2023. How cool is that?
The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra isn't cheap, but it could be the best premium phone on the market right now. It's still a bit too pricey to be our top pick, but if you want the phone with the least compromises, this is the one to get.

6. Google Pixel 5
The best Android camera
Bottom line They say that the best camera you have is the one you have with you, so make sure it's the best it can be. Google's Pixel 5 takes incredible photos in virtually any setting, and thanks to the company's top-notch image processing, you don't even have to be a pro photographer to get impressive shots.
|Category||Google Pixel 5|
|Display||6.0-inch OLED, 2340 x 1080, 90Hz refresh rate|
|Processor||Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G|
|RAM||8GB|
|Storage||128GB|
|Cameras||12.2MP primary, 16MP ultra-wide|
|Charging||18W wired, 15W wireless, 5W reverse wireless|
|Battery||4,080 mAh|
|Water Resistance||IP68|
|Dimensions||144.7 x 70.4 x 8.0mm|
|Weight||151g|
Pros:
- The best camera on the market
- Compact and comfortable to hold
- 90Hz AMOLED display
- Great battery life
- Three years of software updates
Cons:
The Pixel 5 is Google's latest flagship smartphone that you can buy, and compared to past releases, it's a huge departure. Rather than trying to have the absolute best specs possible, the Pixel 5 focuses on offering a great all-around user experience at a competitive price. And, in just about every regard, it succeeds.
First thing's first, we have to talk about the Pixel 5's camera performance. Simply put, if camera quality is a key priority for you, the Pixel 5 should be at the very top of your shopping list. The 12.2MP primary and 16MP ultra-wide cameras may not look all that impressive on paper, but combined with Google's unmatched image processing, they kick out truly incredible results. Detail is sharp, colors are true-to-life, and the Pixel 5 handles low-light environments without a hitch. The best part? The Pixel 5 does all of this more reliably than any other smartphone.
Outside of killer cameras, the Pixel 5 has a bunch more to offer. We're in love with its design, which is refreshingly compact and is made entirely out of aluminum. The paint job gives it an exceptional in-hand feel, and if you ask us. the Sorta Sage color is one of the best we've ever seen on a phone. Period.
Rounding out the Pixel 5 experience is a 90Hz AMOLED display, fast performance thanks to the Snapdragon 765G processor, and long-lasting battery life. For considerably less money than a lot of other flagships, the Pixel 5 is well worth your consideration.

7. Google Pixel 4a 5G
The best 5G value Android phone
Bottom line If you like what you see with the Pixel 5 but can't stomach its price tag, the Pixel 4a 5G could be the perfect alternative. The core experience is virtually identical since it features the exact same cameras and processor. If you're OK with a cheaper design and lesser display, it's a great pick.
|Category||Google Pixel 4a 5G|
|Display||6.2-inch OLED, 2340 x 1080, 60Hz refresh rate|
|Processor||Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G|
|RAM||6GB|
|Storage||128GB|
|Cameras||12.2MP primary, 16MP ultra-wide|
|Charging||18W wired|
|Battery||3,800 mAh|
|Water Resistance||❌|
|Dimensions||153.9 x 74.0 x 8.2mm|
|Weight||168g|
Pros:
- Exact same cameras as the Pixel 5
- Fantastic performance for the price
- Reliable battery life
- OLED screen looks great
- Killer price
Cons:
Google crafted something special with the Pixel 5. It's an incredible phone, but what if $700 is just more than you're looking to spend right now? In that case, we'd turn your attention towards the Pixel 4a 5G. It's a very similar phone in more ways than one, but thanks to a couple of smart compromises, it costs considerably less.
So, what's the same? Compared to the Pixel 5, the Pixel 4a 5G has the exact same processor, cameras, and storage. That means it's plenty fast, takes amazing photos, and has more than enough space for all of your apps/games. It also has very similar battery life (which is to say that it's great), along with an identical software experience that's backed by years of guaranteed updates.
As for how Google was able to cut costs, here's what you don't get with the Pixel 4a 5G: there's no wireless charging, you don't have an IP rating for dust/water resistance, the screen is 60Hz instead of 90Hz, and the phone is made out of plastic instead of aluminum. Those are notable compromises you do need to consider, but if none of those things matter to you, the Pixel 4a 5G is an excellent value that should not go ignored. And, like the name suggests, you're still future-proofing yourself with 5G support.

8. OnePlus 8T
The best Android phone for international buyers
Bottom line The world of international Android phones is a vast and varied one, and the OnePlus 8T is one of the best you can buy. It has a fantastic AMOLED display, top-notch specs, and is an especially great deal for shoppers outside of the U.S.
|Category||OnePlus 8T|
|Display||6.55-inch AMOLED|
|Processor||Qualcomm Snapdragon 865|
|RAM||12GB|
|Storage||256GB|
|Cameras||48MP primary, 16MP ultra-wide, 5MP macro, 2MP monochrome|
|Charging||65W wired|
|Battery||4,500 mAh|
|Water Resistance||❌|
|Dimensions||160.7 x 74.1 x 8.4mm|
|Weight||188g|
2400 x 1080
120Hz refresh rate
Pros:
- Blazing-fast performance
- Sleek, attractive design
- 120Hz AMOLED display
- Tons of RAM and storage
- 65W charging is mind-blowing
Cons:
The OnePlus 8T is OnePlus's newest smartphone offering, and all-in-all, it has a lot to offer. The 8 Pro is still the higher-end and more feature-rich OnePlus handset, but if you have a bit less cash to spend and are an international user, the 8T drives a hard bargain.
Powering the phone is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 processor, along with a generous 12GB of RAM. That allows for incredible performance no matter what you're doing, and thanks to the 120Hz display, everything moves like butter no matter how hard you're pushing the phone. You also get 256GB of storage for all your local files, in addition to a 4,500 mAh battery that allows for long endurance.
When it comes time to refuel the OnePlus 8T, it uses the company's new Warp Charge 65 charging standard. This means you can charge the 8T from 0 - 100% in just 39 minutes, making it one of the fastest charging solutions available right now. The lack of wireless charging is a bummer, but this definitely makes up for it.
The OnePlus 8T is a good purchase if you live in the U.S., but thanks to phones like the Galaxy S20 FE and Pixel 5, it's not the same amazing value that past OnePlus phones have been. In other markets, however, the 8T is considerably more affordable. If you live somewhere like India or the U.K., the 8T is a lot more appealing.

9. Samsung Galaxy S20+
The best alternative Samsung phone
Bottom line The higher price of the Galaxy S20+ isn't for everyone, but if you can afford it, you're in for something special. Compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro, you're primarily benefitting from nicer cameras, an even better display, and a ton of extra features that are only available on a Samsung phone.
|Category||Samsung Galaxy S20+|
|Display||6.7-inch AMOLED, 3200 x 1440, 120Hz refresh rate|
|Processor||Qualcomm Snapdragon 865|
|RAM||8GB|
|Storage||128 or 512GB|
|Cameras||12MP primary, 64MP telephoto, 12MP ultra-wide, 0.3MP depth|
|Charging||25W wired and 15W wireless|
|Battery||4,500 mAh|
|Water Resistance||IP68|
|Dimensions||161.9 x 73.7 x 7.8mm|
|Weight||186g|
Pros:
- Industry-leading display
- Premium design/build quality
- Wonderful cameras
- Excellent battery life
- Tons of software features
Cons:
Before the Galaxy S20 series came out, our top pick here was the Galaxy S10+ — and everything Samsung did this year made it easy to recommend the S20+. The S20+ makes improvements across the board, starting with the display. It's a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, and it's easily one of the very best screens you can get on a smartphone in 2020. We're also happy to see the Snapdragon 865 processor, which allows for breakneck speeds and native 5G support on all U.S. carriers.
Samsung made improvements to other specs, too, with the S20+ offering a large 4,500 mAh battery that has more than enough juice for even the most intense of power-users. There's also plenty of RAM and storage to keep you happy, with Samsung still allowing you to add additional space with a microSD card if you need to.
The huge move up is with the cameras, with a new array both front and back. The new sensors are all larger and let in more light so you can take dramatically better low-light photos. It's not entirely on the level of the Pixel 5, but this is a big step up for Samsung and is no longer a shortcoming of this flagship. You also get capable zooming up to 5X, while keeping an ultra-wide camera for more shooting variety.
Rounding out the Galaxy S20+ are all of the usual Samsung trimmings you've come to expect. The company's One UI software experience is jam-packed with features, and while it can be a bit overwhelming at times, there's no denying the utility that's added by the software. Samsung Pay also continues to be the best mobile payment service on the market, supporting NFC and MST transactions so you can pay with the S20+ at virtually any business.

10. Sony Xperia 1 II
The best Android phone for video
Bottom line Lots of phones shoot great-looking video these days, but few offer as many features and settings in this department as the Sony Xperia 1 II. If you consider yourself a videographer and want a phone you can use for creative work, this is what you should get.
|Category||Sony Xperia 1 II|
|Display||6.5-inch OLED, 3840 x 1644, 60Hz refresh rate|
|Processor||Qualcomm Snapdragon 865|

|Battery||4,000 mAh|
|Water Resistance||IP68|
|Dimensions||165.1 x 71.1 x 7.6mm|
|Weight||181g|
Pros:
- Absolutely gorgeous 4K display
- Fast performance
- There's a headphone jack
- Extremely capable camera system
- Reliable battery life
Cons:
Sony is most well-known these days for its cameras, headphones, and the PlayStation, but the company does still make Android phones. They don't get a lot of buzz and are pretty much invisible in the U.S., but that's not to say you should overlook what the company's kicking out. In fact, if you're a fan of shooting video with your smartphone, the Sony Xperia 1 II is an excellent consideration.
The Xperia 1 II comes equipped with Sony's Cinema Pro app, allowing you to have full control over the video that you shoot. There are endless settings and features to adjust, giving you options that a lot of other phones simply don't offer. On the technical side of things, the Xperia 1 II can shoot 4K HDR video at 24, 25, 30, and 60fps. There's also optical and electronic image stabilization, allowing you to keep all of your pans as smooth as can be.
When you're ready to view your footage, the Sony Xperia 1 II touts a seriously impressive screen. It's a 6.5-inch OLED one with a legit 4K resolution and 21:9 aspect ratio. It's one of the most cinematic displays on the market, and while there's no fast refresh rate, that doesn't take away from just how darn good it looks.
Ample storage, RAM, and battery capacity help to flesh out the rest of the Xperia 1 II experience, and we're pleased to see things like a headphone jack and wireless charging. It isn't the best deal out there, given the high price tag, but if you're serious about video, the Xperia 1 II makes a strong case for itself.

11. Nokia 5.3
The best Android phone under $200
Bottom line Buying a new smartphone in 2020 is challenging for a lot of people. If you have a max budget of just $200 and aren't sure what to get, check out the Nokia 5.3. Despite having an ultra-low price, it manages to deliver on the fundamentals much better than you'd expect.
|Category||Nokia 5.3|

|Charging||10W wired|
|Battery||4,000 mAh|
|Water Resistance||❌|
|Dimensions||164.3 x 76.6 x 8.5mm|
|Weight||185g|
Pros:
- Modern design
- Long-lasting battery
- Clean, simple software
- NFC for Google Pay
- Has a fingerprint sensor
Cons:
Thanks to a multitude of events that have happened throughout the year, it's very likely you don't have a large budget for buying a new phone right now. If that happens to be the case for you, one of the best options to consider is the Nokia 5.3. It obviously isn't the most technically-impressive handset out there, but for its price, you couldn't ask for more.
Starting with its performance, it's powered by the same Snapdragon 665 chipset and 4GB of RAM found in the Moto G Power. That means it can run all of your apps and games just fine, and with 64GB of built-in storage (expandable up to 512GB), you have a good amount of space for storing all of them. There's also a generous 4,000 mAh battery, which Nokia says is big enough to get you through around two days of use on a single charge.
Taking over the front of the Nokia 5.3 is a 6.55-inch LCD display, featuring a resolution of 1600x720. This is far from the sharpest screen we've ever seen, but it looks perfectly fine given the low price. On a more positive note, we're thrilled to see a fingerprint sensor and even NFC for Google Pay payments.

Just like any piece of technology, smartphones evolve and change as time goes on. We've seen screens get bigger, cameras get a lot more capable, and processors rival those found in computers. The next big thing for phones is the folding form factor, and so far, the best yet in this niche is the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2.
The best way to think about the device is it being a phone and tablet in one. When the Z Fold 2 is closed, you're treated to a 6.23-inch AMOLED display that you can use for anything you'd like — checking email, scrolling through Twitter, watching YouTube videos, you name it. Should you find yourself wanting a larger canvas, however, all you need to do is open up the Z Fold 2 up. There, you're treated to a larger 7.6-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. It's a lot like having an iPad Mini that you can fold up and take with you wherever you want, and if you ask us, that's pretty amazing.
As you might expect for a new technology like a folding phone, the Z Fold 2 does come with some unique dilemmas. The Ultra Thin Glass for the tablet display is prone to scratches a lot more than traditional glass, the folding design raises questions about long-term durability, and not all apps are properly optimized for that larger display size. There's also the matter of price, with the Galaxy Z Fold 2 costing more than two OnePlus 8 Pros.
This isn't a phone that we recommend everyone go out and buy right now, but as far as folding phones go, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is the best we've seen to-date. If you're willing to spend the money and put up with those quirks, the Z Fold 2 has a lot to offer.

Folding phones are the future, and leading that revolution is the Galaxy Z Fold 2 from Samsung.
How to pick the best Android phone
Android phones have never been better than they are right now. Regardless of how much or little money you can spend, you can go out and buy a phone that you'll be thoroughly happy with. Out of every single phone on the market in 2020, however, we have to give our top recommendation as the best Android phone to the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE.
Samsung makes amazing phones every single year, but more often than not, you need to pay out the nose for the privilege of owning one. With the Galaxy S20 FE, you get a top-tier Samsung experience at a better value than we've seen in a long time.
Compared to a more expensive Galaxy handset like the S20+, the FE is shockingly similar. It has a 120Hz AMOLED screen, the Snapdragon 865, great battery life, and the same One UI software experience. Even wireless charging and an IP68 rating are here, two things that often get cut with these new "value flagships" we're seeing more of lately.
There are plenty of other options on this list if something about the Galaxy S20 FE just isn't clicking for you, but at the end of the day, we think it's easy to see why it has our highest recommendation.
1. What size screen should I get?
There are a lot of different things you should consider when buying a new Android phone, and it all starts with the display. This is the component you interact with more than anything else, so it's important you get one that you'll enjoy using. Things like the resolution and refresh rate of a screen are worth talking about, but even more so is the size.
Smartphones come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes, and the biggest determining factor for that is the display. A 6.9-inch screen results in a much larger phone than one with a 5.8-inch one, and because of that, you need to know how big or small you're willing to go.
Take the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, for example. It has the largest display on this list (outside of the Z Fold 2, but that's different), and because the screen is so huge, it's a phenomenal canvas for watching movies, playing games, and browsing the web. Basically, any kind of content consumption you do looks better on a larger display, because the more room you have, the bigger and easier-to-see your media is. The downside to this, however, is that phones like the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra can be rather unwieldy. Especially if you're someone with smaller hands, managing a phone like that can be a pain in the butt.
Then there are smaller-sized phones, such as the Pixel 4a. It's substantially easier to manage and can actually be used with one hand, but on the flip side, you have less room for your movies and games. It also means you can fit less content on the screen at one time, and if you're someone that likes to increase your font size so things are easier to read, that could result in you having to do a lot of scrolling.
And, of course, there are plenty of phones that fall somewhere in the middle between these two extremes. If you're really concerned about whether or not a phone will be too big or small, your best bet is to honestly go hands-on with it yourself at your local carrier store or Best Buy before making your purchase.
2. Are software updates important?
It's easy to compare things like displays, processors, and cameras, but something that's just as important to talk about is software updates. Android is constantly evolving and getting better, and unfortunately, only certain phones are backed by a few years of software support.
As it stands, Google and Samsung are the best in the business when it comes to supporting their phones with long-term updates. All of the Pixels and Galaxy devices mentioned on this list are backed by three years of major OS updates from their initial release, which is by far the best support any Android phone maker has to offer. Google even goes a step further with three years of guaranteed monthly security patches, which is an area in which Samsung still has some room to improve.
On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, you have a company like Motorola. Take the Moto G Power, which is only promised to get a single update to Android 11. Security patches are even worse, with Motorola having a track record of falling multiple months behind the latest patches.
So, how important is it that your phone gets software updates? That ultimately depends on how much you care about new Android features. Google releases a new version of Android every single year, and while these updates don't tend to be that drastic from year-to-year, they do give your phone important features and security settings that help keep it running in tip-top shape for a long time to come. It also ensures that your phone stays compatible with all the apps and games on the Play Store, because as Android versions become too outdated, app developers eventually drop support.
A phone like the Moto G Power won't be unusable two years down the road just because it's running Android 11 and not Android 13, but it's also a bit disheartening to buy a product and know it's backed by such a small window of post-purchase support. This divide in updates is something Android has been faced with for years, and while companies are gradually getting better in these regards, we still have plenty of room to grow.
3. How many cameras and megapixels do I really need?
Over the last couple of years, there's been a trend going on with certain phone companies and them wanting to throw as many cameras as they can on their devices. As it's become more and more common for phones to ship with two, three, or even four cameras, there's something of an expectation that phones have to have multiple camera sensors in order to be any good.
Spoiler alert — this isn't true.
Let's look at the OnePlus 8T. It has a 48MP primary camera, 16MP ultra-wide, 5MP macro, and 2MP monochrome camera. Compared side-by-side with the single 12.2MP camera on the Pixel 4a, one would assume that the OnePlus 8T takes better photos. In reality, it absolutely does not.
Having those extra camera sensors can be a lot of fun, but only if they're high-quality. Far too often, we see companies throw in a bunch of extra cameras on their phones only to have these secondary lenses not be very good. The primary camera sensor is always the most important, so that's the one you want to be concerned about the most.
On a similar note, more megapixels (referred to as MP) doesn't always mean you're getting a better camera. As mentioned above, the 48MP camera on the OnePlus 8T takes worse photos than the 12.2MP camera found on the Pixel 4a. There are so many other factors that come into play with phone cameras, so don't let the megapixel count be your one and only factor for judging them when you're out shopping. Read reviews, look at camera samples, and you'll have a much better understanding of what kind of camera you're dealing with.
4. What size battery should I get?
Battery life isn't the most fun thing to talk about with smartphones, but ultimately, it's one of the most important components. Your phone can have the best display and processor around, but if it's constantly dying throughout the day, what's the point?
There are a lot of different battery capacities for all of the phones on this list, and if you don't regularly keep up with them, it can be difficult to know what a good size is and what isn't. So, here's a general rule of thumb. If you're buying an Android phone in 2020, the ideal capacity is one that's 4,000 mAh or larger. As phones move towards larger displays with faster refresh rates, more battery is needed to keep them powered throughout the day.
Of course, this can vary a bit depending on the type of phone you're buying. The Pixel 4a, for example, only has a 3,140 mAh battery but can still get through a full day of use without a hitch. What gives? It has a small display by 2020 standards and only has a 60Hz refresh rate — thus resulting in substantially less power use.
These are factors you'll need to consider when shopping for your phone, but generally, more mAh means more battery life.
5. What smaller features should I look out for?
Last but certainly not least, there are a few smaller features and specs that can be easy to overlook when doing your shopping — a prime example being NFC. NFC stands for Near Field Communication, and it's the chip in most phones that allows you to pay with your smartphone with Google Pay at grocery stores, restaurants, etc. The vast majority of modern Android phones have the feature, but some don't (one of which is the Moto G Power). You may not care about Google Pay, but if you do, it's worth double-checking that the phone you want to buy does, in fact, have NFC.
Another spec to check for is an IP68 rating. This is a seal of protection a lot of phones have, and it ensures they're protected from a certain amount of dust and water. If you happen to get caught outside in the rain or take your phone to the beach, an IP68 rating is nice peace of mind that your phone should survive just fine.
Some phones lack this IP rating, yet tout that they're resistant to water or have a water-repellent coating. Those devices are also probably fine to get splashed with water here and there, but you don't have that same guaranteed protection. The best-case scenario is to avoid getting your phone wet whenever possible, but if you happen to be around the water a lot, it's probably worth getting something with that IP68 protection.
We should also address a trend that's been going through the smartphone space for a few years now — the death of the headphone jack. The vast majority of new phones coming out these days no longer have the port, but there remain a few holdouts that continue to offer it. It's certainly nice to have if you're someone that primarily uses wired headphones or earbuds, but if you've moved on to the wireless bandwagon, it's not something you need to be all that concerned with.
We know that's a lot to take in, but once you have an understanding of the kind of phone you're looking for and the budget you have to work with, we hope this guide makes you feel better equipped to make the right decision. There are so many good phones out there, and we wouldn't recommend one on this list if we didn't think you'd be happy with it. Happy shopping, and enjoy your new phone!

With a bigger emphasis on online shopping versus in-store appearances thanks to the global pandemic, a lot of retailers are opting to start Black Friday a lot earlier than normal. This helps companies by spreading out the shopping and avoiding delivery penalties, but it also helps you the shopper by giving you a much wider selection to choose from over the course of several weeks.
That's exactly what you can expect from Dell, one of the first major retailers to announce its Black Friday sales. A lot of the deals we know are coming aren't necessarily live yet, so if you see something here that you don't see at Dell, just be patient. There are going to be a lot of Doorbusters, limited-time and limited-quantity deals, and other sales throughout the next month and a half or so.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
Remember while Dell obviously a lot of its own products including laptops and desktops and monitors, Dell.com is as robust an online store as any other place selling electronics. Even if you don't need the latest computer from Alienware, you might want some Bose headphones or Sony speakers.
What's in the Black Friday Dell ad?
The Dell Black Friday ad dropped on Oct. 15. This is the first major Black Friday ad to be spotted and it has pages upon pages of deals. The ad confirms that while some of the sales for Black Friday start as early as Oct. 15, the majority of the Black Friday sales will start on Nov. 2 with the biggest sales coming between Nov. 16 and Nov. 28, the day after Black Friday.
Dell also plans to have an entirely new event after Black Friday called Cyber Week instead of Cyber Monday. That will take place between Nov. 29 and Dec. 6.
The ad does cover a lot of big deals on Dell gear. You'll be able to save on the XPS series of laptops, Alienware desktops, the newest monitors, and more. But there's also a lot of non-Dell stuff going on sale. Get Bose headphones, Amazon smart gear, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, and more.
What are Dell's Black Friday hours and Doorbusters?
Dell is an online retailer for the most part, so the hours are... all the time. As long as the sales are live, you can participate in the savings. Expect some deals to trickle in over time.
The main thing you need to watch out for are Dell's Doorbuster deals. These sales will be in limited supply and happen at specific times between now and Black Friday. For example, the Dell D2421 24-inch 1080p monitor will be on sale for $69.99, but that sale will not start until Nov. 16 and will only go live starting at 11 a.m. Eastern. There will also be a Dell XPS 13 Touch laptop doorbuster dropping it to the lowest price of the year, $699.99, at 6 p.m. Eastern on Nov. 26.
Some of the other Doorbusters include:
- D2721H 27-inch 1080p monitor down to $89.99 on Nov. 16 at 11 a.m. Eastern
- Alienware AW3420DW 34-inch curved monitor for $829.99 on Nov. 16 at 11 a.m. Eastern
- Dell G3 15 gaming laptop for $599.99 on Nov. 26 at 6 p.m. Eastern
- Inspiron 15 5000 laptop down to $549.99 on Nov. 27 at 7 p.m. Eastern
- XPS Desktop special edition down to $1,029.99 on Nov. 27 at 7 p.m. Eastern
It looks like Nov. 16, Nov. 26, and Nov. 27 will be the biggest days for Dell's Doorbusters with huge sales happening all throughout those days. Mark your calendars.
What other deals will Dell have?
We're seeing deals from pretty much all the big name brands you'd expect, including Dell's biggest models like the XPS, Alienware, and Inspiron. Popular names not owned by Dell include Amazon, Google, Samsung, Bose, JBL, and Wemo. Again, just to be clear, not all of these deals will be live at the same time. Some are live now, but the majority of the deals will be available between Nov. 16 and Nov. 28. And Doorbuster deals will be very limited in time and quantity.

Whether you're in a house or apartment, making sure your home is safe while you're away is a key priority, and there's no better way to do that than with one of the best smart doorbells on this list. Our favorite smart doorbell that can deter thieves while providing you with peace of mind is the Nest Hello. But Nest isn't the only great smart doorbell available; we've compiled a list of eight of the best on the market! See which one works for you.
- Best Smart Doorbell Overall: Nest Hello
- Best Smart Doorbell on a Budget: Ring Video Doorbell (2nd Gen)
- Best Smart Doorbell for Data Security: Eufy Video Doorbell 2K
- Best Smart Doorbell for Apartments or Condos: Ring Video Doorbell 3
- Best Smart Doorbell for Alexa: Ring Video Doorbell Pro
- Best Smart Doorbell Peephole Upgrade: Ring Peephole Cam
- Best Smart Doorbell for Local Storage: EZVIZ WiFi Video Doorbell
- Best Smart Doorbell for Pre-roll Recording: Arlo Video Doorbell
Best Smart Doorbell Overall: Nest Hello
I love this smart doorbell. It costs a little more than average, but you get plenty of features that make the price worth it. For one thing, you can set it up to give you alerts whenever it detects motion in specific areas of your yard. What's more, it has facial recognition abilities, so it can tell you if a particular friend is approaching before they even ring the bell. The camera operates at 1600x1200 with HDR for clear video quality. When the camera senses that it gets dark, it automatically switches to night vision. It's in grayscale, but it's clearer than many other cameras on the market.
When I was trying to decide between doorbell cameras for my home, I landed on this one. Unlike some others, it's always recording. Doorbell cams that only turn on when they detect motion sometimes turn on too late, making it so owners can't see the faces of those who've stolen packages from their porch. With the Nest Hello, I can go through the log and see everything that happened within the past few days. The app even allows me to zoom in for a closer look.
There are a few things that might give people pause when buying this device. For one thing, it requires a hardwired connection. It needs to work with the proper transformer so some folks, especially those in older houses, might need to purchase one of those as well.
Finally, like many other smart doorbells, this one requires a subscription if you want to view recordings, and you'll need to pay per camera (though you do get the service at a discount if you have multiple cameras). The service is called Nest Aware, and you have the option of paying $6 per month for a 30-day plan, or $12 per month for a 60-day plan.
Pros:
- Non-stop recording
- Great video quality
- Smart home integration
- Facial recognition
- Can set motion zones
- Zoom ability
Cons:

Best Smart Doorbell on a Budget: Ring Video Doorbell (2nd Gen)
If you're looking for a way to monitor your home without spending too much, you should consider the Ring Video Doorbell (2nd Gen). It doesn't have as many features as other smart doorbells, but it does an excellent job with the things it can do. It has a 1080p camera and better audio recording and night vision, which are both improvements on previous models. Still, its 155-degree field of view is a bit lower than some other more premium doorbell cameras. You can also set it to monitor specific, closer areas of your yard. That way, it will only send alerts if it sees people in your yard rather than cars driving past on the street.
Perhaps one of the biggest reasons to get this doorbell is the incredibly easy installation. It comes with all the tools you need to install it, and it's designed to either function using a battery or by being hardwired to your home. When the battery life gets low, it will send you a notification so you can recharge it. It typically takes 10 hours to reach a full charge and should last roughly 12 months.
This little device connects to your Wi-Fi, allowing you to monitor and control it using the Ring app or smart home services like Amazon Alexa or IFTTT. Link it to your accounts, and you can use it to talk with those on your porch via two-way communication, or simply to view motion detection alerts.
The biggest downside to this doorbell is that it only records when it detects motion. As with the other doorbell cameras on this list, you'll need to pay a subscription to access videos. You can pay $10 per month for a Protect Plus Plan or $3 per month for a Protect Basic Plan.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Smart Doorbell on a Budget
Ring Video Doorbell (2nd Gen)
An inexpensive smart doorbell
This is one of the cheapest doorbells you can find. Plus you can use it wired or wireless.
Best Smart Doorbell for Data Security: Eufy Video Doorbell 2K
Eufy is one of the brands under the Anker umbrella, and the company has been making high-quality and reliable smart home appliances for quite some time. In fact, some of our favorite security cameras are made by Eufy! One reason is the quality craftsmanship, but the more significant reason is that your data is safe, secure, and local.
As an actual video doorbell camera, the Eufy measures up well on its own. This version has 2K resolution, a 4:3 aspect ratio for better viewing, and built-in AI human detection capabilities. Its large capacity battery can last six months on a single charge, and it is a cinch to install quickly. Not only can you interact with guests in real-time, no matter where you are, but you can also record up to three "instant" responses for visitors like solicitors, delivery drivers, or gardeners.
Our favorite thing about this camera, however, is that it's a one-time purchase. You get built-in, 256-bit encryption to protect or data, which can be stored locally on the included Homebase hub unit. There are wireless and wired versions available, but you should note that the wireless version cannot do pre-roll buffering as the wired unit can.
Pros:
- Local storage included
- 256-bit encryption
- 2K resolution
- 4:3 aspect ratio
- Advanced AI human detection
- IP65 weatherproof
Cons:
- Wireless version can't do pre-roll buffering
- Wireless version has shorter viewing angles than wired
- Can be quite large
Best Smart Doorbell for Data Security
Eufy Video Doorbell 2K
Local, safe data storage
The Eufy video doorbell is renowned for its local storage options. It's great if you don't want a cloud subscription.
Best Smart Doorbell for Apartments or Condos: Ring Video Doorbell 3
Ring is a home security company owned by Amazon. As such, it's not surprising to learn that Ring devices work super well with the Echo Show (2nd Gen), the Echo Show 8, or the Echo Show 5 to help you monitor your front yard or engage in two-way conversations with those on your porch. If your smart home is already primarily made up of Alexa devices, this is an excellent doorbell for you.
This camera offers the same 1080p video quality as the previous generation, but it adds improved motion detection and privacy zones. You also get dual-band 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz Wi-Fi support. Something I appreciate is that it's super easy to install since it can be either battery-powered or hardwired into your home. Since the hardwiring is optional, it's a great option to use on apartments and condos where permanent changes might not be allowed.
As with other Ring doorbells, this one only starts recording when it detects motion. Just be aware that several users have reported that their doorbell has only started recording once someone has already stolen a package or stolen the doorbell itself. Others have said that the doorbell helped them see intruders or even scare them off before they did anything. It will just depend on how quickly your doorbell decides to turn on. As with other Ring doorbells, you'll need to pay a subscription if you want to view recordings.
Pros
- Battery or hardwired connection
- Easy installation
- Privacy zones
- 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz Wi-Fi bands
- Motion detection with adjustable zones
Cons
Best Smart Doorbell for Apartments or Condos
Ring Video Doorbell 3
A sleek doorbell with quality video
The Ring Video Doorbell 3 allows you to choose between a battery or a wired connection for power, making it perfect for renters.
Best Smart Doorbell for Alexa: Ring Video Doorbell Pro
Of all of Ring's video doorbells, I like the shape of this one the most. Since it's smaller and slimmer than the others, it's more likely to fit on the door frame or wherever else your current doorbell resides. It's the most expensive unit on this list, but it also offers some features you won't find elsewhere. For one thing, it supports both a 5GHz and a 2.4GHz wireless connection, so you're more likely to get it to work on your Wi-Fi without connectivity issues.
Within the app, you can draw your own motion zones. I love this since it makes it so you only get notifications if someone is on your property rather than every time a car passes by. The resolution is a beautiful 1080p, which will give you a clearer view of porch guests than many other doorbell cameras do.
This doorbell does require a hardwired connection, so you'll need to do the wiring work to make that possible. Additionally, this Ring doorbell comes with a Pro Power Kit, that must be installed inside your home for the doorbell to work correctly. The thing with this kit is that it needs the right kind of transformer to work correctly, so you might need to go out and purchase a new one. As with other Ring doorbells, you'll need to pay a subscription to view recordings.
Pros:
- Detects motion better than other Rings
- 1080p video resolution
- Allows for 5GHz connection
- Can draw your own motion zones
Cons:
- Expensive
- Requires hardwired connection
- Pro Power Kit installation required
- Might need to upgrade transformer

Sometimes pulling out your phone to check to see who's on your front porch feels a little slow or even a little silly, especially when you're standing right behind the door. In these situations, it would be nice just to have something that worked as both a door camera and a peephole. Enter the Ring Peephole Cam. It's small and installs in place of your existing peephole to give you both an in-person and digital view of porch guests.
You can also set motion zones and make it so that the Ring device only alerts you if it sees movement in specified areas of your yard. One of the reasons this device is so easy to install is because it's battery-powered. You don't have to do any wiring to make it function. Now, if you don't already have a peephole in your door, the installation will be more of a challenge. In that case, you'll either need to drill a hole into your door or hire someone to do it for you.
As far as doorbells go, this one has a decent camera. It features a 1080p video for a clearer viewing experience. Additionally, the device features both a camera and a microphone. Using the app, you'll be able to talk with porch guests and hear their responses from anywhere. However, while some other buzzers feature HDR video, that's not something you'll find with this unit. Since this is an Amazon product, the camera only works with one smart home service: Amazon Alexa. If you prefer a different smart home assistant, this won't be the ideal option for you.

Best Smart Doorbell for Local Storage: EZVIZ WiFi Video Doorbell
You might be noticing a trend on this list. Most of these smart video doorbells are made by companies that also make some of our favorite smart video security cameras. EZVIZ is another name that can be added to that list, and the company's video doorbell has quite a lot going for it.
For starters, it has an impressive 180-degree field of view. That in and of itself is impressive, and on the higher end of the spectrum as far as video doorbells go, but what makes this option really unique is that the 180 degrees is vertical. Yes, you can still see quite a bit side-to-side, but this camera lets you see as much as possible top-to-bottom.
Aside from that neat trick, this is an HD camera that supports dual-band Wi-Fi at 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz and has night vision capable of seeing out to 16 feet. The doorbell is also fairy weatherproof, boasting IP65 dust and water resistance.
Best of all, you get a free, ongoing, three hours of cloud storage to go along with support for up to 128GB in expandable storage via a microSD card. Now that's some impressive storage options!
Pros:
- 180-degree vertical field of view
- Three hours of rolling cloud storage included
- IP65 water and dust protection
- Supports microSD local storage up to 128GB
- Three different colored doorbell faceplates included
Cons:

This doorbell has some fun extras like a 180-degree vertical field of view and large-capacity local storage options.
Best Smart Doorbell for Pre-roll Recording: Arlo Video Doorbell
Like Eufy, Arlo is another one of our favorite smart video security brands that are not owned by Google or Amazon. The company's security cameras are regularly among our top picks, and it makes a smart audio doorbell that is also a great find.
Like every other smart video doorbell on this list, Arlo's offering has advanced motion detection, two-way audio, HD and HDR quality video, and night vision. It also has a built-in siren to scare away unwanted guests. Its 4:3 aspect ratio means you'll be able to see more of who or what is at your front door. It also comes with both local and cloud storage options for accessing your video data, including three months of free Arlo Smart cloud storage.
Our favorite feature of this doorbell, however, is what Arlo calls Foresight. Foresight is Arlo's pre-roll recording technology, and it captures up to three seconds of video before the initial motion sensors are triggered, giving you a better comprehensive picture of your doorstep visits.
Pros:
- Arlo Foresight pre-recorded video
- 180-degree field of view
- Three months of Arlo Smart cloud recording included
- Can connect with Arlo Smart Hub for local storage options
Cons:

This doorbell captures up to three seconds of pre-roll footage, so you have a complete picture of who visited your doorstep.
Best Smart Doorbell Top choice
When you're looking to protect your home and deliveries, a smart doorbell is the way to go. There are several options on the market to choose from. We did the research and collected the best of the best for a variety of uses. When you go to purchase a smart doorbell, you'll want to consider a few things. Things like whether or not you want a wired connection, what kind of subscription plan you're willing to pay for, the size of the smart doorbell, and of course, the price of the device itself.
We highly recommend the Nest Hello as it records non-stop instead of only recording when it detects motion. It also features 1080p of HDR video quality for a clearer view of guests and trespassers. Best of all, you can set detection zones and make it so the device can tell if a human is approaching rather than a car or animal. It even offers facial recognition to let you know if a friend is approaching your door.

Give your Ring Video Doorbell 2 some personality with a faceplate or skin
Ring's video doorbells have a fairly uniform and distinct look to them, but there are lots of other ways to customize your look. We've found several great options for you to decorate your doorbell with.Best answer: Yes. The biggest difference between each of the versions is how you interact with the game, either tapping on your phone screen, being hooked up to a TV with a controller, or playing on your PC with a keyboard and mouse. But there are also other differences between the mobile, PC, and console versions of Genshin Impact.
- On Android: Genshin Impact (Free at Play Store)
- On iPhone: Genshin Impact (Free at Apple Store)
- On PS4: Genshin Impact (Free at PlayStation)
- On PC: Genshin Impact (Free at Genshin Impact official site)
Which Genshin Impact version should I play?
Considering that Genshin Impact is free on all its available platforms, you should just play it on whatever compatible phone, console, or PC you have handy. The visuals and controls will be better on PC and PS4 compared to mobile, but the game still works really well on a phone.
Controlling your actions with screen taps isn't as easy as using a mouse or a controller. And since Genshin Impact currently doesn't have official controller support at launch, you cannot hook up a PS4 controller or Xbox One Controller to your phone to play this game. So if you were hoping to use a controller or keyboard, you might want to go with the PS4 or PC versions of Genshin Impact.
Cross-saves
Genshin Impact can currently be played on Android, iOS, PC, and PS4. It's supposedly also coming to the Nintendo Switch, but no release date has been given yet for that console. You can hop back and forth between playing the game on PC or mobile. However, the PS4 does not support cross-saves, so you'll only be able to play on Sony's PS4 consoles if you start a game on this platform.
Controls and selections
Anyone playing on a PS4 will control their characters or select items via controller while those on PC will use a mouse and keyboard. Mobile players will spend time tapping the screen to perform these same functions. As of right now, Genshin Impact does not have official controller support at launch, so you cannot connect a PS4 controller, Xbox One controller, or any other type of controller to the game.
Graphics and resolution
For the most part, the visuals will be a lot crisper on a console or PC, as seen in the video above. However, considering that phone screens are so small, you likely won't be bothered by the lower resolution when playing the mobile version.
Additionally, mobile and PC users have the ability to change graphical settings. However, anyone playing on PS4 will be stuck with the default option.
Mechanics and performance
There are likely dozens of differences between each of the game versions, but here are some notable ones:
Aiming and shooting projectiles seems to be easiest on PC and PS4 since a player's fingers don't get in the way of the screen. Mobile players can use Elemental Burst Attacks from all party members, even if a player is switched out. This is not the case for PC or PS4. Finally, there's a bit of a lag when picking up items in the PS4 version. Players often have to wait around an item for a few seconds before registering as something you can interact with. This doesn't seem to be as common of an issue on mobile or PC.
The games seem to operate well enough on all platforms. However, performance will be affected by your internet connection and the device you're playing on. You'll also want to consider Genshin Impact's minimum requirements before determining where to download it.
Minimum Requirements
Each platform requires different things for Genshin Impact to run successfully. Here are the minimum requirements for each version.
Minimum Requirements for Android:
- Compatibility requirements: Arm v8a 64-bit device
- Memory: 3 GB and above
- Supported system: Android 7.0 or above

- Supported system: iOS 9.0 and above

Genshin Impact versions Mobile vs PC vs PS4
Whether you're playing on Android, iOS, PS4, PC, Genshin Impact is a fun RPG. It looks like PC might be the best version to go with since it uses cross-saves with the mobile versions and offers better handling controls. But no matter where you play this game, you're bound to have a good time.

Samsung Galaxy S20 FE
Smart stylus
Samsung Galaxy Note 20
Samsung has developed a reputation in recent years for its stunning hardware designs, typically utilizing a combination of metal and curved glass for its flagship phones. This year, however, we've started to see a shift back towards plastic in the company's "affordable flagship" category. As it turns out, plastic is just fine when done well, especially when paired with two of the best Samsung phones in late 2020 — the Gaalxy S20 FE and the Galaxy Note 20.
Galaxy S20 FE vs. Galaxy Note 20 A lot in common
The Galaxy Note 20 was the first phone in Samsung's flagship lineup to move from curved glass back to a polycarbonate (plastic) design, and while I was apprehensive about the change at first, getting it in my hands immediately put me ease. The Note 20 still feels extremely solid and well-built, and the flat display is a breath of fresh air for anyone who struggled with accidental touches on Samsung's curved displays in the past.
The subsequently released Galaxy S20 FE features the same plastic design and flat display, though it comes in a few more fun colors. Both phones are IP68 water- and dust-resistant, and feature standards like wireless charging and in-display fingerprint sensors. From a hardware standpoint, these two phones are nearly identical, save for a slight difference in physical size thanks to the Note 20's larger display.
Internally, the phones are similar, as well. The Note 20 features the slightly newer Snapdragon 865+ processor (which clocks a bit higher and renders graphics faster), along with more RAM, but both phones offer 128GB of storage, and only the S20 FE offers microSD expandability. The S20 FE is also the only one of the two with a 120Hz display — like the Note 10 before it, the Note 20 maintains a more modest 60Hz refresh rate.
|Category||Galaxy S20 FE||Galaxy Note 20|
|Operating System||Android 10|
|Display||6.5 inches, 20:9 aspect ratio, 2400x1080 (407 ppi) resolution, Super AMOLED||6.7 inches, 20:9 aspect ratio, 2400x1080 (393 ppi) resolution, Super AMOLED Plus|
|Processor||Qualcomm Snapdragon 865||Snapdragon 865+|
|Memory||6GB RAM||8GB RAM|
|Storage||128GB||128GB|
|Expandable Storage||Yes (up to 1TB)||No|
|Rear Camera||12MP, ƒ/1.8, 1.8μm (wide)||12MP, ƒ/1.8, 1.8μm (wide)|
|Front Camera||32MP, ƒ/2.2, 0.8μm||10MP, ƒ/2.2, 1.22μm|
|Battery||4500mAh||4300mAh|
|Water Resistance||IP68||IP68|
|Dimensions||159.8 x 74.5 x 8.4mm||161.6 x 75.2 x 8.3mm|
|Weight||190g||194g|
12MP, ƒ/2.2, 1.12μm (ultra-wide)
8MP, ƒ/2.4, 1.0μm (telephoto)
12MP, ƒ/2.2, 1.4μm (ultra-wide)
64MP, ƒ/2.0, 0.8μm (telephoto)
Of course, the software experience on both phones is nearly identical. Each runs Android 10 with Samsung's One UI 2.5 software overlay, which offers powerful features like DeX for running your phone in a desktop-like experience using an external monitor. The biggest difference between the two is the Note 20's S Pen. This pressure-sensitive stylus allows you to take notes or draw on your screen, and can even be used to control your phone wirelessly using air gestures.
These phones are extremely similar in every way but their price.
Both phones feature the same primary camera, along with an ultra-wide sensor and a telephoto camera capable of reaching up to 30, though the S20 FE packs a native 3X telephoto lens, whereas the Note 20 uses Samsung's Hybrid Optic Zoom technology. The shooting experience is extremely similar on each phone, with a myriad of manual controls for fine-tuning your shots, but one perk I particularly enjoy about the Note 20 is the ability to use the S Pen as a remote shutter.
In case it isn't clear, these phones are extremely similar, from cameras to performance, battery life, and hardware features. They trade blows in minor features like S Pen support, a high refresh rate, and microSD expandability, but ultimately the biggest difference is the price. The Galaxy S20 FE costs a mere $700, and has already gone on sale for just $600. By contrast, the Note 20 launched at $1,000, with few bonus perks save for the S Pen.
If you're a longtime Galaxy Note fan who loves using the S Pen, the Note 20 is the obvious choice, but for all else, it's hard to justify spending the extra money over the S20 FE, which offers just about every other feature and benefits from some newer hardware bonuses. In fact, the Galaxy S20 FE currently ranks as our best Android phone overall, thanks to its unbeatable value. I'm a big fan of both devices, but the choice is clear.

Google Wifi isn't a bad looking router (or three) on its own, and it's pretty easy to stick it anywhere in your house without offending anyone. However, every home is different and you might want something a little more elegant and organized than just plonking a node down on a window sill. Thanks to its popularity and the fact it's a pretty simple shape, there are plenty of options out there for mounting the Google Wifi to a wall or even a ceiling.
- Power up: Dot Genie Google Wifi Outlet Holder
- Easy peasy: Wall Mount Holder for Google Wifi by Koroao
- Save space: ECHOGEAR Outlet Shelf
- Super minimal: Mrount Google Wifi Wall Mount
- In between: LykusSource Wall Mount Bracket
- No mess required: BASSTOP Bracket Stand
- Totally secure: HumanCentric Google Wifi Mount
- Wall or ceiling: OkeMeeo Wall Mount
- Cable management: elago Google WiFi Wall Mount
Power up: Dot Genie Google Wifi Outlet Holder
If you want your router flush with your power plug, this mount is for you. You can wrap and hide the power cable around the inside of the mount so it isn't seen, and the weight of the router is easily supported by the power plug and your wall. Finally, there's an opening at the bottom for plugging in an Ethernet cable.
Easy peasy: Wall Mount Holder for Google Wifi by Koroao
This mount makes it super easy to hang your router on a wall or ceiling, and you can still route in an Ethernet cable to hard-wire devices. The mount comes in a single-, two- or three-pack, and it includes screws for installation.
Save space: ECHOGEAR Outlet Shelf
This product is great for your Google Wifi, but also for other small gadgets weighing less than 10 pounds. There's a small channel at the back of the shelf where you can route your power and Ethernet cables, and installing the shelf is as easy as unscrewing your existing wall plate and screwing on the new one.
Super minimal: Mrount Google Wifi Wall Mount
This may be the most minimal option of this list: you just screw the mount on the wall, and sort of drop the Google Wifi in. You also get a channel for routing the power cable and enough clearance for Ethernet cables. The screws and drywall sockets you need are included, and the kit comes in single-, two- and three-packs.
In between: LykusSource Wall Mount Bracket
This is a middle step between the more minimal options and the full brackets. The mount attaches to your wall with four screws, and you can organize the power and Ethernet cables easily. Your router just rests on the shelf, so there's nothing obstructing it. The kit comes in single-, two- and three-packs.
No mess required: BASSTOP Bracket Stand
Another minimal option is this mount from BASSTOP. With this one, you route the cable through the bottom, plug it into the router, and then plug everything into the outlet. You'll find no extra frills, but only a clean and minimal way to plug in the Google WiFi router and hide the cables without any screws.
Totally secure: HumanCentric Google Wifi Mount
If you want your router to be as secure as it possibly can be, this mount is for you. Again, there aren't any cable management options on the mount itself, so you'll want to measure your cables to keep them from looking sloppy on your wall.
Wall or ceiling: OkeMeeo Wall Mount
The OkeMeeo Mount for Google WiFi makes it easy to mount your WiFi anywhere in the home. This can be used on the wall or the ceiling, and there are holes in the bottom for either application. There's even a non-slip silicone pad to help keep your WiFi in place if you happen to just hang it on the wall.
Cable management: elago Google WiFi Wall Mount
Elago is known for some great smartphone accessories, and with the company's Wall Mount for Google WiFi, you'll be able to keep the cables organized. These mounts don't require any screws while sporting built-in cable management in the bottom of the mount. Plus, you'll be able to get these mounts in either gray or black and in packs of two or three.
An elegant solution
The Google Wifi isn't the ugliest router out there, but sometimes you just want it out of the way, and that's where mounts come in. Luckily, Google Wifi modules are small enough to hide on any shelf or desk, but you can also affordably mount them to your wall near a convenient outlet if that fits better in a particular room or space in your home.
Our top pick is the Dot Genie Google Wifi Outlet Holder which requires no screws for set up, sits flush below your power outlet on the wall, and offers built-in cord management so you don't have unsightly wires dangling down your wall.
All of these mounts are great options for mounting the Google Wifi, but we'll shout out the ECHOGEAR Outlet Shelf since it can also be used for another gadget if need be and it's really easy to install.

These are the best gaming accessories for almost any Android phone
Mobile gaming is getting bigger and more competitive each and every day. We've rounded up the best gaming accessories so that you can be the best at whatever game you choose to play.Many games ask for your birthday and when the happy day rolls around, gift you something fun in game. Genshin Impact celebrates your birthday and every other character's birthday with gifts as well. So what do you get for your birthday in Genshin Impact? Having just celebrated my birthday yesterday, I can show you exactly what you'll get!
How does Genshin Impact handle birthdays?
Every character in Genshin Impact has a birthday. For most of them, that birthday is predetermined, but for the main protagonist, you can select any birthday you want. While you can give the game your actual birthday, you can also select tomorrow if you just want your birthday goodies ASAP.
When your birthday rolls around, you will have a message in the Mail section along with a gift. Your gift, Cake for Traveler, opens up to reveal two Fragile Resin, which restore 60 Original Resin each. Original Resin is used to get rewards from Abyssal Domains, Leyline Blossoms, and some bosses. You don't have to claim this item on your birthday, but it will expire if you don't claim it within the year.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
In addition to your birthday cake, you will also unlock birthday wishes from every character you have. These messages can be found in each character's profile under Voice-Over. When you click on these messages, the individual characters will wish you a happy birthday in their own, unique way. While you can only access the birthday messages from characters you already have, they are retroactive, so any character you unlock after your first birthday in game will also have a birthday wish for you.
What do you get for other characters' birthdays in Genshin Impact?
In addition to goodies on your own birthday, Genshin Impact sends out goodies on each individual character's birthday as well. You claim these presents in the Mail section. The first to show up was Xingqui's on October 9 and included a message about his birthday, along with a food item, Countyside Delicacy, and three talent level-up materials, Teachings of "Ballad". These items will likely be somewhat customized for each character and can be claimed within 30 days of the character's birthday.
In addition to birthday goodies and a letter from the individual character, a birthday message. This can be accessed in the individual character's profile under Voice-Over. It is not yet clear if these are retroactively unlocked like the messages for your birthday.

Google Pixel 5
Powerfully versatile
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE
The Pixel 5 and Galaxy S20 FE are two of the most exciting phones of the year — not because they offer outlandish or experimental features but because they bring the amenities typically reserved for flagship devices to a more affordable price without making any major compromises. These are two of the best Android phones around, with high refresh rate displays and their own sets of excellent cameras, but which is best for you?
Google Pixel 5 vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE: Great cameras and longterm software support
As far as hardware goes, one of the more interesting aspects of these phones is that neither features the commonplace glass back. Instead, the Pixel 5 is made of aluminum, then covered in a bio-resin that makes it feel almost more like plastic, while the Galaxy S20 FE fully embraces plastic with a polycarbonate back. Both feature bi-directional wireless charging (a small portion of the Pixel 5's backing is made of plastic underneath the bio-resin to allow for induction), and the S20 FE bears an aluminum frame for improved durability.
Both phones feel great in-hand, despite forgoing the standard glass back and curved screen.
Neither phone has the most exciting design, but both phones have a flat display with thin bezels and a hole punch camera cutout. The Pixel 5 features a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor just below the camera housing, while the S20 FE relies instead on an in-display sensor. This all comes down to preference, but I far prefer the former, which pulls double duty as a gesture pad that allows you to instantly call down your notification shade.
I really enjoy both phones' in-hand feel, but one of the biggest physical differences between the two is their respective sizes. The Pixel 5 is a much smaller device, which could be a good or bad thing depending on your preferences.
Internally, the S20 FE's Snapdragon 865 is more powerful than the mid-range Snapdragon 765G in the Pixel 5, though the Pixel edges ahead slightly with 8GB of RAM versus the S20 FE's 6. Both come in a single 128GB configuration, and the S20 FE offers microSD-expandable storage. Of course, each phone also features 5G connectivity, though only the Pixel 5 supports millimeter wave on all variants — to use the S20 FE on mmWave, you'll need to specifically purchase the Verizon-based Galaxy S20 FE UW.
|Category||Pixel 5||Galaxy S20 FE|

The software experience is quite different on each phone. The Pixel 5 runs Android 11 out of the box, with few frills or software add-ons, both good and bad. Android 11 is incredibly refined, with categorized notifications and an emphasis on smart home management in the power menu, though it lacks some of the more powerful features of Samsung's One UI. One of the S20 FE's more unique features is Wireless DeX, which allows you to wirelessly cast your phone's display onto a Miracast-compatible TV, and even use it in conjunction with a keyboard and mouse for a desktop-like experience in a pinch.
Two great camera systems with very different shooting experiences.
There's no right or wrong choice here; both phones have excellent software, each with its own set of pros and cons. The important thing is that both Google and Samsung have committed their phones to at least three years of continued software support. That doesn't mean they'll get major platform updates at the same time (this remains one of the biggest perks of using a Pixel), but each will at the very least receive regular security patches until some time in 2023.
While both phones feature outstanding camera systems, they offer very different shooting experiences and capabilities. The Pixel line famously has some of the industry's best imaging prowess, with the Pixel 5 taking excellent photos in virtually any lighting condition thanks to intelligent features like Night Sight and Auto HDR. Its colors are typically warm, and exposure is balanced and consistent. You also get an ultra-wide lens for the first time on a Pixel, though the removal of last year's telephoto lens means that zoom shots aren't quite as sharp as they once were.
The Galaxy S20 FE is nearly the polar opposite. Its colors are extremely vivid, sometimes to its detriment, and Samsung's image processing notoriously overexposes highlights, ramps up shadow details, and softens faces. The S20 FE takes fantastic photos, but they aren't quite as consistent or neutral as on the Pixel. On the other hand, you get not only an ultra-wide lens but also a 3X telephoto lens that can reach all the way up to 30X using Samsung's Hybrid Optic Zoom technology. this makes the S20 FE a far more versatile shooter, and as a bonus, you get comprehensive manual shooting controls.
There are a lot of factors to consider between the two phones, but the good news is that both nail the fundamentals with great displays, long battery life, and long software support. If cameras are a high priority for you, the Pixel 5 will deliver more consistently great and balanced photos, while the S20 FE has a more versatile system for capturing different kinds of photos or taking matters into your own hands with manual controls.

With a solid feature set, great customer service, and reliable performance, you'd normally expect the price to be pretty high but you can actually grab a Surfshark VPN subscription for just $2.49 per month.
The service offers over 1,000 servers across 60+ different countries and your subscription can be used on an unlimited number of devices at once. That's something that most VPN providers don't allow you to do, so there's a lot to like with Surfshark.
Today's best Surfshark VPN deals, pricing, and discounts
|Plan Length||Discount||Monthly Cost||Total Price|
|1 Month||0%||$12.95||$12.95 at Surshark|
|6 Months||50%||$6.49||$38.94 at Surfshark|
|24 Months||81%||$2.49||$59.76 at Surfshark|
When looking at VPNs, security should always be your first concern and Surshark has you covered with AES-256-GCM encryption, IKEv2, private DNS, leak protection, and a strict no data-logging policy. It might not have the most servers of any VPN provider, but the ones it does have are spread across many locations and are plenty speedy.
The best Surfshark VPN deal available today
As is the case with most VPN providers, the longer you sign up for the less your equivalent monthly spend will be. If you prepay for a longer plan with Surfshark, you'll save as much as 81% off the regular monthly cost. Right now, the best option is Surshark's 12 month plan that includes an additional 12 months at no extra cost. Essentially, you're getting two years of service for the price of one. It's billed at $59.76 upfront which works out at just $2.49 per month.
Given that one month of Surfshark costs $12.95, it's an impressive deal. After year one, your account will renew at the regular annual cost of $59.78 which equates to just $5 per month which is still a competitive price for a top-tier VPN. There's a 30-day money-back guarantee with your purchase so there's no risk with signing up for the longer plan to get the best savings.
Surfshark VPN
You can connect as many devices as your heart desires at the same time and never worry about any of them being logged. Surfshark also offers a 30-day guarantee that you'll like the product, or it will give you your money back.
How much does Surfshark VPN cost?
Pricing varies depending on how long you commit to using Surfshark. If you don't want to commit to a long-term plan, you'll pay $12.95 per month. However, if you prepay for a longer plan then you can drop the monthly cost as low as $2.49.
Six months will cost you $38.94 which is a 50% savings versus paying monthly. For a full year of Surfshark you'll pay $59.76, but right now the company is throwing a further 12 months in for free. That means you're getting two years for the price of one and dropping the equivalent monthly cost down to just $2.49 which is one of the best cheap VPN deals around.
- 1 Month Surfshark VPN price: $12.95
- 6 Month Surfshark VPN price: $38.94
- 24 Month Surfshark VPN price: $59.76
Some other services like ExpressVPN are priced as high as $6.67 per month for their lengthier plans, so it's easy to see the value that Surfshark is offering here.
Surfshark VPN free trial: 30-day money-back guarantee
There isn't actually a free trial for Surfshark's VPN, though there is a way to try it out for free. Whichever plan you go for, you'll get a 30-day money-back guarantee. That means, should you not enjoy your experience, you can claim back whatever you paid upfront. That full refund policy should help squash any concerns you might have about committing to one of Surfshark's lengthier plans in order to get the biggest savings.
Just be sure to keep track of when you signed up so you can ensure you're still eligible for a refund just in case. Or set yourself a reminder. Easy.
Is Surfshark VPN a good provider?
The reason there are so many different VPN providers is because users desire and require different things. That means your opinion of whether Surfshark is good will depend on whether its features stack up against what you want. Surfshark is one of our favorite providers thanks to its affordable cost of entry and excellent balance of features. It definitely represents one of the best value for money VPNs.
The company is based in the British Virgin Islands which means it has no directive to log any user data at all (which is a good thing) and it has all the basic VPN requirements in place, including AES-256 encryption, a kill switch, DNS leak protection, and an extra security measure in place via its Double Hop capabilities.
It also has easy-to-use apps for pretty much every platform, extensions for your browser, and even Fire TV and Apple TV support. Though its apps are simple, you also want solid customer support for when it is needed and Surfshark excels there too. Surfshark makes it easy to unblock Netflix geo-restrictions, so if you're looking to stream stuff that may not be available locally this is a great VPN to pick.
One of the best features of Surfshark in comparison to its competitors is the ability to use it with an unlimited number of devices at the same time, which means no disconnecting one to connect another. Most other providers allow around 5 devices, some as many as 10, but very few have no limit at all so that's a real plus. One subscription can secure every device in your home which might actually save you even more money than its deals.
Where Surfshark falls short is in its server availability. It offers around 1,000 servers in 60 countries which is lower than some of its premium competitors. If it doesn't have servers where you need them, that could be a deal-breaker.
How does Surfshark VPN pricing compare to the competition?
Surfshark is one of the most affordable paid options out there, especially if you go for one of its longer-term plans. To get full access for just $2.49 per month is pretty much unheard of with the best VPN deals from other providers usually going for around $3 to $4 at best.
Its two years for the price of one deal make it way better value than the likes of ExpressVPN or NordVPN, though being a newer service it has some drawbacks like lower server availability. As long as you are wiling to sign up for a longer commitment, Surfshark is a very affordable VPN option that you should give some serious consideration to.

The PS5 is set to release on November 12 at $499. The PS5 Digital Edition will cost $399 and hit store shelves on the same day.
Coming soon
PS5
Get your hands on it before it sells out
PS5 is the place to be for exclusives like Spider-Man and Horizon Forbidden West. Get yours before they sell out. The standard PS5 boasts a disc drive so that you can play 4K Blue-ray DVDs and use your physical PS4 games through backward combability. This comes at a higher price tag than the Digital Edition.
All-digital
PS5 Digital Edition
Get your hands on it before it sells out
Cheaper than the standard PS5 but lacking a disc drive, the PS5 Digital Edition can still deliver the very best exclusives entirely digitally. You may not be able to play physical games, but the future is digital anyway. The PS5 Digital Edition features an 825GB SSD.
Where can I buy a PS5?
There are several retailers currently taking pre-orders so you can buy a PS5 like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, GameStop, and more. The PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition are selling out fast so you'll want to buy as soon as possible. Stores are looking to get more shipments in, but it's never a guarantee.
Only seven markets will see the PS5 on November 12 — U.S., Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea — while the rest of the world, including Europe, Middle East, South America, Asia, and South Africa, will need to wait until November 19.
What will the PS5 cost and when will it release?
Sony has confirmed that the PS5 will cost $499 ($629.99 CAD) and the PS5 Digital Edition will cost $399 ($499.99 CAD). Microsoft has also revealed that its cheaper Xbox Series S will be $299 and the Xbox Series X will be $499.
The PS5 will release on November 12, 2020. This will be a few days later than the release of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on November 10. There have been no publicly revealed delays due to COVID-19 as of yet.
Early hands-on impressions of the PS5
Japanese journalists and YouTuber recently got to go hands-on with the PS5 and walked away with some early impressions. Among what we learned is that the PS5 fan appears to be quiet, the DualSense can indicate whether you are player 1, 2, 3, or 4, and there's a weird nut in the casing that may be used to take the shell off.
In a preview of Astro's Playroom, we said that the DualSense controller is a game changer, and "intricate haptics and adaptive triggers are going to be a big focal point for PS5 games moving forward."
Other early impressions indicate that the DualSense is a standout accessory to accompany the PS5. While the console itself is fairly large, especially compared to other consoles like the Xbox Series X, it still goes well with most people's entertainment setups.
When's the next PS5 event?
Sony held a PS5 games showcase on September 16 where we learned more about upcoming launch games like Demon's Souls and Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Final Fantasy 16 and Hogwarts Legacy were also announced, alongside the much-anticipated announcement of the PS5 price and release date.
Sony has yet to announce another event that may take place afterward, but we expect to hear about the PS5's software and features before it launches in November.
What will the PS5 design look like?
Sony has revealed the official design of the PS5, and it's looking futuristic and sleek. I'm not exactly sure what it resembles, but I can say I like it a lot more than the Xbox Series X. I can appreciate what Microsoft is offering, but a big, blocky console isn't all that eye-catching.
In terms of size, the PS5 is 15.4in x 4.1in x 10.2in. It's a chonky boy.
PS5 teardown
Sony released an official teardown of the PS5 showing us exactly what's inside the upcoming console. Most interestingly, we learned that the PS5 uses a liquid metal TIM (thermal interface material) to deliver "long-term stable high cooling" performance in conjunction with its fan and heatsink.
We also got to see how easy it was to remove the side paneling on the PS5, which people had already speculated were removable. After doing so, you can easily upgrade the internal storage by adding an NVMe SSD.
Does the PS5 have an all-digital edition?
Yes. Like the Xbox One X all-digital edition, Sony is getting in on the fun with an all-digital edition of the PlayStation 5, dubbed the PS5 Digital Edition, that will not accept discs of any kind. If you want to play games, you'll need to download them directly to the console.
What are the PS5's specs?
Sony spoke exclusively with Wired about what fans can expect from the upcoming next-generation PS5.
|Category||PlayStation 5|
|Price||$499|
|Dimensions||390mm x 104mm x 260mm (15.4in x 4.1in x 10.2in)|

PS5 CPU
According to PlayStation,, the CPU will be based on AMD's third-generation Ryzen line, with eight cores of the new 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture. It will also apparently include a custom unit for 3D audio.
PS5 GPU
The GPU, which is a custom variant of Radeon's Navi family, will support ray tracing, which is a huge win for Sony. Ray tracing is a rendering technique that models how light travels and interacts with virtual objects. Wired notes that this is something Hollywood employs in big-budget movies, but it has not made its way to any video games consoles yet (although it's becoming more common with PC games).
PS5 Ray tracing
To clarify whether or not ray tracing would be achieved on a software level or through built-in hardware integration, Sony confirmed the latter. "There is ray tracing acceleration in the GPU hardware," he said, "which I believe is the statement that people were looking for."
Ray tracing doesn't just deliver visual benefits, though, according to PlayStation. "If you wanted to run tests to see if the player can hear certain audio sources or if the enemies can hear the players' footsteps, ray tracing is useful for that," he said. "It's all the same thing as taking a ray through the environment."
PS5 Solid-state drive
The crème de la crème is that the PS5 will come packed with a solid-state drive (SSD) as opposed to an hard-disk drive (HDD). SSDs are historically more powerful, faster, and make for a much better gaming experience. Sony demonstrated what took 15 seconds to fast travel in Spider-Man on PS4 took only 0.8 seconds on a next-gen devkit. It will even support 8K graphics, though most people will likely have TVs that only deliver up to 4K resolution.
Because more simplified game data is possible through the use of an SSD, the way that game downloads work will differ from the PlayStation 4. On the PS5, downloads will be more configurable, and parts even removable. "Rather than treating games like a big block of data," PlayStation said, "we're allowing finer-grained access to the data."
This means that players could choose to download either the single-player or multiplayer portion of a game depending on what they wanted to play, or they could download the entire game and delete one part of it, like the single-player.

Is PS5 backward compatible?
PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan has stated that the PlayStation 5 will be backward compatible. Ryan even went so far as to see that the company plans to offer cross-generational play, where players can start a game on PS4, pick up where they left off on PS5, and hop back to PS4 if they wish. This feature has not been fully detailed by the company as of yet.
"Whether it's backwards compatibility or the possibility of cross-generational play, we'll be able to transition that community to next-gen," Ryan said. "It won't be a binary choice about whether you have to be either on PlayStation 4 or next-gen to continue your friendship."
Sony confirmed that only the 10 following PS4 titles won't be backward compatible on PS5:
- DWVR
- Afro Samurai 2 Revenge of Kuma Volume One
- TT Isle of Man - Ride on the Edge 2
- Just Deal With It!
- Shadow Complex Remastered
- Robinson: The Journey
- We Sing
- Hitman Go: Definitive Edition

What is the new PS5 DualSense controller?
The next-generation PlayStation controller is officially called the DualSense. Sony revealed its design in a post on its blog. It features haptic feedback technology, adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone array, and a new Create button to replace the Share button.
To that end, there are two key innovations with the PlayStation 5's new controller. First, we're adopting haptic feedback to replace the "rumble" technology found in controllers since the 5th generation of consoles. With haptics, you truly feel a broader range of feedback, so crashing into a wall in a race car feels much different than making a tackle on the football field. You can even get a sense for a variety of textures when running through fields of grass or plodding through mud.
The second innovation is something we call adaptive triggers, which have been incorporated into the trigger buttons (L2/R2). Developers can program the resistance of the triggers so that you feel the tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain. In combination with the haptics, this can produce a powerful experience that better simulates various actions.
Geoff Keighley went hands-on with the DualSense during the Summer Game Fest and gave us our first look at the controller in action. As you can see in the above image, taken by Keighley, the DualSense appears to be slightly larger than the DualShock 4. Keighley also noted that it feels heavier as well, but this added weight still feels fine to hold.
Will the PS5 support virtual reality?
Though you shouldn't expect a new VR headset to launch alongside the PlayStation 5, Sony has big plans for virtual reality going forward. Sony Global Head of R&D for PlayStation Dominic Mallinson wants the next headset to be lighter, easier to put on, and have fewer cables. A fully wireless headset is difficult to put on the market right now because it would be more expensive for consumers, but he believes that is the way the market is trending.
Mallinson is excited about the possibilities of eye-tracking, and stated that he expects the resolution to almost double in future VR headsets, with FOV increased to over 120 degrees.
PlayStation System Architect Mark Cerny has also said, "VR is very important to us and that the current PSVR headset is compatible with the new console."
Sony has patented a new, wireless VR headset however you should still not expect this headset at launch alongside the PlayStation 5.
What will the PS5 user interface look like?
The user interface on the PlayStation 4 is fast and works well, but it's also static and can not provide a ton of information. The PS5 is set to change this. Ahead of its release, Sony gave us our first look at the PlayStation 5 UI. As the company already indicated, it is a lot more dynamic than ever before. Some of its biggest, most notable new features include a Control Center, Activities cards, Game Help, and changes to the way parties work.
With the press of the PS button, you'll bring up the Control Center while whatever game you are playing continues to run in the background. This is the one stop shop for everything you'll need to immediately access on your console, including your settings, downloads, friends list, and much more.
The PS5 User interface is much more dynamic.
Activities show up as cards above the Control Center, allowing players to jump into a specific level or point in a game they're playing. "Activities enables you to discover new gameplay opportunities, go back to things you missed, jump directly into levels or challenges you want to play, and much more. Some Activity cards can be put in picture-in-picture mode, so you can view them without having to leave the game," according to Sony.
Game Help is a benefit for PlayStation Plus members that allows them to view tips and walkthroughs for certain games. The example shown in the video is a level in Sackboy where it provides hints as to where to complete an objective. This ensures that you aren't being spoiled and are getting exactly what you're looking for. Game Help will not be enabled for all games.
Another big change comes to its party system. Players will now be able to Screen Share games they are playing with other members in their party, which those people can then open in a picture-in-picture view or on the side of their own screen.

Replace your PlayStation Blu-ray player with these 4K UHD Blu-ray players
While the specs and price of the PlayStation 5 Digitel Edition make it tempting, what can you do with all your 4K UHD Blurays? Buy a player, that's what.Best answer: No, as of right now Genshin Impact does not officially support controllers for the mobile or tablet versions. However, it's possible this will get changed in a future update considering how popular the game has been. There are third-party apps that allow you to connect controllers, but you'll use these at your own risk.

- On your iPhone: Genshin Impact (Free download on Apple Store)
- On PS4: Genshin Impact (Free at PlayStation)
- On PC: Genshin Impact (Free from Genshin Impact official site)
Why can't I pair a controller?
Being able to connect a PS4 DualShock controller or Xbox controller to some of the best Android games like Fortnite or Call of Duty: Mobile can really make the playing experience a whole lot more convenient than tapping on your mobile screen. Sadly, the mobile version of Genshin Impact has not launched with controller support. So even if you pair a controller to your phone, there are no in-game settings that allow you to connect a PS4 controller to Genshin Impact.
If you were really looking forward to playing with a controller, then you might want to consider downloading the game on PC or PS4 if that's available to you. There are some differences between the Android, iOS, PC, and PS4 versions of Genshin Impact, but the overall game is the same.
Can I use a third-party controller app?
There are plenty of mediator apps like Octopus that will allow you to connect a controller to your phone or tablet. However, since there aren't any in-game controller settings this isn't guaranteed to work. Additionally, using third-party controller apps might subject your phone or tablet to malware and other risks. So, you should only use these apps if you really trust them.

Game like a pro with these controllers for your Samsung Galaxy phones
Are you ready to have some fun with your new Samsung Galaxy phone and get some serious gaming done? Before you can, you'll likely want to get an awesome controller to pair up and make the most out of the experience.Samsung first brought its users a system-level Night mode in Android 9 Pie with the first version of One UI, but when Google added Dark mode to the core Android system with Android 10, Samsung adjusted to use Google's version instead. While dark mode on most phones is just a simple toggle to turn it on and off, Samsung adds in a scheduling function that can automatically turn dark mode on at sunset — or a predetermined time — and then turn it back off at sunrise. This is how you enable and configure it.
How to enable dark mode on Samsung Galaxy phones with One UI 2.0
- Open Settings from the home screen.
- Tap Display.
Toggle Dark at the top to switch to dark mode.
- Tap Dark mode settings to customize dark mode settings.
Toggle Turn on as scheduled to On if you want to schedule dark mode from sunset to sunrise. If you want dark mode enabled all the time, leave this setting off.
How to enable Night mode on Samsung Galaxy phones with One UI
- Open your phone's Settings.
- Scroll down and tap on Display.
Look for Dark mode or Night mode and tap on the toggle to turn on Night mode right away.
- To configure Night mode, tap on the text itself rather than the toggle.You can set Night Mode to come on automatically on a custom schedule, or let it come on from sunset to sunrise.
For easier access to Night mode, you can also add a quick toggle in the notification pane. I personally prefer to keep Dark mode turned on all day, all night, but if you prefer a bright UI during the day when using your phone on a sunny afternoon, it's easy enough to either toggle it off or schedule it to stay off during daytime hours. Hopefully, Google will come to steal Samsung's scheduling options for Dark mode for future versions of Android, but at least we can get it on Galaxy phones right now.
What phone do you have?
If your phone is running One UI 2 (Android 10), then you'll see Dark mode as the name of this feature in both the Settings and Quick Settings menus. Android 10's Dark mode can also be used to trigger dark themes in many Android apps, whereas Android 9's Night mode isn't as all-encompassing.
If your phone is running One UI (Android 9 Pie), then this feature will be listed as Night mode and is only guaranteed to change system apps and menus from light to dark. The steps will be the same on both versions, the only difference is the name and its impact on third-party apps.

The mmWave network is called Ultra Wideband and has been around for quite a while now but the coverage was very limited. On October 13, 2020, Verizon launched its nationwide 5G network and is looking to catch up to T-Mobile and AT&T, both of which launched nationwide 5G networks in late 2019. With coverage in most big cities, Verizon expects to cover 200 million people.
Understanding how each carrier will deploy 5G can be confusing but we've been keeping tabs on all of them. Here is everything you need to know about Verizon's newest and fastest wireless network.
Unlimited data
Verizon Play More Unlimited
Plenty of data with 5G access included
If you're ready to try out one of the fastest 5G networks, Verizon's Play More gives you plenty of data with Disney+ included.
When will my area even get 5G?
If you have a phone that supports the newer nationwide 5G network and you live in a big city, there's a chance you're covered. Check out Verizon's 5G coverage map to see if you're covered.
This network shares spectrum with Verizon's LTE network with the tower allocating spectrum as needed based on demand.
Ultra Wideband is fast but coverage is low
Verizon now has 36 cities with some level of UWB 5G coverage. Even if you live in one of these cities, you can expect to be on LTE most of the time due to the relatively poor coverage capabilities of mmWave 5G networks like UWB. Its high frequency also results in poor building penetration meaning if there's a wall between you and a Verizon 5G node, you're probably going to be using LTE.
If you want to see if your area has coverage, Verizon has released a set of maps showing the current coverage for its 5G UWB network. Coverage is progressing but there's still a long way to go.
Cities with UWB coverage
- Anaheim, CA
- Ann Arbor, MI
- Arlington, TX
- Atlanta, GA
- Baltimore, MD
- Boise, ID
- Boston, MA
- Charlotte, NC

Ultra Wideband 5G expansion is going to be much more cumbersome than 4G deployment due to the sheer number of towers needed. Verizon's Ultra Wideband 5G deployment uses mmWave, or millimeter-wave, technology. While very fast and capable of handling many devices connected, each tower covers a much smaller area than previous cell technology.
Here's every U.S. city with 5G coverage right now
What tech is Verizon using?
Verizon has launched a 5G network with both DSS and mmWave. DSS, or dynamic spectrum sharing, shares spectrum between the older LTE network and a sub-6 5G network as needed. This will help Verizon keep up with an increasing 5G load without disabling portions of its LTE network.
Ultra Wideband or UWB is how Verizon is branding its millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G. This name refers to the vast amounts of spectrum Verizon has access to in the higher frequency bands of 5G. That's above 24Ghz. To put that in perspective, a wireless router in your home uses frequencies at 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz. This spectrum can carry a huge amount of data but is much weaker at building penetration, needing a nearly unobstructed line of sight with the tower.

Which devices should I get to be 5G ready?
While you may be tempted to grab an unlocked 5G phone like the Galaxy S20, keep in mind that most of these phones will not be able to use Verizon's 5G network. It's unclear if unlocked phones will support Verizon's nationwide 5G network so your best bet is to get done directly from Verizon.
Luckily, Verizon's power has led to companies like Samsung, LG, and OnePlus to make specific UW versions of phones that can access Verizon's UWB network. Your best bet for a compatible phone is to buy it through Verizon. Verizon even has a Galaxy Tab S7 5G available.
If you're looking to get some work done, Verizon has a couple of hotspots that can access its network. Notably, the MiFi M2100 5G UW from Inseego supports both mmWave and sub-6 5G as well as Wi-Fi 6. With support for up to 30 connected devices, it can be a great way to get a lot of devices online in a pinch.
Which plan do I need for access?
All Verizon plans will have access to the nationwide 5G network for now extra cost. If you have a phone that supports the network, you will be able to access it without changing your plan or paying any extra.
Currently, UWB is included with Verizon's Play More, Do More, and Get More Unlimited plans, which offer unlimited data on 5G, including unlimited hotspot usage. It also increases the streaming video resolution from 720p to 4K. If you have the Start Unlimited plan, you can add 5G for $10 per month.
|Play More||Do More||Get More|
|UWB 5G data||unlimited||unlimited||unlimited|
|UWB 5G hotspot||unlimited||unlimited||unlimited|
|UWB 5G video||4K||4K||4K|
|Premium data||50GB||50GB||50GB|
|LTE hotspot||15GB||15GB||30GB|
|Talk and text||unlimited||unlimited||unlimited|
|LTE video||Up to 720p||Up to 720p||Up to 720p|
|Mexico and Canada||talk and text||talk and text||talk and text|
|Apple Music||6 months||6 months||included|
|Disney+, Hulu, ESPN +||included||6 months||included|
5G access can also be added to the entry-level Start Unlimited plan for $10 per month.
Verizon Prepaid still doesn't have any plans that include 5G access and MVNOs, for the most part, have been slow to buy into 5G. US Mobile, however, offers 5G at $100 for three months.
Best 5G Plan in 2020
Does it do home internet?
With approximate speeds of 300Mbps, using Verizon's 5G Home service may be the replacement for wired home internet we've been waiting for. As a $50 per month service with an existing Verizon Wireless plan and $70 without, this service is very competitive with most ISPs.
The coverage issues noted above are not an issue with this usage because a powerful and precisely placed receiver converts the 5G signal into traditional home internet with a stationary router. This router provides customers with all of the normal connections expected of a router such as Ethernet connections.
Is 5G worth it for most people?
If you have a fairly new phone with support for Verizon's full LTE Advanced network, then you probably won't get that much of a benefit from 5G just yet. Once Verizon has a sub-6 network in place and accessible, it will make a lot more sense. For many people, the jump to 5G isn't even available yet and may not be for quite some time.
As an enthusiast, I'm thrilled about the concept of 5G bringing fast connections to more people than has been possible with fiber-optic connections. Verizon being able to deliver fiber-optic levels of performance to a phone can help drive competition between ISPs as we have never seen.

The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is Verizon's best phone
There's nothing quite like a new phone on America's top-rated network, and the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is a smash hit. While it's arguably the best phone on Verizon right now, there are a lot of other great options.Best Ergonomic Mouse Android Central 2020
The best ergonomic mouse is subjective to your needs, but thankfully, companies have been transitioning to provide more and more options. Sitting at the computer for hours and hours will eventually cause some strain, and it's important to do whatever you can to relieve the pressure and stress. Wrist pain or even discomfort for long periods can lead to bigger problems such as carpal tunnel, which is something that everyone should avoid especially now that many of us can work from home full-time.
- Simple the best: Logitech MX ERGO
- Budget friendly: VicTsing Ergonomic Mouse
- Use a trackball: Kensington Pro Fit Ergo
- The budget pick: Anker Wireless Mouse
- The handshake mouse: Logitech MX Vertical
- Ambidextrous gaming: Razer Viper Ultralight
- Best "traditional" mouse: Logitech MX Master 3
- Just a slight curve: Jelly Comb Wireless Vertical Mouse
- Sculpted ergonomics: Microsoft Sculpt
- Extra buttons: Nulaxy Vertical Ergonomic Mouse

Simple the best: Logitech MX ERGO
The Logitech MX Ergo features a unique and ergonomic design, including an adjustable hinge to make sure your hand is in the most comfortable position. As you would expect, the MX Ergo can be paired with multiple devices at the same time, and the battery will last for up to 70 days before needing some more juice.
Budget friendly: VicTsing Ergonomic Mouse
One of the problems with finding the best ergonomic mouse is that too many don't take into account different hand sizes. VicTsing's Ergonomic Mouse takes the "one-size fits all" approach to be comfortable for everyone. VicTsing wants you to get going as soon as it arrives, so you won't have to worry about any pesky drivers or third-party software. Just plug-in and play.
Use a trackball: Kensington Pro Fit Ergo
You may be surprised that using a trackball instead of moving your wrist will do wonders on your wrist and forearm. The Kensington Pro Fit Ergo combines the "handshake" design with a trackball, leaving your hand in place and reducing the overall strain. Kensington even offers nine buttons that can be programmed to perform a myriad of tasks without needing to reach for the keyboard.
The budget pick: Anker Wireless Mouse
Anker is primarily known for its fantastic charging accessories, but the company has released its own version of an ergonomic mouse. Instead of opting for the trackball, this Bluetooth mouse sports a vertical design that's designed to prevent the squeezing of nerves in your hand and wrist. In addition to the traditional mouse buttons, there's another option on the mouse to switch the DPI on the fly, based on what you're doing on the computer.
The handshake mouse: Logitech MX Vertical
Logitech's MX Vertical mouse places your hand at a 57-degree angle, which prevents twisting your forearm. The company performed a study that claims this design will reduce strain by 10% compared to a regular mouse. In addition to the great functionality provided by Logitech, this mouse has excellent battery life, as it will last for four months on a single charge.
Ambidextrous gaming: Razer Viper Ultralight
It can be frustrating to find a mouse that you want, only to realize that it was made for righties, especially if you're a gamer. Razer has changed the scenery for gamers with its Viper mouse, which is an ambidextrous mouse and has a total of eight programmable buttons. Plus, you'll be able to sync it with Razer Chroma for all of that RGB greatness.
Best "traditional" mouse: Logitech MX Master 3
Whether you are just looking for a mouse that has all the features, or want something comfortable, the MX Master line has always been solid. With the MX Master 3, you are provided with the best traditional mouse that Logitech has made to date. Between Flow controls, a 4000 DPI sensor, and 70 days of battery life, the MX Master 3 is fantastic in just about every facet.
Just a slight curve: Jelly Comb Wireless Vertical Mouse
Instead of relying on drastic curves or adjustable angles, the Jelly Comb Vertical Mouse takes a different route. You'll find just a slightly bulbous design to fit the curvature of your hand a bit better, along with giving your thumb a relaxing place to rest while using the mouse. Three DPI settings can be adjusted via the button on the mouse.
Sculpted ergonomics: Microsoft Sculpt
Microsoft makes some unique mice, and the Sclupt is a great example. This is primarily designed for Windows computers, as is evidenced by the Microsoft key that provides one-touch access to the Start Menu. The unique shape will not only help with any wrist pain, but also will help you to use the right forearm posture while on the computer.
Extra buttons: Nulaxy Vertical Ergonomic Mouse
It's all fine and dandy if you're good with just the traditional buttons on your mouse, but some have been spoiled with additional buttons for added functionality. The Nulaxy Vertical Mouse features a total of six multi-functional buttons, along with a matte finish to add to the comfortability of this mouse.
Back to basics: AmazonBasics Vertical Ergonomic Mouse
It should come as no surprise that there's an ergonomic mouse from AmazonBasics, as the brand has been expanding into more areas. This mouse is rather basic, with a button on top to switch the DPI settings on the fly, along with the forward and back buttons. But with its handshake design, it will help curb some of that hand fatigue.
Lefties or righties: Evoluent VM4R Ergonomic Mouse
Many of these ergonomic mice are designed for those who use their right hand at the computer, leaving lefties out of the mix. Evoluent's VM4 line of Ergonomic mice offer options both right, and left, handed versions. Both are compatible with Windows and Mac, while offering a higher thumb-rest than other options for additional ergonomic awesome-ness.
Save your wrist with the best ergonomic mouse
Logitech is known for making some of the best peripherals for your computer, so it only makes sense that they would make the best ergonomic mouse. The MX Ergo brings the ability to use this with multiple computers at the same time, along with the trackball to keep your hand place. Plus, Logitech has added the ability to adjust the tilt of the mouse, so that your hand is always in the right position to reduce fatigue and strain.
Some believe that the "handshake" mouse is the best way to navigate your computer, and Kensington excels in this regard. The Pro Fit Ergo is a vertical mouse with the handshake design, but also has a rather large trackball so you can keep your hand in place and not move it around. There are also nine buttons to personalize and customize to remove the need to reach back over to the keyboard while you're getting some work done.

Here are 9 cheap office desks to complete your home office
Working from home? Whatever your reasons may be, these cheap office desks will ensure you have the best experience possible.The recent Star Wars resurgence (thanks to Disney's acquisition of the franchise) and the new sequel trilogy of movies has caused an explosion in the number of Star Wars fans around the galaxy. Many of these newer fans didn't grow up on the original Star Wars, but this generation of younglings can still experience them in other ways. When a dated movie just doesn't cut it, video games can step in to help. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is aiming to do just that.
And let's be honest. Adults love the LEGO video game series too. I'm sure it will be on my personal list of the best PS4 games.
All nine films
LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga
A galaxy far, far away
LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga will be the first game to compile all nine of the series' main entries into one package. Play as various Star Wars characters as you experience the story in this lighthearted retelling.
What is LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga?
LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is an upcoming video game that adapts the main nine Star Wars films that comprise the Skywalker Saga: The original trilogy, the prequel trilogy, and the (as of yet incomplete) sequel trilogy.
- The Phantom Menace (1999)
- Attack of the Clones (2002)
- Revenge of the Sith (2005)
- A New Hope (1977)
- The Empire Strikes Back (1980)
- Return of the Jedi (1983)
- The Force Awakens (2015)
- The Last Jedi (2017)
- The Rise of Skywalker (2019)
According to publisher Warner Bros. Interactive, all nine films will be compiled into one brand-new video game package, not unlike LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga, which bundled up levels based on the original and prequel trilogies.
So far, we know that there will be a total of 45 levels, with each episode receiving five story missions each. Previous versions of this game included a main hub where characters jumped off to experience separate missions. This game will be set up similarly, but will have a specific hub for each episode rather than simply sharing one hub for all the episodes.
If you're wondering whether or not you'll be able to play as your favorite Star Wars characters that appear in the main Skywalker story, the chances are pretty high. There are going to be over 500 playable characters to choose from. I know I'm excited to run around as Boba Fett, Darth Maul, and Han Solo among others.
Who is making LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga?
LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is being developed by Traveller's Tales within the company's new engine known at NTT and will be published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment rather than a Disney publisher.
Will LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga adapt other Star Wars movies?
It doesn't look like it will adapt any other Star Wars movies other than the main nine episodes. The anthology films Rogue One and Solo will be left out as they don't directly tie into the Skywalker family's journey.
What can I expect from LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga gameplay?
Though its announcement trailer didn't show any actual gameplay, you can likely expect it to play similarly to previous LEGO Star Wars games. You'll play through levels based on certain parts of each movie and complete them by exploring, solving puzzles, and building LEGO tools to progress. And because it's a Star Wars game, you'll surely be able to participate in lightsaber duels and use your Force powers.
The developer did not reveal what, if any, new gameplay mechanics would be making their way to LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, but the studio did say that fans will have "complete freedom to explore the LEGO Star Wars galaxy." And best of all, The Skywalker Saga will feature hundreds of playable characters with a massive amount of content.
Will players be able to fly a TIE fighter, X-wing, or the Millennium Falcon?
We don't know all of the game specifics yet, however, we wouldn't be at all surprised if the game allows you to pilot these iconic spacecraft. We know for sure that there will be podracing on Tatooine and the ability to man an Alliance snowpeeder on Hoth, so it really doesn't seem out of the question for actual space battles to exist as well.
Will it remake the previous LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga?
LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga, which originally came out over ten years ago, isn't just being thrown into The Skywalker Saga and ported over. The Skywalker Saga is a completely new game, and for the first time fans can hop in at any point in the franchise timeline, whether they want to start with The Phantom Menace or skip all the way until The Last Jedi before they get a taste of the final movie.
The Force Awakens was adapted into a LEGO game a few years ago, but it's also being completely remade from the ground up for The Skywalker Saga. The Last Jedi film never received a LEGO video game counterpart, so this will be the first time it is adapted in this way.
LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga: What else should we expect?
Disney is doing what Disney knows best, animation. It seems we will be seeing a LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga animated series. While very little is known about this additional project for the LEGO Star Wars title, so far, many believe it will be tied in with the release of the game some time late 2020. Thus far, it is expected the animation will be handled by WilFilm, the studio behind The Freemaker Adventures and Droid Tales.
LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special
You might have read the above title and gotten traumatic flashbacks of the infamous Star Wars Christmas Special from 1978. Fear not, this is something completely different, though it does center once again around the Wookiee holiday, Life Day. For one thing, it features LEGO versions of Rey, Finn, Poe, Rose, R2-D2, and a slew of other familiar characters. Hopefully, the only reason it will make you laugh is because it intends to. From some of the promotional images we've seen, it looks like it's going to be a hoot.
Apparently, the LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special will be filled with festivities that help us celebrate "the entire Star Wars saga." It isn't directly tied to the upcoming game, but since the game was delayed until 2021, the holiday special will give us some of that LEGO/Star Wars charm to get us through 2020. The special will come to Disney+ on November 17, 2020.
LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga Pre-order bonus
Best Buy's website states that it is offering an exclusive steelbook to anyone who pre-orders LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. So, if you'd like to get an extra special collectors item, you'll want to order the game as soon as you can.
If rumors are to be believed, this steelbook will depict a LEGO Han Solo encased in carbonite. We do not know for sure if this is the real look of the steelbook, but it certainly would be fitting, wouldn't it?
We're investigating into this matter and will update when we learn more.
LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga Release date
We originally figured that LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga would release in October 2020, due to a slip on This Week in Star Wars. However, in August 2020, the official LEGO website showed that the game wouldn't we releasing until Spring 2021. We don't know an exact date yet, but we'll update when we learn more.
The game will be available for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. You can pre-order it today.

The Quest isn't exactly cheap to start with, so you're probably looking for some affordable accessories to go along with it. Here are some of the best we could find.
- Getting comfy: Studioform Creative Quest Deluxe Strap
- Keep Touch controllers on: Energizer Rechargeable batteries
- Quick cleanup: Microfiber cloths
- Add in-ear audio: Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds
- Ensure compatibility: AmazonBasics USB-C to USB-A 3.1 cable
- Clear vision: Jaws Quick Spit anti-fog spray
Getting comfy: Studioform Creative Quest Deluxe Strap
This strap reaches across the top of your head and pulls the headset's weight off of your face. It's a simple accessory that makes a big difference for longer playing sessions.
Keep Touch controllers on: Energizer Rechargeable batteries
The Quest's Touch controllers each require an AA battery to operate, and, speaking from experience, you're going to want to invest early in some rechargeable batteries to save money in the long run. This pack includes a wall charger that can handle four AAs at once, so you shouldn't have any downtime while waiting for a charge.
Quick cleanup: Microfiber cloths
There's nothing worse than foggy or dirty Quest lenses. They obstruct your ability to focus on the action in the headset properly, and frankly, they're just gross. These cloths from SecurOMax won't scratch your headset's lenses, and you'll be glad you have them on hand after a couple of sessions.
Add in-ear audio: Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds
The Quest uses built-in positional audio to deliver sound, allowing you to hear the real world around you while also hearing what's going on in the VR world. If you'd rather cut out all external sound, you can plug in this affordable pair of Panasonic earbuds to the 3.5mm audio jack on the Quest and be totally immersed in what's going on within the head-mounted display.
Ensure compatibility: AmazonBasics USB-C to USB-A 3.1 cable
The Quest has a built-in USB-C port to handle charging from the included AC adapter. Still, if you're planning on adding an external battery pack, you'll no doubt be able to take advantage of this three-foot USB-C to USB-A cable from AmazonBasics.
Clear vision: Jaws Quick Spit anti-fog spray
Dealing with foggy Quest lenses is serious pain and a problem that affects a large majority of VR users. Heading into the Quest can be a physical endeavor, and having what is essentially a hot mask over your face doesn't lend itself well to ventilation. To help cut down on the fog that ruins games and causes frustration, try applying some anti-fog spray to your lenses once in a while.
If we're making some suggestions
This collection of accessories can complement your Oculus Quest, and none cost more than $20, but if we're picking just one to grab, we recommend the Studioform Creative Quest Deluxe Strap. It alleviates pressure from your face, enabling you to play on your Oculus Quest for extended sessions in comfort.
We also recommend the Energizer rechargeable batteries. The Quest's Touch controllers each take a single AA battery, and in our experience, if you don't recharge, you're going to be buying a lot of batteries to keep up with your VR playtime. This pack comes with four total AA batteries, allowing you to always keep some charged up and ready for your next playthrough.

Valve has, once again, lived up to its pedigree as one of the world's foremost video game developers and created a must-have title. Unfortunately, at this moment, it's only available on a PC running Steam. But Oculus Quest owners can rest assured knowing that they don't need to purchase another VR headset just to play; all you need is a decent gaming PC and an Oculus Quest to get playing!
- Oculus Link: a simple wired experience
- Virtual Desktop: the best wireless option
- ALVR: the free wireless solution
Products used in this guide
- The easiest way to connect: Oculus Link cable ($80 at Best Buy)
- When a USB-C port isn't available: Modal 10-foot cable ($27 at Best Buy)
- See your computer's desktop through your Quest: Virtual Desktop ($13 at Oculus)
- Unlock your Quest's full potential: SideQuest (Free at SideQuest VR)
How to play Half-Life: Alyx with an Oculus Link
Wired is the best way to go right now for two main reasons. First, the wired experience is unbelievably easy to set up and, second, you'll be getting the highest quality video and audio quality with a wire. To get started, all you'll need is a USB Type-C cable to plug your Oculus Quest into your computer.
The $80 Oculus Link cable will offer the highest quality experience and is officially recommended by Oculus. If your computer doesn't have a USB Type-C port, you can opt for a less expensive $27 Modal 10-foot cable that'll plug into the USB Type-A 3.1 ports on your PC. Once you've got the cable, follow these instructions.
- Make sure Steam, SteamVR, and Half-Life: Alyx are all installed on your computer. You can get Steam here. You don't need to open SteamVR at this time.
- Open up the Oculus software on your PC.
- Sign in with your Oculus account.
- Connect one side of the USB cable to the appropriate port on your PC and the other side to your Oculus Quest.
The Oculus app on your computer should recognize the Oculus Quest once it's plugged in. Click Continue on the screen that pops up to enable Oculus Link.
During the Oculus Link setup, you can test the cable to make sure it's fast enough to be used with Oculus Link by clicking the Test button at the bottom of the screen. If your cable fails the test, you should consider one of the cables we recommended above.
- Click Continue and put the Oculus Quest on your head.
- You'll be asked to set up the Guardian boundaries for your room.
- On the Oculus Home screen, select Apps on the left-hand side of the screen.
Now start SteamVR.
If you have not previously set up the room boundaries in SteamVR, you'll need to follow through with the steps on your PC. This will appear automatically on your monitor if it was not previously set up.
Once SteamVR loads up, press the menu button on the left Oculus Touch controller to pull up the SteamVR dashboard.
- Launch Half-Life: Alyx and enjoy.
How to play Half-Life: Alyx with Virtual Desktop
Virtual Desktop is the best wireless experience but it'll cost you extra (if you want to go free, check out ALVR). Make sure to buy the Oculus Quest version, which can be found on the Oculus Store right here (the Steam and Oculus Rift versions won't do the same thing). Once you've got that, put your Oculus Quest on and get Virtual Desktop installed:
- Open your library tab on the Oculus bar at the bottom of your view. It's the square grid of 9 dots.
Install Virtual Desktop by clicking the install button on the Virtual Desktop tile.
- Once it's done installing, take your headset off. Don't launch Virtual Desktop just yet.
Head on over to your gaming PC now.
- Plug your Oculus Quest into your computer with a USB cable. SideQuest should recognize your Oculus Quest if you've gone through our SideQuest setup guide.
- Navigate to the SideQuest app on your Desktop PC.
- Use the search bar on the top right of the SideQuest app to search for Virtual Desktop or just click here.
Select Virtual Desktop.
Click the Install to Headset button to install the Virtual Desktop patch onto your Oculus Quest.
Click on the tasks button on the top and ensure the patch was successfully installed.
- While still on your PC, download the Virtual Desktop streaming app.
Run the application once it's done downloading.
- Fill in your Oculus username in the box and press Save.
- For the best future experience, make sure Start with Windows and Start minimized in tray are selected.
Time to put the Oculus Quest on your head and game.
- Launch Virtual Desktop from the library tab on the Oculus bar at the bottom.
When Virtual Desktop loads up for the first time, you'll need to select your Desktop PC from the list to connect to it. It's probably the only thing listed.
- Once connected, press the menu button on the left controller to open the universal Virtual Desktop menu.
Select Games from the list.
Select Half-Life: Alyx.
How to play Half-Life: Alyx with ALVR (a free wireless experience)
ALVR delivers a wireless VR experience without the extra cost. It's come a long way in a very short amount of time and, in most cases, the quality gap between it and Virtual Desktop has quickly shrunk. That's why we love ALVR and can recommend it as a great way to go wireless without spending the extra dough.
For this tutorial, you'll need to use SideQuest to get ALVR installed onto your Oculus Quest. Please follow our SideQuest guide here if you don't have SideQuest installed yet.
- On your desktop computer, navigate to the ALVR Github.
Download ALVR_server_Windows.zip. You can find this under the Assets section of each release in Github.
Extract ALVR_server_Windows.zip to a permanent location on your computer. Something like My Documents or the Desktop folder is fine.
- Open up the ALVR folder you just extracted and run ALVR.exe.
Accept any security warnings that appear.
Follow through the initial setup to make sure your Windows Firewall is configured correctly.
Now to load ALVR onto your Oculus Quest
- Plug your Oculus Quest into your computer with a USB cable. SideQuest should recognize your Oculus Quest if you've gone through our Sidequest setup guide.
- Open up the SideQuest application on your desktop PC.
Use the search box at the top of the screen to search for ALVR or click here. The full title name you'll see listed in Sidequest is ALVR - Air Light VR.
On the store page within Sidequest, click the Install to Headset button to download and install ALVR onto your Oculus Quest.
- Once the installation is complete, unplug the Oculus Quest and fit it to your face as you normally would when playing.
- Open your library tab on the Oculus bar at the bottom of your view. It's the square grid of 9 dots. If you don't see the bar at the bottom, press the home button on your right controller.
- Select Unknown Sources from the rightmost dropdown list.
Scroll down and select ALVR from the main pane.
- ALVR will launch into a white screen.
- Pull your visor up but leave the Oculus Quest on your head to keep it from falling asleep.
On your computer, click the Trust button within the ALVR app next to the Oculus Quest listing.
- Once it's connected, you'll see your headset's statistics and information displayed in the ALVR app on your desktop.
- SteamVR will automatically launch and you'll be greeted with SteamVR home from within the Oculus Quest.
Once SteamVR loads up, press the menu button on the left Oculus Touch controller to pull up the SteamVR dashboard.
- Launch Half-Life: Alyx and enjoy.
And there you have it, all the options you could want for playing Half-Life: Alyx on your Oculus Quest. Keep in mind that you'll experience the highest quality visual and audio fidelity when using the wired Oculus Link experience. The wireless experiences outlined here will be slightly lower quality but will depend entirely on how fast your home's network is. A faster home network will guarantee a higher quality wireless experience. Either way, you'll be experiencing the best VR has to offer with Half-Life: Alyx.
Half-Life is back!

The story we never knew

Grab some Prime Day 3D printing deals right here
Grab yourself a brand new 3D printer and accessories for cheap with these Prime Day deals.If you're dying to find out just how much better Facebook's new VR system is than the original, you're in luck, because our Oculus Quest 2 graphics comparison is designed to do just that. Thanks to the efforts of some seriously amazing developers, quite a few games have already received initial patches that enhance the graphics for owners of an Oculus Quest 2, making Oculus Quest 1 games even more immersive. Heck, you might even need more storage space if games like The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners are any indication.
But the performance upgrade that comes with a 3-generation leap in chipsets isn't just better graphics — it also means performance improvements across the board. The means better AI, more enemies on the screen at once, more detailed worlds and characters, faster loading times, a massive jump in resolution and overall clarity and, maybe my personal favorite, compatibility with Wi-Fi 6 to finally make 90Hz wireless PC VR gaming possible.
Oculus Quest 2 vs. Oculus Quest graphics comparison The first enhanced games
While the Oculus Quest doesn't launch until October 13, developers have already begun upgrading their games to take advantage of the Snapdragon XR2 chipset inside the Oculus Quest 2. Games like The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, Reel Fishing, Gravity Lab, Waltz of the Wizard, and Red Matter (to name a few) have already received patches that add extra detail to character models, bump up the texture resolution, add in new lighting effects, and even significantly increase the overall resolution for better clarity (and actual easy-to-read text).
Let's check out a few, shall we? It's important to remember that these games were built for the significantly lower power Oculus Quest, and future games built from the ground-up for the Oculus Quest 2 will almost certainly look even better. Also, make sure to view the images below in full-screen to see all the differences. In general, captured VR images never quite give you the full effect that you'll see with the headset on your face, so know that these games will look even better when using the Oculus Quest 2 versus what you'll see here.
Red Matter
Sci-fi space puzzler Red Matter was already one of the best looking, if not the best looking Oculus Quest game on the market. It's no surprise then to see this developer significantly enhance the resolution of the game as well as the textures, lending even further detail to the game. As you'll see from the above shots, the original Oculus Quest relied heavily on fixed foveated rendering (FFR) to guarantee good performance.
While FFR is great for keeping performance steady, it significantly degrades image quality in your peripheral vision and can sometimes even cut into the center cone of vision. You'll see this difference in the first two screenshots, which show significant pixelation on anything outside of the center cone of vision on the original Oculus Quest.
The Oculus Quest 2 version appears to do away with FFR completely, making the entire image look crisp and clean. In addition to that, there's some obvious increases in texture quality around the scene, particularly in the mountains and cliff facades, as well as other materials like the outside of the ship you crashland on.
Gravity Lab
Gravity Lab is a Rube Goldberg-esque puzzler that sees players creating machines to deliver different types of marbles to containers. Since it's in space, you'll find plenty of gravity-based puzzles in its 3-tiers of levels, including different difficulty levels that challenges players to use fewer pieces to get the job done.
From what I can tell having played them both side-by-side, the Oculus Quest 2 version of Gravity Lab looks identical to the PC VR version. That includes improvements in lighting, cube-mapped reflections on tubes and other reflective surfaces, glass shaders, dynamic lighting, and some other effects. There's no difference in texture quality from what I can tell — it's all about effects and a resolution bump in this game.
In fact, if you look at the video around the 16-second mark (or the second picture below), you'll notice that the dynamic lighting glows and reflects off several surfaces on the Quest 2 version, illuminating your hands, reflecting in the glass, and generally looking realistic. You can see the green and red lights glowing in all the surfaces, and it really just looks fantastic. The Quest 1 version, on the other hand, features flat lighting with no reflections or anything of the sort and comes off looking a bit sterile.
The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners
The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners has been one of the most anticipated Oculus Quest releases since it originally launched on the PC earlier this year. When compared to the PC version, the Oculus Quest versions visuals are pretty tame but the experience is, thankfully, exactly the same. That fact that developer Skydance Interactive was even able to get this physics-heavy action RPG on the Quest in the first place is pretty astounding.
The demo on the Oculus Quest store starts you about an hour into the game and puts you in the middle of a suburban part of New Orleans with a mission to retrieve a wedding ring from a woman's zombified husband. Upon initial glance, there seem to be few differences between the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 versions of the game, but a quick walk around the area reveals several detail and lighting differences to behold.
The ragged streets of post-apocalyptic New Orleans feature more debris and other realistic-looking stuff strewn around on the Quest 2 version. There are even more objects in the world, as you'll note from the first image below, where an entire telephone pole and palettes (left side) and a tree (middle) are completely missing on the Quest 1 version. Likewise, the second image shows the dumpster on fire making the palettes around it glow on the Quest 2, while the third image shows lighting enhancements like godrays coming through the dusty windows in the third shot on the Quest 2.
Waltz of the Wizard
Waltz of the Wizard is an innovative wizard simulator that sees players inside the home of a wizard, combining ingredients to make potions, performing spells, and visiting locations to engage in combat and other puzzles. Waltz of the Wizard was one of the first games to enable hand tracking on the Oculus Quest, and now it's one of the first games to be enhanced for the Quest 2.
The Quest 2 enhancements for Waltz of the Wizard include a 150% resolution increase, additional objects and fine detail in the main room, lighting bloom (see the candles and lanterns), realtime lighting from spells and other objects, anisotropic textures, and improved particle effects all around. In the first image above, you'll notice the pictures on the back wall are significantly sharper on the Quest 2. This effect is even more exasperated when using the headsets and show what anisotropic filtering can do for distance texture and object quality.
Arizona Sunshine
Zombie games are popular in VR if you couldn't tell, and there's a lot of good ones to boot. Arizona Sunshine was one of the original successful VR zombie games, as it combined a compelling single-player campaign with the ability to play the entirety of the campaign co-op with a friend. Developers Vertigo Games and Jaywalkers Interactive have added a ton of content to the game over the past few years and have somehow managed to cram all that onto the Oculus Quest, with some great enhancements for the Oculus Quest 2.
Compared to the Oculus Quest, the Oculus Quest 2 version is much higher resolution, making it more pleasant to experience just how disgusting zombies can be up close. More detailed zombie models now have ragdoll physics when killed, additional environmental objects like birds, blood spatter, foliage, and even "decorative" zombies around the environment make the world feel more alive. New dynamic lighting, shaders, specular and normal maps, as well as destructible glass add even more realism to the world, and now the sniper scopes are also rendered in real-time.
Vertigo Game's own comparison trailer above does a marvelous job of showcasing all the changes you'll find. Oculus Quest players can play alongside Oculus Quest 2 players, so while the visual enhancements will make the Quest 2 version look better, you'll still be able to play the same great game on the original Quest.
Oculus Quest 2 vs. Oculus Quest graphics comparison How about PC?
Comparing an Oculus Quest 2 to a PC, even with its extra horsepower over the original, is probably going to yield some disappointment. Given the massive gulf in power between the Quest 2 and a gaming PC, it's no surprise that the PC is going to win a graphics contest every time. But does it really matter? Do more detailed environments and models really make a better game, or is this more about aesthetics? Let's take a look at two games with Quest 2-specific enhancements: Arizona Sunshine, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners.
Arizona Sunshine
When compared with the PC version, you'll see some massive differences in lighting quality, several additional and higher-quality shaders (like the water), cloth simulation found in banners on bridges and other places, and much higher quality models and animations. To the Oculus Quest port's credit, there are several aesthetic and artistic changes that I personally prefer, like more vibrant mountains and some little details, like blood on the shooting gallery table in the beginning.
Regardless of the visual differences, you're still getting the same great game with hilarious dialog and a story that spans multiple hours. You can also play cooperatively with two other players through the entire campaign, as well as the additional downloadable content available.
The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners
We've already covered the differences between the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 versions of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, but what about the PC version? Simply put, it looks like comparing a PS2 game with a PS3 game. The Quest 2 version certainly gets the point across and, surprisingly, still ends up creating an atmosphere with a palpable sense of dread despite the massive visual differences here.
Saints & Sinners is a bit tough to perfectly line encounters up since the mobs in the game are randomly generated, but the scenery stays the same throughout. What we can see is a stark contrast in power, with the PC pushing much higher resolution textures, significantly better lighting (particularly inside the blue mansion at the end), more objects strewn about the world, and even some gameplay adjustments based on the ability to add in more detail (like the barbed wire trap inside the mansion).
Oculus Quest 2 vs. Oculus Quest graphics comparison Looking to the future
On the technical side of things, Oculus has already updated the performance targets for developers in their official documentation. Some developers on Reddit have been able to crunch the numbers, and the difference between the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 is pretty astounding. Facebook's performance targets show that the Oculus Quest 2 can render roughly 10x the number of triangles when compared to the Oculus Quest 2.
Statistically, that's the kind of generational leap we had hoped for when dreaming of a next-generation standalone VR system, and it seems that Qualcomm and Facebook were able to deliver it. While polygon counts have become a less important metric for gaming consoles in recent generations, the original Oculus Quest could only render between 50,000 and 100,000 triangles per frame. Oculus Quest 2 is capable of around 1,000,000 triangles per second, and that doesn't even count in the new shader abilities and other technical details we won't delve into here.
The chart above from Qualcomm shows performance differences between the Snapdragon XR2 in the Oculus Quest 2 and the Snapdragon 835 in the original Oculus Quest. That theoretical performance difference is pretty astounding, especially when you look at the AI metric. An 11x improvement is no joke, and it seems to go perfectly hand-in-hand with the 10x improvement in polygon count that we mentioned above.
How, exactly, does AI performance translate into games? The developer of Sun Shard used a gladiator-style arena full of zombified skeleton enemies to help illustrate the difference in a palpable way. The video below shows that the game on the original Oculus Quest is only able to successfully able to display and handle AI and physics calculations for two enemies at a time, making the arena feel a tad sparse. The Oculus Quest 2 is able to handle eight enemies without problem, and that's just something that was built in a single day after the developer received his Quest 2.
We've seen from the PC side of things that AI calculations mean more than just smarter enemies (or more enemies) — it also means ways to significantly enhance both image quality and performance through technologies like DLSS 2.0. Facebook was the first company to implement foveated rendering in a consumer-grade headset with the original Oculus Quest to enhance performance, and Facebook's AI division has already shown that they're working on a technology similar to NVIDIA's DLSS 2.0 for the Oculus Quest family.
There's no doubt that this will further enhance image quality and performance of Quest 2 games, going forward, since the chipset that powers the Quest 2 is so good at making the AI-based calculations needed for this type of tech. The Oculus Quest 2 will be out on October 13, and is most certainly Facebook's attempt at making a fully-realized VR console for the masses.

Blair Witch comes to the Oculus Quest just in time for Halloween
The Oculus Quest allows you to play VR games without requiring a PC, phone, or external sensors. Here's every game you can buy or download for free!Best Chromecast for Oculus Quest Android Central 2020
The Oculus Quest is an excellent device to bring to parties. It doesn't require any external sensors or wires, so you can bring it anywhere and pass it around so everyone can play. However, if you want people to see what's going on inside the headset rather than watch someone flail their arms around, you'll need a Chromecast device. Even though there is a wide range of supported devices for casting the quest, the best three options are the first three devices that supported casting, and the best of the best is the Chromecast Ultra.
Best Overall: Google Chromecast Ultra
The Google Chromecast Ultra has a similar design to the Chromecast 3rd generation but has one key difference that effects Oculus Quest streaming, the ability to connect it using ethernet. By connecting the Chromecast Ultra to an Ethernet port, you're removing one wireless component from the casting equation. Even if you use it over Wi-Fi, users have reported that the Chromecast Ultra works better when it comes to casting the Oculus Quest.
When it comes to streaming media content, the Chromecast Ultra pumps in a lot more power than the standard Chromecast. The Chromecast Ultra supports 4K and HDR. If you're looking for a media device to stream 4K content and to cast your Oculus Quest, then the Chromecast Ultra is your best option.
Pros:
- Supports Ethernet connection
- Supports 4K HDR video streaming
- Still in a small form factor despite the increased power
Cons:
- Almost twice as expensive as the Chromecast 3rd Generation
Best Overall
Google Chromecast Ultra
High quality casting
The Chromecast Ultra supports ethernet connectivity to improve the quality of casting the Oculus Quest. It also supports 4K HDR media.
Best Budget: Google Chromecast 3rd Generation
The third-generation Chromecast is the least expensive device that's officially supported for streaming the Oculus Quest. The performance of streaming varies on a variety of factors, including Wi-Fi strength and if you're on a 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz band. 5Ghz is generally preferred for casting the Oculus Quest. While this budget-friendly Chromecast works with casting the Oculus Quest, many users have had stuttering or connectivity issues. We've used this ourselves, and it worked reasonably well in our testing. Still, if you have the budget, it might be worth looking at more expensive options.
In addition to being able to stream the Oculus Quest, the Google Chromecast 3rd Generation delivers over 2,000 apps in 1080p. It's a great budget-friendly option for people with 1080p TVs or users on a budget.
Pros:
- Budget-friendly
- Easy to set up
- Also an excellent device for streaming media content
Cons:
- Performance is worse than Chromecast Ultra
- Lacks an ethernet support
- Only supports up to 1080p video
Best Budget
Google Chromecast 3rd Generation
Budget-friendly casting
The third-generation Chromecast supports 1080p streaming for media and is the cheapest device to support casting the Oculus Quest.
Best for Gamers: NVIDIA Shield TV
The NVIDIA Shield TV is a 4K HDR media streaming box that can also play games from the Google Play Store. It has a library of popular PC games that you can download and play and allows you to cast PC games to your living room TV. Now, with the addition of Oculus Quest casting, the NVIDIA Shield is an even better hub for gamers.
The NVIDIA Shield is the best Android TV available and one of the only devices that can stream so many different types of content. The only reason that it's not the best overall device on this list is its price. At $200 for the pro edition, the NVIDIA Shield is an expensive purchase if you're just planning to use it for Oculus Quest streaming. You can get a non-pro version for $150, but that's still expensive when compared to the other entries on this list. If you already have the NVIDIA Shield TV or you're looking for an Android TV device, this is your best option. If you're having a hard time picking between the Shield TV and the Shield TV Pro, check out our guide comparing them.
Pros:
- Supports casting the Oculus Quest and PC games
- Is also an excellent Android TV device
- Can play some games natively
Cons:
- Expensive if you're only going to use it for Oculus Quest casting
Best for Gamers
NVIDIA Shield TV Pro
Game casting
The NVIDIA Shield TV can cast the Oculus Quest and PC games. It's also a 4K HDR media streaming device that can play games from the Google Play Store.
Bottom line
There are more options than ever for casting your Oculus Quest. The Oculus Quest recently gained support for more casting devices, including the NVIDIA Shield TV, Google Home Hub, and some smart TVs. It also works with all generations of Chromecast.
The Google Chromecast Ultra is the best option for Oculus Quest casting because it supports ethernet connectivity which will ensure a solid connection. It's also a better streaming device with support for 4K HDR media.
To increase your chances of seamless casting, you should attach your Chromecast through Ethernet, if possible. If you are using Wi-Fi, you should use a 5Ghz band to reduce interference. When it works smoothly, casting the Oculus Quest to a Chromecast instantly livens up a party and lets you share your VR experience with everyone around you.

Looking for alternatives to Nest Wifi? Here are the best options.
Google's Nest Wifi might be some of the best-known mesh networking hardware on the market, but it's far from the only option available to you. If you're looking for alternatives, there are plenty - and many of them blow Google out of the water.Acer has finally unveiled the first Snapdragon-powered Chromebook with the upcoming Spin 513 series. It's kind of exciting if you're a fan of Chromebooks — or even of mobile tech in general — because it's more than likely going to be the first of many. It just might also be something that changes who buys a Chromebook and how we use them.
The Spin 513 isn't using a specially-built Snapdragon chip; it has the same off-the-shelf Snapdragon 7c we've seen in Windows ARM 2-in-1s. That's not a bad thing because a Chromebook doesn't really need any specially designed ARM chip, at least not right now.
The Snapdragon brings two awesome things to the Spin 513: extra-long battery life and LTE connectivity. I'd argue that these are the most important upgrades for any Chromebook because they are designed to be mobile. Chromebooks tend to be light — both in weight and in specs — and portable so you can take and use them anywhere. This also keeps the prices in check, which is why you can buy a great Chromebook for school that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. A Snapdragon chip takes this idea and runs with it.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
Of course, this isn't the first ARM-powered Chromebook nor is it the first LTE-enabled Chromebook. About half of the available models come with ARM chips from companies like MediaTek or Rockchip, and Chrome OS has been optimized for these devices to run fairly well on some very anemic hardware. And we've seen LTE Chromebooks from Samsung, HP, and even Google themselves, but they seem to have fallen out of fashion.
Nobody does cellular like Qualcomm.
A Snapdragon Chromebook is different, though. Your LTE connection is going to be top-notch because nobody does LTE (in North America, especially) like Qualcomm does. Love or hate Qualcomm for some of its business practices, you can't deny how great the company's cellular connectivity and RF system is. It's simply the best in the business.
Qualcomm has integrated LTE in a way that has much less impact on battery life than any other company. Combine this with the chip optimization from Android device makers and we have seen insane battery life from our phones. Now the race is on to do the same for Chromebooks.
14-hour battery life in tests translates into 8 or 9 hours of real work with an LTE connection.
Acer rates the Spin 513's battery life at up to 14 hours. Surely this is under ideal conditions and not using the LTE connection. I'd imagine that means you can be using it normally via cellular connection for 8-9 hours straight if you watch the screen brightness. That's ... mouthwatering to a Chromebook user.
This is where the room for optimization is, both from Qualcomm and from Google. I suspect we will see a Chromebook-optimized Snapdragon if the idea proves popular enough, but it doesn't have to come from Qualcomm, In fact, I'd say the best way to do things is let Qualcomm keep developing Snapdragon chips for Windows laptops — which it does a great job at — and let Google do the work to mate them to Chrome OS.
If you could get the Spin 513 right now, some features just aren't going to work perfectly or at all. You need an Intel processor to use Parallels for the enterprise in order to run Windows apps. Linux application support is optimized for Chromebooks with ARM chips, but of the MediaTek variety. Your Android apps will, of course, work fine on Snapdragon's core feature set unless Chrome gets in the way somehow. I'm betting it won't.
Google needs to optimize Chrome OS for the Snapdragon c series instead of Snapdragon optimizing the chip for Chrome. It just makes sense.
I'm not sure if we'll ever see Parallels for ARM-powered Enterprise Chromebooks, but looking at Windows laptops using the same chip, it's technically possible. That will depend on Parallels and Google working things out and evaluating the performance. The same goes for using Linux applications inside Chrome — any glitches or interoperability problems are best worked out by Google. If Qualcomm follows the known roadmap for ARM Windows chips, Google knows just what it needs to do.
All I know for sure is that I want someone to do it and give us more Snapdragon-powered models with LTE support in the future. Quick pairing with a Pixel phone for a data connection was a great idea. But not having to pair at all and have an on-demand LTE connection that's smart enough to sleep when it's not needed is a far better idea and makes a Chromebook much more attractive to the 99% of smartphone users who didn't buy a Pixel.
A Chromebook with an always-on feature is a very different beast, and I really miss having one; I used the Google Chromebook Pixel far longer than I would have if it didn't have LTE. Having an LTE Chromebook with Android apps might make the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 the Chromebook to buy in 2021.
Need something now?
Acer Chromebook Spin 713
The beauty is a beast in the power department.
If you're someone who loves a 3:2 screen and a big, beefy processor to power it, this Project Athena Chromebook is for you. It's got a bigger price tag than the 513, but it's got more ports and more power to justify the upgrade.

But hearing about it — because you want to watch BBC iPlayer on U.S. soil, or Netflix when traveling abroad, probably isn't enough. If you want to know everything about why a VPN is also great for anonymity, security and your personal online safety - you're in the right place.
What is a VPN and why do I need one?
A VPN is a clever way of masking your online identity. Usually, when you go online you get connected to a server and given a unique IP address, this identifies where you are logging on from and can store data about you. Since these servers are relatively open, there could be people watching, and potentially, threats that can access your data. This IP address can give away your real world identity, allowing potentially negative entities to track you down. This is especially important when travelling and using open Wi-Fi at airports and hotels that could, potentially, be insecure.
This specific identity also means your location can be determined. So if you're a U.S. citizen abroad that still wants to catch up on your Hulu shows then you might be blocked in a country Hulu isn't accessible from. This, also, is a great use for a VPN which can make you appear to still be on US soil.
How does a VPN work?
So you want to get that identity leak plugged up. That's where a VPN can help. It masks your IP address and location by effectively bouncing your signal through other servers. To any online entity or potential threat, you will appear to be someone else logged on in another location.
That means that when contacting a website, say, you'll be going via the encrypted VPN. Your computer will tell the VPN it wants to access the website, that request will be sent from the VPN secure server and the response will then be forwarded to you. This affords you a buffer layer to keep you safer and more anonymous when online - rather than having all your data collected by every site you visit.
Is a VPN secure?
A VPN is a super secure way to go online thanks to the wonder that is encryption. This is a military developed digital security that is used by governments, the banks and security firms the world over. So you can definitely rely on it being secure.
An encryption works by giving both parties, a key. The message is sent in code with one key giving the way to read that code, the other key being used to write the code. If you don't have a key you can't understand the message - even if you do somehow manage to get hold of it. There are different grades of encryption but this will depend on which VPN service you go for, with some more complex than others.
All that means your network is pretty much hack proof and all your browsing information is encrypted in transit making it unreadable anyway.
Is a VPN good for Netflix, BBC iPlayer and Hulu?
Lots of VPN services are great for accessing geo restricted content when you'd otherwise be denied. For the UK's BBC iPlayer while in the U.S., or U.S. Netflix and Hulu while in Europe, a VPN will get you in.
If you're on vacation in France, say, and want to watch the latest Star Trek on Netflix then you'll be blocked as Netflix will see you're not in the U.S. Fire up your VPN service, select a U.S. server, then go back into Netflix. Now Netflix will think you're back home and give you access to all your content once again.
Of course some people also use a VPN to access international Netflix content outside of their country but we're not encouraging or condoning that. We're just pointing out that is something a VPN can do and something some people choose to use it for.
Does a VPN work for P2P torrents?
Sharing P2P content, or torrenting, may be illegal in some cases, but not all. What you choose to share is down to you. But should you wish to do so with anonymity and a layer or security, then a VPN can provide that.
It's worth nothing that not all VPN services will support torrents and some are faster than others, so it's worth reading into this if you're getting a VPN specifically for P2P content.
How fast is a VPN?
A VPN service's speed varies widely. This is due to two main factors, location and servers. So one VPN service could be a lot faster than another for you because that one may have more servers, or better connections between servers, allowing for faster data sharing. The servers themselves could be faster on one VPN over another also.
Some VPN services are really fast for local access, but then slow down a lot once you change your location to somewhere far away. Others offer a more consistent speed no matter where you are. As you might imagine you usually get what you pay for.
What is the best VPN for me?
The best VPN service for you will depend on what you need. But for an overall top rated service we vouch for ExpressVPN as it's well priced - higher than most, sure - but it offers a solid all-round setup. You get a wide number of internationally placed servers, high-grade encryption security and an excellent 24/7 live chat support. Also, the clients - aka apps - work really work across devices including iOS, Android, Mac and Windows with a super simple to user interface and added security of a kill switch and more. All that can be used across five devices at the same time.
ExpressVPN
There are lots of great VPN options out there, but ExpressVPN is our favorite. It offers reliable connections, fast speeds, and great customer support. Sign up today and get three months free!
If you want the cheapest option, then there are free services but these generally limit you on data. HotSpot Shield Free VPN is a great option as it gives you plenty for free and then you can upgrade to the Premium version if you like it and want more. You are limited to 500MB of data allowance per day on the free version, but at 15GB per month that's a lot for most people.
If absolute security is your main requisite then Surfshark is a good choice as it uses a private DNS, double VPN hop and AES-256 encryption to keep your identity and location totally hidden.
How much does a VPN cost?
As you've probably worked out, VPN services vary and so do their prices. They start at free, with limits on things like data, but then go up to over $100 per year. The average monthly price, if you pay month to month and don't commit to longer is about $10 per month.
If you go for a year then it'll work out nearer to $5 per month, go for two years and it'll drop to lower and so on. So it really depends on how you want to pay.
Best Free VPN Services 2020
Lots of services offer a seven day free trial and a 30-day money-back guarantee. So, generally, you'll be able to try before you really buy anything - which makes that commitment to a longer set of payments - and saving money - easier to do comfortably.
We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:
1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).
2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad.

Galaxy Note 10
Samsung's 2019 Note is still a powerhouse
With the Galaxy Note 10 series, Samsung decided to market three different models instead of one, removed the headphone jack, and phased out the microSD card. However, with gorgeous AMOLED displays, faster performance, and an S Pen that does more than ever before, these Notes are certainly still worth a look.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Price and availability
The Galaxy Note 10, Note 10+, and Note 10+ 5G were announced in early August 2019 and became available for purchase on August 23, 2019. The Note 10 had a starting price of $950, whereas the Note 10+ started at $1,100. There was also a Note 10+ 5G version available on AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, which retailed for $1,300.

Now that the devices are all over a year old, you can find them at significant discounts. We've even seen the standard Note 10 as low as $710.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Reviews
The Galaxy Note 10+ is one of the best phones that Samsung has to offer in 2020, only being outdone by the Galaxy S20 and Galaxy Note 20 series. Some of its highlights include an incredible AMOLED display, outstanding hardware, consistently good camera performance, and excellent battery life.
A lot is going for the regular Note 10, but the headphone jack's removal was a big change for the Note series, and low-light images taken with the camera haven't proven quite as strong as we would have liked. There's also the annoying fact that the baseline Note 10 doesn't have expandable storage.
Following our initial review of the Note 10 back in August 2019, we've continued to use and follow the phone's growth over the months. We recently checked back in with the Note 10 after about 10 months from its release. And, surprisingly, it holds up better than we could have expected. The design is still excellent, the display is gorgeous, and it's still a performance beast. Minus the lack of a 120Hz or 90Hz display, everything else about the Note 20 feels like a modern 2020 smartphone.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Specs
Note devices are always chock-full with the latest specs, and that's no different with the Note 10 and Note 10+.
Powering the phones are Qualcomm's blazing-fast Snapdragon 855 processor, you can get up to 12GB of RAM, the displays support HDR10+, and Samsung boosted its wired charging speeds up to 45W.

Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Software
In September 2020, Samsung started rolling out its One UI 2.5 update to the Galaxy Note 10 in the U.S. This isn't the largest update Samsung's ever released, but it does come with some notable upgrades and changes you'll want to be aware of.
Most importantly, One UI 2.5 brings some of the features down from the Galaxy Note 20 series, such as Wireless DeX mode, improved Pro Video mode in the Camera app, and support for Bitmoji stickers within the Always On Display. Note 10 and 10+ users can also search for YouTube videos directly from the Samsung keyboard app and share their Wi-Fi logins and passwords with friends and family more easily. One UI 2.5 also brought the September 2020 Android security patch.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Compared to other Android phones
Last year's Notes are forces to be reckoned with — no doubt about that. However, they're also far from existing in a bubble. The Android flagship smartphone space is crowded with tons of other competing handsets, with some of them offering similar features for hundreds of dollars less.
Before you pull the trigger on the Note 10, be sure to give our comparisons a look to make sure you're buying the phone that's right for you. The Pixel 4 XL, for example, may be a better choice if you place a lot of value in your phone's camera system. There are also the Galaxy S20+ and S20 Ultra, which are better than the Note 10+ in more ways than one.
However, none of those phones have the S Pen, which continues to make the Note series stand out from everything else on the market. Whether or not that S Pen is more valuable than spec upgrades from newer phones is up for you to decide.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Models
As mentioned above, Samsung's shook up its Note release formula with the Note 10 by launching not just one new Note, but three — the Note 10, Note 10+, and Note 10+ 5G.
The regular Note 10 is the cheapest of the bunch, and for the first time since we can remember, it offers a true Note experience in a surprisingly manageable form factor. Samsung usually tries to make Notes as big as possible, but the Note 10 has a similar footprint to the Galaxy S10. While we still wouldn't consider it a small phone, it's definitely a breath of fresh air for the Note series.
Unfortunately, the Note 10 does come with some drawbacks to achieve its "low" price. Its display is only 2280 x 1080 Full HD+, there isn't support for expandable storage, and the battery capacity isn't the largest at just 3,500 mAh.
If you want the best Note in the 10 series, you'll want to get the Note 10+. It has a larger display with a higher Quad HD+ resolution, a bigger battery, an additional Time-of-Flight rear camera, and supports microSD cards for extra storage space.
Last but not least, there's the Note 10+ 5G. As the name suggests, this is essentially the same phone as the Note 10+, save for the fact that it can connect to 5G networks.
In January 2020, Samsung unveiled something we weren't expecting — the Galaxy Note 10 Lite. Taking a look at the phone, it's an interesting hodgepodge of specs. It offers a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a 2400 x 1080 resolution, Samsung's Exynos 8895 processor, up to 8GB of RAM, and triple 12MP cameras — including wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto sensors. You also get a hefty battery at 4,500 mAh.
The idea behind the Note 10 Lite is to offer the Galaxy Note experience at a more affordable price, with the phone selling for just under $500 if you decide to import an international model into the U.S.
That's the biggest kicker for the phone. It packs a hefty punch for the price, but with international phones not coming with any sort of manufacturer warranty, you'll need to decide if that's something you're comfortable with.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Colors
With 2018's Note 9, Samsung had some fun with its creative side with colors like Ocean Blue and Lavender Purple. For the Note 10, Samsung kicked its color wheel up to 11.
The Note 10 comes in a variety of awesome colors, including a striking Aura Glow one that's essentially a rainbow colorway and changes its appearance all the time, depending on how light is hitting it. If that's not your thing, Aura Red, Pink, and Blue are also pretty great.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Accessories
After you buy the Note 10, we recommend picking up some accessories for the phone.
The Note 10 is big, beautiful, and definitely not something you want to risk shattering with just the right drop. As such, we urge you to get a screen protector and case, along with a 25W charger at the bare minimum.
If you opt for the larger Note 10+, not only will you want to pick up a screen protector and a case, but you'll also want to consider getting a microSD card and a 45W charger.
If you want a bit more flexibility with your Note 10 charging, consider a wireless charging pad or portable battery pack.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 FAQs
Below are answers to some of the more frequently asked questions that we've received regarding the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+ devices. The Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+ are chock-full of different features and settings. This is great news for anyone looking for a phone with endless functionality, but in that same breath, it can also make the handsets a bit challenging to use if you don't know exactly where everything is. To ensure your Note experience is as seamless as can be, we've compiled a bunch of how-to guides to help walk you through various aspects of the phones.
What are some tips and tricks with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10?
One UI, Samsung's custom Android interface, can come with quite the learning curve if you've never used a Samsung before. As such, knowing how to perform basic functions — such as enabling dark mode and managing your notification settings — looks different on a Galaxy than it does a phone from Google, OnePlus, or LG. There's also the navigation bar, which is one of the more heavily-customized aspects of One UI.
If you've had your Note 10 since the very beginning, it's possible you may be encountering some performance issues. Every Android phone experiences some hiccups here and there as it gets older, and the Note 10 is no exception. Thankfully, resolving these performance woes should be quite easy.
And, finally, if you haven't remapped the Bixby button yet, it's time you finally do that.
Does the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 have a headphone jack?
Yep, the rumors were true. The 3.5mm headphone jack, one of the Note series' staple features, is no more with the Note 10. No matter which Note 10 you get, you won't find the legacy port anywhere on the phone.
As with other phones that lack the 3.5mm jack, you can still use wired headphones with the Note 10's USB-C port — either with the USB-C headphones, Samsung includes in the box or with a 3.5mm to USB-C adapter.
Alternatively, if you prefer wireless headphones, the Note 10 supports the latest Bluetooth 5.0 standard so you can listen to your tunes with great wireless range and minimal interference.
Is fast charging available on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10?
While Samsung's been a proponent of wireless charging for some time now, its wired charging speeds have consistently been slower than what a lot of the competition has offered. With the Note 10, the company finally changed things.
Both phones come equipped with USB Power Delivery, meaning that you get out-of-the-box charging speeds of 25W.
That's a sizable upgrade on its own, but if you splurge for the Note 10+, you can take advantage of even faster 45W charging. However, in order to get these increased speeds safely and reliably, you'll need to spend another $50 for Samsung's official 45W USB-C Fast Charging Wall Charger.
What can I do with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10's S Pen?
For many people, the S Pen is the reason to get a new Note phone each year. With the Note 10, Samsung continued to improve the S Pen and added even more features to it.
For avid selfie-takers, Samsung introduced something called Air Actions. Building upon the Bluetooth functionality first introduced with the Note 9's S Pen, Air Actions allow you to point the S Pen at the Note 10 to act as a camera shutter button, switch between different shooting modes, and zoom in/out.
Air Doodle is another new feature, allowing you to draw wigs, mustaches, and more on people in the camera's frame. The Note 10 can map these drawings on top of people through the viewfinder in real-time through the use of algorithms.
If video editing is more your thing, the S Pen is also a key component to the Note 10's new native video editor, making it super easy to splice, scrub, rearrange timeline items, and more.
Should I get the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 instead?
The Galaxy Note 10 continues to be an excellent phone, but even so, you should be aware that its successor is already here. Samsung announced the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra in August 2020, and we've already been using both for months.
While the Note 10 and 10+ are functionally very similar, there are some significant differences between the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra. The Note 20 is made of premium plastic, while the Note 20 Ultra is all metal and class. The Note 20 is smaller and has a lower refresh rate, while the larger Note 20 Ultra has a 120 Hz refresh rate. The larger model also has more RAM, an SD card slot, and a larger battery. The Note 20 comes in a beautiful Mystic Green, while both are offered in a fabulous Mystic Bronze color.
The perfect ten
Galaxy Note 10
Samsung's 2019 Note is still a powerhouse
With the Galaxy Note 10 series, Samsung decided to market three different models instead of one, removed the headphone jack, and phased out the microSD card. However, with gorgeous AMOLED displays, faster performance, and an S Pen that does more than ever before, these Notes are certainly still worth a look.

But that doesn't mean you have to spend a fortune to protect yourself, especially with so many great VPN deals out there. Take NordVPN, for example. Right now you can take 70% off its regular price when you go with its 3-year plan. That drops the equivalent monthly cost down to just $3.49. Billed upfront at $126, you're saving $305 versus the regular month-to-month cost for that period of time. The best part is that NordVPN will give you either a 1-month, 1-year, 2-year, or 3-year plan on top of the 3-year plan you've bought at no extra cost. It's randomized, and the longer plans are obviously rarer, but free is free.
Stay safe out there
NordVPN
You may never have thought about using a VPN before, but they help keep your private information private. This plan saves you $305 and you could get a 1-month, 1-year, 2-year, or 3-year plan on top of the 3-year plan you've bought at no extra cost.

$430.20 $305 off
You've probably heard a lot about VPNs of late, and for good reason. They enable you to keep your private information private, feel safe in the knowledge that your device's security is intact, and get around geographical barriers that otherwise restrict online content.
NordVPN offers a secure, fast and anonymous browsing experience. It uses military-grade 256-bit AES encryption, DNS Leak Protection, and keeps no logs about user activity so you surf anonymously. NordVPN is also speedy and has an unlimited bandwidth so there's no data cap to worry about. In terms of coverage, NordVPN has one of the highest server counts meaning you're more likely to get a fast and reliable connection. There are 5,000+ servers in NordVPN's network spread across 58 countries. It's also got a large set of additional features like Double VPN, P2P-dedicated servers, automatic kill switch, and much more.
It works on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows, so you can protect whatever devices you use most. There's also support for Linux and Android TV, as well as browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. Your subscription allows you to have 6 devices protected simultaneously and you can even use NordVPN with your router to protect all of the devices in your home while using up only one of those slots. In fact, we named it on our list of the best VPNs of 2020.
NordVPN has a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can try it out risk-free. If you don't want to commit to the 3-year plan, there are some solid savings on the 1-year and 2-year plans, though you'll miss out on the additional free months. In October, Nord announced information related to a data breach that took place in 2018. The impact was limited, and our pals at TechRadar have some great info about the whole situation.
We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:
1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).
2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad.
We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services. Consuming pirated content that is paid-for is neither endorsed nor approved by Future Publishing.

This has been evidenced, in part, by how the special edition Nintendo Switch Animal Crossing Edition console has immediately sold out just about every time an online retailer gets it in stock.
Turns out that Amazon has some available during Prime Day. So while this isn't a Prime Day deal per se, it's a great time to snatch up one of these tropical-colored Switch consoles before they sell out once more.
Nintendo Switch Animal Crossing Edition
It might not be a Prime Day deal per se, but the Animal Crossing Edition of the Nintendo Switch has been sold out for most of the year. Grab it now while it's actually in stock during Prime Day.
Whether you're a Nintendo fan or a hearty Animal Crossing fan, this is the perfect collector's item. The Nintendo Switch Animal Crossing Edition stands out from other limited edition Nintendo Switch console since it is the only Nintendo Switch so far to come with a bright-colored dock. It features the Tanooki, Tom Nook along with his kids, Timmy and Tommy, standing on a small tropical island. Those ocean-green and sky-blue Joy-Cons put one in mind of a calming sea and pair beautifully with the cream-colored dock. There are even special Animal Crossing symbols and designs embossed into the casing on the backside of the main console.
This Nintendo Switch Animal Crossing Edition will look absolutely charming when displayed on your media center or TV stand. But it's not guaranteed to be in stock much longer. Given how quickly it's sold out in the past, you should definitely pick it up while you can or you might just miss the chance to get it all together.

- Some players are getting their Facebook accounts banned after being falsely identified as fake accounts.
- Banned Facebook accounts cannot be signed into, making the Oculus Quest 2 unplayable.
- Facebook says they are working on the problem, which is a temporary issue, and to contact customer service to help resolve it.
The Oculus Quest 2 is an amazing piece of hardware with some killer games, but some players seem to have run into a huge snag. It seems that some new players purchasing an Oculus Quest 2 don't yet have Facebook accounts. Upon signing up for an account and linking their existing account, Facebook's automated systems are marking these accounts as "fake identities", thus banning them in the process. But it's not just that players are unable to join multiplayer sessions or purchase content from the Oculus Store — they're not able to use their shiny new Quest 2 at all.
Right now, Facebook is directing all affected customers to their customer support portal to submit a support ticket and have a human deal with the issue. If you're one of the affected folks, be sure to get that ticket submitted ASAP to get your issue addressed. Official Facebook response on the issue points to this being a temporary error in its system rather than an orchestrated effort to shut out some users. We've been in communication with Facebook on this issue and will continue to provide updates as they become available.

Because of the way Facebook designed the latest Oculus software, players have to log in with a Facebook account before being able to play on the Oculus Quest or Quest 2. If you can't log in, you can't use the Quest; it's as simple as that. While this is a big enough problem in and of itself for brand new players, existing players with Oculus accounts are finding themselves unable to access games and apps they bought in the past, even if they've been Oculus customers for years.
While Facebook's customer service team seems to be able to handle some of the requests with a quick resolution, other customers are still facing lockouts and are stuck with what they describe as a "paperweight" instead of a usable Oculus Quest 2. One reader we've been in contact with had his account flagged after running into a scammer on the Facebook marketplace. Other readers have said their accounts were flagged, most likely, due to the fact that they didn't have a Facebook account before getting an Oculus Quest 2. Hopefully, for all Oculus players, Facebook will be able to resolve these issues soon and provide all customers with a working resolution (and a working account).

While the Oculus Quest 2 has speakers built into its straps, many users may prefer to use a headset to make their audio more controlled and contained.

While you can't use split earphones, there are still some excellent options. Here are the best headphones for the Oculus Quest 2.

Superior sound: OneOdio Over-Ear DJ Stereo Headphones

What are the best headphones for the Oculus Quest 2?
The Oculus Quest 2 has built-in speakers that work well, but headphones provide another level of immersion. They're also a good way to keep audio private. The Logitech G333 VR gaming earphones are built with the Oculus Quest 2 in mind. Their cables are just the right length for the headset, and they'll help immerse you into the world of VR.
If you prefer an over-ear design, we recommend the Logitech G PRO Gaming Headset. The over-the-ear design will prevent external sounds from interfering with your gaming, and give you the best bass compared to earbuds.
You can preorder the Oculus Quest 2 now to make sure that you can enjoy it with your new headphones as soon as possible.

- Google has updated the Google Home app for Android to allow Google Wifi network management.
- The update would be version 2.26 of the Google Home app, rolling out now.
- The Google Wifi app is now no longer necessary if you have a newer Google or Nest Wifi router.
Google has introduced a new update to the Google Home app, allowing users to import Wi-Fi networks managed by the Google Wifi app into the Home app (via 9to5Google.)
This repositions the Google Home app as the central managing hub for all your Google smart home devices and narrows the bifurcation of features between the Google Home and Google Wifi app. One may say it even limits (or eliminates) the necessity of the Google Wifi app, which hasn't gotten a meaningful update in ages and still retains the old material design stylings.
In addition to the import, a user can now manage advanced settings which 9to5Google notes encompass "DNS, WAN, LAN, UPnP, IPV6, DHCP IP reservations, Port Management, and Network Mode." It's essentially everything you'd need the older Wifi app for.
Now, the update is live for the Google Home app in the Play Store with version 2.26. Google first rolled out the update to the iOS Google Home app, noting:
Import your Wi-Fi network from the Google Wifi app so you can manage your network and other connected devices in one place. Use Google Assistant to do things like pause Wi-Fi, check your internet speed, and show your guest Wi-Fi password on smart displays.
On Android, it is rolling out in batches, so it may take a while before it hits your device.
Nest Wifi
The Nest Wifi adds a Google touch to your typical Wi-Fi router and eliminates the risk for extenders if setup properly. Now, it works with the Google Home app so managing it and your other Nest devices is that much easier.

2. IPVanish VPN
Includes 250GB cloud storage for free
Bottom line: Real-world testing has proven that IPVanish is a fast and reliable service. The apps are available on a variety of different platforms, and they are all easy to use. As an added bonus, IPVanish includes 250GB of SugarSync Cloud Storage with all of its plans, giving you a safe place to store your data to access from anywhere.
IPVanish recently changed its policy so that it now allows you to connect as many devices simultaneously as needed. There is no longer a limit of 5 devices.

Pros:
- Over 40,000 shared IP addresses
- Great customer support
- Now offers unlimited devices to be connected simultaneously
Cons:
When it comes to IPVanish, it falls inline feature wise with many of the other providers, but comes in a little bit cheaper than some of the others.There are more than 1,300 servers spread across 50 different countries and it offers up to 10 simultaneous connections on a single account.
It is a US-based provider, which some people may not like, but IPVanish does not keep logs or any other information on its users. There are apps for all major platforms and it's very easy to use.
Invisibility cloak: IPVanish
With its current deal, IPVanish is fairly-priced for its average feature set. It's the best deal we've seen on it for a while, especially with the added cloud storage, though it only has a 7-day money-back guarantee.
3. NordVPN
Most well-known VPN provider out there
Bottom line: Back in 2018 one of NordVPNs servers was compromised, but the company has beefed up security measures to ensure it can't happen again. It is one of the best-known VPN brands that exists today, and offers a bunch of key features that people love to use.
You get a 30-day money-back guarantee should you find it isn't quite the provider that works best for you or your devices.
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, iPlayer, Amazon | Servers: 5,300+ | Server Locations: 80+ in 59 countries | Trial Period: 30 days
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$11.95||0%||$11.95 at NordVPN|
|12 Months||$6.99||41%||$83.88 at NordVPN|
|24 Months||$3.49||70%||$83.76 at NordVPN|
|36 Months||$3.49||70%||$125.64 at NordVPN|
Pros:
Cons:
It may not be the absolute cheapest option, but the deal that NordVPN is running right now makes it quite a compelling option. Pricing for the service starts at just $3.49 per month, but right now when you sign up for the 3-year plan you can get up to an extra year of VPN service for free, which brings that actual cost down pretty significantly.
A recent bit of news revealed that back in 2018 one of the company's servers was compromised. After investigating it, and the confirmation from Nord, it was understood that it was a single server with limited information being obtained. There's a lot at play here beyond just Nord's involvement, and our pals at TechRadar have a great breakdown, so be sure to check that out.
Aside from that, NordVPN offers some really compelling features that would make you want to use it. There are more than 5,600 servers available that are spread around over 60 different countries and Nord makes use of 2048-bit encryption, which exceeds what others are doing.
The company also offers a kill switch, apps for all the popular platforms, DNS leak protection, and more. You can use it to easily circumvent geo-restrictions with a built-in feature that makes it easy to conenct to the right server location.
You can sign up and pay monthly, but the way to get the best deal is to just go all-in on the three year plan, which is just $3.49 per month.
NordVPN
NordVPN is one of our favorites, in part because of its near-6,000 servers that cover the world in over 60 countries. Its 2048-bit encryption is pretty unique, and compelling deals mean you could even score a year of service for free.
4. Hotspot Shield VPN
Feature-rich free plan available
Bottom line: While it's one of our favorite free VPNs as well, Hotspot Shield is also a great contender in the paid space. This is an option you won't want to sleep on.
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, YouTube | Servers: 3,200+ | Server Locations: 130+ in 80+ countries | Trial Period: 45 days
|Plan Options||Total Price|
|Basic||Free at Hotspot Shield|
|Premium||$7.99/mo at Hotspot Shield|
Pros:
Cons:
We had a few complaints when looking at Hotspot Shield as the best free VPN service, but almost every one of them gets solved when you pony up a few dollars each month and pay to use it. It comes in as one of the best cheap VPN providers for a few reasons, from unlimited bandwidth and devices to the 24/7 customer support.
There are over 2,500 servers in more than 70 locations across the world. You can connect up to five devices at the same time, and it's completely ad-free. There is no data logging with Hotspot Shield, and the only major lacking things are OpenVPN support and Bitcoin for payments.
This is one that you'll want to try out for just under $3 per month.
Hotspot Shield VPN
If you're looking for a free VPN to use, look no further. Hotspot Shield VPN is our #1 free pick for a myriad of reasons, and you can even upgrade to a paid membership at any time
5. CyberGhost VPN
Easiest cheap VPN to use to unblock content
Bottom line: CyberGhost offers all the standard features that you'd expect to see in a VPN and also offers some of the easiest server matching out of everyone. The company makes it insanely easy to find the best server so that you can unblock Netflix, Hulu, and more.
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 6,400+ | Server Locations: 110+ in 90 countries | Trial Period: 45 days
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$12.99||0%||$12.99 at CyberGhost|
|12 Months||$5.99||54%||$71.88 at CyberGhost|
|24 Months||$3.69||72%%||$88.56 at CyberGhost|
|38 Months||$2.75||79%||$99 at CyberGhost|
Pros:
- Over 6,200 servers available
- Based in Romania & Germany
- Automatic server matching for geo-restricted content unblocking
- 45-day money-back guarantee on 3-year plan
Cons:
Romania & Germany-based CyberGhost is one of the top VPN providers out there with more than 6,200 servers that span over 110 different locations. Compared to much of the compeition, this is a huge number.
One of the biggest standout features about CyberGhost is just how easy it makes for unblocking georestricted content while you are on the go. There is a one-click server matching option that pairs you with the best server from CyberGhost to allow you access to Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and more. Once connected, the app even opens up your browser for you so you can start streaming. It's the most convenient thing, ever.
Additionally, the service can block ads, trackers, and malicious sites. It automatically sends you to the HTTPS version of each site to ensure you are viewing the most secure option you can. On mobile, you can enable data compression to help save you some MBs while on the go.
Thanks to the ease of use, speeds, and reliability it offers, CyberGhost has been able to bring over 10 million users to its service. The pricing is quite competitive, and by signing up for longer-term plans you can help reduce the per-month cost of the service as well. Will you be the company's next subscriber? Check out our full CyberGhost VPN review for all the details.
CyberGhost VPN
CyberGhost makes using a VPN easy by helping you choose the best server to use for certain tasks, and it generally offers some of the best pricing around as well.
6. PIA VPN
One-click easy connections to servers
Bottom line: PIA is a U.S.-based VPN provider that gives you an unlimited amount of data to use each month and up to 10 simultaneous connections.
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 3,300+ | Server Locations: 65+ in 45+ countries | Trial Period: 30 days
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$9.95||0%||$9.95 at PIA|
|6 Months||$5.99||23$||$35.95 at PIA|
|12 Months||$2.85||49%||$39.95 at PIA|
Pros:
Cons:
PIA, previously called Private Internet Access, is a US-based VPN provider that helps secure your online identity. Before sending any data outbound from your session it automatically assigns a brand new IP address to you in order to keep you secure. It uses AES 256-bit encryption with a strict no-logging policy.
It offers more than 3,300 servers, which is more than many of the competitors, and spreads them across 50 different locations around the world. There are no data limits when using the service, which means you can keep your devices connected at all times without worrying that you'll use too much data daily.
The apps are super easy to use, and PIA has made them as easy as being able to click just a single button to get instantly connected to a server.
PIA VPN
While PIA may have lower server locations than most of the competition, it features zero data limits, 10 simultaneous connections, and easy-to-use apps, meaning it still remains a winner in our book.
ExpressVPN
Our top overall VPN pick for most people
Bottom Line: ExpressVPN offers the perfect balance of speed, reliability, customer service, and ease of use. It has features to protect everyone, and whether you are experienced with VPNs or this will be your first, you'll have no problem getting started with it.
ExpressVPN is so sure you'll like the service that it offers a 30-day full money-back guarantee should you want to cancel it.
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 3,000+ | Server Locations: 160 in 94 countries | Trial Period: 30 days
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$12.95||0%||$12.95 at ExpressVPN|
|6 Months||$9.99||23%||$59.95 at ExpressVPN|
|15 Months||$6.67||49%||$99.95 at ExpressVPN|
Pros:
- Servers in 160 locations
- 100 Mbps download speed
- Great customer support
- Works with almost every device & browser
Cons:
ExpressVPN combines the best of nearly all worlds and features when it comes to VPNs, but that comes at a price to you. It's definitely more expensive than the other services out there by about double each month, but it's also one of the most reliable offerings that we've tested with the fastest and most consistent speeds.
The service is easy to use and the mobile apps are super friendly. ExpressVPN offers 24/7 customer support so should you run into any issues, you can get them resolved pretty easily.
When it comes to downsides, there's not much to complain about. The service checks a lot of the key boxes for what most VPN users will care about and want, though it does charge a bit of a premium for it. The pricing structure is higher than some of the competition, but using our link you can actually save up to 49% on your first year of service, along with an extra three months free. Remember, ExpressVPN gives you a free 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you don't find it valuable or just can't figure it out, you can always get your money back with ease.
Be sure to read our full ExpressVPN review and get started for yourself below.
ExpressVPN
ExpressVPN is nearly unbeatable. This is our favorite paid VPN for providing speed, reliability, and outstanding customer service. It's certainly not the most affordable option, but if you're looking for the best of the best, ExpressVPN is it.
What should I look for in a cheap VPN?
When looking at the various best cheap VPN options, you'll want to look at a few different pieces of the puzzle to find the best offering. You'll want something that offers fast, consistent speeds and has great customer service. The whole "you get what you pay for" thing doesn't always hold true, especially with this list. The cheapest is one of the best here, and you can't go wrong with it.
Make sure that there are servers in lots of locations so that you can connect to the ones you need. Otherwise, give them a look, try some of them out, and see which one works out best for you.
When should you upgrade your VPN?
Moving from a free VPN to a cheap VPN is a great option for many people. Paid VPNs tend to offer improved features, but unfortunately cheap VPN plans aren't the best for everyone. You may notice that the plans don't offer enough data for you each month or that you need the ability to connect more devices at the same time than the plan offers. That's a good indicator that it's time to upgrade to something else.

- NordVPN is one of the most popular virtual private network service providers.
- One of its data centers was breached back in March of 2018, the company recently admitted.
- It claims no user activity logs or credentials were compromised.
A Finnish data center hosting NordVPN servers was breached early last year, the company admitted in a blog post earlier today.
It fingered a remote management system used by the data center provider as being responsible for the breach, a system that NordVPN claims it was entirely unaware of. Though it did not name the vendor, the VPN company has terminated its contract with the data center provider and has also shredded all the servers it was renting at the facility.
With regard to activity logs and user credentials, the company insisted that "none of [its] applications send user-created credentials for authentication," so these are secure. The company also makes a big point of its "no logging policy," meaning the former should not exist in the first place.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
Alongside this, the company stated that upon its discovery of the breach last year, it immediately commended an extensive audit of its entire network to ensure any other parts of its network were not similarly exposed. That, it explains, was the reason behind the delay in disclosing the breach till now.
However, as researchers cautioned users of the service this week, a (now expired) private security key was also exposed due to the breach, which could allow anyone to set up their own servers disguised as NordVPN.
"However, the key couldn't possibly have been used to decrypt the VPN traffic of any other server. On the same note, the only possible way to abuse website traffic was by performing a personalized and complicated MiTM attack to intercept a single connection that tried to access nordvpn.com," said the company's Daniel Markuson.
To keep its network secure in the future, the company is purportedly moving all of its servers to RAM, something that it says will be completed by next year. It's also launching an application security audit and a no-logs audit, and is preparing a bug bounty program to ensure the continued safety of its network.

NordVPN

When looking for a VPN service, you want one that is affordable but also maintains your privacy and doesn't slow down your connection. NordVPN gained a near-perfect score in its Windows Central review for its balance of price, varied feature set and performance. It has over 5,000 servers spread out over 62 countries, you can use it simultaneously on six devices, no user logs are kept, you can pay with anonymous cryptocurrencies, and there's no cap on bandwidth.

However, you may not know that linking up to your PC also lets you transfer files back and forth between your headset and computer. Doing so enables you to download films, music, pictures, game mods, and other content to your device. Below, we walk you through the process of transferring files to (and from) your Quest.
Products used in this guide
- Simple cable solution: AmazonBasics USB Type-C ($8 at Amazon)
- Wireless VR: Oculus Quest ($399 at Oculus)
How to connect your Quest to your PC
Connect your Quest to your PC with a USB-C cable. If your PC has its own USB-C port, you can use the USB-C cable that comes with the Quest itself. You will see the Quest pop up on your explorer.
- Put your Quest on your head.
- Within the Quest, you will be prompted whether you want your PC to be able to access your Quest files. Confirm yes.
On your Windows PC, you will now have access to explore your Quest as if it were a drive. Transfer any files to the appropriate folder by dragging and dropping them.
If you use a Mac
You will need to use a particular app to access your files, as Apple doesn't play nice with Android devices.
- Download the Android File Transfer app.
- Open the dmg file.
- Move Android File Transfer into your Applications folder.
- Connect your Quest to your Apple computer.
Open the application, which should detect and display your files as a drive.
If the "access files" prompt doesn't appear
Make sure your Quest isn't in developer mode, which can prevent the file transfer option from appearing. Unplug your Quest from your PC and try the following steps:
- Open your Oculus Quest mobile app.
- Open the Settings menu.
- Tap the picture of your connected Quest device.
- Select More Settings.
- Select Developer Mode.
- Untoggle the mode.
- Put on the Quest headset.
- Press and hold the power button, then select Restart.
- Reconnect your Quest to your PC.
Downloads and uploads
While connecting your Quest to your PC is a fairly simple task, it unlocks so much potential for the Quest. Once you have uploaded your pictures, movies, or podcasts to your Quest, you can easily access them on the device. You'll simply select the Library tab, click the Oculus Gallery app, and select Internal Storage. Now you'll be able to view whatever you've added to your Quest via the PC.
You can also upload your VR highlights from your Quest to your PC. Take a screenshot or record footage to show your friends or post online, and then simply connect to your PC and transfer the files from your Quest library to your desktop. Plus, having direct control over storage space makes it much easier to delete old files and free up space for new games and content.

Using one of the best ergonomic keyboards can relieve unnecessary strain on your wrists, shoulders, and posture caused by traditional keyboards. When it comes to ergonomic keyboard styles, there is a number to choose from. Some offer a curved split design, whereas some have a flat with a slight wave to the keys. Here are the best when it comes to ergonomic keyboards.
Best wireless ergonomic keyboard
- Silent yet accurate: Logitech Ergo K860 Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard
- Ride the wave: Logitech K350 Wireless Wave Keyboard
- Sculpting every word: Microsoft Sculpt
- Wireless choices: Kensington Pro Fit Ergo Wireless
- Clean and comfortable: Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard LXM-00001
- Triple dimension: Perixx Periboard 512
- For the accident prone: Kensington Pro Fit Ergonomic Wired Keyboard
- Night typer: Adesso Tru-Form 150
- Custom comfort: Kinesis Freestyle2 Ergonomic Keyboard
Silent yet accurate: Logitech Ergo K860 Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard
Where the Logitech K350 mentioned previously offers a small posture change to typing, the Ergo K860 has a wider split to the keys as well as an arch the overall board shape. Together with shallower scooped keys that have a quiet press to them, these features come together to offer a more serene typing experience. The wireless Ergo K860 is also part of the Logitech Unifying Receiver, so it uses the same adapter for your other compatible accessories.
Ride the wave: Logitech K350 Wireless Wave Keyboard
The Logitech K350 is an excellent option if you don't like a full split to the keys. The slight angle of the keyboard setup and the wrist rest provides enough of a posture change to add comfort to typing for long periods. You get some quick keys for media, window switching, and some are customizable to your needs. Since this wireless keyboard is part of the Logitech Unifying Receiver line, you can use the same adapter for your keyboard and compatible wireless mouse.
Sculpting every word: Microsoft Sculpt
The Sculpt's design is about more than just looking unique. This design helps create the most comfortable and natural typing position for your fingers and wrists. The domed shape of the keyboard is specifically done to reduce wrist pronation — less strain. Though there isn't a number pad built into the keyboard, a wireless one is included so you can position it where it's most comfortable.
Wireless choices: Kensington Pro Fit Ergo Wireless
Kensington's Pro-Fit Ergo keyboard brings a split keyboard design with a slight 3D shape to the overall board. With quick and quiet keys, typing on is as comfortable as it is non-distracting. Kensington also brought its spill-proof design to protect the keyboard from accidental spills. Another unique feature is the multiple wireless connectivity options. With a 2.4 GHz dongle connection or Bluetooth 4.0 LE, you can still use the keyboard even if you forget or lose the dongle.
Best wired ergonomic keyboard
Clean and comfortable: Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard LXM-00001
I've used a few different ergonomic keyboards, and since getting this one about a year ago, this is my favorite. The shape of the board and the keys' split are just right, not to mention the wonderful key travel you get while typing. The additional shortcut keys for media, calculator, Office 365, even the emoji button are all beneficial and save the need to reach for your mouse to launch those programs. Along with angle adjustments and the wrist rest, I can comfortably type for long periods.
Triple dimension: Perixx Periboard 512
Perixx may not be a super well-known brand, but the company makes some quality accessories that include the Periboard 512 ergonomic keyboard. The keyboard's 3D shape and the split key design aids in giving your hands and wrists a comfortable resting play while typing. The Periboard 512 includes seven quick keys for launching a browser window, media controls, and more.
For the accident prone: Kensington Pro Fit Ergonomic Wired Keyboard
With this keyboard from Kensington, you get a split keyboard with a slight slope to the board itself. The shallow style keys offer a short, quiet travel for quick typing. While you won't find any of the shortcut keys found on other models, you do get spill-proof keys. This not only can make general cleaning your keyboard easier, but it also protects against accidental spills.
Night typer: Adesso Tru-Form 150
If you prefer a dimmer workspace, you might like the Adesso Tru-Form 150. It offers a split keyboard design with backlit keys and a choice of red, green, or blue at the push of a button. Not only does this mean that you get posture correct typing, but also a unique look to the quiet type keys. There are twenty hotkeys for media controls, webpages, and more, offering easy access to frequently used computer functions.
Custom comfort: Kinesis Freestyle2 Ergonomic Keyboard
With a design that truly stands out from other keyboards, KINESIS Freestyle2 allows you to get the keys' angle and the most comfortable arm width while typing. By splitting the keyboard into two halves, you can spread them up to 9-inches apart and adjust the angle up to 15 degrees. There isn't a traditional number pad on this keyboard, but you can enable one and quick keys for common computer shortcuts using the function key.
Typing with comfort
As more and more time is spent on keyboards typing for work, school, and surfing the web for entertainment, having a keyboard that offers a comfortable typing experience is about more than just comfort at the moment. Proper posture is something that should be exercised as much as possible to ward off potential health issues that can be acquired over time.
While a keyboard isn't going to solve all potential posture problems, it is something that is an integral part of achieving proper posture, especially if you spend a significant amount of time typing away at your desk. If you want to lose the tangle of wires at your computer while typing in the most comfortable position, then the Logitech Ergo K860 Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard is an excellent choice. It offers a comfortable split to the keys and a slight arch to promote a more proper body position while typing.
If you prefer a hard-wired keyboard, then the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard LXM-00001 is the way to go. It brings a great typing experience with a middle of the road keyboard shape. Its shape isn't an extreme curve to the board or overly broad split to the keys. You get helpful, quick keys to gain shortcuts to various computer functions for an enjoyable and comfortable typing experience.

One of the main considerations when buying a hard drive for your NAS is long-term reliability.

These are the best long-lasting hard drives for your Synology NAS in 2020.Best Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Cases Android Central 2020
The best cases for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra need to balance protection and profile, style and substance, and do it all without breaking the bank. The Note 20 Ultra is one of the most cutting-edge phones on the market, but it's also one of the largest and heaviest phones in 2020. Combine that with the luxury price tag that Samsung demands, and you have a recipe for disaster if you dare take your new phone out into the world naked. Skip the public smartphone indecency and get yourself a great case. Here are the best Galaxy Note 20 Ultra cases to keep it like new for years to come.
- Slim and sublime: Ringke Air-S
- Rough and tumble: ArmadilloTek Vanguard Series
- Colorful coolness: Caseology Parallax
- Light-duty durability: OtterBox Symmetry Series
- Clearly rugged: i-Blason Ares
- Subdued and suave: Samsung Leather Cover
- Grippy and good: Spigen Liquid Air
- Carry it all: FYY RFID-Blocking Wallet
- Drop protection: UAG Civilian
- Lets kick it: ESR Kickstand
- Sturdy grip: Speck Presidio2 Grip
- Vibrant scratch-guard: Anccer Colorful Series
Slim and sublime: Ringke Air-S
If you don't want to bulk up your Note 20 Ultra but need to add some grip, the Air-S is a minimalist case that will give your fingers more purchase than expected while also guarding against scratches.
Rough and tumble: ArmadilloTek Vanguard Series
I have loved the Vanguard Series for the last couple generations of Galaxy phones because the color options go beyond the boring black and blue and the sturdy kickstand works in portrait mode as well as landscape.
Colorful coolness: Caseology Parallax
The Note 20 Ultra isn't getting that lovely Mystic Green color, but you can at least get a bit of that earthy glow with the Aqua Green version of the Parallax, or navy blue or burgundy if you prefer.
Light-duty durability: OtterBox Symmetry Series
OtterBox is better known for the ridiculously durable Defender Series, but I'm partial to the Symmetry because it's thinner, easier to get on and off the phone, and it usually comes in more attractive colors like this Cake Pop Pink.
Clearly rugged: i-Blason Ares
Named for the god of war, this two-stage clear case keeps the Note 20 Ultra safe while showing off that Samsung styling. The color options for the bumper and accents here are quite fetching as well, with Red and Purple in addition to the basic black.
Subdued and suave: Samsung Leather Cover
Samsung's first-party leather case remains the leather case to beat for yet another generation, but the color options this year are more earthy and sophisticated than previous years, with color choices of black, brown, and green.
Grippy and good: Spigen Liquid Air
While Spigen's Rugged Armor might be the more popular, the Liquid Air is so much more appealing, both in the hand with its deeper texturing and visually with that uniform look.
Carry it all: FYY RFID-Blocking Wallet
This functional and fashionable folio allows you to ditch the wallet and carry all your essentials together. The lining inside this leather folio disrupts RFID signals, keeping your cards from getting scanned by skimmers, and five colors are available.
Drop protection: UAG Civilian
Urban Armor Gear is long-known for its military-grade cases, and the Civilian keeps you covered while also sporting an understated look in either an Olive Green for those who wish the Ultra came in Mystic Green or my preferred Mallard Blue.
Lets kick it: ESR Kickstand
Being able to prop up the Note 20 Ultra while you're out and about is a wonderful addition, especially when you get it without being saddled with some huge bulky tank. It also adds an excellent grip.
Sturdy grip: Speck Presidio2 Grip
The best way to protect your Note 20 Ultra is to never let it slip out of your hands in the first place. Speck upgraded the Presidio case line for the Note 20 Ultra, so it should last longer, grip easier, and feel better in the hand.
Vibrant scratch-guard: Anccer Colorful Series
If you're determined to avoid adding any thickness to your Note 20 Ultra while guarding the glass back from scratches and slips, Anccer's Colorful Series can let you trade the bronze or black for bold blue, green, or red.
Show it off: Ringke Fusion
While the Fusion-X offers a bit more robust protection, it's much more aggressive look can put off a lot of users. The Fusion offers most of the same protection without betraying the look of the phone.
Feel the fabric: SQMCase Denim Patchwork
Fabric cases are fewer and further between these days, but this case features a flexible bumper around the sides and a two-tone textile feel around the back that simulates denim as well as leather.
Covert card carrier: Spigen Slim Armor CS
Goodness knows the back of the Note 20 Ultra is certainly big enough to hold a few cards, and this understated case from Spigen lets you carry them without being as obvious as other folio cases.
Shiny and sturdy: Ghostek Atomic
If you prefer your clear cases a little more robust and rugged, the Ghostek Atomic's multi-layer bumper should help it survive 12-foot drops. I also like the bold metallic accents around the edges.
Minimal majesty: Samsung Silicone Cover
Samsung's silicone cases are always perfectly color-matched to the Note models, and this year is no exception, offering white, black, and "brown", which is undoubtedly, unabashedly pink.
Wallet without bulk: GOOSPERY Card Holder
This unique card-concealing case is thinner than your usual folio fare, and it's not as obviously a wallet case because the entire back folds open like a secret door, and you can combine it with a credit card inside to convert into a kickstand.
What are the best cases for the Note 20 Ultra?
The Note 20 Ultra is a phone with a good bit of heft to it, so you need two things above all else in a case: you need grip and you need impact protection. If you still need your case to be slim while guarding your new flagship, the Ringke Air-S offers great grip and some cushioning while hugging the Note 20's every curve and not being as flashy and showboating. It's an understated look for a refined user.
If you need something more rugged to keep it safe, the Ghostek Atomic will let the Mystic Bronze shine through while that shiny bumper conceals the shock-absorbing gel that sits around the corners and the top/bottom edges. I adore the look of the bold red with the bronze, but the Iridescent version could mesh really well with the Mystic White.
Of course, there are a great many cases available in many styles for the Note 20 Ultra, and if you're looking for something a little more specific, we have dedicated roundups for heavy duty cases, leather cases, thin cases, clear cases, and wallet cases for the Note 20 Ultra, to help you narrow down your search more quickly.

- The Oculus Quest 2 does not support Oculus Go games.
- Oculus Consulting CTO John Carmack states that he "lost the internal debate over backwards compatibility."
- Facebook did not make it clear that Oculus Go games would not be supported.
The Oculus Quest 2 does not support Oculus Go games. That news was dropped by Oculus Consulting CTO John Carmack on Twitter recently when asked about trying to get Oculus Go games to work on the Oculus Quest. Until Carmack's tweet, Facebook had not given any indication that Oculus Go games would not work on the Oculus Quest.
On the original Oculus Quest, dozens of Oculus Go games were supported. While you couldn't play every Oculus Go game on the Oculus Quest, there was a notable library of games available through backwards compatibility.
"I totally lost the internal debate over backwards compatibility," said Carmack on Twitter.
Backwards compatibility is a hot topic amongst gamers, including fervent debates about how many generations of games should be supported on devices. It's likely that demand for Oculus Go and GearVR games on the Oculus Quest 2 was low, or Facebook may have gone in another direction.

The Oculus Quest 2 is the direct successor to the Oculus Quest, and in some ways is the successor to the Oculus Rift S. If the Oculus Quest 2 supported some GearVR and Oculus Go games, you would have been able to play games from every generation of untethered Oculus devices on a single piece of hardware. Instead, if you want to play games from the Oculus Go or GearVr, you'll have to grab an older headset.

How to cast your Oculus Quest from your phone
Casting an Oculus Quest 2 or Oculus Quest to a Chromecast allows you to share your VR experience with friends and family in a living room. Games like Beat Saber being cast to a TV can take over a room and create an energetic party atmosphere. Thanks to a recent update, the Oculus Quest can cast to a wide range of devices, including the Chromecast with Google TV and Chromecast 3rd Generation.
- Open the Oculus app on iOS or Android.
- Tap the cast icon in the upper right-hand corner (right next to the bell icon).
- Select your Oculus Quest (any supported devices will show up on this list).
- Select Your Chromecast device in the "Cast To" menu.
- Tap start.
Once you've connected, the Oculus Quest will cast to your TV through your Chromecast device. There are some apps that block casting, but several big titles like Beat Saber support it.
How to cast your Oculus Quest from your headset
Once your Oculus Quest is running version 10.0 or later, you can initiate casting directly from the headset. You don't need to use your phone to cast your Oculus Quest to a device like a Chromecast or Chromecast TV.
- Go to the Oculus Quest Home screen on your headset.
- Select Sharing.
- Select Cast.
Select the Device that you want to cast to.
- Select Next.
- You may need to select Start Casting on your target device depending on what device you're casting to.
Being able to cast to a device directly from the headset is a nice addition. The more the Oculus Quest can run vindependently, the better.
How to cast your Oculus Quest to a phone
While the Oculus Quest can cast to a TV, it also has the handy ability to cast to a phone. This is a nice option for anyone who doesn't have a supported Chromecast device or only wants to share their Oculus Quest with one device.
The steps for this are practically identical to casting to a Chromecast. You simply select "This Phone" instead of any other device as a casting target. Make sure that your phone and your Oculus Quest are on the same wireless network before starting this process.
- Open the Oculus app.
- Tap the cast icon in the upper right-hand corner (right next to the bell icon).
- Select your Oculus Quest (any supported devices will show up on this list).
- Select This Phone in the "Cast To" menu.
- Tap start.

Chromecast with Google TV
The fourth generation of the Google Chromecast is a huge upgrade over its predecessors thanks to the new Google TV interface, 4K support, and a well-designed remote for an impressively low price. It's also a nice way to cast your Oculus Quest 2 or Oculus Quest to a TV.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!The Oculus Quest has built-in sensors that can make any area into a VR space. Oculus' Guardian system lets you set up a boundary in any room or area that you'd like, and the device sets up a virtual grid to ensure that you stay in your secure area. But if you drew an area wrong, made changes to the area, or are setting up your Oculus Quest in a new space, you'll need to set or reset your boundaries. Fortunately, Oculus made this incredibly easy.
Products used in this guide
- Wireless VR fun: Oculus Quest ($399 at Amazon)
How to set up a roomscale boundary
One of the Oculus Quest's best features is that you can map out a room, and the headset can remember the boundaries. This is referred to as "roomscale" and is the ideal setup for most VR games. You draw a map of the boundaries, making a border that can be bent around items like house plants and sofas. The Oculus Quest then creates a virtual grid that turns red if you get too close. If you pop your head out of the roomscale boundary, the device's cameras allow you to see the outside world.
- Press the home button on your Oculus Touch Controller.
Point your controller at Roomscale and pull the trigger.
- Set the level of the floor by lightly tapping your controller to the floor.
- Point your controller at confirm and pull the trigger.
- Draw the boundary by holding the trigger down and drawing the area you'd like to use.
- Point your controller at confirm and pull the trigger.
- Point your controller at confirm and pull the trigger one last time to complete the process.
The passthrough cameras and Touch Controllers make it easy to draw a boundary. You can always tweak these in the future if you add or remove something to your play area.
How to set up a stationary boundary
Stationary boundaries are for when you don't have enough room to use roomscale boundaries. You should set up a stationary boundary if you plan on standing still or remaining seated. This setup won't work with some games that require you to move around, but it is fine for watching movies and playing some stationary games. The Oculus Quest sets up a virtual cylinder around you that turns red if you get too close to the edge. Like roomscale boundaries, if you pop your head out of the grid, you can see the real world through passthrough cameras.
- Press the home button on your Oculus Touch Controller.
- Point your controller at the stationary and pull the trigger.
- Make sure there are no obstructions in the grid that is formed.
- Point your controller at confirm and pull the trigger.
How to spot objects in your playspace
In Oculus firmware version 17 and beyond, your Oculus Quest can detect objects that appear in your playspace. If you have an area scanned and then try to play in it while a new object is in the area, the Oculus Quest will let you know about it. You can then redraw your playspace or move the object and continue. You can read more about the feature here.

Facebook officially announced the Oculus Quest at Facebook Connect on September 16, 2020.
The Oculus Quest 2 represents a major step forward for wireless VR, as we've pointed out in our Oculus Quest 2 review.

Facebook is selling several official accessories for the Oculus Quest 2 alongside their newest VR system. The Oculus Quest 2 ships with cloth velcro straps, but you can purchase a more rigid Quest 2 Elite Strap for $50. That one features a rigid plastic design similar to the Oculus Rift S, but with a cushy cranial pad at the back for enhanced comfort. Facebook is also upping its game by selling a Quest 2 Elite Strap with an extra battery inside to help with those long VR gaming sessions and double the Quest 2's battery life.
Speaking of intense gaming sessions, Facebook also offers an official Fit Pack that comes with two face pads to change out when things get extra sweaty (like during the new Beat Saber multiplayer mode). And when you want to take the Oculus Quest 2 on the go, there's a handy carrying case for safely packing the whole thing away.

The Oculus Quest allows you to play VR games without requiring a PC, phone, or external sensors. Here's every game you can buy or download for free!Best answer: No. As of Sept. 2020, you can no longer remove your Facebook account from an Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2. In fact, you'll need it to access a lot of features.
- A new level of wireless VR: Oculus Quest 2 (From $300 at Amazon)
- Keep it protected: Oculus Quest 2 travel case ($49 at Amazon)
- Most comfortable headset ever: Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap ($49 at Amazon)
Forever entwined
While you could previously use a Facebook account or an Oculus account, you can no longer remove a Facebook account from Oculus Quest. Facebook announced the change in August 2020. If you preordered an Oculus Quest 2, just be aware that you'll need to sign in with your Facebook account and won't have any other options.
Oculus players that are still using an Oculus account have the option to merge their Oculus account with their Facebook account if they want. Just remember to use a legitimate Facebook account with your real name and not a fake account, as Oculus stated that it will ban players who use false identities.
Once you merge your Oculus account with your Facebook account, there's no going back. Facebook says it will not require existing Oculus players to merge their accounts, but players might have issues beginning January 2023 if they do not, as Facebook is continuing to merge Oculus services with Facebook services.
A better way to play
The Oculus Quest 2 is a huge leap over the original Oculus Quest in every way. From the lighter and smaller design to the new, more comfortable head straps and face pads, the Oculus Quest 2 is designed for a more enjoyable experience. It's also got more ergonomic controllers with a better button design, better haptic feedback, and longer battery life.
If that wasn't enough, the Oculus Quest 2 features a processor that's over three generations newer than the one found in the Oculus Quest. It's also got a display that sports 50% more pixels than the original, and enough horsepower to add additional detail to all your favorite games.

This kind of power and convenience isn't cheap, but it may just be worth it to you.

We spent a few weeks with the LG Stylo 6, and think that despite some significant shortcomings, it just might be the right phone, at the right price, for the right consumer.

TiVo Stream 4K review: Simplify your streaming for just $50

At its fall 2020 event, Amazon unveiled an entirely new design for its Echo smart speaker lineup, featuring a soft, spherical design on the standard Echo (4th Gen) and the three flavors of Echo Dot (4th Gen). We took a look at the Echo Dot with Clock (4th Gen) and Echo Dot (4th Gen) to see how much they've improved over the previous generation and let you know if we think you should buy them, and if so, which one you should go for.

Review: The Atom XL is small, rugged, and a chore to use
Small phones are rare and so are rugged phones, so to find that combo in a single affordable device is near unicorn status. The Atom XL from Unihertz offers some great features focused on a rugged life, however, the company forgot to build in a decent camera or display for outdoor lighting.

Review: ECOVACS Deebot OZMO U2 Pro is perfect for tackling pesky pet hair
ECOVACS recently released the Deebot OZMO U2 Pro. But is this a robot vacuum worthy of purchasing?For anyone who's used to working in a standard office with annoying coworkers in the cubicle next door and a water cooler to go chit chat at when you need to stretch your legs, working from home may seem like one of those Monkey's Paw wishes. It's great at first, but then come distractions, and loneliness, and a completely warped sense of time. Believe me, I know. I've been there.
It's an adjustment I had to make 18 months ago when I came on full-time at Android Central, and while it'll never be perfect, there are plenty of tools out there that can help you stay focused, productive, and most importantly — sane.
Put your Bluetooth speaker across the room
While active noise-canceling headphones can help you block out the giants living in the unit upstairs, you probably don't want to wear headphones all day every day when you're the only one home. When pairing up and playing music from a Bluetooth speaker, though, resist the urge to put the speaker right next to you or your computer.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
Putting the speaker nearby increases the likelihood of listening at too high a volume, especially when trying to block out noise from the street or your neighbors. When the sound of your music is close, you also have more of a tendency to focus on it, whereas setting it across from your desk and letting the sound fill your makeshift office is easier to keep it in the background.
If you're looking for good "background" music to get you through the day if your usual music pulls you out of your work too often, take a page from the experts. Theme parks like Disneyland and Universal build area music to help immerse guests it their worlds without drawing too much attention to themselves, and whether you need something graceful, ethereal, magical, retro-futuristic, or just plain nostalgic, there's an area loop out there for everyone. There are also a few loops that are great for naps if you need something to calm you down from a particularly manic day.
Drop the beat
Tronsmart Force Bluetooth speaker
We threw this little brick four stories into a pool, and it's still kicking! FOUR STORIES!! It's also got NFC for easy pairing and charges via Power Delivery.
Activity is key
Get up once one every 1-2 hours
I know that when you get into a groove, we generally just want to get a task done and be done with it, but getting up and just walking from one end of the house to the other, refilling your water, and petting the cat can be very useful. It helps keep your body from cramping up, the activity helps your mind avoid getting stuck in a rut, and the more active you stay while in isolation, the better the chances are of you keeping healthy and happy.
My breaks usually consist of me getting up and dancing along to a song or two that come up in my YouTube Music mixtape, but doing a few quick lunges, planks, or sit-ups can help you avoid feeling cooped up and renew your energy so you can keep chugging along with your work. If you have a Nintendo Switch, Ring Fit can be a good 20-minute workout break.
If you're the type to get sucked into your research — or Reddit while you were supposed to be doing research — consider grabbing yourself a smartwatch. My Samsung Galaxy Watch Active reminds me to get up if it notices that I haven't stood up in an hour.
Stay active
Samsung Galaxy Watch Active
This watch has practically everything the newer Galaxy Watch Active 2 has for $100 less, and if you need encouragement to keep active and healthy, this is your best-looking affordable option.
Disney won't distract if you want the TV on
I'll confess, there are times that just having music on isn't as helpful as having on the original background noise of the American living room: the TV. TVs and the plethora of streaming services available on them can be very, very handy while you're trying to get work done, but there are a couple of rules you'll generally want to follow:
- Reruns only. If you start a show you've never watched before, chances are either the show absolutely sucks or it's going to suck you in and work will grind to a halt. You want something where you already know what happens, has some good one-liners or gags to help keep your spirits up, and where when you tune out the film, you won't be lost or completely pulled out of your work when a big scene cuts through the fog.
- The longer, the better. I honestly prefer to rewatch my favorite movies when working because 1.5-2 hours is a good block of time between snack/exercise breaks, and that block of time still allows me to get a good amount of work done either researching, writing, or updating. "Hour-long" episodes are okay for busy work so long as autoplay is on and you're mostly tuning them out, but "half-hour" episodes are only 22 minutes, and those are a big rapid-fire for background noise since you'll get credits and main theme every 20 minutes.
- Listen, don't watch. When trying to figure out what show or film you might want to work through, my general rule of thumb is that if I can follow what's going on with my eyes closed, it's an excellent film to work through. The TV screen is only there for me to look at when I lose my train of thought or need a momentary break to let my brain figure out a roadblock.
If you're home with the kids — or are just a child of the 90s, like me — Disney movies are typically pretty great to have on as background noise. There's a song about every half hour, there's usually about three jokes/quotes a scene adults will appreciate more than the kids, and as a bonus, you can ask your kids if you tune out and miss anything important.
We need a little magic
Disney+
Whether you need to entertain a house full of bored kiddos or you just need a happy little taste of nostalgia, Disney+ has all your old favorites and new hits like Frozen 2 and The Mandalorian.
Drink early and often
Just because you're not running around an actual office building doesn't mean you don't need to stay properly watered. I know that being at home, the temptation to grab a Coke out of the fridge instead of water is going to be strong, but being cooped up at home, water is better for you and should help you avoid getting jittery the way the Coke I just finished is making me feel.
Water is a beautiful necessity of life, and while room temperature water doesn't always taste the greatest, ice cold water is amazing (except for the fact that it tends to drip condensation all over your desk). This is why insulated tumblers like YETI and RTIC have been very, very popular over the last few years.
I supplement my RTIC with a collection of Disney Parks insulated souvenir mugs — because, really, why not add some cuteness to my day? — but YETI and RTIC insulated metal tumblers will keep drinks cold far, far longer. And you can always decorate them with some stickers or decals if you want to add some personality to it.
Keep cool under pressure
YETI Rambler 30 oz
This sturdy, Texas-born tumbler comes in over twenty colors, can hold a good amount of ice-water — or ice-Gatorade, should you need electrolytes — and shouldn't leave water rings all over your desk.
Keep three snack types nearby at all times
Snacks are a vital part of work no matter where you are — I had a whole cooler dedicated to my snacks in my control room at the TV station — because you're not you when you're hungry, and your work will suffer if your concentration and your blood sugar tank while working. Cravings come and go, but there are three snack types that you absolutely must have at all times:
- Sweet: Sometimes you need a quick hit of energy, and that's when it's time to give in to the siren song of sugar. Graham cracker snacks and chocolate-chip cookies (fresh-baked, since you're stuck at home) are great options, but I also keep a medium jar of Runts on a shelf near my workspace so I can pop a couple if I just need a quick hit while I finish an article.
- Salty: Pretzels are a frequent snack for me because the combination of crunchy and salty is addictive, and that's because salt is something that our body craves just like sugar. And like sugar, a little salt is good, but you won't want to overdo it.
- Healthy: Remember that we're all stuck in here because we're trying to not get sick? Healthy snacks like fresh fruit, peanut butter crackers, or maybe a little jerky for protein will help fill you up more than chips and candy, and they'll help you keep up on the nutrients your bods needs.
By having these close by, it's easy to quickly grab the snack you need and get back to work instead of wandering into the kitchen, poking around looking for what you actually have to eat, what would sate your craving, and then getting distracted doing the dishes, making a grocery list, or getting an early start on dinner.
Bring your own jar
Wonka Runts (5 lbs)
This is my favorite shelf-stable hard candy. The flavors are yummy, it's easy to suck on or crunch depending on my mood, and it's easy to scoop some into an Altoids tin for on-the-go emergency sugar.
Set reminders for meals — really
When you finally get in a groove while working from home, it's very easy to lose track of time and forget to stop for meals since there's no mass exodus from the office at 5-7 PM. I am absolutely horrible about forgetting meals, which is bad because when you forget to eat, you tend to be a distracted mess instead of a focused machine.
So, since I have several smart speakers throughout my home, I set a Google Assistant Routine to run shortly after 1 PM so that if I'm reminded to eat if I haven't already — and reminded to take another quick break if I ate lunch early.
Google Assistant/Alexa Routines can speak out a reminder for you, turn on the lights in case you don't hear it over the music in your headphones, and hundreds more fun things. My lunch routine turns on the living room lights, my dinner routine dims the living room lights, and my bedtime routine turns the lights off, which has been quite helpful in keeping me fed and happy when days and days of isolation at home start making me a little bit loopy.
Google Nest Mini ($50 at Best Buy)
Get all the benefits of Google Assistant for controlling your smart home, including routines, in a compact package that fits in any home office.
Echo Dot with Clock ($60 at Amazon)
Having an easy-to-see clock on the front is really, really useful, so if you're more of an Alexa fan, this is the smart speaker for you.
LIFX Mini Color ($37 at Amazon)
You don't need a hub to control LIFX bulbs via Assistant/Alexa/Cortana, and the smaller frame helps it fit in a wider array of lamps and ceiling fixtures.
What helps you work from home?
I know that there are tons of other items that can be used to elevate the work from home experience — my Uniqlo Disney wearable blanket was an absolute godsend during Black Friday, but they're completely sold out — but I'm always looking for more. I still need a worthy lap desk to replace the discontinued Brookstone model I left in Texas, and while my IKEA Standing Desk has served me very well, I know sitting on my reupholstered bar stools is terrible for my back.
So, what are you using right now that works? What are you hoping to replace or augment as you get used to the glorious burden of building a proper work-from-home setup?

In the smartphone space, it could be used to reference companies cheating on benchmark scores, the iPhone 6's Bendgate, or one of OnePlus's hilariously bad invite campaigns from back in the day.
However, there's one controversy that stands out above all of these — the Samsung Galaxy Note 7.
The Note 7 was supposed to be one of the very best phones of 2016, but instead, it ended up being a complete and utter failure.
This isn't a device we talk about that much anymore, but if you're curious as to where the Galaxy Note 7 stands in 2020, you're in the right place. Here's everything you need to know about the phone.

Samsung Galaxy Note 10+
It's just so darn good
The price tag of the Galaxy Note 10+ certainly isn't for everyone, but if you can afford it, you're getting one of the most powerful and capable Android phones money can buy. The Note 10+ has a gorgeous display, fast performance, great cameras, and all of the utility that comes with the S Pen.
What do I need to know about the Galaxy Note 7?
Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 7 in August 2016, and at the time, there was a lot riding on the phone. The Note 5 before it was a controversial device for longtime Note fans, as it was the first in the series to ditch a removable battery and expandable storage — two longtime staples of the Note series. The Note 7 continued the trend of no removable battery, but it brought back expandable storage and further refined the Note formula to create for one damn impressive device.
Unfortunately, excitement and praise for the Galaxy Note 7 were short-lived.
Following worldwide reports of battery failures and fires with the Galaxy Note 7 in early September 2016 — including nearly 100 cases in the U.S. alone — Samsung and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) announced a complete official recall of all Galaxy Note 7s in the United States. Similar movements were made in Canada, as well as throughout Europe and Asia. Regions in which the Note 7 had yet to launch simply postponed shipments of phones.
Weeks later, with the recall in full swing and old Note 7s being replaced by hundreds of thousands of new "safe" models, reports started to arise of the same exact failures happening with these replacement phones. With consumers quickly losing faith in the Note 7, carriers in early October voluntarily offered free returns and exchanges for all Note 7s, and eventually stopped selling the phone altogether.
On October 10, 2016, Samsung issued a statement that it was halting sales of the Galaxy Note 7 globally and encouraged consumers to return their Galaxy Note 7 to where they bought it from. Shortly after, Samsung officially canceled the phone. In the U.S., authorities issued a second recall, that banned sales of the Note 7, and forbid passengers from bringing it on board airplanes. Major airlines banned the use of the phone while on planes, shortly followed by the FAA officially banning it on all flights. If you flew anytime in 2016 or 2017, you probably heard the attendant remind you that the Note 7 wasn't allowed on your flight.
On December 9, 2016, Samsung pushed an update to Note 7s in the U.S. that all but bricked the phones — limiting battery capacity and functionality when not plugged in. At that time, some 125,000 phones still remained in the wild.
Samsung kinda sorta brought the Note 7 back in July 2017, taking the form of the Galaxy Note Fan Edition (also referred to as the Note FE). The phone shared many of the same specs as the Note 7, with the biggest difference being the smaller battery (3,200 mAh vs. 3,500 mAh). The Note FE launched in South Korea, but it never made its way to the United States or any other region.
During this time, things looked pretty bleak for Samsung. Putting customers' lives in danger not once, but twice, made it hard to see a future where we'd be able to completely move on and forget. However, that's exactly what happened.
The Galaxy S8 was released just a few months after the Note 7 debacle in March 2017, and it went on to be one of the best phones of the year. The same goes for the Galaxy Note 8, which despite a small battery (for obvious reasons), offered every other spec and feature you could ask for in an Android flagship.
There are probably some people out there that still hold a grudge against Samsung for everything that happened, but by and large, the Note 7 ended up being nothing more than a bump in the road.
From the Editor's Desk: Remember the Galaxy Note 7?
What kind of reviews did the Note 7 get?
Prior to the phone exploding on folks, the Note 7 received high praise from the tech community. We didn't have a rating system in place at AC in 2016, but we called the Note 7 the "biggest and best" Android phone of the time while hailing its excellent hardware, display, and camera.
Battery issues aside, Samsung got a lot right with the Galaxy Note 7. It was an evolution of the radical redesign introduced by the Note 5 in 2015, bringing back the microSD slot and offering the best specs the market had to offer at the time.
It was big, expensive, and Samsung bloatware was a very real thing, but in an alternate timeline, the Note 7 was one of the best phones Samsung ever released.
Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review: Biggest and best
What's the newest Note that I can buy?
Should you find yourself shopping for a Galaxy Note device in 2020, the latest options available to you are the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+.
The Note 10 family was launched in August 2019, meaning they're still perfectly relevant and capable devices. You'll find powerful performance, gorgeous displays, and reliable cameras.
As for which one you should choose, it depends on what kind of phone you're looking for. The regular Note 10 ditches microSD card support (something the Note 10+ has), but it's one of the most manageable sizes we've ever seen for a Note device. Note phones tend to be some of the biggest on the market, so it's refreshing to have something that gives you the full Note experience but without the massive size for folks that don't like it.
The Note 10+ is the typical Note we've come to expect year after year, touting a large 6.8-inch display and longer battery life and faster-wired charging compared to the smaller Note 10.

Should I wait for the Note 20 instead?
You can't go wrong buying the Note 10 or Note 10+, but unless you absolutely need a new phone this very minute, it might be worth it to wait and see what Samsung does with the upcoming Galaxy Note 20.
Rumor has it that Samsung will once again launch two models, including the Note 20 and Note 20+. We're expecting big upgrades for the display and cameras, but as always, nothing is official until the phones are actually announced by Samsung. Availability remains uncertain given the current pandemic that's sweeping the planet, but we're anticipating a release at some point in Q3 or Q4 2020.

New technology works best when everyone commits to it — 2020 has been the year everyone is committing to 5G connectivity which means you'll want to find the best 5G phones to future-proof yourself. A ton of support from carriers and smartphone companies is going to flood the market with 5G-capable phones this year. 5G isn't everywhere (yet), but if you live in a place with a 5G network, these are the best 5G phones you can buy.
- Best 5G Phone Overall: Samsung Galaxy S20+
- Flagship Killer: OnePlus 8 Pro
- Best Mid-range 5G Phone: Samsung Galaxy S20 FE
- Best 5G Phone on a Budget: Samsung Galaxy A71 5G
- Best with an S Pen: Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra

- Best Foldable 5G Phone: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2
- Best for Verizon: Motorola Edge+
- Best International 5G Phone: OnePlus Nord
- Best for Pixel fans: Pixel 5
Best 5G Phone Overall: Samsung Galaxy S20+
You used to have to buy a specific Galaxy S model that had 5G, but now with the S20 series every phone has 5G, so our top 5G recommendation is the same as our overall recommendation: the Galaxy S20+. The S20+ is a great all-around phone, with a display that has a super-smooth 120Hz refresh rate, a large 4500mAh battery, tons of RAM, and a new Snapdragon 865 processor.
Samsung made big moves this year with its cameras, which were a weak spot in the last generation. The new sensors are all larger, letting in more light and taking dramatically better low-light photos. It's not quite on the level of the Pixel 4 XL, but this is a big step up for Samsung and is no longer a shortcoming. You also get capable zooming up to 5X, while keeping an ultra-wide camera for more shooting variety.
The Galaxy S20+ supports 5G on all U.S. carriers, both Sub-6 and mmWave, even when you buy the unlocked model, and that makes it incredibly well-suited to stick with you for a long time.
Pros:
- Best-in-class display
- Good battery life
- Exceptional performance
- Great all-around cameras
- 5G for all carriers, even unlocked
Cons:
- Expensive for 128GB of storage
- Camera zoom much weaker than S20 Ultra
- Slow fingerprint sensor
- No headphone jack
Best 5G Phone Overall
Samsung Galaxy S20+
Samsung's excellent all-rounder has 5G and few compromises
The S20+ has a great screen, top-end specs, a strong array of cameras and feature-packed software. And you get 5G on any carrier.
Flagship Killer: OnePlus 8 Pro
The OnePlus 8 Pro is impressive and well-designed as any high-end smartphone can be. If you know anything about OnePlus phones, you'll be happy to know it doesn't upend the traditional OnePlus formula. Instead, it extends it to its logical place in the world of 2020 flagships with more features and a higher price.
The hardware goes toe-to-toe with any phone out there, and it's punctuated by the best display OnePlus has ever used. It's bright, colorful and has a 120Hz refresh rate. Inside, there are exceptional specs, and that leads to amazing performance thanks to the super-smooth OxygenOS software — it's just a joy to use.
The 8 Pro also brings the best cameras yet to a OnePlus phone, with a new main sensor that steps up its game to a true flagship level. The entire camera experience is a small step behind the likes of the Galaxy S20+, but then again it's also a little less expensive. That's really where the 8 Pro fits in. It's a true flagship experience top to bottom, for just a bit less money than the traditional players with big brand names.
When you're focused on 5G, the one shortcoming here is network compatibility. The OnePlus 8 Pro doesn't support mmWave 5G at all, so you can't use it on Verizon's 5G network nor most of AT&T's network. On T-Mobile you'll get access to a majority of its 5G network, since it's built on Sub-6 technology, but even there you miss out on its up-and-coming mmWave expansion.
Pros:
- Large, beautiful 120Hz display
- Greatly improved main and wide-angle cameras
- Excellent battery life
- OxygenOS is best-in-class Android software
- Wireless charging and IP68 rating
Cons:
- Much more expensive than before
- 5G limited to T-Mobile and some of AT&T
- Telephoto camera isn't good
- Some software and camera bugs still present
Flagship Killer
OnePlus 8 Pro
A great overall phone, but one that comes up short in 5G compatibility
The OnePlus 8 Pro is an impressive and well-designed phone that doesn't upend the traditional OnePlus formula.
Best Mid-range 5G Phone: Samsung Galaxy S20 FE
There are a lot of exciting options to choose from that have launched in the second half of 2020. Samsung may have outshined all of them with the Galaxy S20 FE, which should have been available when the rest of the S20 lineup launched. Samsung offers all of the best features and specs from the S20 while finally providing a flat-screened device that users have been wanting for some time. In a world where curved displays look good, they struggle with palm detection, ending up with more accidental touches than anything else
Samsung also upped the ante by integrating the 120Hz refresh rate, so everything you do on the S20 FE looks smooth. Considering the price of the S20 FE, you figure that Samsung had to cut corners somewhere, and that's where the plastic material comes in. But this can help alleviate the worry of cracking the back glass panel if accidentally dropped, along with providing six fun and different colors to choose from.
As for 5G connectivity, the Galaxy S20 FE features Sub-6 GHz for most users, but those who want to use 5G on Verizon will be a bit disappointed. Since Verizon relies on Ultra Wideband (mmWave), the standard unlocked version found on Amazon or Best Buy won't feature this. Instead, you'll have to go to Verizon directly in order to get the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G UW model.
We're also still scratching our heads as to why Samsung ships a 15W charger in the box. The Galaxy S20 FE is capable of charging at speeds up to 25W, but you'll have to come out of pocket for a compatible charger. The 1080p resolution on this 6.5-inch display may not look the greatest at all times, but the 120Hz refresh rate and improved battery life will make up for it.
Pros:
- 120Hz flat display
- Six colors to choose from
- Plastic build is refreshing
- Triple camera system
- 5G connectivity for all carriers
Cons:
- Ships with a 15W charger
- 1080p display
- No headphone jack
- mmWave version only available through Verizon

Best 5G Phone on a Budget: Samsung Galaxy A71 5G
When you look at the sheer number of phones that Samsung releases, it's easy to get confused quickly. That is, with the exception of a few of the best Samsung phones, such as the Galaxy A71 5G. This device is the successor to the Galaxy A71, and provides support for both Sub 6 and mmWave 5G connectivity.
As for what the Galaxy A71 5G provides, you'll get a quad camera system on the rear, along with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage. Samsung already makes some of the best displays in the business, and the company made sure to include a darn good one thanks to the 6.7-inch AMOLED screen. You also won't have to worry about those accidental palm touches, as this is one of the few great Samsung devices that actually sports a flat display instead of a curved one.
Battery life will also be of no concern with the Galaxy A71 5G with the included 4,500mAh cell and fast charging available. You'll only begin running into issues when it comes to the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. As is the case with many of Samsung's devices, the fingerprint scanner is inconsistent and not as reliable as the competition.
Pros:
- Four rear cameras
- 5G and excellent specs for the money
- Excellent battery life
- Sleek and solid hardware
Cons:

A cheaper alternative to the flagship 5G handsets

Best with an S Pen: Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
When you look at the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and compare it to just about every other phone on the market, there really isn't a comparison. Samsung has included every feature you could think of, save for a foldable display (hello Z Fold 2). There's the beautiful 6.9-inch Super AMOLED display, complete with the Adaptive 120Hz refresh rate and a 1440p resolution.
Despite the huge camera module, these are some of the best cameras you can find on a smartphone today. Samsung even opted to leave out the 100X Space Zoom that was launched with the S20 Ultra, and honestly it's for the better. These cameras perform so well on a consistent basis that you likely won't want to even pick up your traditional camera —unless you're taking pictures of the Note 20 Ultra.
The star of the show with the Galaxy Note 20 is the S Pen, which has been moved to the left-side but is more feature-packed than ever. Being able to control your device without getting fingerprints on the screen is a game-changer along with the "normal" features like taking notes when the screen is turned off and clicking the button to snap a picture.
Since Samsung is seemingly hard-pressed to stick with its curved displays, you may have to worry about the palm rejection. The company continues to struggle with this, and the issues have remained with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. We also are waiting to see if Samsung will move the fingerprint scanner to the Power Button, as the ultrasonic scanner just doesn't get the job done well enough on a consistent basis.

Almost the biggest 5G-capable phone you can get
The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the best 5G-capable phone you can with an S Pen, and is one of the best overall.
Best for Dual Screens: LG Velvet
If you're not into the whole "foldable" scene, or don't want to choose between buying a used car or a smartphone, the LG Velvet is a great compromise. It seems LG is done chasing Samsung for being the best Android phone and is taking a different approach to the market. Enter detachable screens.
The Velvet itself is a move away from the traditional design that we've seen LG attempt in years past. With the Velvet, you'll find an extremely ergonomic design with curves in all of the right places, along with a water-drop layout for the rear cameras. Those wanting to slap on a secondary display can get the feeling of a book, although you'll have to spend a few extra bucks to get one. Nonetheless, this combination makes for a great mid-to-upper range option.
If you're looking at the Velvet solely for camera performance, you'll come away disappointed. It's not that the Velvet is bad, but LG's post-processing software adds on too much sharpening, and almost making your pictures look fake altogether.
On the 5G front, you'll find that there are actually three different versions of the Velvet. The Verizon edition is $100 more and features mmWave for 5G connectivity, while the AT&T and T-Mobile versions support the more-traditional sub-6GHz network compatibility. But the twist here is that while the Verizon and AT&T versions sport Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G, the T-Mobile variant alone sports the MediaTek Dimensity 1000C chipset. There should not be much of a performance difference, but it's rather questionable to see this change, causing some potential confusion.

If you want two screens without the fold, the Velvet is great
The LG Velvet provides a gorgeous design, middling specs, but also comes in several different versions in the same body.
Best Foldable 5G Phone: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2
Where does one begin when it comes to talking about the Galaxy Z Fold 2? It's almost as if the original Galaxy Fold is from a different device lineup altogether, as the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is incredible from every perspective. The Cover Screen fills up almost every inch of the front, and unfolding it provides you with a 7.2-inch tablet that is much more useful than you may think.
The camera system may not be exactly on par with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but it is still better than a lot of other smartphones. While Google is still trying to figure out how to handle foldable devices, Samsung has tweaked its software just enough to make sure that you can take full advantage of those apps. From including the Snapdragon 865+ paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage, along with all-day battery AND 5G connectivity, this is the Ferrari of smartphones.
Even with its exorbitant price tag, Samsung still opted to cut a few corners with the Z Fold 2. Notably, there is no official IP rating for water or dust resistance. Your phone will be able to handle a bit of rain, but that's about it and you'll want to wipe it down as soon as you can. While the Z Fold 2 sports 256GB of onboard storage, that may not be enough for some but that's just "too bad" as you won't be able to use one of the best microSD cards with this bad boy.
Pros:
- Incredible hardware design
- The best specs in a smartphone
- Triple camera setup
- Software has been tweaked to accommodate foldable display
Cons:

Best for Verizon: Motorola Edge+
Motorola has had its fair share of ups and downs over the years when it comes to providing one of the best Android phones. With the Motorola Edge+, the company was hoping to get back on the map with a complete re-design thanks to the waterfall display acccompanied by a 90Hz refresh rate.
This redesign provides a more narrow body, making it easier to use with one hand. One-handed usage is something that many smartphone makers have seemingly come to ignore as phones continue to get more wide. Nonetheless, Motorola paired the new design with flagship specs courtesy of the Snapdragon 865 chipset, along with 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an enormous 5,000mAh battery.
Surprisingly, Motorola made the conscious decision to omit any official dust or water resistance IP rating. You'll likely be just fine for a splash in the rain, but that's about it. The camera system is also just OK, and not what you would likely expect to see from a flagship-level device in 2020. Instead, it matches up more with some of the mid-tier smartphones that we've seen released over the last year or so.
Finally, there was one more puzzling "issue" with the Moto Edge+ that has some scratching their heads. While this handset supports both Sub-6 and mmWave, the only official carrier support comes from Verizon. Even if your tried to purchase the phone directly from Motorola, you are only limited to selecting Verizon as there are no "unlocked" variants available.
Pros:
Cons:
Best for Verizon
Motorola Edge+
Great for only Verizon users
The Motorola Edge+ features both 5G spectrums, while also sporting flagship specs and a gorgeous design.
Best International 5G Phone: OnePlus Nord
For the past few years, we have seen OnePlus join the race to attempt and topple Samsung with devices like the OnePlus 7 Pro and 8 Pro. However, this is a far cry from the "old days" where the flagship killer moniker had more substance. OnePlus devices feature great designs with a solid spec-sheet. Some may say that the company has lost its way, but that has seemingly changed with the OnePlus Nord.
The Nord instantly become one of the best 5G phones with a sleek glass sandwich design, four rear cameras, and a beautiful 90Hz AMOLED display. Under the hood, you'll find Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G paired with up to 12GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. Battery life is of no concern here thanks to the 4,115mAh cell, along with OnePlus' Warp Charge 30T fast charging technology.
So then why is this not higher on the list? Well, OnePlus opted to stick to its international userbase for the Nord. The device is available in select regions around the globe, with the exception of the U.S. While we wait for the U.S. version of the Nord to arrive, you'll be stuck trying to get lucky on Amazon or over at Walmart's online storefront. It's also important to note that the Nord does not include any of the 5G bands needed to get the fastest connection from your GSM carrier, and there is no compatibility with CDMA networks.

Cons:

Perfect for everywhere but the U.S.
The OnePlus Nord marks a change in the guard for the company as it tries to return to its roots.
Best for Pixel fans: Pixel 5 (coming soon)
2020 has been a weird year for Google after getting lambasted in regards to the shoddy battery life from the Pixel 4. The only saving grace for 4 and 4 XL was the absolutely amazing camera system, making it possible to point your smartphone at the night's sky and get pictures of the constellations. Fast forward to today, and there are now three phones in Google's 2020 lineup, culminating with the upcoming Pixel 5.
This handset features all of the specs one would expect from a smartphone priced at less than $1,000. The Snapdragon 765G provides great performance while unlocking 5G connectivity. Google's decision to use an aluminum unibody design while still making wireless charging is fantastic, and the Pixel 5 now features an ultra-wide secondary camera, instead of the telephoto lens found on the Pixel 4 and 4 XL.
Getting a Pixel guarantees you three years of platform updates, along with getting the latest version of Android as soon as it's become available. But with the Pixel 5 and the Pixel 4a 5G (another 5G phone in Google's lineup), Google learned from the past and packed in a larger battery with its latest devices to go along with the 90Hz display for buttery smooth scrolling and gaming, although the 4a 5G is limited to just a 60Hz refresh rate.
It's going to be tough determining whether the Pixel 5 can really stack up against the likes of the OnePlus Nord and Galaxy S20 FE at this price. Additionally, the Pixel 5 will not be available in all markets, as Pixel fans in India will be left out of the fun here. Nonetheless, the Pixel 5 is sure to turn some heads, especially with the new Sorta Sage color option.

Cons:

Get 5G connectivity from Google
Google's 2020 flagship may be surprising to some, but it's an impressive handset with Google's software and camera prowess.
The best 5G phones aren't just for enthusiasts anymore
5G coverage is growing, but it isn't yet to the point where we can unequivocally say that you have to get a 5G phone. At the same time, the number of phones launching with 5G are beginning to become rather compelling with many of the best Android phones already featuring the new bands.The smartphone market will soon reach the point of no-return, where just about every phone released features 5G. We're just hoping that this will mean that the names of some of these devices can get a little shorter than they are currently.
For those who want to get to the best network speeds, the Galaxy S20+ is a clear winner — because it's just a great overall phone that happens to have 5G connectivity. You don't choose the Galaxy S20+ because it has 5G, but because of its great hardware, display, specs and cameras. Having 5G for now — and more importantly for a year from now — is just a great side benefit.

That's why we've rounded up some of the best ergonomic office chairs around.One of the world's best VPN providers is setting up an advisory team of independent experts to influence its product and commercial direction. NordVPN has announced that leading cybersecurity expert Troy Hunt, who founded Have I Been Pwned, is the first person to join its new advisory team.
In a media release, the Panama-headquartered VPN provider said it was "gathering a team of advisors to help it become a global leader for digital security."
The firm went on to explain that its advisors will "share their expertise and provide guidance on the company's security and commercial practices."
Tom Okman, co founder of NordSec (the parent company of NordVPN), said:
"We are very excited to greet Troy Hunt as an advisor. Our product family is growing rapidly, and we have ambitious plans ahead. That's why it's important to have a team of professionals who can support us by providing their expert insights and strategic advice."
While the company hasn't revealed the names of other advisers yet, it explained that members will come from areas like technology, digital security and academia. They "will provide strategic guidance and help shape the company's future by sharing unique perspectives, insights, and trends," it added.
Troy Hunt said in a statement that he is "impressed with NordVPN's product and their desire to engage with independent experts to drive further innovation."
He continued: "Their openness and transparency with the way they run their services combined with their vision for the future is a big part of what attracted me to the organisation. I'm looking forward to partnering with NordVPN and helping them do more for digital privacy."
The launch of an advisory team is the latest step NordVPN has taken to improve the privacy and security of its products. Its no logs policy has already been independently audited twice, and the company is a founder of industry best practices organisation VPN Trust Initiative.

Whether you're tired of losing your keys, you're already in the process of automating your home, or you're setting up a B&B, a vital part of the process is choosing a smart lock that fits your needs. There are plenty of different smart locks to choose from, each with their own unique abilities. However, we recommend the August Smart Lock Pro for most people since it's super easy to set up and comes with everything you need.
- Best Overall: August Wi-Fi Smart Lock (4th Gen)
- Best Budget August Lock: August Smart Lock Pro + Connect (3rd Gen)
- Best Built-in Alarm: Schlage Camelot Connect
- Best Pocket-friendly: Kwikset Smart Code 888
- Best for Added Security: Lockly Secure Pro
- Best Keyless Entry: Yale Assure Lock SL
- Best Fingerprint Reader: Lockly PGD 728F
- Best Nest Lock: Nest x Yale Lock
Best Overall: August Wi-Fi Smart Lock (4th Gen)
Unlike many of the other smart locks that you'll find on the market, it isn't immediately apparent when you have an August Wi-Fi Smart Lock installed on your front door. That's because the device only gets installed on the interior of your home, so the front, so there's no indication of it from your front porch. The latest model is still a little bulky but is much smaller than previous generations.
One of the things that makes this particular lock so great is that buyers don't need any additional bridges when using this device since it has its own built-in Wi-Fi. That means that buyers can lock and unlock the door from anywhere as long as they have access to the August app and a good internet connection. You can also view the activity of any door that the August smart lock is installed on merely by checking the app. If you want, the app allows you to change the settings so that it automatically locks when you leave home or unlocks when you approach. Plus, it works beautifully with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and other smart home assistants.
Pros:
- Built-in Wi-Fi
- Control it with August app
- Auto-lock and auto-unlock
- Track unlock activity
- Works with voice assistants
Cons:
Best Overall
August Wi-Fi Smart Lock (4th Gen)
Small and simple lock
Control this smart lock with several apps, voice assistants, and smart home services.
Best Budget August Lock: August Smart Lock Pro + Connect (3rd Gen)
One of the reasons we like this option so much is that from a street view, no one would know that it was a smart lock. It allows you to keep your handle and lock in place but adds a smart component that's only visible from inside your home. It isn't the most pleasant thing to look at from the inside, but you probably won't be looking at it much. It's a bit expensive. However, this particular purchase comes with an external Connect Wi-Fi Bridge, which will let you control your lock using the August app or a voice assistant like Amazon Alexa devices.
The app also has an activity log so you can see who has been coming and going through your door. The DoorSense feature even allows you to check your phone and see if your door is shut or open. For additional convenience, you can make it, so your door automatically unlocks when you approach with your smartphone and locks when you walk away. It's perfect for when you're carrying home armloads of groceries. Despite being a high-tech device, this lock will only take you around 10 minutes to set up.
Pros:
- Comes with Connect Wi-Fi Bridge
- Control it with August app
- Features DoorSense
- Track unlock activity
- Locks and unlocks with your arrival and departure
- Works with voice assistants
Cons:

Best Built-in Alarm: Schlage Camelot Connect
If you're looking for a smart lock that offers a sleeker design, you'll be interested in the Schlage Camelot Connect Smart Door Lock. It looks beautiful, and there are a couple of colors to match the look of your front door. This lock features a built-in alarm, and you can cycle through three different alert modes to let you know if there is any activity going on at your door. It also has an impressively long battery life and will alert you via a yellow light when it requires new batteries.
Open your door using a key or give out up to 30 access codes to your kids or guests so they can get in the house without a key. You'll even be able to monitor who comes in and out of your home using the activity log. You will need a Z-Wave hub, like this Wink hub or this SmartThings hub to control your door via an app or by using a voice assistant like an Amazon Alexa device or Google Assistant. Buying both the lock and the hub makes this an especially expensive option.
Pros:
- Works with several smart assistants
- Built-in alarm
- Manual locking option
- Low battery indicator
- Two color options
- Works with Z-Wave
Cons:
Best Built-in Alarm
Schlage Camelot Connect
A beautiful multi-control smart lock
Control your deadbolt via the keypad, key, smart assistant, or app. It comes in beautiful designs that will match the look of your door.
Best Pocket-friendly: Kwikset Smart Code 888
If you're looking for something that securely bolts your door shut without costing too much, then this is the smart lock to get. It features a keypad and a physical key slot so you can open it manually if necessary. You'll need either a Zigbee or Z-Wave hub to control it via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, but this isn't necessary if you simply want to use it as a keypad entry. If you prefer to keep your front door locked, enable the 30-second auto-lock.
It comes in three colors to match your door: Satin Nickel, Venetian Bronze, and Polished Brass. If you want to make sure that it matches the color of your handles, you can upgrade to the Smart Lock Keypad + Handleset. There isn't a battery life indicator on the device, so you'll need to pay attention and replace batteries as needed.
Pros:
- Features keypad
- Physical key slot
- Can upgrade to entire handle set
- Works with Z-Wave Plus
- 30-second autolocking
Cons:
Best Pocket-friendly
Kwikset Smart Code 888
An inexpensive smart lock
This smart lock features a keypad, key slot, and 30-second autolocking, although you'll need a separate hub for some features.
Best for Added Security: Lockly Secure Pro
If you're worried about people spying on you or guessing your code, then the Lockly Secure Pro can help you feel more secure. The screen houses three-button locations with different numbers inside them. Every time the device turns on, the numbers scramble around, which makes it, so you have to pay more attention each time you enter your code. It also makes it a lot harder for anyone to mimic your code after watching you type it in. Additionally, this unit has a fingerprint reader on the right side that can remember up to 99 fingerprints. This makes it a great lock not only for homes but for businesses as well.
The downside to the screen is that you cannot adjust the brightness, so it might be hard to see the buttons at certain times of the day. It comes with a Wi-Fi hub, so you don't have to purchase one separately to get it to connect with your internet. There's also a small kit inside the box that you can attach to your door, which notifies the app if the door is open. That way, you know for sure if your house is secure. This is a relatively expensive smart lock, but given the extra security features, that's not too surprising.
Pros:
Cons:
Best for Added Security
Lockly Secure Pro
Extra security features
It remembers up to 99 fingerprints and scrambles the locations of the buttons to add an extra measure of security.
Best Keyless Entry: Yale Assure Lock SL
For those wanting to ditch the house keys altogether, this touchscreen smart lock is just the trick. It features a sleek design that will look good on any front door, and it's easy to install. It comes in three colors to match your door and handle. Since this lock uses DoorSense, you'll be able to tell if your door is open or closed if you purchase the Connected by August version.
On that note, something significant to be aware of is that there are four different smart versions of this lock: one that uses Connected by August, one that works with Zigbee, another that's compatible with HomeKit, and lastly, a version that connects with Z-Wave. Depending on which version you purchase, it will work with Wi-Fi, Alexa, Google Assistant, Xfinity Home, SmartThings, Wink, and even ADT. You'll need to buy the version that uses the control options you like, be aware that the price changes depending on which version you purchase.
Pros:
Cons:

Yale Assure Lock SL
A lock that doesn't require keys
This handy keypad attaches directly to your door's bolt and can be controlled via touchscreen and different automation services.
Best Fingerprint Reader: Lockly PGD 728F
This smart lock works like something from a Mission Impossible movie. It's a bit expensive compared to others, but it also includes several additional features. There are four ways to open the lock - via fingerprint, keycode, a physical key, or unlocking it with your smartphone. It employs a 3D fingerprint sensor, which ensures that the lock doesn't respond to lifted prints. This is one of the most secure keypads since the numbers continuously change positions. This means that if someone was watching while you entered the access code, the buttons will move, and they won't be able to guess the code correctly. You get three attempts to enter the code before the keypad requires you to enter the correct code twice.
Owners can also give out access codes to friends and family, so they don't have to have a physical key to open the door. You'll also be able to monitor the unlock history, to see if something strange has been going on with your door. Something we appreciate about this lock is the physical keypad disablement button. Simply slide it to the off position to prevent anyone from using the keypad. If you're the kind of person that prefers to keep your front door locked at all times, then you'll appreciate the auto-locking feature. Set it to lock anywhere between 5 seconds and 5 minutes after opening the door. Just be aware that the deadbolt will lock regardless of whether or not the door is open. It comes in two colors so you'll be able to choose the look you like best for your home.

Best Nest Lock: Google Nest x Yale Lock
This is a pricey option, but It has a lot going for it that makes it a great purchase. Anyone whose home is decked out with Google smart devices will be able to lock, unlock, and check the status of this Yale lock simply by talking to Google Assistant. Just keep in mind that since this is a Nest device, it doesn't work with Amazon Alexa. You can also use the Nest app to control the deadbolt from just about anywhere or come up with temporary access codes to give to family or friends.
Are you worried about security? If someone starts messing with your lock, you'll get a notification on your phone letting you know that something is going on. On top of that, if you have the Nest Secure alarm system, you can connect it to this lock, making it so that whenever you unlock the lock, it disarms the alarm. This keeps your home secure without making it inconvenient for you. You'll find that this lock comes in three different colors so you can find a look that fits your door: Oil-Rubbed Bronze, Satin Nickel, and Polished Brass.
Pros
- Works with Google Assistant
- Pairs with Nest Secure
- Tamper alerts
- Control it with Nest app
- Let family and friends in from anywhere
- Three colors
Cons

Lock up your Nest
Unlock your door keyless by either using the touchpad or by accessing the Nest app. You can also set it to automatically lock when you're away.
Lock it up and throw away the key
When looking for a smart lock, you want something that provides plenty of security features as well as an added convenience for a reasonable price. You'll have to determine if being able to lock via the app or voice assistant is enough or if you'd like the ability to key in codes, use a physical key slot, or even open the door via fingerprint scans. No matter what features you want, there are plenty of options from which to choose.
One of the best options out there is the August Smart Lock Pro + Connect. It makes the front of your door look like any other lock, but you'll be able to monitor lock activity to know who is going or coming from the included August app, and tell whether or not your front door is shut using DoorSense. It's also one of the only locks that you can program to automatically unlock when you approach with your phone and lock when you walk away.

With Virtual Desktop (wireless)
Virtual Desktop is the best wireless experience but it'll cost you extra (if you want to go free, check out the ALVR tab above). When you connect an Oculus Quest 2 to a Wi-Fi 6 network, Virtual Desktop will be able to provide even higher quality visuals with lower latency.
Whichever Oculus Quest you use, make sure to buy the correct Oculus Quest version of Virtual Desktop, which can be found on the Oculus Store right here (the Steam and Oculus Rift versions won't do the same thing). Once you've got that, put your Oculus Quest on and get Virtual Desktop installed:
- Open your library tab on the Oculus bar at the bottom of your view. It's the square grid of 9 dots.
Install Virtual Desktop by clicking the install button on the Virtual Desktop tile.
- Once it's done installing, take your headset off. Don't launch Virtual Desktop just yet.
Head on over to your gaming PC now.
- Plug your Oculus Quest into your computer with a USB cable. SideQuest should recognize your Oculus Quest if you've gone through our SideQuest setup guide.
- Navigate to the SideQuest app on your Desktop PC.
- Use the search bar on the top right of the SideQuest app to search for Virtual Desktop or just click here.
Select Virtual Desktop.
Click the Install to Headset button to install the Virtual Desktop patch onto your Oculus Quest.
Click on the tasks button on the top and ensure the patch was successfully installed.
- While still on your PC, download the Virtual Desktop streaming app.
Run the application once it's done downloading.
- Fill in your Oculus username in the box and press Save.

- With those options selected, all you'll need to do in the future is turn your PC and launch Virtual Desktop on your Oculus Quest.
Time to put the Oculus Quest on your head and game.
- Launch Virtual Desktop from the library tab on the Oculus bar at the bottom.
When Virtual Desktop loads up for the first time, you'll need to select your Desktop PC from the list to connect to it. It's probably the only thing listed.
Once SteamVR loads up, press the menu button on the left Oculus Touch controller to pull up the SteamVR dashboard.
Enjoy wireless SteamVR on your Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2!
With ALVR (wireless)
ALVR delivers a wireless VR experience without the extra cost. It's come a long way in a very short amount of time and, in most cases, the quality gap between it and Virtual Desktop has quickly shrunk. That's why we love ALVR and can recommend it as a great way to go wireless without spending the extra dough.
For this tutorial, you'll need to use SideQuest to get ALVR installed onto your Oculus Quest. Please follow our SideQuest guide here if you don't have SideQuest installed yet.
- On your desktop computer, navigate to the ALVR Github.
Download ALVR_server_Windows.zip. You can find this under the Assets section of each release in Github.
Extract ALVR_server_Windows.zip to a permanent location on your computer. Something like My Documents or the Desktop folder is fine.
- Open up the ALVR folder you just extracted and run ALVR.exe.
Accept any security warnings that appear.
Follow through the initial setup to make sure your Windows Firewall is configured correctly.
Now to load ALVR onto your Oculus Quest

- Open up the SideQuest application on your desktop PC.
Use the search box at the top of the screen to search for ALVR or click here. The full title name you'll see listed in Sidequest is ALVR - Air Light VR.
On the store page within Sidequest, click the Install to Headset button to download and install ALVR onto your Oculus Quest.
- Once the installation is complete, unplug the Oculus Quest and fit it to your face as you normally would when playing.
- Open your library tab on the Oculus bar at the bottom of your view. It's the square grid of 9 dots. If you don't see the bar at the bottom, press the home button on your right controller.
- Select Unknown Sources from the rightmost dropdown list.
Scroll down and select ALVR from the main pane.
- ALVR will launch into a white screen.
- Pull your visor up but leave the Oculus Quest on your head to keep it from falling asleep.
On your computer, click the Trust button within the ALVR app next to the Oculus Quest listing.
- Once it's connected, you'll see your headset's statistics and information displayed in the ALVR app on your desktop.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!After taking an early 10-0 lead last Sunday, the Packers let Tom Brady and the Bucs score 38 unanswered points and suffered their first loss of the season. It was an ugly game the entire team will look to put behind them as they battle the 1-5 Houston Texans in week 7.
Whether you're a cheesehead or a Texans fan, below we'll explain how to watch Packers vs Texans live no matter where you are in the world.
Considering they're 4-1 the Packers are favored to win this week, but the game could end up being a lot closer than some expect thanks to a tough Texans defense. If we're being honest, the Packers seem to struggle when a team has a solid D and a mean pass-rush. Basically, Green Bay will need to slow down J.J. Watt if they want to get a W on Sunday.
Until last week the Packers were the #1 offense in football averaging over 38 points a game, while the Texans sit at 29th and struggle to score more than 20 points in any game this season. However, now that Houston fired most of the head coach staff the entire team is playing with urgency, and the defense even got its first interception of the year last week.
What this all boils down to is the Texans are a better team than their record indicates, which should make this a great early Sunday game. At the same time, the Packers will likely come out strong and look to quickly bounce back from the embarrassing loss last week.
We don't know who will win this one, but here's how to watch it.

Some are really exciting, whereas others are a bit boring. Among all of the handsets to come out during a given year, one release that's continually met with a lot of excitement and fanfare is Samsung's Galaxy S series.
One could argue that Galaxy S phones aren't always the most interesting, but there's no denying how much more attention they get compared to much of the competition.
For 2020, Samsung launched a trio of phones with the Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra. These are very technically impressive gadgets with high prices to match, and if you can afford what Samsung is asking for the phones, they're bound to be some of the best the Android landscape sees all year.
From hands-on coverage, detailed specs, accessory recommendations, and so much more, here's absolutely everything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S20 family.
Galaxy 2020
Samsung Galaxy S20
Samsung's latest flagships have it all
Hoping to dominate the smartphone market in 2020, Samsung is doing so with three phones — the Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra. Each one is packed with impressive specs, such as a 120Hz display, upgraded cameras, and expandable storage across the board. If you want a top-notch Android phone this year, these are worthy of your attention.
Where can you buy the Galaxy S20 and how much does it cost?
Now that we've reached the end of this guide, it's time to talk about everyone's favorite subject — price.
The Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra have starting prices of $1,000, $1,200, and $1,400, respectively. As of March 6, all three phones are available for purchase.
You can pick up the S20 at most major carriers and retailers in the U.S., with many of them offering generous promotions and discounts to help you save some cash. Right now, Samsung is offering up to a $450 instant credit when you trade-in an eligible device.
Outside of Samsung, you'll also find deals from Amazon, Verizon, T-Mobile, and plenty more. The S20 lineup is undoubtedly expensive, but if you know where to look, it's fairly easy to save a lot of money.
What's this Galaxy S20 FE everyone's talking about?
Following the release of the Galaxy S20 series, Samsung launched a follow-up to it in the form of the Galaxy S20 FE (Fan Edition). It has almost all of the same specs as the regular S20, but it swaps out the glass back for a plastic one, has slightly less RAM, and a tweaked camera system. Everything else is basically the same, which is darn impressive when you factor in the FE's $700 retail price.
While phones like the S20 and S20+ are still great purchases, the S20 FE now makes them a tougher sell. They're fantastic if you have a ton of cash to spend and want the best Galaxy phone money can buy, but the S20 FE and its considerably lower price drive a hard bargain. For those $700, you're still getting a 120Hz AMOLED display, Snapdragon 865 processor, a huge 4,500 mAh battery, and triple rear cameras that take excellent photos.
We came away rather impressed with the Galaxy S20 FE in our full review, going as far to say that it's "the new flagship killer." If you're interested in the S20 experience but are trying to watch your budget, this is absolutely a phone you should consider.
Have we reviewed the Galaxy S20?
Before you dive too deep into this guide, a good place to start is by checking out our full reviews of the S20 lineup.
As you'd probably expect, the S20 Ultra is a really good phone. Its 120Hz AMOLED display is a thing of beauty, Samsung's build quality is as good as ever, and the upgraded camera system is a lot of fun to shoot with. Samsung went all out with the phone, and the end result is a device that packs in just about every feature imaginable.
We don't blame you for wanting an S20 Ultra of your own this very second, but keep in mind that it is not a perfect phone. The 120Hz refresh rate is a massive drain on battery life, Samsung's in-screen fingerprint sensor is a pain to use, and there's no getting around the $1,400 asking price.
Alternatively, you could just get the Galaxy S20+ . It's $200 less than the S20 Ultra while being every bit as good. The digital zooming isn't quite as impressive and the battery is smaller, but it's also much easier to handle thanks to its smaller size and puts a significantly lesser dent in your wallet.
Then, there's the baby Galaxy S20. You might be inclined to think that the baseline S20 is the least exciting on the bunch, but it's actually the one we'd recommend to most people. It has the smallest price tag, is easy to use in one hand, and offers basically all of the same features of the more expensive S20+.
No matter which phone you end up picking, you can rest assured you're getting one of the best Android phones of the year.
Which Galaxy S20 model should you buy?
Speaking of the different models, let's take a closer look at what each one is bringing to the table.
At their core, the S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra are very similar. All three phones have 120Hz displays, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 processor, expandable storage, water resistance, and wireless charging. However, similar to what we saw last year with the S10e, S10, and S10+, there are also clear differences between them.
While the S20 isn't cheap with a starting price of $1000, it is the lesser phone of the trio. It has the fewest cameras, smallest battery, and doesn't connect to mmWave 5G networks. Then again, it's the S20 version that'll put the smallest dent in your wallet and is a good choice if you prefer phones with smaller screen sizes.
In the middle of the bunch is the S20+, offering modest improvements in all of the areas where it differs from the regular S20. If you step all the way up to the S20 Ultra, you're getting the biggest and baddest S20 experience possible — though it is going to cost you.
What specs does the Galaxy S20 have?
Samsung doesn't mess around with specs for its Galaxy S phones, and that idea has carried over to the S20 lineup.
Whether we're talking about the S20, S20+, or S20 Ultra, these are flagship phones through and through. As such, you'll find flagship specs in just about every regard.
Here's a quick rundown of what they're packing.

Samsung Galaxy S20 Specifications
Does the Galaxy S20 have good cameras?
Similar to the displays, the Galaxy S20 is also being used as a showcase for Samsung's improved camera tech. The Galaxy S9 and S10 had fine cameras, but compared to what's been offered by the rest of the competition, Samsung's efforts in this department have felt lukewarm.
That changes with the S20 lineup, and it all starts with the S20 and S20+. Both phones still have a 12MP lens for the primary camera, but the big improvement is that the pixels are about 30% larger so that substantially more light can be let into a shot. The telephoto camera has also been upgraded, now featuring a 64MP sensor with 3x lossless zoom. If ultra-wide is more your thing, this year's sensor brings 40% larger pixels which should help in low-light scenarios.
Those are all worthwhile improvements, but where things get really interesting is when you look at the Galaxy S20 Ultra.
It offers a massive 108MP primary camera, using pixel binning to take pictures that come out as 12MP shots. There's also a 48MP telephoto camera, and because of the way it's positioned inside of the 20 Ultra, it's able to offer 10x lossless zoom and up to 100x digital zoom if you want to go all out.
Above, you'll see a selection of pictures we've taken with the S20 Ultra. We could go on and on about getting into the specifics, but the tl;dr is that photos look really, really good. With the main sensor, specifically, we're seeing significant improvements with detail and natural bokeh thanks to the huge sensor size. Samsung's processing still has a tendency to be too heavy-handed with things like HDR and highlights, but overall, we've been impressed.
As for how the S20 Ultra's 100x zoom works, a perfect example is seen in the above tweet from Nirave.
Zooming in all the way to 100x definitely comes with a drop in overall image quality, but the fact that you're able to get this close to subjects and still clearly make them out is seriously impressive.
How can I get the most out of my Galaxy S20?
The Galaxy S20 is a very capable device, but if you're new to the Android or smartphone world, understanding all of its various functions can be rather tricky. Thankfully, it doesn't have to be. We've spent a lot of quality time with all models of the S20, ensuring we can keep you in the loop on how to get the most out of the phones.
For starters, you'll want to know how to do all of the basics on the S20 — whether that's accessing your notifications, enabling dark mode, or customizing the various camera modes. These are all small things on their own, but once you learn to master them all, you'll be able to have the S20 work for you rather than against you.
There are also some more specific features to play around with, such as changing the Galaxy S20's refresh rate. The 120Hz mode looks absolutely gorgeous, but because it's refreshing at twice the speed of 60Hz, it also uses a lot more battery. By switching back and forth between these two modes, you can choose to favor performance or battery life whenever you please.
Another great feature is Live Caption, which uses on-device tech to display captions for any audio or video that's playing from your Galaxy S20. Not only is it great from an accessibility standpoint, but it can also be really convenient if you're trying to watch a YouTube video in private and don't want to rely on YouTube's generally awful closed captioning.
Should I upgrade my old Samsung phone to the Galaxy S20?
There's no denying that the S20 lineup is mighty impressive, but if you already have an older Galaxy phone, do you really need to upgrade? Samsung builds its phones to last, so if you have an S10 or S9, chances are you can probably hold onto it for a little while longer and be just fine.
On the flip side, when you take into consideration all of the upgrades offered by the S20, there's also an argument to be made as to why you should upgrade. The 120Hz display is a big deal, the camera improvements are nothing to scoff at, and you get ample future-proofing with the Snapdragon 865, minimum of 12GB of RAM, etc.
Ultimately, it comes down to whether or not you're happy with your current Galaxy handset and how much you value the upgrades offered by the Galaxy S20.
How does the Galaxy S20 compare to other smartphones?
In that same breath, it's also worth pitting the Galaxy S20 up against phones from other manufacturers. Samsung is far from the only company making quality smartphones, meaning the S20 needs to make an argument as to why you should buy it over everything else being offered.
Looking at the regular S20, it has some stiff competition coming from the OnePlus 8. While you do give up on some features like wireless charging and water resistance with OnePlus's phone, you end up with a very similar experience for hundreds of dollars less. Especially in a market that's incredibly price-conscious right now, that's a big deal. There's a similar argument to be made when comparing the Galaxy S20+ and OnePlus 8 Pro, as you still have a sizeable price difference even with the Pro's added features and improved cameras over the regular OnePlus 8.
And, of course, we have to talk about how the Galaxy S20 Ultra compares against Samsung's own Note 20 Ultra. Both phones brandish the Ultra name and have two of the highest price tags around, though it's pretty clear to us which of them is the better buy.
What Galaxy S20 colors are there?
Samsung has been known to offer some truly great colors for its smartphones, and that's something we're seeing yet again with the S20.
There are five available colors this time around, including Cloud Blue, Cloud Pink, Cosmic Grey, Cosmic Black, and a Best Buy exclusive in the form of Aura Blue. There's nothing as extravagant as the Galaxy Note 10's Aura Glow, but the colors that are offered all look great.
Cloud Blue and Cloud Pink are have a pleasing pastel feeling that allows them to stand out without being overbearing, with Cosmic Grey and Cosmic Black existing for folks that like to keep things as simple as possible. Aura Blue is also a sight to behold, but it's not the easiest to get your hands on.
Should I get any accessories for the Galaxy S20?
The Galaxy S20 is a phenomenal phone on its own, but it's not something that should be used naked. A screen protector is a must to keep its jaw-dropping display intact, while a case will ensure the phone doesn't get ruined during a drop/fall.
There are also other types of accessories to consider for your shiny new phone, such as microSD cards, wireless chargers, and more.

Remembering Google Play Music: A mixtape for my favorite streaming service
How are you liking the Pixel 5 so far?
With so many shades, there's a Galaxy S20 FE color for everyone
Samsung is really spoiling us with the Galaxy S20 FE colors. It can be hard to pick between that succulent red, the lush green, the luxurious purple and more, so let's take a look at all the colorways side by side and figure out which one belongs in your pocket.Best answer: No, Google did not release a Pixel 5 XL. If you want a newer Pixel with a big display, the Pixel 4a 5G is your best bet.
- Google's latest flagship: Pixel 5 ($700 at Amazon)
- The larger Pixel: Pixel 4a 5G ($500 at Best Buy)
You won't find a Pixel 5 XL anywhere... because it doesn't exist
For the first time since the Pixel lineup was introduced, Google's flagship lineup does not feature an "XL" variant. The Pixel 5 is all that you can get, along with its modest 6-inch display, but the Pixel 4a 5G was almost the Pixel 5 XL.
Originally, Google had plans to unveil and launch the Pixel 4a at Google I/O 2020, which was scheduled back in May 2020. However, since I/O 2020 never happened, that forced Google to re-think its strategy for its 2020 lineup of handsets, especially since the Pixel 4a was not officially revealed until August.
Thanks to the work of our own Alex Dobie, we learned that Google went through a few iterations of branding ideas before landing on what was revealed in the second half of this year. The Pixel 4a was intended to be a standalone release, giving Google a few months of "breathing room" before revealing the Pixel 5 lineup. The devices that Google would announce in September were to become the Pixel 5 and the Pixel 5s.
The Pixel 4a 5G, which is coming out in just a few weeks, was intended to be the "standard" Pixel 5, and the Pixel 5 that is also launching soon was slated to be the Pixel 5s, which is the "more premium" version of the entire lineup with its aluminum frame, wireless charging, and 90Hz refresh rate.
Because Google did not want to cannibalize a product it had just announced, the company shifted its naming scheme again. The "standard" Pixel 5 became the Pixel 4a 5G in an effort to keep the $350 Pixel 4a relevant, leaving the Pixel 5s to drop the "s" and be the only option in the Pixel 5 lineup.
All of this is to say that if you want a Pixel with a larger display, you'll have to go with the Pixel 4a 5G. While there's a larger battery, along with the same Snapdragon 765G processor, you'll miss out on the faster 90Hz refresh rate for the display that you get with the Pixel 5. That may not matter to some, especially since you're getting most of the same features, along with a headphone jack, for a couple of hundred dollars cheaper. Even with some of those "losses" in the feature department, the Pixel 4a 5G is still nestled in the middle of the pack for the best Android phones of the year, right behind the Pixel 5.
Google's latest flagship
Pixel 5
Redefining the meaning of "flagship"
The Pixel 5 has everything you could want from a flagship handset in 2020. It sports a 90Hz OLED display, 8GB of RAM, and even 5G connectivity. Plus, as per usual, it has some of the best cameras in the game.
The larger Pixel
Pixel 4a 5G
What could have been
The Pixel 4a 5G may have been rebranded, but at its core, it's the Pixel 5 XL that we all could have hoped for. Minus the lack of a 90Hz refresh rate, it still has everything you could want.

Keep your Pixel 4a 5G looking its best with these screen protectors
The Pixel 4a 5G is finally here, giving users 5G future-proofing in the same design as the Pixel 4a from earlier in the year. However, now that Google's future-proofed device has arrived, you'll want to keep it protected for the years to come, so we've rounded up the best screen protectors.When the opportunity came to do a Bartesian review, I was more than willing. I enjoy a nice cocktail as much as the next person, and this device would pair nicely with my smart home build. I don't always want to physically make my cocktail, and not everyone knows how to create the beverage or has all the ingredients on hand. There are many reasons you wouldn't have the desire to maintain a fully stocked bar, but that doesn't mean you wouldn't like to have your favorite drink on-demand.
In our current times of spending far more time at home than going to our favorite restaurant or drinking establishment, access to that elusive favorite spirit-based beverage is mostly out of the question. So, unless you plan to take up bartending or mixology, the perfect solution to the issue is the Bartesian — or so the company behind the product believes. As a whole, it's not entirely wrong, and in most cases, it's right.
The Bartesian is a cocktail maker that allows you to make some of your favorite cocktails and mixed drinks at home without the need to keep a ton of ingredients on hand. All you need is a place to plug in the machine, your preferred brand of the base spirits, a glass, ice, and maybe a cocktail shaker if you really want to go for it. For the most part, the Bartesian delivers on its promise.
Bartesian
Bottom line: The Bartesian pours great-tasting drinks with minimal effort. You get to use your favorite brand of spirits paired with some quality mixing ingredients to produce a cocktail at the strength you desire. The only thing truly missing is pre-chilled water.
The Good
- You get to choose your preferred brand of spirits
- Customize the strength of your cocktail
- There's a good variety of drinks to choose from
- Upkeep of the machine is very easy
- Making drinks if very simple
The Bad
- The plastic on the machine feels a bit cheap for the price
- Sometimes, the drink stream makes a mess
- The capsules can get expensive
Custom, simple, and tasty
Bartesian What is it?
I've always liked the idea of mixology and bartending, though I never have officially been either — however, I do have a shirt from some college friends that says otherwise. I'm drawn to the idea that making myself a drink from a range of ingredients, flavors, colors, and consistency to produce a potentially mood-altering experience. The Bartesian removes part of that experience, while still giving you a flavorful drink.
The Bartesian not only allows the party's bartender to relax but also let guests in on the fun.
Being the drink maker for your friends can get exhausting, and you rarely get to relax. Hosting a party usually means spending the entire time running around trying to make sure everything is going perfectly and all your guests are happy. To have a machine that can take the weight off of making some of the essential classic cocktails is excellent.
The Bartesian is a machine in a similar vein to a Kuerig coffee maker, who makes a cocktail machine too. You pick from a growing variety of mixer capsules based around five base spirits: gin, rum, tequila, vodka, and whiskey. The capsules are filled with the bitters, extracts, non-alcoholic liqueurs, and juice concentrates needed to create the beverage of choice.

The product itself looks great. The outward appearance is something that most people wouldn't be ashamed to have sitting on the counter or at your home bar. The matte grey finish, the chrome handle for the lid, and four crystal-clear bottles for liquors all come together for a sleek modern style.
There are up to four spirits installed at a time; gin and rum share a spot and swap out as needed. You can fill each bottle with your preferred brand of spirit, as well as filling up the water reservoir, which is used to dilute the concentrated ingredients inside the capsule. After this, making a drink with Bartesian is straightforward.
Open the lid and place the capsule for your desired drink into the device. The Bartesian has a bar code scanner that reads the code on the foil lid. Each code tells the machine what the cocktail is, which determines the recommended glass, what spirit is needed, and the amount of spirit necessary for each drink strength.
Yes, you read that right, you get to choose how strong of a drink you get. The levels go from a mocktail (no alcohol), light, regular, to strong. This means that anyone of age — or not, if you trust them to pick a mocktail — can get a drink from this machine. You can take things to another level and experiment with using flavored liquors in your cocktails as well for a new twist on a classic if you want.
It's great that nearly all of the removable parts to the Bartesian are top-rack dishwasher safe.
When you need to change out liquor or refill one, the machine's settings menu has an option for such occasion. This purges the line of that liquor so that it's clear and won't influence the next drink from that well, or in the case of a refill, not make a mess when removing the bottle. Speaking of not affecting the next cocktail, after each drink is made, the machine cleans out the disbursement area so that each drink tastes as expected. Basically, this means that your Old Fashioned won't taste like the Cosmo made before.
Bartestian What drinks can it make
The quality of any cocktail is dependent on a few basic things: the quality of the spirits and mixers used, and the amounts used in the mix. The Bartesian controls all of these things for you, except for liquor — that's on you.
As mentioned previously, each cocktail that the Bartesian makes is delivered in capsule form. Every capsule contains exact measurements of each ingredient to make the cocktail of choice, apart from the base spirits. From the juice concentrates to the extracts used, the mixologists at Bartesian have taken the time to ensure each time you make a Negroni, it tastes exactly the same. However, this also means you're reliant on Bartesian to offer a capsule for the drink you're after, so you might be out of luck for lesser-known cocktails. Here are the cocktail capsules available right now:

In my time testing out the Bartestian with my wife and a few friends and family, the overall consensus was that all the drinks tried were delicious. I have a relatively stocked home bar and carry ingredients to make many of the drink options from Bartesian, and mostly I enjoyed the options provided.
The only drink I didn't personally enjoy was the Manhattan, one of my all-time favorite cocktails. The version from Bartestain has a stronger cherry note to it than I like. Other than this single instance, all of the drinks were great.
You can purchase the capsules through Amazon and from the Bartiesian website directly, which also offers a monthly subscription for 18 capsules. While you can buy capsule sets from other retailers, when getting them from Bartesian, you get to mix and match however you want.
Bartesian says that it is always experimenting and working on expanding the catalog of drinks that are offered. They even welcome customers to send in suggestions for drinks that they would like to see added.
Bartesian What I don't like
As the saying goes, "not everything that glitter is gold," and in this case, not everything silver is metal. One of my biggest complaints with the Bartestian is the build quality. Nearly every part of the machine that the operator interacts with is a not particularly sturdy-feeling plastic.
For a machine that costs as much as this one does, I want it to feel like it can withstand a bit of the abuse that it may take from multiple people using it at a party. Outside of the bottles and their lids, the rest feels a bit lackluster. Now, this isn't a machine that you will be carrying around with you and operating all day, but it could still be better.
I just wish the lid mechanism was a bit more solidly built to avoid the plastic's creaking.
Opening the lid to insert your drink capsule is creaky and a bit herky-jerky. But it's when closing the lid onto the capsule that really makes me leary for this machine's longevity. Everything seems to twist and groan as you click the lid closed to puncture the capsule. The Bartesian may last years, but the sounds it makes even when new are a bit concerning.
From time to time, when making a drink, the stream coming from the machine would get a bit hectic, and if using a shorter style glass would cause a bit of overspray. A couple of different problems could cause this. Either the capsule didn't get properly seated, or the area that the drink comes out of may have had some residue from a previous drink. So it's good to wipe down that area when done with the Bartesian for the night.
The last thing on my list of grievances is the cost of the capsules. A six-pack is $15 per set, so you are looking at $2.50 per mixer and then whatever your cost is for the liquor. There's also an eighteen-pack option for $43 per set, making the cost a little less at $2.39 a mix. While not extremely expensive, I would like to see a better price break on bulk purchases.
The competition
In terms of at-home cocktail makers, there aren't a ton of options. However, those that are in the space offer some very compelling features setting each apart. The closest comparison to the Bartesian is the Drinkworks from the makers of Keruig, coming in at about $300.
Drinkworks features the expected pod system, given its lineage. The most significant difference is that the pods contain not only the mixers but also alcohol. From a simplicity standpoint, this is great. When you want a drink, all you have to do is provide that glass to drink from and the water to fill the reservoir with, and you're ready to drink. The downside is you can't pick the brand of liquor or the strength of each drink.
Another differentiator for Drinkworks is that it can chill the water before it comes out. It's unclear if the Bartesian considers dilution for ice melting or not, but the Drinkworks doesn't need to account for that. You also have the option for bubbles with Drinksworks because it also has a place for a CO2 cartridge.
On the high-end of cocktail makers is the Barsys 2.0, priced a whopping $979. This is a very impressive machine with a spot for up to five liquor bottles and three canisters of mixers. There are no pods to this machine, as it is entirely operated via its app. You calibrate the Barsys to what each liquor is and the bottle size and tell it what mixers are in the canisters.
Using the app, you pick recipes that use what you have installed into the machine, and the illuminated conveyor belt moves your glass to the appropriate liquor. The device then disburses the exact amount of each spirit and mix to create your drink. You can queue up multiple drinks, even create and save custom drinks with the app.
Bartesian Should you buy?
You should buy this if ...
You enjoy a mixed drink or cocktail
Perhaps whiskey on the rocks or a glass of wine isn't your thing, or you like to mix it up from time to time — a well-balanced cocktail is just the trick. However, making the drink can be a hassle or something you really don't feel comfortable doing. The Bartesian takes all of the guesswork out of getting that perfect cocktail.
You like trying new things
Maintaining a fully stocked bar can be time-consuming, take up a lot of space, potentially wasteful, and not to mention expensive. If you want to try out new drinks but not invest in the supplies to make all of these different drinks, you'll love the Bartesian. With its growing variety of cocktails, you can try drinks you usually wouldn't. My wife learned she like gin while we were testing out the machine.
You have preferences as to how you like your cocktail
The ability to choose the liquors' brand and style in each cocktail you make are important to some people. If you prefer Jack over Jim, or Patron over Jose, you can do that with Bartesian. Not only do you get control over the exact style of the spirit used, but also the quantity. I like my drinks strong, and my wife prefers hers on the lighter side. We get that flexibility with the Bartesian.
You should not buy this if ...
You don't care about the type of liquor used
If you can't tell the difference from one vodka to the next, then something you may be more tempted by the Drinkworks machine. With the all-in-one approach to its drink pods, you don't have to mess with refilling the liquor bottles or purchasing them at all. You get the mixers and liquor in a convenient package to pop into the machine and push start. It also makes transportation easier when you don't have to haul bottles of booze.
You want a drink with bubbles
As of this review, the Bartesian does not have any drinks in its catalog that are carbonated. While this may change, if you like something like a mojito that has a bit of club soda, you're out of luck with the Bartesian. Sometimes adding a bit of fizz can really take a cocktail to another level. Maybe I'd like an Old Fashioned with some bubbles.
You want to customize the mixers
As I mentioned in my critique of the Manhattan offered by Bartesian, the recipe is what it is when you buy a capsule. Yes, you can alter the strength and liquor used, but the mix's flavors are predetermined. I enjoy experimenting with flavors in my drinks, and while I do enjoy a classic cocktail, the option to put a twist on it is fun, too.
In the end, if you want to enjoy a well-balanced cocktail using your favorite spirits, then the Bartesian is a great choice. You get to change up the liquors used if you want and make the drinks more robust or weaker as needed. However, if you don't want to fuss with bottles of alcohol and want an even more simplified approach to your drinks, then there's an option for you in the Drinkworks.
The Bartesian is a fun product to have if you like a mixed drink or cocktail from time to time. I have my preferences regarding how I want my drink made and what goes into it, and the Bartesian strikes a nice balance of those things. There's enough flexibility that I can change things up a bit if I want. It also provides a straightforward enough process that someone like my wife, who wants to push a button and to pour a drink, can enjoy it.
I would like the machine itself to be a bit more solidly built for the price. The creaky plastic and older style TFT touchscreen are a bit of a downer for me. As the cocktail list expands, the company can also find a better pricing structure for bulk capsule purchases because, depending on the use case, the capsules can get expensive.
Outside of some small issues, I really like the Bartesian. Watching the bubbles going up the liquor bottles as it pulls the booze while mixing a cocktail is just plain fun. The excitement that guests get when they watch it make their drink is almost as entertaining as the party.
Bartesian
Bottom line: The ability to make a classic cocktail at home with the push of a button. Choosing the drink's brand of liquor and strength almost makes it feel like you have your own in-home bartender.

- The best of the S20 series for less: Samsung Galaxy S20 FE ($700 at Amazon)
Get the right 5G phone
Pretty much every flagship phone released in 2020 has 5G support and it's no surprise that most of the best Android phones you can get right now have 5G. Verizon phones are a bit of a different story and may require a software update to access Verizon's nationwide 5G network. There's no timeline for when or if this update will come to unlocked phones though it's possible.
For most people, the most important thing is to make sure your phone supports the sub-6 5G bands your carrier uses. AT&T and Verizon phones should have support for band n5 while T-Mobile phones should support both n41 and n71. If you want the fastest possible connection you can get a phone that also supports mmWave for the few places that have mmWave coverage.
If you're getting a pre-owned phone or just an older phone like the Galaxy S10 5G, there's a good chance that it won't support all of the bands in use by your carrier, and in the case of Sprint phones, may not work with 5G at all anymore. The only 5G Sprint phones you should get right now are in the Galaxy S20 series.
It's also worth remembering that an AT&T phone that advertises itself as 5G Evolution ready actually doesn't have any 5G support at all. AT&T's 5Ge network is simply LTE rebranded.
5G coverage is finally here
All three major carriers now have some sort of nationwide sub-6 5G network. Sub-6 5G has much greater coverage than the mmWave 5G deployed early on by AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. This 5G now covers hundreds of millions of Americans.
Each carrier has been consistently adding additional coverage to its 5G network and will likely see the majority of the network improvements going forward. The speeds on sub-6 5G won't be anything special compared to a mature LTE network but as more spectrum is able to be dedicated to 5G, the speeds should catch up and surpass LTE in the coming years.
Make sure you get the right plan
Luckily, sub-6 5G is included with most plans you can sign up for right now. On AT&T, 5G access is included with all unlimited plans though many of the older data plans won't get support. This is different from both T-Mobile and Verizon with nationwide 5G working on all plans as long as you've got a supported phone.
Many prepaid carriers also included 5G on some or all of their plans. Visible, for example, has announced that it will offer 5G on Verizon's nationwide 5G network in 2020. T-Mobile-based carriers like Mint Mobile already offer 5G on all plans.
With support on most new phones, plans, and carriers, it's finally worth it to choose 5G when you buy your next new phone.

When it comes to affordability, ease of use, and availability, however, Google did it first, if not the best. It brought mesh Wi-Fi to millions of people, and made it very easy to understand. That's why it's one of our favorite products of the decade, and why
Mesh networking for your house
Wireless mesh networking isn't a new idea. A Wi-Fi signal can only travel so far, and if you want to stay on the same wireless network, extending its area by "meshing" multiple APs (access points) together under one gateway is the crazy network engineer's way of doing it easily.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
The thing is, it was never really easy. The amount of logic required to transmit network packets between multiple devices without changing the path from point A (your phone) to point B (the internet) used to mean a lot of programming and extremely complicated rules for switching and routing.
Five years ago, you might have found a wireless mesh network somewhere like an automated assembly line or a large institution. Today, you can find one in homes across the world thanks to cheap consumer-grade mesh equipment like Google Wifi.
Google Wifi's History
Google Wifi isn't the first set of small internet-enabled pucks to blanket your home with a meshed wireless signal. Other companies like Eero built essentially the same product that you could do the same thing — cover your entire house with good wireless coverage in every room.
The problem in 2016 when Google Wifi was released was the price. While companies like Netgear, Ubiquiti, or Luma made similar — and sometimes better-performing — wireless mesh networking setups, they were also expensive, with the cheapest being about $150 more than a pack of three Google Wifi units. Every tech shopper knows how important price is, especially if the product is still great.
And Google Wifi was great.
It all just worked, and that's why it
Google tends to make products that can be great at one thing but are also good or even average at plenty of other things at the same time. Google Wifi was not one of those kinds of Google products.
Once you got your package, a few minutes of reading and downloading an app was all you needed to get started. Setup was a breeze, and within minutes you had fully functioning wireless everywhere in your house — even in places that used to be dead spots.
You could be a tech superhero and add Ethernet cables to join nodes that were too far apart or add a wired switch, but all you actually needed was to plug a unit in and follow a few on-screen prompts to get everything running. Using it was simple, too. You just used it — no switching networks, no waiting for anything to do anything. It was seamless.
The features were great, too. You got the basic control every wireless network needs like a guest network and parental controls, and whenever any sort of wireless security issues were discovered (and new ones are found every day it seems) your Google Wifi silently updates in the middle of the night when it sees that nothing is using it.
Google has made a lot of products over the years, but few work as well as Google Wifi. And that's why it's one of our favorite products of the 2010s.

The Oculus Quest is no different, and that means that after a few hardcore sessions you might be wondering how to keep your headset and controllers clean. With a mixture of hard plastic, fabric, and foam pads it means that you'll need to use different methods for each different part of your Quest.
How to clean your Oculus Quest
Keeping your VR headset clean isn't just a good idea; it also makes for better gameplay. You don't want to put your face on a foam insert that feels damp from someone else's sweat, and dust in your lenses will definitely hamper your gameplay. With that in mind, we've broken down how to clean each individual section of your Oculus Quest.
How to clean your Quest lenses
When cleaning your lenses it's important that you remember that no liquid cleaner can be used. This means no damp paper towels, Lysol wipes, or lens cleaner should ever be applied.
- Use a compressed air cannister to clean out any dust or debris around your lenses.
- Use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe away any smudges or larger debris.
How to clean your Quest headset
- Use a wet wipe to clean off the front of your headset.
- Use a wet wipe to clean any smudges off of the straps at the side and back of your headset.
- Use a damp washcloth with mild detergent to spot clean the body of the headset.
How to clean your Quest foam facepad
- Gently remove the facepad from your Quest.
- Using gentle detergent handwash the face pad.
- Pat down the facepad to remove excess moisture
- Lay your facepad in a safe place to air dry.
- Re-insert it by pressing it back into place. Make sure it clips in at the top and bottom.
How to clean your Quest controllers
- Use a wet wipe to run over the various parts of your controller. A lightly damp paper towel can also work.
- Use a compressed air cannister to clean out any dirt or dust inside the analog stick or around buttons.
While you do need to make sure you're using the right kind of cleaning supplies, the actual cleaning doesn't take long at all. The most intensive cleaning process involves your facepad, and if you're the only person using the Quest then you don't need to clean as often. By keeping your Quest in a cool safe space away from moisture and dust you can also mitigate how often you'll need to clean it, which leaves more time to play.
Our top equipment picks
While you definitely need an Oculus Quest in order to play, having the right cleaning supplies on hand when you need them is important. Nobody wants to get ready to play and then realize that they need to go out for compressed air, or soft microfiber cloths to get the job done.
Untethered VR
Oculus Quest
No wires, no tether, no limits
The Oculus Quest delivers the first high-end wireless VR experience. With a headset and controller, you have everything you need to get started in VR in one simple package. Whether you want to watch videos or enjoy the best VR games out there, this is the headset to do it.
Oculus Quest offers all of the fun of a Rift without any of the wires involved. It's the next step forward in VR gameplay, and it's definitely a headset that anyone can enjoy, whether they are familiar with VR or not.
Additional Equipment
In order to properly clean your headset, you're going to want a few different cleaning supplies — namely compressed air and microfiber cloths. When it comes to clothes, the softer, the better because then you don't have to worry about scratching or damaging your Oculus Quest.

- NordVPN is now rolling out the WireGuard VPN tunneling protocol on all platforms.
- WireGuard offers significant speed benefits to existing VPN standards like OpenVPN.
- The VPN provider started integrating the standard last year on Linux, and it's now available on Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac as well.
- NordVPN is using a double NAT system to ensure privacy, and you can start using the new protocol right away by switching to the NordLynx standard.
If you're using a VPN to protect your privacy while browsing, there's a good chance that your VPN provider is using either OpenVPN or IPSec to create a secure tunnel. These two protocols have been a mainstay for a while now, but they have their drawbacks, particularly when it comes to end-to-end encryption.
Over the last 12 months, WireGuard has emerged as an alternative to the OpenVPN standard. WireGuard offers clear advantages when it comes to speed and is better at maintaining a connection — even on mobile — and as a result it has gained momentum. Essentially, think of WireGuard as the leaner and more secure alternative to OpenVPN and IPSec. WireGuard hit v1 earlier this year for Linux-based builds, and it's now gaining mainstream adoption by way of NordVPN. WireGuard was already available on a few VPNs like Mullvad, and services like IPVN already offer the protocol on all platforms. NordVPN is doing the same now.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
NordVPN is one of the best VPNs around for its feature-list and speed, and the service is now offering its users the ability to switch to the WireGuard protocol on all platforms. NordVPN started integrating WireGuard on Linux last year via a new feature called NordLynx, and starting today the protocol is available on all platforms, including Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and Linux. What this means is that if you're a NordVPN user, you will be able to switch to WireGuard regardless of whatever platform you're using.
While that's a welcome move, there's more to the story. Because WireGuard cannot dynamically assign IP addresses to all devices connected to a server, NordVPN is relying on a double NAT (Network Address Translation) system as a workaround.
This is the basis for the NordLynx feature, and it works like this:
To put it simply, the double NAT system creates two local network interfaces for each user. The first interface assigns a local IP address to all users connected to a server. Unlike in the original WireGuard protocol, each user gets the same IP address.
Once a VPN tunnel is established, the second network interface with a dynamic NAT system kicks in. The system assigns a unique IP address for each tunnel. This way, internet packets can travel between the user and their desired destination without getting mixed up.
The double NAT system allows us to establish a secure VPN connection without storing any identifiable data on a server. Dynamic local IP addresses remain assigned only while the session is active. Meanwhile, user authentication is done with the help of a secure external database.
NordVPN says that by using a double NAT system, it is able to provide the same levels of privacy while leveraging all the benefits on offer with WireGuard. NordVPN also mentions that the new standard "significantly outperformed" the likes of IKEv2 and OpenVPN in internal testing.
For now, NordVPN is sticking to OpenVPN as the default protocol on its service, but that may change based on how NordLynx fares in real-world testing. If you're a NordVPN user and are interested in trying out the new standard, just select the NordLynx protocol from the settings. NordVPN says it is currently rolling out the protocol to all users, and that everyone should be able to access it by April 24.
And if you haven't signed up yet, now is the time to make the switch to NordVPN. With plans starting at just $6.99 a month, there's no reason not to give the service a try.
NordVPN
With a no-logs policy and over 5,600 servers spread across the world, NordVPN is one of the best VPN services around. With the switch to WireGuard, you're guaranteed better connectivity and faster speeds, making an already-great VPN solution even better.
We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:
1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).
2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad.
We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services. Consuming pirated content that is paid-for is neither endorsed nor approved by Future Publishing.

Although a Chromebook's trackpad works well enough for most situations, a wireless mouse is best when using a larger display to multitask, or during intense video gaming sessions. Chromebooks are here to stay — and Google recently confirmed that it's even extending the lifetime of supported Chromebooks to nearly a decade. Most wireless mice will work with Chromebooks, whether you're a student looking to get one as a part of your overall selection of Chromebook accessories, or if you're a Chromebook user who craves more precise navigation. Here are some of the best Chromebook mice to meet your unique needs.
- No risk, easy set-up: Seenda Wireless Mouse
- Super quiet operation: ShhhMouse Wireless Ergonomic Mouse
- Slim and ambidextrous: Logitech Pebble M350 Bluetooth Mouse
- Long life, low price: Logitech Wireless Mouse M510
- Keep rollin' rollin' rollin': Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse
- It's got curves: Tecknet Wireless Mouse
- Swiss-Army Mouse: Logitech M720 Triathlon
- King of the Hill: Logitech MX Master 3
- Handshake design: Anker 2.4G Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Mouse
- Work or play comfortably: VicTsing Pioneer Wireless Mouse
- Just the necessities: Jelly Comb Slim Wireless Mouse
- For the gamers: TENMOS M2 Wireless Gaming Mouse
No risk, easy set-up: Seenda Wireless Mouse
Available in tons of cool colors including this pastel-like mint green, this versatile mouse is compact enough to throw into your bag and easy to set up via the USB dongle and instant connection via a 2.4GHz network without the need to install drivers. Plus, it comes with a lifetime warranty that promises a free replacement if it's defective.
Super quiet operation: ShhhMouse Wireless Ergonomic Mouse
With a reported 90% noise reduction compared to other standard mice, this is the perfect option if you work in cubicles or close to others and don't want to disturb them with your constant clicking. It also conserves battery through automatic sleep mode after eight minutes of activity. It's powered by a pair of AAA batteries, which come included.
Slim and ambidextrous: Logitech Pebble M350 Bluetooth Mouse
Looking for an ultra-portable and lightweight mouse that both lefties and righties can use? The Logitech Pebble M350 solves those problems with its slim design while featuring ultra-quiet scrolling, and up to 18 months of battery with a single AA battery.
Long life, low price: Logitech Wireless Mouse M510
If you want a wireless mouse that is comfortable to hold, comes in different colors, and has a long battery life — users report about one year on average — then check the Logitech M510. Your wallet will be as happy as you are!
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin': Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse
A trackball offers precision that you'll never get through hand and wrist movement but can also be something you don't want to use all of the time. The answer is this combo mouse and trackball from Logitech that gives the best of both worlds along with super-long battery life.
It's got curves: Tecknet Wireless Mouse
This basic wireless mouse employs a curved, ergonomic design that helps reduce wrist pressure and can be used both left- or right-handed. With a 30-month battery life, it operates on the 2.4GHz spectrum and is plug-and-play - no drivers needed.
Swiss-Army Mouse: Logitech M720 Triathlon
Start with a precision laser for accurate tracking, toss in a newly sculpted body, big free-spinning wheel, and redesigned thumb button, and you have this Logitech option. Keep the Bluetooth or USB receiver options and multi-device pairing from the original and see why we love the M720 Triathlon.
King of the Hill: Logitech MX Master 3
Some love it because of the shape, while others like it because of its ability to track anywhere (even frosted glass) or because it's rechargeable. But almost everyone (sorry lefties) agrees it's one of the best wireless mice you can buy for any computer including your Chromebook. If you have multiple computers or supported tablets, you can switch between them easier than ever.
Handshake design: Anker 2.4G Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Mouse
The "handshake" position when using a mouse for long periods of time means less strain on your wrist and forearm and it's well worth giving a vertical mouse a try. Anker makes that easy with its offering; you get a premium product and a cheap price tag along with a wrist that isn't sore at the end of the day.
Work or play comfortably: VicTsing Pioneer Wireless Mouse
Nobody likes being in the middle of a big project and then have their hands start to cramp or get sweaty. VicTsing helps to combat this with its ergonomic design, aiming to help fit the contours of your hands while providing a better grip on the sides. There's no USB-C, but VicTsing states the Pioneer's battery will last for up to a year before needing to recharge it.
Just the necessities: Jelly Comb Slim Wireless Mouse
If you're looking for a basic, no-nonsense mouse that has a slew of different colors to choose from, then the Jelly Comb Slim Wireless Mouse is perfect. There are more than 20 different colors to choose from, and when you're not using it, you can store the USB receiver in the mouse itself. There are no extra gimmicks, just a couple of buttons, the scroll wheel, and great battery life.
For the gamers: TENMOS M2 Wireless Gaming Mouse
The ergonomic shape, lag-free 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, and soft color-changing LED lights (that can be turned off if desired) make this mouse ideal for gamers. The funky-designed computer rodent companion runs on a built-in rechargeable lithium battery and comes with a charging cable. Silent clicks mean you can game away without distracting others.
Keep a mouse nearby
Chromebooks come with trackpads that are ideal for navigating the screen and various applications. But sometimes you really can benefit from using a mouse, especially a nice ergonomically designed one. Sometimes, a mouse just offers the precision you simply can't get from a trackpad. But which are the best mice for Chromebooks you can get?
When it comes to mice, you want something affordable, versatile, easy to use, and set up. The Seenda Wireless Mouse checks all of these boxes. The mouse works easily via plug and play without the need to install drivers so you'll be up and running in no time.
Out of all the Logitech products on the list, the Logitech Pebble M350 Bluetooth Mouse is compact and lightweight, making it ideal to bring home from the office for use or while traveling. Plus, it's designed to work equally well with lefties (like me!) and right-handed folks. The Logitech MX Master 3 is a favorite among Chromebook users, too, especially thanks to its ability to track on virtually any surface .
Ergonomic mice are always a big hit and once you get used to the design you'll find that your wrist and forearm feel better after a long day. It's great seeing products that won't break the bank like Anker's Vertical Mouse. When it comes to gaming, you can't get any funkier in design than the TENMOS M2 Wireless Gaming Mouse that has seven cool LED light colors and offers lag-free connectivity so you can keep up with the competition.

Oculus Quest 2 64GB
Extra room
Oculus Quest 2 256GB
Both versions of the Oculus Quest 2 support the same features and have the same library of games. The only difference is the amount of storage available and the price of each device. The Oculus Quest 2 is available now starting at $299.
Oculus Quest 2 64GB vs. Oculus Quest 2 256GB: What's the difference?
Storage and price: Those are the only factors to look at when comparing these devices. They both support all of the same games and features, and the form factor is also the same, so they work with the same accessories. They're even the same colors. The only difference is the amount of storage available and the price.
The price jump might be the main deciding factor for users because you don't give anything up when you opt for the option with more abundant storage.

The Oculus Quest 2 can be used for gaming and media, but many people will only store games directly on the device. Oculus Quest games vary in size, but even large ones are small enough that you can keep several on the Quest. For example, on my original Oculus Quest, Robo Recall: Unplugged takes up 2.87GB, Vader Immortal: Episode I takes up 2.58GB, and SUPERHOT VR uses 5.17GB.
Some well-recognized games are even smaller. Beat Saber only took up 2.95GB on my original Oculus Quest when I had songs sideloaded onto it. Media apps are relatively tiny, though the media you play on them can take up space.
Oculus Quest 2 64GB vs. Oculus Quest 2 256GB: How much storage do you really need?
If you're trying to be savvy with your money, or you don't want to pay for the storage you won't use, then it's crucial to examine how you plan to use the Oculus Quest 2 and figure out how much room you need.
If you're a hardcore gamer and you want to download a lot of titles on your Oculus Quest 2, then you should opt for the 256GB variant of the headset. The Oculus Quest 2 doesn't have a microSD card slot, so once it's full, you'll have to delete games or media to free up space.
If you plan to uninstall games as you get bored with them or finish them, then you're probably going to be just fine with the 64GB version.
One important thing to note is that games requiring Oculus Link, such as Half-Life: Alyx, don't take up additional storage on your Oculus Quest 2. This is a good thing since PCVR games can be massive. The games are stored on whatever PC you use to power your Oculus Link games, so you'll need to have space on your PC. Both the 64GB and 256GB versions of the Oculus Quest 2 can run games through Oculus Link, so if you're looking to connect your Oculus Quest 2 to your PC, either will work.
Oculus Quest 2 64GB vs. Oculus Quest 2 256GB: 64GB is enough (for most)
While games vary in size, they aren't large enough to require the 256GB variant of the Oculus Quest 2 for most people.
If you're the type of user that plays a specific set of games at a time and then removes them from a device, then you probably don't need to spend the extra money for an additional 192GB of storage.
If budget isn't a factor for you, or you want to make it more likely that you can always store your games and media on your VR headset, then you should get the 256GB variant. You don't give up any features when you increase storage size, so it's a one-time investment to get a better device.
As a bonus, Facebook upped the storage maximum for the Oculus Quest 2 when compared to the original Oculus Quest. Spending an extra $100 on an Oculus Quest 2 gets you for times the storage of the cheaper variant. Again, you might not need that extra storage, but it's a good bargain.
No matter which storage variant of the headset you choose, you'll get a great device. The Oculus Quest 2 earned an excellent score in our review and builds upon the already great original Oculus Quest.
Enough for most
Oculus Quest 2 64GB
Budget-friendly with enough storage for many users
The 64GB version of the Oculus Quest 2 supports all the same features and games as the larger version. While it's unfortunate that there isn't a microSD card slot, it has enough space for users who only keep specific games on their device at a time.
Room to work with
Oculus Quest 2 256GB
Enough storage for a larger library
This version with a larger storage capacity will be able to keep more games and media on your device at once. While it still doesn't have a microSD slot, it can store multiple games and several larger media files.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!These days the best VPNs, or virtual private networks, are used in a variety of different ways. Some use them for personal gains, like spoofing locations and securing connections, while others need a business VPN in order to be able to access important work-related files and sites. With how much of our day is spent connected to the internet, and how much sensitive information is sent around, it's vital that you keep your connections secure. If you aren't totally sure on the benefits, here's more about what a VPN is and why you should consider one.
With a VPN, your data is funneled through a provider's server and then gets to the destination, which helps mask what's going on and prevent people from being able to get into it. As companies move their employees to work from home, the need for a business VPN continues to grow so that people can access the important documents securely. Odds are as a business owner you don't want to host your data on a public connection, so you need a private way for the employees to be able to still have everything they need for completing daily work.
Once you establish a connection to your VPN all of your data becomes end-to-end encrypted, which means that outside eyes can not find their way into what you are doing. If by some off chance someone were able to access your machine or what you were doing, they would not be able to decode it and see what was actually going on.
Business VPNs come in a bunch of different varieties. Many of them can be scaled to fit the needs of your organization, which makes it a great choice for small and large businesses alike. What sets a true business VPN apart from some of the other options that are aimed more towards individuals is that they offer a dedicated IP address on a personal server, not one that is shared like on the consumer side. These are designed with securing the company in mind, instead of just securing a single user.
There are a bunch of providers that offer great business services, and picking the right one absolutely depends on the needs of your business. Some have device limits, others offer a wider variety of servers and locations, and pricing obviously ranges between the services. Unlike on the consumer side, there are no free VPN options for the business customers.
Don't worry, though. We've spent some time looking through all the different options out there, and have narrowed down a small list of the absolute best business VPNs that are available right now. Whether you are a business owner looking to roll out a VPN for your employees or an employee looking to ensure your data is kept safe while you work from home, be sure to check out the list below and get started today.
Perimeter 81
Whether you own or work at a small to medium sized business, Perimeter 81 is the best business VPN available. It's the one we recommend looking at for a variety of reasons, including the company's willingness to customize plans for your needs. There is, however, a five person minimum for teams, so if you don't have five employees this may not be the right option for you or your company.
Perimeter 81's services are all based in the cloud, which means scaling up and down is super simple and more affordable for your business. You don't need to worry about changing out hardware or anything like that, it's all handled on Permiter's side. There are three different plan options to pick from, with prices starting at just $10 per month for each team member.
Unlike some other business software, Perimeter 81 has a great app that's available on a variety of different devices to ensure maximum compatibility. You can use it on Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, iOS, and Android. Permiter 81 has tight security protocols and uses OpenVPN, IKEv2, L2TP, and PPTP backed by WireGuard connector. There's an automatic Wi-Fi security and it offers a software-defined perimeter (SDP) that limits network access via a system control.
The two-factor authentication is both easy to use and reliable. It works well whether you are using a mobile device connected to a public network or your home PC connected to your network.
Should you run into any issues while using Perimeter 81 you'll be happy to hear that the company offers great support, and if you are unhappy with the purchase you have a 30-day money-back guarantee.
Perimeter 81
Perimeter 81 is the leader in business VPNs at the moment, and the option we recommend for most people. You will need to activate five users to get started, and from there the company can scale plans to your needs.
Encrypt.me
Much like Perimeter 81, Encrypt.me can be scaled based upon the needs of your business so that you're always paying for what you are actually using. What sets it apart, though, is that the minimum number of team members required for the business plan is only two, and the company allows you to use it on an unlimited number of devices for each account. This is great for those who are juggling between their phone, tablet, and PC during the day to get things done.
Encrypt.me is available on all the major platforms, including Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android, and even Amazon. All you have to do is download the app and walk through the set up procedure, and you'll be good to go.
On the security front, Encrypt.me offers all the standard stuff you'd expect from a VPN along with a few other features that are nice to have. Some of them include private endpoints, an Auto-Secure feature, DNS protection, and more. This will make it easy for employees to remotely connect to the information they need while not in the office.
Something worth noting is that Encrypt.me does keep some session logs, which is something most other VPN providers are not doing these days. This isn't to say it's monitoring your activities or anything, just that it does have records of who is connecting, and when.
Pricing starts at $15.98 per month, and like we previously mentioned you do need two team members to get started with this. If you're looking for an option to try out in the short-term while your employees are working from home, this may be the way to go.
Encrypt.me
With Encrypt.me you can get started with as little as two users and each of them can use an unlimited number of devices at once. The pricing is affordable and the feature-set is well rounded.
ExpressVPN
ExpressVPN is our best VPN pick on the consumer side, and while the company doesn't offer a specific "business plan," that doesn't mean it can't be a great pick for some situations. If you're running a small business, or happen to be self-employed and want to protect yourself, ExpressVPN can do great things for you. It does have a maximum of five devices that can be connected to each account at one time, which is less than some other providers.
The ExpressVPN app works on all major platforms, including Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Fire TV, Chromebooks, Nook, Firefox, Chrome, and more. It's super easy to set up, and connecting to the VPN is as simple as clicking one button once you get started.
By default, ExpressVPN offers great encryption, split tunneling, and operates with a very clear no-logging policy. There are dedicated DNS servers available, and while you may pay a bit more than some other consumer VPN options to use ExpressVPN, it's worth every penny.
Right now, if you sign up for the 12-month plan you can save 49% on the purchase and score an extra three months of service at no cost to you. ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee as well, so there's no risk in trying it out today.
ExpressVPN
This is our top pick for anyone looking to get started with a VPN. It offers a great mix of speed, reliability, outstanding customer service, and affordability. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee, so give it a shot today.
NordVPN Teams
On the consumer side, NordVPN has always been a popular choice, and the company hopes to achieve the same on the business side with NordVPN Teams. Like other options, NordVPN Teams can be customized to meet your needs, though there is a minimum of five users to get started.
What sets NordVPN Teams apart from the rest is that it offers a double encryption, which is something that other companies are simply not offering. This means that if someone were to be able to get their hands on what you were doing, there's no possible chance that they could figure out what was actually taking place, and instead it would all just be a jumbled mess. In addition, Nord offers a kill switch that helps keep your sessions secure, even if your connection drops out for some reason.
NordVPN has a strict no-logging policy, and when you sign up for a business account you actually get a dedicated business VPN server. This is key because it offers a dedicated IP address for your team to connect to so they can access the sensitive documents that they need for work.
Pricing is done on a per-company basis, which means that you'll need to reach out to NordVPN via a support form to get started.
NordVPN Teams
Much like the consumer product, NordVPN Teams has a heavy focus on privacy and reliability. The apps are easy to use and the pricing is tailored to your company, so be sure to reach out for a quote today.
VyprVPN
If speed is what you are looking for in a business VPN, you'll want to look no further than VyprVPN. The company manages all of its own servers, and when you start to check out the performance of them you'll understand why that is important. In testing, we've noticed that using VyprVPN could actually provide better download speeds for some people than their standard connection could without using a VPN.
In terms of security features to match the speed, VyprVPN offers OpenVPN support, NAT Firewall, and its own Chameleon technology that helps add an extra layer of security to the mix. There is also 24/7 support in case you run into any issues while using the VPN, which is great since odds are most of your employees will be new to using a VPN.
The company doesn't give as much information publicly about its business VPN plans as some of the others, but there is a bit we do know. You can sign up for a Business or Business Cloud package, with prices starting at $299 or $349 for the year respectively. You'll need to reach out to VyprVPN customer support to get the exact details based on your business' needs, though the company does offer a free trial which is something you should definitely take advantage of.
VyprVPN
Of all the business VPN options out there, VyprVPN is the fastest. If your employees will need to download or upload large files, this may be the best option for you.
PureVPN
PureVPN offers both a consumer and business product, and does both of them quite well. On the business side PureVPN offers some extra features that you won't find on the consumer side, and its product is trusted and used by companies like Disney, Amazon, DHL, ABC, Microsoft, and more.
PureVPN has a global network of over 2,000 servers spread across 140 different countries, offers a dedicated IP for your teams, along with a dedicated server. This is all in addition to the normal encryption, no-logging, and IP whitelisting that you always get with the service. There's an easy-to-use Admin Control Panel so you can create, edit, and delete IPs, along with managing the permissions of the users on your team.
You can use it with all the popular devices, like Windows, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Chrome, Fire TV Sticks, Raspberry Pi, Roku, and much more. Pricing starts at $8.45 per user each month for just the Teams access, and goes up to $9.99 if you add a dedicated IP address. If you want to go all-in with a dedicated server, pricing starts at $399 a month, and you need to contact PureVPN before you can sign up for that.
There's a lot to like about PureVPN, so it's worth giving them a try. The company offers a free 31-day money-back guarantee as well, so there's no real risk in getting started today.
PureVPN
PureVPN is so confident you'll like its service, that it offers a whole extra day on its money-back guarantee than others do. Jokes aside, it offers a ton of server options spread wide in different areas, and offers great customer support with affordable options for all business sizes.

Do I need a VPN for my business?
There's no yes or no answer that fits for everyone here. What it comes down to is where your employees are working, and what kind of data they are accessing. If you have people working remotely, and they need access to your business documents and systems on the go, you should have them behind a VPN. This keeps you secure, and makes it so that they can't do something unsafe by accident.
It's a rather affordable way to beef up the security of your company. You don't need to invest in lots of expensive hardware and support. Most of the companies above have cloud-based systems which are easy to install and manage. It may not be something you thought of in the past, but as your company expands, and circumstances change, it may be time to make the investment and get a corporate VPN set up for your business.
We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:
1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).
2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad.

Get the right 5G phone
Pretty much every flagship phone released in 2020 has 5G support and it's no surprise that most of the best Android phones you can get right now have 5G. Verizon phones are a bit of a different story and may require a software update to access Verizon's nationwide 5G network. There's no timeline for when or if this update will come to unlocked phones though it's possible.
For most people, the most important thing is to make sure your phone supports the sub-6 5G bands your carrier uses. AT&T and Verizon phones should have support for band n5 while T-Mobile phones should support both n41 and n71. If you want the fastest possible connection you can get a phone that also supports mmWave for the few places that have mmWave coverage.
If you're getting a pre-owned phone or just an older phone like the Galaxy S10 5G, there's a good chance that it won't support all of the bands in use by your carrier, and in the case of Sprint phones, may not work with 5G at all anymore. The only 5G Sprint phones you should get right now are in the Galaxy S20 series.
It's also worth remembering that an AT&T phone that advertises itself as 5G Evolution ready actually doesn't have any 5G support at all. AT&T's 5Ge network is simply LTE rebranded.
5G coverage is finally here
All three major carriers now have some sort of nationwide sub-6 5G network. Sub-6 5G has much greater coverage than the mmWave 5G deployed early on by AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. This 5G now covers hundreds of millions of Americans.
Each carrier has been consistently adding additional coverage to its 5G network and will likely see the majority of the network improvements going forward. The speeds on sub-6 5G won't be anything special compared to a mature LTE network but as more spectrum is able to be dedicated to 5G, the speeds should catch up and surpass LTE in the coming years.
Make sure you get the right plan
Luckily, sub-6 5G is included with most plans you can sign up for right now. On AT&T, 5G access is included with all unlimited plans though many of the older data plans won't get support. This is different from both T-Mobile and Verizon with nationwide 5G working on all plans as long as you've got a supported phone.
Many prepaid carriers also included 5G on some or all of their plans. Visible, for example, has announced that it will offer 5G on Verizon's nationwide 5G network in 2020. T-Mobile-based carriers like Mint Mobile already offer 5G on all plans.
With support on most new phones, plans, and carriers, it's finally worth it to choose 5G when you buy your next new phone.
5G as standard
Samsung Galaxy S20
Sub-6 5G and great hardware
Samsung put 5G in every Galaxy S20 series phone bringing faster speeds, a 120Hz display, and some of the best cameras ever put in a phone.

Just cradle it: Brainwavz Screwless Wall Mount
The Brainwavz Screwless Wall Mount is perfect for those who either live in an apartment or don't want to muddy up the walls with screwholes.

The cradle has been specifically designed to house your Eero Wi-FI stations thanks to the curved design to keep it in place without interrupting your network connectivity.

Compatible with both the Eero Home Wi-Fi and Eero Pro Wi-Fi, it is easy to push-in and push-out to connect the Eero router to this wall bracket.

Plug it in: Mount Genie Eero Wi-Fi Genie

The silicone band attaches to your Eero to not only keep it in place, but to cut down on the potential interference.
Get better signal: Relassy Wall Mount Bracket (3-pack)
Relassy's Wall Mount Bracket can be placed practically anywhere in the home without the need for screws, as it includes 3M tape.

This bracket also features Torx head screws that hold your Eero into the bracket and will help deter those who want to remove the Eero.
Just the Pro: STANSTAR Wall Mount Brackets
With the STANSTAR Wall Mount Brackets, owners of the Eero Pro can rejoice knowing that they are able to easily mount the routers without drilling into the wall.

Save some space and get one of the best Eero mounts
You'll need an Eero mount that will protect your router from getting dirty or damaged by yourself, your kids, or even your pets. There's also the matter of stability, keeping your router safe and secure. With security and aesthetics in mind, the Mrount Eero Wall Mount Bracket is the perfect fit for any home.
In some instances, there are not really any "perfect" places to mount your Eero in your home. Instead, there is an excellent option with the DG-Direct Wall Mount Holder as this plugs directly into your outlet. Plus, you won't have to worry about putting any holes in your walls or the ceiling to mount your Eero.

To start things off, version 1.1 is expected to drop on November 11 and according to Redditor Zlunlu's translation, will fix several bugs to improve the game's stability.

- With more and more schools closing in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Audible has audiobooks for your kids.
- Completely free of charge, hundreds of titles have been hand-selected for young people ages 0-18.
- Available in six different languages, these titles promise to entertain, engage, and educate.

Telecommuting saves you from fighting traffic, saves your employer the costs of renting or buying a big office, and cuts down on carbon emissions. There are a lot of reasons why it's great.
But it can also be a bit difficult getting used to working from home. For most people, home is where you relax and wind down from a workday. But when your home is also your office, you need to find ways to mix productive time with leisure time. I've been working from home for 10 years and can tell you how I do it.
Coronavirus and tech: Ongoing list of event cancellations, disruptions, product delays, and more
Get up and go to work
Some people think working from home means you roll out of bed at noon and spend the day at a desk in your underwear. While that's one way to look at it, it helps if you act like you're actually going to work.
You're still going to work.
Set your alarm with enough time to eat a bit of breakfast or get some exercise and grab a morning shower. Even all three if that's your normal routine. Just because your office is now inside your house doesn't mean you should break your daily routine. The urge to sleep late or skip the daily morning jog will be tempting you, but don't give in.

I get up every morning at 8 a.m. and eat breakfast with my wife while we listen to the news. Then I grab a quick shower and head downstairs to my office space where I'm ready to start at 9 — just like I would if I were working downtown.
Set a dedicated workspace
I'm lucky in that I have a spare room that I turned into an office. I have my desk, my work computer, some decor on the walls and shelves filled with books and things that are all work-related. I also have a nice bright overhead light and plenty of space to do what I need to do.
Separate work from home even if you work from home.
That sounds a lot like a typical office; the only thing missing is a co-worker. But it's really important to separate work from home, even if you work from your home.
You might not have a spare room, but you don't really need one. Just set aside a place that has what you need to work at hand, and try not to fill it with distractions. Instead, find a spot for a good mouse and a good keyboard to pair with a work laptop or Chromebook which makes an excellent remote work machine. You might be able to find a corner in your bedroom or living room, or maybe you have a small counter in the kitchen. Where isn't as important and being consistent — try not to carry a laptop around and sit on the couch all day.
Best Chromebook

The best Chromebook just got better.
With double the USB ports and 8GB models on the horizon, Lenovo's aluminum-lidded laptop is more than a pretty face.
Tell your family that you're working
The biggest hurdle I found when I started working at home was having to remind my family that I was at work even if I was in what used to be the rec room. And remember, it's a hard adjustment for your family or roommates, too.
Quality time with the family is great once the work is done.
I don't recommend locking yourself away in a room or the corner, but your workspace needs to be your workspace. Just because your spouse or a child or roommate might be at home for the day, too, doesn't mean they should be spending time keeping you from what needs to be done.
Set a few ground rules for everyone in the house — including you — to follow and stick to them. Don't isolate yourself and spend the day as a loner, but don't stop working and start chit-chatting every time someone walks near your office space.
Remember you're working
If you work from home chances are you're doing it on a computer and online. Being online all day means there are about a million things out there trying to keep you from being productive.
Resist the temptation to watch videos or play games or spend all day on Facebook. Your boss might not be looking over your shoulder but they will know if you aren't spending time working and are just goofing off.
Remember break time
At the office, you probably take a break or two every day or get up for a drink of water when you're thirsty. Keep those good habits when you're working from home.
Your desk isn't the right place to eat lunch even if it is also your dining table.
Be sure to step away from your desk for lunch or even a cup of coffee mid-morning every day. Don't grab some finger food and sit at your desk during lunchtime. Your mind needs a break just like your body does and sitting in your work chair in front of your work computer eating a sandwich isn't giving it a proper break.

Silence is bad for you
While you definitely shouldn't spend the day watching Netflix, some background noise can be important. At the office you probably have some co-workers talking or some piped-in music or all sorts of sounds that you don't even notice. You need the same thing at home.
Spotify: Everything you need to know
Streaming music services are a godsend here. Something like a Spotify radio station opened in a browser tab or streaming from your phone to a Bluetooth speaker can provide the ambient sounds you need so you don't feel like you're spending time in solitary confinement. Just look through them, find one that seems like it will fit the bill, and start it up. A custom playlist can work, but be careful not to spend the day singing or playing virtual drums with a pencil all day!
Best Overall Bluetooth Speaker
Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2
The best budget Bluetooth speaker around.
The Wonderboom 2 combines excellent sound quality with a rugged design, IP67 water resistance, and 13-hour battery life.
Make yourself at home
Most offices allow things like photos on your desk or a picture on the wall and your home office should be no different — especially if you're using a dedicated room for "the office" like I am.
I have posters, pictures of the kids, pictures I've painted and a small aquarium in my office so I don't feel like everything has been sanitized. I leave the door open so if the dog wanders in I can reach down and give her a little head scratch so she knows how much I love her.
If your office space isn't comfortable, you won't be as productive as you can be. Find a comfortable space and a comfortable chair and make it your own without making it a distraction.

Are you searching for the best speakers for your Echo Dot? I love how easy the Echo Dot makes it to listen to music, search for the news, add items to your grocery list, and do so much more. The device's sound quality isn't terrible, but if for a better audio experience, I prefer to pair it with compatible speakers. There are hundreds if not thousands out there for you to choose from, but our favorite is the Sonos One SL. Here are some of our other favorite picks.
- Best Overall Speakers for Echo Dot: Sonos One SL
- Best Budget Speakers for Echo Dot: OontZ Angle 3
- Best Portable Speakers for Echo Dot: Anker SoundCore 2
- Best Speaker Dock for the Echo Dot: Nomodo Speaker Dock
- Best Upgrade Speaker Dock for the Echo Dot: Cyber Acoustics Portable Speaker

Best Overall Speakers for Echo Dot: Sonos One SL
Sonos is known for its powerful hi-fi speakers, but it makes the dream of owning them a little more accessible with the One SL. Not only is this the most affordable wireless speaker the company offers, but it also produces impressive sound quality and looks stylish to boot. Since it's built so compactly, it won't take up a lot of space in your home. Both the black and the white version look good, so you can purchase the look you like best.
It features a midrange woofer and a tweeter that are powered by their own amplifier. You'll find that it pairs beautifully with the Echo Dot and other Alexa-enabled devices so you can control music by merely giving a voice command. If you want, you can purchase two of these speakers and set them up in the same room to provide a stereo audio experience.
One thing to note is that wireless connectivity is done through Wi-Fi; it doesn't support Bluetooth. Technically, Wi-Fi gives a better sound experience, but some might find the lack of connection options to be a downside. Similarly, you'll find an Ethernet port on the backside for a better internet connection. However, there is no 3.5mm auxiliary input, which some users might find limiting. Lastly, the Sonos One SL is intended to be a permanent fixture that's plugged in at all times, so it doesn't have a built-in battery for portable use.
Pros:
- Two color options
- Compact design
- Easy to use
- Can connect with other Sonos speakers
- Wi-Fi connectivity
Cons:

Best Budget Speakers for Echo Dot: OontZ Angle 3
Now, if you're looking for something quick and cheap, the Oontz Angle 3 is the speaker to get. Despite its small size, it offers decent audio that rivals more expensive devices. At higher volumes, the bass has been known to struggle. One of the things we like about it is the number of colors it comes in. Choose from blue, white, orange, red, and of course, black to spice up any room. It will last up to 14 hours and work up to 100 feet away from the transmitting device.
As far as construction goes, the middle is cased in plastic while the edges are covered with a soft rubber that feels good to the touch. The 3.5mm headphone jack and micro USB port are protected behind a rubber flap. That being said, while it is water-resistant, it isn't fully waterproof, so you'll want to be careful when using it near a pool or bathtub. When it comes time, you can connect it to your Echo Dot using Bluetooth or using a cable.
Pros:
- Up to 14 hours of battery
- Works up to 100 feet away
- Five color options
- Compact design
- Easy to use
- Inexpensive
Cons:

OontZ Angle 3
A good, inexpensive speaker
This option is cheaper than many other speakers and still provides decent sound quality and connection options.
Best Portable Speakers for Echo Dot: Anker SoundCore 2
You usually can't go wrong with Anker, an electronics company that's proven its worth, especially when it comes to power banks. Unsurprisingly, the Anker SoundCore offers one of the most extended battery life options we've ever seen in a portable speaker — up to 24 hours of music listening on one battery charge. What's more, you won't have to pay a fortune for it as it's priced lower than many other speakers of the same quality. However, the bass is known to have problems when handling higher volumes.
Connect your Dot wirelessly with Bluetooth or use the auxiliary input to connect the two devices with a cable. The wireless connection works up to 66 feet away so you can take it with you from room to room without disturbing the link to the Dot. It's also perfect for pool parties and outdoor activities since it's waterproof. As with most speakers, it comes in classic black, or you can get it in blue or red if you want something with a bit more color.
Pros:
- Up to 24 hours of battery
- Inexpensive
- Works with paired devices up to 66 feet away
- Three color choices
- Waterproof
Cons:
Best Portable Speakers for Echo Dot
Anker SoundCore 2
A quality speaker at an affordable cost
Using a Bluetooth connection, it works up to 66 feet away from your Echo Dot, either around the house or outside.
Best Speaker Dock for the Echo Dot: Nomodo Echo Dot Speaker Dock
If you're worried about how cluttered a room can look with both an Echo Dot and a speaker, you might want to consider getting a speaker dock to combine the two. Nomodo's speaker works with the 2nd Gen Echo Dot and provides up to 10 hours of music listening on one battery charge. This means you can take it with you around your home or even outside. Unlike many of the other speakers you'll find on the market, this one looks stylish with its fabric covering that you can get in four different colors. Choose from Red, Navy Blue, Charcoal, and Grey to fit the decor of your home.
As with most inexpensive speakers, the sound quality won't be as good as what you'd find with a fancier device. However, it works well and does enhance the Echo Dot's speaker by quite a bit. It may or may not bother you, but it's worth noting that the Echo Dot doesn't lay flush on top of the device. This is done to make the Dot easier to place and remove from the dock, but it can be unpleasant for some to look at. While you can command Alexa at any point in time by saying her name, this dock must be turned on and off manually. You'll need to remember to switch it off if you want to save battery power.

Best Upgrade Speaker Dock for the Echo Dot: Cyber Acoustics Portable Speaker
For those that have purchased the most recent Echo Dot (3rd Gen), you'll want to check out this compact portable speaker dock. Its modern design matches the Echo Dot beautifully. The Echo Dot slots right in at the top of the speaker, and thankfully, the ring of light around the top is left visible. This way, you can know if Alexa has heard you or if it's having any issues.
Its small size makes it a great addition to a bedside table or desk, and it's also super portable. Take it with you anywhere and take advantage of the six-hour battery life. A built-in led around the speaker will liven up any get together, and the high-efficiency tweeter and front and rear drivers allow for 360-degree, room-filling sound.
Pros:
- Up to six hours of battery life
- Multi-colored LED for entertainment
- Charges with Echo Dot charging cable
- Compact size
Cons:

Best Splurge Speakers for Echo Dot: Sonos Five
The Sonos Five is pricey, but it provides beautifully deep bass and crisp sound thanks to the three high-excursion woofers and two tweeters it employs. Setting it up with your Echo Dot is easy, so you'll be listening to your favorite songs via voice commands in no time.
If the sound quality isn't enough, then there's also the sleek design. Considering what it offers, this speaker is pretty compact and will look good on your shelf or entertainment center. Since it's a high-end speaker, it would be nice if it came with a remote, but it doesn't. You'll have to rely on Alexa or an app to control it from a distance.
One of the nice things about it is that you can stand it up vertically or horizontally to better fit in your home. A built-in sensor adjusts sound quality accordingly, no matter which way the device is oriented. You can even pair it with another Sonos Five5 to create stereo sound in your home. On the backside, you'll find a 3.5mm jack so you can plug in a compatible device and listen to music that way. This speaker supports Bluetooth, as well as high-quality connections via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, to pair with other devices.
Pros:
- Excellent sound
- Looks good
- Simple setup and pairing
- Bluetooth and 3.5mm audio jack
- Wi-Fi connectivity
Cons:

Best Speaker Enhancement for Echo Dots: Echo Link Amp
Alright, alright, this definitely isn't a speaker, and it doesn't come with one. However, if you already own a fancy speaker system and are looking to connect your Alexa device with it, this is a good option. You'll find inputs and outputs for both digital and analog devices on the backside of the amp. This means it works with a vast number of speakers.
The design of the box isn't anything special. I mean, it only comes in one color and doesn't have anything exciting about it. However, the fact that it's so simple and compact makes it easier to store on a shelf next to other electronics or decor. It sets up in minutes. Just use the proper cables to hook it up to your speakers, internet, and Echo Dot. Then you'll be good to go.
Pros:

Pump up your Echo Dot Kids' Edition with these Bluetooth speakers
Unfortunately, the speaker found on the Echo Dot Kids isn't the best. Luckily, there are plenty of speaker options available on the market for you to pair with the Echo Dot Kids. Here are a few of our favorite choices and why.AT&T has one of the most developed 5G networks out right now with millimeter-wave coverage alongside low-band coverage in several cities. Both networks are available to customers with phones capable of connecting to both networks. AT&T has been aggressively expanding its 5G network and now approximates coverage for 120 million people with 190 markets. 80 Million are covered by the more accessible low-band network. Here's what you need to know if you are considering switching to, or upgrading your phone on AT&T.
When will my area get 5G?
As of July 23, 2020, AT&T has officially launched its nationwide 5G network.
As far as 5G goes, AT&T is building two networks. One network is a low-band sub-6 5G deployment at 850MHz. The majority of customers will see 5G on this network. The other network is a high-band mmWave network that is capable of very fast speeds but has a much more limited range. Currently only the Samsung Galaxy S20+ and S20 Ultra can connect to both networks with most phones using the 850MHz network exclusively.
Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, or DSS, is a technique that reuses spectrum currently used for 4G with both 4G and 5G as the need grows. Unlike the refarming spectrum from LTE and simply moving capacity from one network to the other, DSS is able to keep both networks active and allocate portions of that spectrum as needed to either 4G or 5G. On June 5, 2020, AT&T began deploying DSS to improve connectivity for 5G customers without reducing capacity on the older 4G network. While currently only live in northern Texas, this type of deployment should be seen much wider use later in the year.
AT&T began preparing its towers for a 5G network with LTE upgrades it called 5GE. This essentially added the network capacity on the backend for 5G including upgraded fiber network connections. If you see 5GE on your older AT&T phone, this is not actually 5G and is actually 4G LTE with tower upgrades that make the most of LTE technology.
True 5G is now shown on AT&T's standard coverage maps which makes it easier than ever to see how far this coverage has made it. It does take a while for these maps to get updated so check out the entire list for the most up-to-date locations.
We have a full list of cities covered by AT&T's 5G network below.
Which phones work with 5G?
AT&T now has several devices capable of 5G including the Samsung Galaxy S20 series as well as the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G. The LG V60 ThinQ 5G also works with 5G on AT&T. Some business customers were able to get the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G in 2019 however this phone only connects to the mmWave network.
|Device||Low-band (850MHz)||mmWave|
|LG V60 ThinQ 5G||✔️||❌|
|LG Velvet 5G||✔️||❌|
|Samsung Galaxy A71 5G||✔️||❌|
|Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G||✔️||❌|
|Samsung Galaxy Note 20 5G||✔️||❌|
|Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G||✔️||✔️|
|Samsung Galaxy S10 5G||❌||✔️|
|Samsung Galaxy S20 5G||✔️||❌|
|Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G||✔️||✔️|
|Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G||✔️||✔️|
|Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5G||✔️||✔️|
Which plan do I need?
Postpaid AT&T customers will need either the Unlimited Extra plan or the Unlimited Elite plan. These plans are among AT&T's most expensive plans coming in at $75 per month at $85 per month respectively for one line.
Starting August 7, 2020, AT&T is launching 5G access for the Unlimited Starter plan as well.
With AT&T Prepaid, you can only get 5G with the most expensive Unlimited Data Plus plan which comes in at $75 per month for one line.
On August 21, 2020, Cricket Wireless launched 5G support on both AT&T's sub-6 and mmWave network. 5G is available with Cricket's top-end unlimted plan as well as itsSimply Data plans data-only plans. If you were looking to get 5G access with a ton of data, Cricket is one of your best bets.
Sub-6 5G on Cricket is being called Cricket 5G while mmWave is called Cricket 5G+ matching AT&T's own branding. AT&T's 5G network still isn't the biggest but it has had some solid growth over the past months and has a solid coverage map so you can see if you are covered.
What tech is AT&T using for 5G?
AT&T is using mmWave technology to deliver fast 5G service. This uses high-band spectrum above 24 GHz for coverage. This spectrum is available in large chunks allowing for enormous speeds of over 2 Gbps in ideal conditions. It remains to be seen how this will hold up under a true public load, but the early prospects are good.
AT&T has also launched a low-band sub-6 5G network at 850MHz. This is the network that the majority of customers will be able to connect to since it has much better coverage than mmWave. This service is much more in line with what we've seen from Sprint and T-Mobile as far as speed and coverage. Typically, this means speeds faster than those that LTE can deliver but not by as much as you would expect. Still, some of the other benefits of 5G such as better traffic management and capacity will be worth the trade once the network is built out.
AT&T has also started reusing some of its LTE spectrum for 5G with Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) which will perform much like its existing low-band 5G network. The main difference is that this spectrum will be able to be used on the 4G LTE network or the 5G network as needed without taking either fully offline. This will help AT&T smoothly transition use of its large amounts of spectrum currently dedicated to its 4G LTE network to 5G customers.
With the Samsung Galaxy S20+ and S20 Ultra capable of connecting to both networks, consumers finally have access to the entire network. Most 5G phones only use the sub-6 network due to a smaller and simpler antenna setup and lower cost.

- Is 5G dangerous or is it safe?
- Does 5G use more battery than LTE?
- What is 5G Technology?
What is 5Ge?
LTE isn't the same today as it was on day one. Periodic upgrades to the underlying technology have made LTE more efficient and faster over time. The most modern version of this is called LTE Advanced. This tech offers the best consumer wireless technology outside of 5G and can produce some very strong speeds that are more than enough for almost any application. This isn't abnormal since LTE stands for long term evolution and was designed to evolve and grow as technology improved.
AT&T is moving its LTE Advanced towers along a path towards 5G coverage thanks to these towers having high-speed backhauls that can support 5G speeds. This is why they have renamed their 4G LTE Advanced service to 5Ge with a software update. Short for 5G Evolution, this is framed as the first step towards an actual 5G network, though, not everyone agrees.
The fact of the matter is that this 5Ge network is the best of LTE and if you are using an older phone that is unusably slow in crowded areas, it may be worth it to get a phone that supports these enhancements. Don't expect speeds to be a huge difference but latency and connection quality can be improved.

AT&T has started to bring some 5G experiences to some sports stadiums including the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. AT&T is also working with the NBA and WNBA to demonstrate the power of 5G. While these are basically just tech demos, it can be a way to see what lies ahead for 5G.
Is 5G worth it for most people?
In ideal conditions, 4G LTE is fast enough for most people. One problem is that these good speeds lead to data usage that is constantly increasing as the quality of media improves and download sizes grow. With LTE technology, there will be a hard ceiling on the amount of data one tower can deliver and the user experience will start to suffer.
Currently, you need one of AT&T's more expensive unlimited plans to even access 5G so it's really only worth it to the heaviest data users.

The Polk Audio Command is essentially a three-in-one device. First, and most obvious of all, this is a soundbar + subwoofer combo. As such, it replaces your television's crappy built-in speakers for audio that'll knock you off your feet. Utilizing Dolby and DTS technology, the Polk Audio Command is capable of kicking out really great sound. There are two 3-inch drivers and two 1-inch tweeters in the main soundbar, with the wireless subwoofer offering a punchy 6.5-inch driver at 100 watts. Everything from movies to music is blasted with a noticeable thump thanks to the standalone subwoofer, giving you better bass than you'll find with the more expensive Sonos Beam.
Looking at the sound bar, you've likely noticed by now the Echo Dot-like circle in the middle of it. This brings us to the Command's second function, and that's as an Alexa speaker. Just like you would with any Amazon Echo, you can talk to Alexa via the Polk Audio Command by saying "Alexa" at any time. Want to see what the weather is going to be like for the day? Ask Alexa. Have a smart thermostat and need to crank the heat up? Alexa can do that, too. Not sure how tall the Empire State Building is? Alexa knows. Whether you already have other Alexa-powered speakers or this is your first one, having Alexa built into the Polk Audio Command is a welcome touch.

Plus, the sound bar has built-in support for audio services like Amazon Music, Pandora, TuneIn, iHeartRadio, and more.

- VR game developers are seeing as high as a 10x increase in sales since the launch of the Oculus Quest 2.
- Both big names and indie developers are seeing huge spikes in sales, including games on the 3rd-party SideQuest platform.
- Additional sales help boost future development, meaning more content and new games on the horizon.
Since the launch of the Oculus Quest 2 just 3 days ago, developers from all over the spectrum of VR gaming are reporting a significant spike in sales. From big names to smaller indie studios, the Oculus Quest 2 is having a huge impact on game sales and, ultimately, the success of the VR industry.
Specifically, we're seeing reports from studios like Cloudhead Games, makers of Pistol Whip, showing an 10x increase in sales. The Curious Tale of the Stolen Pets and Apex Construct developer Fast Travel Games is seeing an 800% spike in sales, while Angry Birds VR and Blaston developer Resolution Games cites a 500% jump.
What might be even more impressive is that indie developers behind games like Hand Physics Lab and Deism, which are only available on the SideQuest platform, are seeing huge sales boosts and increased downloads from Quest 2 owners. That's a big deal because the SideQuest marketplace can only be used after players have gone through additional steps to sideload it onto their Oculus Quest, showing that players are hungry for as much content as they can possibly get.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
These numbers are important, not just because they are increased sales for developers who rely on a platform's success, but because it means that lots of new players are joining the fray. After all, if you were already invested in the VR ecosystem and were interested in these games, you probably would have already owned a copy. Additional sales also benefit gamers, as it means increased attention can be paid to games, enhancing them with better graphics on the Oculus Quest 2 and maybe even providing new content, as well. Now that's something to get excited about.

And if you're looking for something with a bit more personality, there are three colors to choose from.
Stand it up: Samsung Clear Standing Cover
It doesn't matter how big a phone really is, being able to prop it up to watch some YouTube can be quite valuable. With the Clear Standing Cover for the Galaxy S20 FE, you'll get a built-in kickstand on the back, along with a transparent TPU cover wrapping around your device.
Through the window: Samsung S-View Flip Cover
Nobody likes having to unlock their phone all the time just to check the time or see what notifications have come through. With the S-View Flip Cover for the Galaxy S20 FE, you won't have to worry about that thanks to the transparent cover window on the front. This displays various bits of information without requiring you to actually interact with your phone.
Put a ring on it: Newseego Rotating Ring Case
Even though Samsung ditched the curved edges with the Galaxy S20 FE, the screen is still pretty massive for some. But instead of picking up another accessory, why not get a case that will protect your new phone while featuring a ring holder that doubles as a kickstand?
Beautiful colors: Vinve Gradient Case
Getting a clear TPU case is going to be key with the Galaxy S20 FE, but why not add a little more personality? With the Vinve Gradient Case, you can do just that with its gradient color design, going from purple on one end to pink at the other. There's even a spot for you to put a lanyard if you want to keep your S20 FE attached to your wrist while you're out and about.
Simply solid: Osophter Protective Cover
Protection is the name of the game when finding the best Galaxy S20 FE cases, and Osophter delivers. The Protective Cover is made from a combination of TPU and polycarbonate, ensuring the best shock absorption possible. There are four colors to choose from, so you can match your case color to your phone's color.
Defend your phone: Giner Armor Defender
Cases with the most protection are usually big, bulky, and unsightly. That's not the case with the Giner Armor Defender, as this case sports a rugged TPU bumper with enhanced protection in all four corners. Plus, the company includes a tempered glass screen protector, ensuring that you'll cover every inch of the Galaxy S20 FE.
Hybrid and colorful: Ranyi Hybrid Bumper
The Ranyi Hybrid Bumper is a rather unique case. It combines a polycarbonate bumper with a TPU backplate. Usually, these materials are reversed, but this makes it possible for you to have a few colors to choose from. All four corners have been reinforced, and there are the expected raised bezels around the front display and rear camera module.
Keep your cards safe: CoverON RFID Wallet Case
There are times where you want to go out on the town, but don't want to have to bring your wallet. That's where the CoverON RFID Wallet Case comes into play since it can hold up to six in the inner pocket. CoverON also included RFID protection, so that your credit card information doesn't fall into the wrong hands. The case features a TPU bumper to keep the Galaxy S20 FE in place, along with a magnetic clasp for the front flap.
Vibrant protection: Weycolor Liquid Silicone Slim Case
If you're looking for some rather unique and vibrant colored cases to pair with the Galaxy S20 FE, you're in luck. Weycolor's Liquid Silicone Cases come in three vibrant colors, along with a plain black option. As for protection, this is made from silicone, making it easy to clean and adding a little bit of extra grip.
Dual layered: XPM Armor Hybrid
Some of the best cases for protection provide two layers of materials, and that's where we find the XPM Armor Hybrid. This case features a soft TPU inner sleeve for improved shock absorption, while being kept in place by a hard polycarbonate backplate. There's even a built-in kickstand for those who want to be able to prop up their Galaxy S20 FE to enjoy some movies or shows.
All-in-one: Feitenn Heavy Duty Cover
If protection is the name of the game, you can't go wrong with the Feitenn Heavy Duty Cover. This case comes in two different pieces, but also features a built-in screen protector. With this combination, your Galaxy S20 FE is sure to withstand anything you throw at it.
Bling, Bling y'all: Dzxouui Quicksand Glitter Case
If you're checking out the Dzxouui Quicksand Glitter Case, chances are that you want something that helps your Galaxy S20 FE stand out from the crowd. The case itself is made from a TPU material for improved shock absorption, along with raised edges around the display and camera module. But the real story of this case is the unique design on the back with heart-shaped glitter that moves around as you use your new phone.
Keep it protected with the best Galaxy S20 FE cases
Samsung's Silicone Cover for the Galaxy S20 FE doesn't really compromise in any area. It features a slim design without adding much bulk, along with providing extra grip with the silicone material on the back. There's even a wide cutout on the bottom ensuring that all of your charging cables will work flawlessly. This makes sure one of the best Android phones of 2020 stays pristine.
Caseology's Parallax Case has quickly become a fan favorite for recently-launched devices, and for good reason. With the unique 3D design on the back to provide some added without sacrificing wireless charging compatibility, the Parallax is a home run. The case also features raised bezels for added protection around the display and rear camera module.

The Pixel 4a 5G looks boring in Just Black, but we can fix that! These cases are fun, fashionable, functional, and ready to carry your Pixel 4a 5G into the future.Dyson has a variety of air purifiers targeted at different use cases. The Pure Cool TP04 does a great job with air purification, and the machine has a fan that blows cool air throughout the room. There's also a Pure Hot + Cool model that does the same, but you also get the ability to use it as a room heater.
Dyson's latest product in this series comes with an intriguing new feature that sets it apart: humidification. The Dyson Pure Humidify + Cool works as an air purifier and has a powerful fan, but its standout feature is the built-in humidifier, making it a great all-round machine.
With air pollution already taking a turn for the worse in countries like India, the Dyson Pure Humidify + Cool launches at a convenient time. The humidification part makes it an enticing option in Western markets, where colder weather in the coming months will lead to a decrease in indoor humidify levels.
I normally use a standalone air purifier along with a Xiaomi humidifier to maintain relative humidity levels between 50 to 60% within my home, and when Dyson launched the Pure Humidify + Cool, I was immediately interested. Retailing for $800 (₹55,999 in India), the Pure Humidify + Cool is not an affordable machine, but if you're getting a standalone air purifier, humidifier, and a good fan, you'll end up spending close to that figure anyway. So let's see what the Dyson Pure Humidify + Cool is all about, and whether you should pick it up.
Dyson Pure Humidify + Cool
Bottom line: The Dyson Pure Humidify + Cool combines a fan, air purifier and humidifier in a single machine. The fan does a great job blowing cool air throughout the room, the humidifier ensures indoor humidity levels stay consistent, and the HEPA air purifier does a fantastic job purifying the air. If you're looking for versatility, nothing comes close to this machine.
The Good
- Excellent at air purification
- Humidifier regulates humidity levels
- Bladeless fan delivers cool air
- Easy to maintain and clean
- Connects over Wi-Fi to Dyson Link app
The Bad
- Costly
- Not very portable
- Gets loud
Dyson Pure Humidify + Cool What I like
The Dyson Pure Humidify + Cool shares the same design aesthetic as other Dyson air purifiers, but there are a few key differences. For one thing, the machine is shorter and rounder because of the built-in humidification system, and it is heavier as well. But it has clean lines, looks modern, and the perforated grille design with the dual-tone finish for the base makes it look very elegant.
The Pure Humidify + Cool retains an elegant design while adding a humidifier.
The main difference between the Pure Humidify + Cool versus regular Pure + Cool machines is that the base of the unit doesn't rotate anymore. There's a water tank built into the base, and the added weight with the humidification system means Dyson had to come up with another solution for the fan, and it did so in the form of vertical slits that run the length of the bladeless tower.
These slits are closed when the unit is not in use, and when they're active they do just as good a job as the Pure + Cool system at blowing cool air throughout the room. Because the base itself does not rotate, you get 45 or 90-degree oscillation versus the 350-degree oscillation on the Pure + Cool system. That isn't too big a deal because I never ended up using more than 90-degree oscillation on the Pure + Cool TP04 anyway.
A feature that I particularly like on the Pure Humidify + Cool is the LCD screen that sits above the base. The machine has built-in sensors to detect real-time PM2.5, PM10, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels, and it also shows the overall air quality index (AQI) that takes all these factors into account. The built-in sensor is pretty accurate, but you can always get an air quality monitor if you want granular data.
You can cycle through the various modes via the bundled remote, and you also get to see the indoor temperature and humidity levels. The remote itself is sleek and attaches magnetically to the unit, so you don't have to worry about losing it.
You can easily adjust the oscillation, adjust fan or humidification levels, change airflow direction, and use the new timer feature. The timer automatically shuts the machine down, and you get to choose from 30 minutes all the way up to 8 hours. Oh, and there's also a nifty night mode on the Pure Humidify + Cool that turns down the noise levels and dims the brightness of the screen.
The Pure Humidify + Cool has Wi-Fi connectivity, and you can control it by using the Dyson Link app. You basically get all the features of the remote, and the app shows real-time PM2.5, PM10, VOC, and NO2 data, including a detailed daily and weekly breakdown of these metrics.
While humidification is a new feature, the Pure Humidify + Cool is just as effective at air purification as the other Pure + Cool models. The unit has a 360-degree air intake with two HEPA filters located on either side of the base, and these filters clean up to 99.97% of allergens and particles as small as 0.3 microns. The Pure + Cool system has dedicated activated carbon and HEPA filters, but they are combined into a single filter on the Pure Humidify + Cool.
The built-in humidifier does a fantastic job regulating humidity levels, and it is easy to clean.
The air purification system working in conjunction with the fan ensures you get a steady stream of cool air throughout the room. The fan itself was good enough that I didn't feel the need to use an air conditioner, and the Pure Humidify + Cool also lets you control the direction of airflow. If you don't want to use the fan, you can direct the airflow to the back of the unit, and it will still purify and humidify the air but without the fan mode.
The standout feature on the Pure Humidify + Cool is the new humification system. The humidifier gets its own filter, and Dyson is using an ultraviolet light that removes 99.9% of bacteria in the water, ensuring the mist that comes out of the unit is clean and free of any germs or bacteria. The large water tank built into the base is easily removable, and holds a gallon of water. There's even a handle built into the tank to make it easier to carry it.
The Pure Humidify + Cool intelligently monitors real-time humidity levels and spays a mist of purified water to maintain the relative humidity to your preferences. You can either use the auto mode and have the machine automatically adjust the humification levels based on the temperature and indoor humidity, or set a manual level. So if you like having the humidity at 60%, you can set the machine to maintain that humidity level via the Dyson Link app.
In terms of performance, the Pure Humidify + Cool did an outstanding job. The unit produces invisible mist to maintain a constant relative humidity, and I immediately noticed a difference when using the Pure Humidify + Cool versus the regular Pure + Cool.
The best part about the Pure Humidify + Cool is that it's easy to clean and maintain. Dyson recommends a deep clean cycle once a month to ensure the humification system doesn't accumulate any germs. The Dyson Link app shows you when the machine is due for a deep clean, and the hassle-free maintenance makes the Pure Humidify + Cool a particularly great option.
Dyson Pure Humidify + Cool What needs work
Because of the built-in humidification system, the Dyson Pure Humidify + Cool is significantly heavier than the regular Pure + Cool models — it comes in at 18.28lb (8.2kg) versus 10.98lb (4.9kg). The added bulk and heft makes it hard to carry the machine from room to room.
The other downside is the noise levels. At its highest setting, the Pure Humidify + Cool can go up to 86dB, but in the week I used the unit, it kicked the fan level up to 10 only on one occasion, and that too for a few minutes as indoor PM2.5 levels rose to over 200 due to odors from cooking.
Another issue is that while the Pure Humidify + Cool connects over Wi-Fi, there's no way to control the machine via Google Assistant. Dyson has an Alexa skill that lets you control the unit via Amazon's digital assistant, but I rely on Assistant to control smart home gear, and its omission is a letdown. Dyson says it is adding Google Assistant control starting November 14, so I'll update this post once the integration is live.
Dyson Pure Humidify + Cool The competition
Right now, there's nothing that goes up against the Pure Humidify + Cool. Dyson's product is unique in its ability to offer both an air purifier and humidifier in a single unit. If you don't care about humidification, the Pure Cool TP04 is a great alternative that retails for $599 on Amazon.
Dyson Pure Humidify + Cool Should you buy?
You should buy this if ...
You want a single machine for purification and humification
The Pure Humidify + Cool does a great job providing two distinct features in a single unit. If you're tired of using a standalone air purifier and humidifier and want a more seamless machine that does both, this is the ideal choice.
You want a machine with an elegant design
Dyson's design aesthetic is unmatched in this category, and the Pure Humidify + Cool looks premium while delivering great performance.
You're looking for a humidifier that's easy to maintain
Filling the water tank and cleaning the Pure Humidify + Cool is about as easy as it gets, and the hassle-free maintenance makes it a great choice.
You should not buy this if ...
You don't need a humidifier
The key differentiator with the Pure Humidify + Cool is the humidifier. If you don't see yourself using a humidifier as much, then Dyson's Pure Cool air purifiers will be a better fit for your needs.
You need something on a budget
Retailing for $800, the Pure Humidify + Cool is not what I'd call affordable. You are getting a lot of value for your money here, but if you are in the market for a budget option, you'll have to look elsewhere.

AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon have launched 5G networks and are aggressively expanding those networks in 2020 and into next year. Recently, Sprint's 5G network was devoured by T-Mobile and taken offline as T-Mobile recycles Sprint's spectrum. 5G service not only provides faster speeds but also reduced response times, allowing for new services and cloud computing not previously available.
5G is taking hold in the U.S. and it's no coincidence that many of the best 5G phones are also some of the best Android phones in general. For now, the major difference between LTE and 5G will be speed, but as coverage continues to roll out to new areas, more services that rely on instant connectivity should become possible.
Frequencies and coverage
|Carrier||Bands|
|Verizon||n5 (DSS for sub-6), n261 (28GHz)|
|T-Mobile||n71 (600MHz)|
|AT&T||n5 (850MHz)|
n41 (2.5GHz) from Sprint
n260 (39GHz)
n261 (28GHz)

Building a 5G network is a balance between capacity and coverage. With the high-frequency bands, known as mmWave, carriers get access to huge chunks of spectrum, allowing for fiber-like speeds over the wireless network. While it's not the first time the frequencies of mmWave bands have been used, this is the first time it has become economically feasible to use them for mobile broadband.
Lower frequencies are less susceptible to interference, meaning fewer but larger towers need to be built to cover an area than mmWave. Since there is less lower-frequency spectrum available, plus more people will be sharing one tower, speed is much more limited. With mmWave, you will have a tower for smaller areas like a neighborhood. This is kind of like how your Wi-Fi is very fast but only works in your home.
While T-Mobile is making the most out of its 600MHz and 2.5GHz spectrum for a solid balance of coverage and speed, Verizon and AT&T will be leaning heavily on DSS, or dynamic spectrum sharing that allows towers to share spectrum between LTE and %G on the fly.
Where Verizon has 5G
Verizon started small, with only a few cities deploying what it calls 5G Ultra-Wideband (UWB). In short, this version of 5G uses significant chunks of high-frequency bandwidth, around 28GHz, that produce very high speeds but suffer in other areas such as coverage over distance and building penetration. While coverage was dense enough in cities to be included on the list, coverage is still only available in parts of the cities outdoors.
A much larger nationwide 5G network is now available using Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS). DSS allows Verizon to repurpose its huge amount of existing LTE spectrum to work with both 5G and LTE. The equipment on the towers is able to allocate the spectrum to the network that needs it most without removing any capacity from the LTE network which most people will still be using for a while.
Furthermore, this nationwide 5G network is available to all customers on any data plan, unlike UWB which requires an unlimited plan.
Verizon has a coverage map with both LTE and 5G coverage showing just how much larger its nationwide network already is than the UWB network.
Verizon UWB 5G has made it to 36 cities so far but continues to be spotty at best. Verizon has released a set of maps to help you pinpoint where 5G is available in your cities. This is a helpful addition, but it does show off some of the main coverage weaknesses of UWB.
At this time, it is easy to be discouraged about such minimal 5G coverage, but this 5G network will keep things snappy even when there are a ton of customers connected. Early tests have been positive with us seeing speeds up to 1.4 Gbps. Although these massive speeds are impressive, they probably won't hold up under a full Chicago load, but it's still exciting to see. We're also seeing more specific expansion to places like NFL stadiums or race tracks. While great as a tech demonstration, this doesn't offer much to the customer just yet.

5G on Verizon: Everything you need to know
Verizon 5G
Nationwide plus UWB
The fastest 5G you can get
Verizon's 5G network is expanding quickly and with nationwide 5G now available, even you might have access to Verizon's 5G network as long as you have a 5G phone.
Where T-Mobile has 5G
T-Mobile started building a 28GHz or 29GHz high-band mmWave network in the middle of 2019 before following it up with 5G on its 600MHz spectrum. While this lower-frequency 5G isn't as fast as we've seen with mmWave networks, its extensive coverage area makes it more practical for users. Add to that T-Mobile's future usage of its acquired Sprint 5G spectrum and the T-Mobile 5G network is poised to be one of the most capable in the nation. Samsung's Galaxy S20 series phones will all support both the low-band and mid-band spectrum with the larger S20 models supporting high-band as well.
Nationwide coverage
T-Mobile already has an interactive 5G coverage map ready to go. The Samsung Galaxy S20 series, as well as the LG V60 5G, are confirmed to work with both the Sprint and T-Mobile 5G network when the time comes. Some older phones will work with both networks such as the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McClaren. Looks for bands n41 and n71
Notably, on June 1, 2020, T-Mobile announced a partnership with carrier GCI in Alaska to provide 5G coverage in Anchorage. This makes T-Mobile the first carrier to have 5G coverage in all 50 states.
Metro by T-Mobile, Mint Mobile, Google Fi, and several other T-Mobile-based prepaid carriers also offer 5G on supported phones. Unlike AT&T and Verizon prepaid carriers, there's no special plan or additional fees to use it.
Layer cake and 5G SA
T-Mobile's sub-6 network is on bands n71 and n41 (Sprint) at 600MHz and 2.5GHz, respectively. Its mmWave network is on n260 and n261 at 39GHz and 28GHz. Simply put, a higher frequency has less range and has worse building penetration but much greater potential for high speeds.
In our earlier testing, the raw speed with T-Mobile's n71 600MHz sub-6 network increases compared to LTE weren't anything to write home about. The problem is twofold since there is relatively less bandwidth available on this long-range spectrum and that a phone may prefer to connect to a weaker 5G signal over a stronger LTE signal. This puts 5G in a worst-case scenario for head to head speeds.
To improve this, T-Mobile will continue to upgrade more towers with 5G capabilities. One of the most significant developments has been the move to standalone 5G or 5G SA. Earlier deployments of 5G required a connection to LTE to work correctly. This setup could severely limit network responsiveness and coverage. With 5G SA, T-Mobile is reporting around a 30 percent increase in its 5G coverage as well as a 40 percent improvement in latency.
Another upgrade is the added support for n41 2.5GHz 5G. Sprint managed to secure quite a bit of spectrum, so speeds are a decent upgrade over LTE for the most part, but it doesn't reach nearly as far. Of course, T-Mobile customers with compatible phones and Sprint customers with a Galaxy S20 series phone will be able to access both bands on T-Mobile's 5G network.
T-Mobile now has 5G active on its 2.5GHz spectrum in over 200 cities with speeds of around 300Mbps peaking close to 1Gbps.

Finally, if you're looking for pure speed, mmWave is the answer but has a range more similar to Wi-Fi than sub-6 5G. With a tower struggling to cover a city block and useless on the far side of a brick wall, it's better suited to very dense areas and even buildings like stadiums. With the cost of tower installation multiplied by the vast number of towers needed, mmWave is going to take years to build out.
High-band, millimeter-wave coverage is available in parts of these cities.
What about Sprint and Sprint customers
Sprint has now been rebranded as T-Mobile, but for now, Sprint customers will continue to use the Sprint network. In time Sprint customers will be brought to the T-Mobile network, but it has yet to announce a date when that could happen.
Only Sprint customers with a Galaxy S20 phone are currently able to access 5G from a Sprint plan since these phones have been updated to support T-Mobile's nationwide 5G network. T-Mobile is refarming Sprint's 5G spectrum for use as part of its network. That means, however, that Sprint customers with an older 5G phone like the Galaxy S10 5G will get kicked back to LTE since the Sprint version doesn't work with T-Mobile's network. Sprint's coverage maps don't even show 5G anymore.
T-Mobile is allowing customers that are still making payments on Sprint 5G devices like the Galaxy S10 5G, LG V50 ThinQ, or the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G to upgrade to a Galaxy S20 for a discount. T-Mobile is also crediting the customers that purchased the HTC 5G hotspot.
In the long run, T-Mobile will be able to build a fast and robust network with all of that spectrum, but it is a real drag for those that were already using Sprint's 5G network.

Low and high-band
Nationwide coverage
T-Mobile is building a nationwide 5G network on low-band and high-band spectrum. It isn't charging customers any more to get on it. With T-Mobile, all you need is the phone and coverage to get 5G.

Metro by T-Mobile
Prepaid 5G is still 5G
Metro by T-Mobile is an MVNO with a big focus on data, and that isn't changing. Like its big brother T-Mobile, all plans on Metro get 5G for no extra charge.
Where AT&T has 5G
AT&T certainly has one of the most impressive lists of cities with available 5G coverage. AT&T has launched the majority of its 5G network for business use. AT&T started with millimeter wave, or mmWave before the more recent release of the Samsung Galaxy S20 5G alongside its low-band 850Mhz deployment for consumers.
On June 5, 2020, AT&T began using Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) to share portions of the spectrum currently only used for LTE with its 5G network. This will allow towers to use spectrum as needed and provide a smooth transition to 5G without needing to take portions of LTE fully offline. This network has launched in parts of north Texas though it will likely see much more extensive use later in the year.
Interestingly, AT&T now offers 5G roaming in Japan thanks to an agreement with NTT DOCOMO.
If you're on AT&T and you want to access 5G, you'll need either the Unlimited Elite or Unlimited Extra plan. While there will likely be some improvement over LTE using this 850Mhz 5G, it's not going to hit the super-fast speeds we've seen with millimeter-wave. Still, the 850Mhz deployment should have much better coverage than mmWave and be faster than 4G LTE. AT&T is adding 5G access to the Unlimited Started plan starting August 7, 2020.
5G is now shown on AT&T's standard coverage maps which makes it easier than ever to see how far this coverage has made it. It does take a while for these maps to get updated, so check out the entire list for the most up-to-date locations.
On August 21, 2020, AT&T MVNO Cricket Wireless launched 5G support on a few of its plans. 5G is available with Cricket's top-end unlimited plan as well as its Simply Data plans data-only plans. Cricket is also supporting mmWave with what it's calling Cricket 5G+. AT&T's 5G network still isn't the biggest, but it has had some robust growth over the past months and has a solid coverage map, so you can see if you are covered.

5GE is not 5G
If you have an AT&T phone, you have seen your phone indicate a 5GE connection even if you don't have a 5G phone or plan that supports 5G. This is because 5GE is not 5G. To deploy 5G, a carrier needs a fast fiber connection to the network and upgraded equipment. A 5GE connection is technically LTE but with the most modern hardware and close to a best-case scenario. You may get speeds faster than typical LTE with 5GE, but the fact of the matter is, it's just good 4G LTE.
AT&T has stopped advertising this name recently, but some people with LTE phones may still see it pop up in some areas. For what it's worth, 5GE represents the best of what LTE can do and should be able to deliver great performance.
Real 5G is available in these cities on AT&T. Keep in mind that not all 5G phones support the mmWave network.

Low-band and mmWave working together
AT&T's 5G network has been playing coverage catchup with its sub-6 rivals but is closing the gap fast and already covers more than 120 million people in the US.
5G devices are becoming more capable with advancements in 5G modems such as the newer X55 modem from Qualcomm that has replaced the X50 as the most capable 5G chip.
5G is one of the more exciting things to happen to wireless networking in years and has the same exhilarating feeling that the move to 3G had. If you are a wireless enthusiast and want an easy way to see how 5G is shaping up worldwide, Ookla, the company famous for its internet speed test, has a map showing new locations as providers send them in.

It only takes a few seconds to focus the sun's rays onto your screen and permanently burning marks into it. While you may get lucky and your headset might avoid any permanent damage, it's probably best to follow our tips, and the advice of Oculus themselves, and avoid the sun.
Products used in this guide:
- On-the-go protection: Oculus Quest Travel Case ($40 on Amazon)
How to keep your Quest safe from sunlight indoors
- First, secure your regular indoor playspace from sunlight by closing blinds that may face your lenses. Even sunlight through a window can damage your screen.
When your play session is over, make sure you do not store your headset with the lenses pointing towards the sun. Ideally, store your headset in a case.
How to keep your Quest safe from sunlight outdoors
- If you have to transport your Quest outside, the first thing you should do is cover the lenses. Ideally, this will be done by putting the Quest in a case, but in a pinch, covering your lenses with a cloth will suffice.
- When transporting the Quest outside, do not remove the cover, or remove it from its case. As tempting as it may be, Oculus does not recommend using the Quest outside, and any damage caused from doing so will not be covered by the warranty.
- Wait until you are back inside before taking your headset back out.
By following this guide, your Quest's lenses and screen will be safe from sunlight. While it may not seem like much, sunlight is probably the quickest way to damage your headset. VR headsets are just inherently not sun-friendly, since the lenses quickly become a deadly magnifying glass. With regular maintenance and care, you can keep your VR headset in pristine condition.

iPhone & iPad
Linux
Routers
Best VPN for
Netflix, Hulu, and streaming

Security and privacy
Pros
- Netflix unblocking
- Fast live chat support
- Customizable apps
- Owned servers
Cons
- Short trial
- Odd issue with usability
- No Bitcoin support
IPVanish is a VPN that's U.S. based. For some that might be a red flag for security but in this case the provider owns and runs its own servers, meaning it can offer privacy and anonymity. It also means, if you're U.S. based, you can get some great speeds on closer servers with over 1,300 dotted about more than 75 locations worldwide.
It's not only the local servers that are a big appeal here but also the fact they all support P2P. Yes that does mean torrenting support, but it can also mean the ability to download from nearby, meaning the best possible speeds too.
The clients, or apps, are also something worth mentioning as they stand out from the competition. These are easy enough to use for newbs but also offer deep levels of customization making them ideal for more knowledgeable users that want to really personalize their VPN experience.
So is this the VPN for you? Read on to find out everything you need to know about IPVanish VPN.
Pricing and plans
Like most VPN providers IPVanish offers a few options for payments which mean you can find the best for you that represents a saving.
If you don't want any commitment then a month to month payment could be the plan for you, costing around $8 per month.
But you can make savings by paying for a longer period up front. Go for three months and it works out at $7.20 per month or commit to a full year and you'll be paying the equivalent of $5.20 per month.
You also get a 30-day money-back guarantee, effectively making this a free trial period. This is a nice increase from the 7 day period the company previously offered.
Testing and performance
For IPVanish in the U.S., download speeds were impressive. We tested using Speedtest.net and TestMy.net to see what the performance was like. These tests were repeated across several days to get a more realistic spread of speeds to give us an average.
Tested in the U.S., we got back an average speed of 220Mbps – so, pretty impressive then. When you consider the slowest speed we got on an individual test was 153Mbps you get an idea why this is a decent VPN when it comes to connection performance.
Taking that further afield, to the UK, we tested using a 75Mbps line and achieved 69Mbps showing that there is very little lag on the part of the VPN.
Features
The little mentioned but really useful feature of IPVanish is its ability to unblock Netflix. It does this really well allowing you to watch from any location. This also works for Spotify and YouTube. However, it falls down when it comes to BBC iPlayer where it was largely unable to unblock the content in our tests.
The apps are fantastic with lots of features. These work across lots of platforms including iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Chromebooks, Linux, Fire TV and more. You get a quick connect button for easy use on the fastest server available. But you also get features like easy protocol switching, kill switch access, map based server views, useful stats on your details at a glance, a handy scramble feature for more anonymity, automatic protection for unsecured networks and white and black list building - to name just a few.
IPVanish comes with a free SugarSync account which is a cloud storage offering. That means for the price of your VPN you're also gaining 250GB of online storage capacity for use as and when you need.
Privacy and security
IPVanish uses some of the most solid industry-standard security in the form of AES-256 encryption to secure your data. It also has OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols meaning speed while remaining secure. You can also pick your OpenVPN port and use that scramble option to get even deeper levels of anonymity. That translates to an ability to avoid detection in VPN blocking countries like China or Iran.

- Google Wifi is now available for $99 for a single unit and $199 for three.
- The power supply now connects with a USB-C cable to match the rest of Google's lineup.
- Google Wifi has the same AC1200 speed and 1,500 sq ft of coverage.
Google's entry-level mesh system, Google Wifi has been updated with a new price and an updated power supply with a USB-C connector. As reported by The Verge, Google's original Google Wifi router has received a price drop down from $129 for a single unit to just $99. The three-pack has come down from $299 to $199. There are a couple of changes to the housing including an updated logo on top and it's now being made out of partially recycled plastic. Google states that 49% of the device's plastic is made with recycled material.
Google Wifi is still only available in white (Google calls it snow) and is limited to AC1200 speeds meaning this isn't a good fit for someone with a gigabit internet connection though MU-MIMO is supported to help keep it running smoothly even with a lot of connections. It has WPA 3 security for Wi-Fi and even has dual Ethernet ports on each Google Wifi allowing for you to connect wired devices or to add a wired connection between mesh points to improve speeds.
Compared to Google Wifi, Nest Wifi is still the fastest router available from Google with AC2200 speeds, though the speed on the Nest Wifi point is the same as Google Wifi while lacking any Ethernet support. The Nest Wifi Point is available in more colors and has a built-in smart speaker. At this price, Google Wifi is a compelling option for someone building a mesh or looking for an inexpensive way to expand an existing Google Wifi or Nest Wifi mesh.

That started with the TicWatch E in 2017, but it wasn't until the Pro line of watches came shortly after that Mobvoi moved to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 2100 series of processors that debuted in 2016. Unfortunately, the company stayed with that SoC for every watch since — that changes with the TicWatch Pro 3, and wow, is the change well worth it.
Now, I've owned watches from Huawei, Misfit, LG, and even going outside of the Wear OS platform with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2. Outside of the Samsung watch, all of these have had the same fault — relatively sluggish performance. However, with the TicWatch Pro 3 sporting the newest Snapdragon 4100, the overall experience gets a massive upgrade.
The Pro 3 also brings a host of new sensors, improvements to its standout secondary display, a larger screen, an overall thinner and lighter watch body, and other useful changes that make using the watch daily much more enjoyable. All of these benefits come before the TicWatch Pro 3's impending update to the fall Wear OS update.
Big changes, smaller package
TicWatch Pro 3 GPS
Bottom Line: The TicWatch Pro 3 is the first device running the Qualcomm Snapdragon 4100 processor and it provides a much needed performance boost. Not only is the device significantly faster, but it also is thinner and lighter. The Pro 3 brings improvements in nearly every category you could want — health, performance, display technology, and wearability. Outside of missing an ECG sensor and launching without the fall Wear OS update, the TicWatch Pro 3 ticks all of the boxes.
The Good
- Thinner and lighter than before
- Larger screen
- Significant performance improvements
- Fantastic battery life
- Improved secondary display
- New sensors and health tracking
The Bad
- Still large for some wrists
- Missing ECG monitoring
- Unable to disable secondary display's backlight
- Launching without Google's newest Wear OS
TicWatch Pro 3 Design and display
The Pro 3 maintains much of the same design language from its predecessors in the TicWatch Pro 2020 and Pro 4G. It retains the familiar bezel with time designations, dual pushers, along with the two-tone metal against a matte plastic. However, the Pro 3's design upgrades become evident once you tighten the stitched silicone band — especially after wearing the TicWatch Pro 4G.
The first significant change is how much thinner it is in comparison to the Pro 4G. While the TicWatch Pro 3 is still a large watch, Mobvoi has managed to reduce the device's overall thickness to 12.2mm, .4mm thinner than the TicWatch Pro 4G or 2020. This change, along with a lighter weight of 42g, a reduction of 28%, makes wearing the Pro 3 much more comfortable. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 comes in at 11.1mm thick and weighs 53.8g.
The reduced thickness and enlarged screen size makes wearing and using the TicWatch Pro 3 so much better over prior generations.
Mobvoi, while making the device thinner and lighter, did make the display larger and because this is part of the Pro line of TicWatches, it has Dual Display upgraded to 2.0. The enlarged screen improves the readability of text and allows for more information, such as health statistics.
The improved top-layer screen retains its excellent visibility in bright light, including the direct sun, and brings a few new tricks. Mobvoi added a few design lines to give the secondary display a bit of personality and change up to the battery indicator. The watch also gains a live seconds counter, and though it's a small change, it is a nice addition.
One of the few drawbacks to the secondary display is that if there isn't any ambient light from the outside, you cannot see the screen — the Pro 3 addresses that. With this release, Mobvoi adds in a backlight that is reminiscent of a Timex Indiglo watch.
The lift to wake feature on Wear OS watches activates the full smart display when you raise your wrist. On TicWatch Pro devices, when you disable that feature, the LCD acts as your always-on display. If you enable always-on in the watch settings, you get the improved AMOLED Retina display instead. When you raise your wrist with the Pro 3 and always-on disabled, it activates a backlight for the top-layer display, making it visible in low light situations.
While these can be categorized as somewhat small changes to a very familiar design, they are thoughtful and impactful updates. Perhaps the biggest drawback to the TicWatch Pro line of watches has been its chunky size and dated processor, and though it is still a large watch, the Pro 3 addresses much of that criticism.

While the design changes are notable, the most significant update is to the processor being used. The TicWatch Pro 3 is the first smartwatch to use the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 4100 chipset. Though it would have been nice to have seen the 4100+ used here, the 4100 proper brings some significant performance and battery improvements over the 2100 SoC used on the previous TicWatch Pro generations.
Similarly to when smartwatches upgraded to 1GB of RAM, anything less felt nearly impossible to use. Now that I've used a watch with the 4100 processor, I can't go back to anything else.
Everything on the Pro 3 is so much smoother than watches running the 2100 and 3100 processors. From on-screen animations to opening apps and navigating through Wear OS and using Google Assistant, it all just works. It may seem strange to be so excited for things to just work, but that's where we've gotten to in the Wear OS realm.
These performance improvements are being realized while still using the Wear OS version that has been kicking around for the last year or so. Mobvoi has confirmed that the fall update to the operating system is on the way and that it's just waiting on the roll-out from Google.
Another big improvement with the TicWatch Pro 3 is in the battery life department. While the Mobvoi's line of Pro watches has never been slouches when it comes to battery life, it only gets better with the newest addition.
With the TicWatch Pro 3, I can actually use the onboard Google Assistant because it's now fast and responsive.
On my TicWatch Pro 4G, I would get around two or three days of usage before needing to put it on the charger. This is while using 24-hour heart rate tracking as well as Mobvoi's TicSleep for sleep tracking. With the Pro 3, I get over three days during 24-hour monitoring of my heart rate, SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) tracing, analyzing SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals), and nightly sleep tracking.
Even when I disable the secondary display, which uses very little power, and use the AMOLED display with the always-on feature enabled, I get nearly three days between charges. If you don't need or want 24-tracking for some of the health features or don't care about sleep tracking, switching some of these features off will improve the TicWatch Pro 3's already impressive battery life.
TicWatch Pro 3 Health tracking
The TicWatch Pro 3 brings along some new health sensors to the table. Mobvoi has included a night infrared static heart rate sensor with non-visible light for improved readings, a barometer, as well as a SpO2 sensor. With these additions, the hopes of more accurate monitoring of previously included health readings such as heart rate and sleep but new metrics like blood oxygen saturation levels become available.
With the new suite of sensors on the TicWatch Pro 3, Mobvoi gives users more insight into their general health.
Mobvoi combines the sensor set on the Pro 3 to track the ambient noise around you, stress levels using SDNN, and the ability to automatically track sleep and SpO2 with the watch in Essential mode. Previously on TicWatch Pro devices, all that was tracked when the device was in Essential mode was time, heart rate, and steps.
Of course, Pro 3 still offers basic fitness tracking, such as keeping a tally of your steps as well as reminding you to move around if you've been sitting too long. Whether you manually trigger 15 workouts in the TicExercise app or let TicMotion auto-detect your exercise, the secondary display will show you key metrics during your training session. This is especially useful when getting your sweat on outdoors in the bright sun.
TicWatch Pro 3 Software
As mentioned before, the TicWatch Pro 3 is launching with the same version of Wear OS that has been on smartwatches for over a year, but the Android 11 fall update is coming soon. However, this doesn't mean that Mobvoi isn't making some changes itself. The Pro 3 is bringing updates to the Mobvoi companion app on the phone and changes to the apps on the watch.
Starting with the phone app, Mobvoi brings a more comprehensive look at what is happening on the watch. While making changes to things like always-on display and gestures are done in the Wear OS app, and on the watch itself, viewing all of your health data in one place is a welcomed addition to the app.
The new Mobvoi phone app is a nice improvement; however, it would be great to export the health reports for my records or show my doctor.
The Mobvoi app brings in the new tracking metrics offered by the TicWatch Pro 3 to your phone, offering a singular place to review them. From the home screen on the app, you see the device name and battery status. You see your steps, exercise, and active hours currently tracked in the Sports and Health section. You can also access a watch face center with all of the watch faces created by Mobvoi, although not all are compatible with every watch.
There's also a place to hear your audio notes recorded from your Pro 3. Here you can also convert the notes to text. Lastly, there's a place for screenshots from the watch and a help section to explain the various apps and watch functions.
By tapping on the Sports and Health section, it expands to show you the current health data tracked on the Pro 3. Each area shows you what your last reading was and can be expanded on to offer you a history of that data.
The TicWatch Pro 3 refreshes the existing Mobvoi apps like TicExercise and TicPulse and adds in TicOxygen for SPo2 tracking, TicHearing for noise detection and alert, TicZen to track stress using heart rate, and TicBreathe for breath training. All of the apps are relatively straightforward with settings to make some of them monitor around the clock.
TicWatch Pro 3 What could be better
For all that the TicWatch Pro 3 gets right, there are still some downsides — nothing's perfect. Even though the watch has been trimmed down a lot over prior Pro models, it is still a large watch with its 1.4" display. Due to this, some folks with smaller wrists or people who simply prefer a smaller watch likely won't enjoy a device this size on their wrist.
While this is a somewhat small issue, I would like the ability to change what info is shown on the secondary display. I understand that the screen has predetermined areas that can be used for data, but allowing me to access that would be wonderful. For example, when using TicExercise, my heart rate is shown on the LCD screen. Why can't I enable that to show up when I'm not working out?
Please, Mobvoi, allow me to turn off the secondary display's backlight for times that I don't want it on.
While on the dual-display subject, though I do appreciate the addition of the backlight, I would like the option to disable it when I don't want it. Yes, I can put the watch into Theatre Mode; I don't want to put it back into that mode every time I want to view the AMOLED display underneath. It's a tiny complaint, and more times than not, I want to have the backlight available, but I like options.
For all of the updated health sensors, it would have been nice to have gotten the ability to do an ECG reading. It is a relatively niche thing in the Android smartwatch options. It is being added for devices like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 and the new Fitbit Sense, so having it here would be nice. It's not a deal-breaker for me, but some people may really like to have it available.
Finally, I wish the TicWatch Pro 3 was launching with the newest Wear OS version. Let me be clear; it is as current as Google allows it to be. Much like other services or other OS updates, these things are rolled out on Google's schedule. I have been told that everything is in order, and the device is just waiting for the update to be pushed out from Google.
TicWatch Pro 3 Competition
While this is currently the only watch running the Snapdragon 4100 processor, other watches still bring something to the table.
Firstly, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 and Galaxy Watch Active 2 comes to mind. For a smartwatch that packs style, performance, and many health forward features, this is the watch that will give the Pro 3 a run for its money. With its own unique feature in the rotating bezel, navigating the Tizen OS is a joy. It has all of the same health tracking metrics found on the TicWatch Pro 3, with the addition of ECG support coming in a future update. You lose out on a lot of app support for the watch on top of paying quite a bit more, but you do get a very advanced smartwatch.
A watch that could stake claim to your wrist that is health first and smartwatch second is the new Fitbit Sense. The Sense is a lighter, smaller device that integrates many health-tracking features, some that aren't found on any other smartwatches. One of the most unique options found on the Sense is the temperature sensor. It allows users to track changes in temperature to detect a fever or even the onset of a menstrual cycle.
For staying in the Wear OS ecosystem, options like the Skagen Falster 3 with its svelte style, solid performance running the Snapdragon 3100 processor, and rotating crown, there's something to be said for simplicity are a great option. Another Wear OS watch to fight for that spot on your wrist is the TicWatch Pro 2020. Though it runs an older processor, it has 1GB of RAM and the very capable Dual Display 1.0.
TicWatch Pro 3 Should you buy it?
TicWatch Pro 3 Who it's for
This watch is for someone who wants excellent performance and battery life. Far too often, those two things are not features that go together. However, on the TicWatch Pro 3, the rarity is achieved. Swiping between screens, scrolling through texts, bringing up your Google Assistant, and getting a fast response, are all available on this watch. Then to toss in three-plus days of use between charges is just fantastic.
It's for the person who likes to spend time outside. The improved Dual Display 2.0 offers a clear view of essential data, no matter the lighting conditions. The backlight also means that you won't have to change settings when you're in dimly lit spaces.
TicWatch Pro 3 is the choice for the person who wants to keep better track of their health. With its improved heart rate sensor, added SpO2 sensor, and inclusion of new apps to track more aspects of your health, the Pro 3 is a wonderful addition to your fitness goals.
TicWatch Pro 3 Who it isn't for
If you don't like large watches or have smaller wrists, the TicWatch Pro 3 may not be for you. The slimmed-down device is much improved over its predecessors, but it is still large. With a 1.4-inch display, it's tough to make the watch much smaller than it is — physical limitations are still a thing.
For the person who really wants a deeper health metric with methods such as an ECG reading, then you will want to look elsewhere. For all of its improvements on the health tracking front, the omission of this feature is missed. While tracking irregular heart rhythms on a smartwatch isn't the most accurate method, there are benefits to it, and having it on the TicWatch Pro 3 would have been excellent.
The TicWatch Pro 3 is easily the best Wear OS device out right now. It's tough to say if it's the best Android smartwatch or not, but for me, it is.
In terms of Wear OS watches, it brings unmatched performance, fantastic battery life, and the Dual Display 2.0 is one that no other device has. While the first two items in this list may show up on other watches as more manufacturers release Snapdragon 4100 and 4100+ options, the Pro 3 has it now, and it's great. Mobvoi is doing some nice tweaks to its own software to bring options that aren't found on other Wear OS watches either.
As for overall smartwatches on the Android platform, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 and Active 2 are tough to beat. The performance is great, and health features are missing from the Pro 3, but Tizen has plenty of drawbacks. From the lack of apps to poorly managed notifications, the TicWatch Pro 3 has brought performance and Wear OS to a level that makes it a challenger for the crown.
Performance king
TicWatch Pro 3 GPS
Lighter, faster, stronger
The TicWatch Pro 3 improves on the already impressive line-up of Pro watches from Mobvoi. The inclusion of the new Snapdragon 4100 extends the remarkable battery life the line already enjoyed. Its performance is much improved, and the added health features round out a fantastic smartwatch.

It could make all the claims it wants about speed and consistency, but until I saw it in person I wouldn't be able to give it the benefit of the doubt. The day after the announcement, I had the opportunity to test the sensor at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit, and I'm incredibly impressed by its speed and capabilities.
The first impressive part of seeing the 3D Sonic Max sensor in action is its size. I know Qualcomm quoted it as being 17x the size of the original, but didn't really have a sense of how big the original was — the new sensor is the size of a few postage stamps, which is way bigger than anything out there right now. It's large enough that you really don't need to think about where you place your finger — and the sensor doesn't care, it'll recognize the print anywhere in the area.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
Qualcomm says the sensor can be placed anywhere the company wants, and it's just 0.15 mm thick so it really doesn't impede on the placement of any other components in the phone. The sensor also supports two-finger authentication, and though it wasn't working for the lock screen in our demo, it was working in a test app. Companies can choose to use this two-finger recogition as a higher level of authentication if they choose. And speaking of heightened security, the sensor can also recognize blood flow and heart rate as another level of authentication that the finger being placed on the sensor is actually a live person's.
The more practical part of the demo that blew me away was the speed. The sensor recognized incredibly quickly, just as fast, or faster, than what I've come to expect from the best fingerprint sensors out there. Surely this is partly due to not needing to perfectly place your finger on a small recognition area, but it's also clearly parsing the authentication much faster too. Improving from its predecessor was a requirement — I didn't expect it to be this fast though.
We were using the new sensor in a prototype device, which means things can change when it comes out in retail devices, but presumably it would only change for the better with a couple more months of tweaking.
The Qualcomm representatives running the demo obviously wouldn't confirm which device was being used for the testing, but it was very obvious that it was a OnePlus 7 Pro with the new sensor replacing its usual optical fingerprint sensor. The size, shape and software of the device were a dead giveaway. That doesn't necessarily mean that the OnePlus 8 (or whatever it may be) will have this new sensor, but it's an interesting little tidbit of information to keep in mind.
That speculation aside, I do fully expect that this sensor will be used in the Galaxy S11 series, however. Considering the partnership that brought the original ultrasonic to Samsung's S10 and Note 10 series, it'd stand to reason it would stick with Qualcomm again — particularly with this vastly improved sensor. Even if Samsung were to use the new sensor only for its size and speed, and not for the extra authentication methods, it would be a huge win.
The final component of this is getting to use the sensor in the real world for days and weeks to see if it really holds up. There are a lot more variables out in the wild using a phone compared to a (relatively) controlled demo environment. But after seeing the sensor in action, my view has shifted from cautiously optimistic right to completely excited to use this component.

- It will also be offering a free 5G upgrade to users of its Unlimited Starter, Extra, and Elite plans from August 7.
- The carrier has stocked 5G equipped phones, including the LG Velvet, Samsung Galaxy A71, and the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 5G.
The march of 5G continues as AT&T today announced the deployment of the new standard across the U.S. Looking at AT&T's coverage map, it's nowhere near as ubiquitous as LTE, but it's not as limited as it was at the start of the year.
For existing customers and subscribers, AT&T is adding support for 5G to its AT&T Unlimited Starter, Extra, and Elite plans from August 7. Individuals on any of these (or their Business Unlimited equivalents) would be able to take advantage of faster connectivity without paying more. Pre-paid customers will have to purchase either a 5G enabled device directly from AT&T, or use an eligible device on the company's Unlimited Plus plan.

Commenting on the story, AT&T's Chris Sambar, EVP of Technology Operations said:
Our strategy of deploying 5G in both sub-6 (5G) and mmWave (5G+) spectrum bands will provide the best mix of speeds, latency, and coverage that are needed to enable revolutionary new capabilities to fuel 5G experiences for consumers and businesses. Our competitors are still working to provide that same mix, which for them could take months or even years. What we offer is available to consumers and businesses today, and we're not slowing down. As we have throughout our 144-year history, we'll continue to innovate and invest in our network to expand our 5G coverage to more consumers and businesses across the country.
In the past few weeks, there has been a glut of 5G devices launched on AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Samsung's Galaxy A71 and the LG Velvet are just two notable mid-range examples. In the near future, flagships like the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Z Flip will be making their entrance. Finally, Google is also rumored to be bringing a Pixel 4a with 5G alongside a 5G equipped Pixel 5 to the market pretty soon.
Faster than we expected, we're moving swiftly towards a 5G world. Carriers can build the networks, but it's also up to phone OEMs to build affordable devices that can reach a critical mass of people. It's also up to chip makers to create chips like Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765 or Mediatek's inexpensive Dimensity 800-series which enable those cheaper 5G enabled phones to hit the market.

- Business VPN usage has increased by 165% worldwide, according to NordVPN.
- Its sales grew by almost 600% since March 11.
- People are also working longer hours.
The usage of VPNs — or Virtual Private Networks — has skyrocketed in recent weeks as a result of people spending more time at home, according to data shared by NordVPN. It noted a 165% uptick in the use of business VPNs and its overall sales increased by almost 600% since 11 March, 2020.
With people around the world moving to working from home, the sharp increase seen by NordVPN, particularly with regard to business VPNs, may not be surprising with employees needing to connect securely to corporate networks, but the numbers are staggering.
There appears also to have been a spike in productivity, or at least an increase in working hours, with the move to home working with NordVPN users connecting for longer each day.
Usage data from the NordVPN Teams business software revealed several countries, including Canada, The UK, France, and more, are using their business VPNs for an extra two hours per day. U.S. usage jumped by an even greater amount as the workday lengthened by three hours on average.
Daniel Marcusson, digital privacy expert of NordVPN Teams, said:
"Typically people homeworking are starting work earlier — but finishing at their usual same time. The lack of a morning commute is currently being used as additional work time, which looks like a win-win for employees and businesses."
It remains to be seen if that additional time is actually being used productively or if the adjustment to home working is causing some efficiency issues.
If you're looking for a VPN for personal use, you can score a sweet deal on NordVPN with up to 70% in savings. Alternatively, take a look at our list of the best VPN deals.

Untethered VR
Oculus Quest
Freedom to move
The Oculus Quest is a standalone VR headset. That means you don't need a PC or phone to use it, and you don't have to duck and dodge around wires. As a result, you can bring VR almost anywhere and immerse yourself in gameplay.
Check out our full review!
The Oculus Quest is an immersive and liberating VR experience. In our review of the Oculus Quest, we said that it "felt like this is how virtual reality was always supposed to be." The lack of external sensors or wires makes it easy to jump straight into VR and share it with your friends.
Oculus Quest review: A liberating VR experience you can take anywhere
What is Oculus Quest?
The Oculus Quest is a completely wireless virtual reality headset. It doesn't need to be tethered to a PC like other powerful VR headsets and doesn't require a phone like some mobile VR devices. It features six degrees of freedom (6DoF), meaning it can track your movements up, down, left, right, forward, and backward. It doesn't require any external sensors like the original Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Instead, it has sensors built into the headset. It also supports two updated Touch controllers, meaning it can be used to play popular gaming titles that require two hands, such as Beat Saber.
Spatial tracking from within the headset means you can move around a room-scale setup just like you can now in Rift, Vive, or Windows Mixed Reality. A camera in each corner of the headset (total of four) track space and motion controllers from the inside out. The Quest uses the same optics as the Go for a display resolution of 1,600 x 1,400 for each eye, but here you'll be able to make lens-spacing adjustments on the fly. Also, like the Go, Quest has a built-in audio system that delivers 3D sound without the need for bulky headphones. A headset jack is included if you'd like to use separate hardware, and charging is handled with a USB-C port.
All the necessary hardware — including the processor, RAM, storage, and rechargeable battery — is worn on your head. As for an operating system, Quest runs on the Oculus OS, a variation of Android.
Where can I buy an Oculus Quest?
The Oculus Quest starts at $399 for the 64GB version. It's available at several major retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, and through the Oculus website. If you plan to do a lot of sideloading or plan to watch a lot of downloaded media content, then you should consider purchasing the larger 128GB version for $499.

How does Oculus Quest tracking work?
Oculus Insight, the new tracking technology from Oculus, is capable of scanning all items in your VR space, including floors, ceilings, walls, rugs, art, windows, and curtains, for an accurate representation of your place in the real world. It looks for edges and corners and other distinct features, then builds a 3D map of the playspace and combines that data with data from the gyroscope and accelerometer to give the headset's position once every millisecond.
The Guardian system is still here to keep you from bumping into walls and furniture, and you'll now be able to save multiple rooms for quick setup. For example, you can save your standard VR play space, and you save your friend's living room for when you visit with the Quest and want to set up quickly.
Since there are no external sensors, the play space for Quest is potentially enormous, though features such as Arena-Scale tracking will come in future updates.
Facebook rolled out an update that allows you to disable Guardian Tracking. While it may seem odd to have the option to disable one of the Oculus Quest's best features, turning it off allows you to use the device in new ways. With Guardian Tracking off, you can use the Oculus Quest in the dark and while lying down. It's also useful for playing supported Oculus Go and Gear VR games.

How do Oculus Quest controllers work?
Along with a new headset, Quest is bringing new Touch motion controllers that are also tracked by sensors in the headset. Much like other Oculus Touch controllers, the Quest controllers have a ring covered in IR lights that are tracked. Here, instead of facing down like on current Touch, the rings face up, making them more visible to the cameras in the headset.
In addition to controlling the Oculus Quest with its Touch Controllers, you can control some aspects of it with hand tracking. This feature only rolled out in December 2019 but it has tremendous potential.

How do I set up my Oculus Quest?
The Oculus Quest is one of the easiest VR headsets to set up. It doesn't require any external sensors or a PC to run. You do need a phone for the initial set up process, but after that, the headset runs completely independently. When you first set up your Oculus Quest, the device guides you through the tutorial to sign in to your accounts. It also familiarizes you with the Oculus Guardian system and the basic movements and gestures available on the Oculus Quest.

Do I need any additional equipment?
One of the best things about the Oculus Quest is that you don't need any additional equipment to use it. Apart from having to replace batteries in the Touch Controllers, everything you'll ever need to run the Oculus Quest is in the box it ships with.
Though all of the required equipment is in the box, there are some helpful add-ons and accessories you can use to enhance the Oculus Quest experience. A magnetic charging cable makes it easier to charge your headset and also makes it safer to use while plugged in because it reduces the risk of damaging the headset.
The accessory that will result in the most significant change in gameplay and immersion is a good pair of headphones. The Oculus Quest has built-in speakers that support directional audio, but if you want to immerse yourself fully, you can pop on some headphones. Just remember that the Oculus Quest doesn't officially support Bluetooth audio, so you'll need a wired set of headphones.

What games can I play on the Oculus Quest?
Even though the Oculus Quest is not connected to a PC, it can still run many games that developers can port over from the Oculus Rift. Oculus Quest ports of Rift games can be both impressive and immersive, though discerning eyes will be able to tell the difference between the same game being played on both systems.
The Oculus Quest has an impressive library of games. Many Oculus Rift games and some Oculus Go games have been ported to the Oculus Quest. Shooting games are especially immersive and popular on the Oculus Quest. Its lack of wires means you can spin around and fire at enemies in games like Robo Recall: Unplugged.
The Oculus Quest also lends itself well to anything with a sword or saber thanks to its support for two Touch Controller. Beat Saber is an incredibly fun game that pairs slicing blocks to the rhythm of music.
The Oculus Quest gained support for several Oculus Go and Gear VR titles. This greatly expanded the library and brought some popular titles to the Oculus Quest.
There's a growing library of games on the Oculus Quest, and many of them are available for around $20.

Is the Oculus Quest good for watching movies and TV?
The Oculus Quest has several media apps that allow you to enjoy content on a gigantic virtual screen. Netflix and YouTube have official apps available for the Oculus Quest. You can also watch locally stored media on your headset or stream content to it using an app like SKYBOX VR. You can also watch several other types of content by sideloading Android apps onto the Oculus Quest. The Oculus Quest is an Android device at its core, so there are plenty of apps to choose from.

Can I sideload apps and games?
While the Oculus Quest has several games and apps available through the Oculus Store, sideloading opens a whole new world to the device. You can sideload media apps like the Android version of Netflix that supports offline media playback, or sideload custom songs onto the popular game Beat Saber. Sideloading can also be used to enable SteamVR inside Virtual Desktop.
Sideloading initially took quite a bit of effort, but the developers of SideQuest have made it seamless. SideQuest is a program you install on your PC that allows you to drag and drop APKs onto your Oculus Quest. It's also an incredible tool for sideloading custom songs and content onto Beat Saber.

Can I connect the Oculus Quest to other devices?
The Oculus Quest is an excellent device on its own, but it can also connect to several types of devices to provide different experiences. If you want to show your friends and family what's going on inside of your headset, you can cast your Oculus Quest to a Chromecast. This is excellent for parties because people can watch your gameplay instead of watching you flail your arms around.
You can also stream PC games and apps to the Oculus Quest through Virtual Desktop. This app allows you to use your PC inside a virtual environment to enjoy a wide variety of content. You can also sideload the ability to stream SteamVR games to your Oculus Quest.
The Oculus Quest can also be connected to a computer to download video files from recorded gameplay. It's simple and just involves plugging your headset into your computer with a USB-C cable.
The feature is in beta, but Oculus Link allows you to play PCVR games on your Oculus Quest. We went hands-on with Oculus Link at Oculus Connect 6.

How do I keep the Oculus Quest running?
The Oculus Quest doesn't require much maintenance, but there are some essential things to remember to keep it running well. The most important thing to know is that sunlight can damage the screen inside the headset in just a few seconds. It's tempting to take the Oculus Quest outside to take advantage of a larger play area, but the lenses of the Oculus Quest are magnifying glasses. If sunlight hits the lenses, it can damage the display. When storing the Oculus Quest and transporting it, you should always use a case and/or a lens cover. Additionally, you shouldn't use the Oculus Quest in direct sunlight or leave it in a location where the sun might hit the lenses.
The Oculus Quest has two Touch Controllers that allow you to interact with games and apps. These controllers aren't as robust as the Touch Controllers that shipped with the original Oculus Rift. While I've hit a counter on accident and not seen any damage, many users have cracked the tracking ring on their Touch Controllers by dropping them. You should always use the wrist straps for the Touch Controllers and clear out your playing area. The Oculus Guardian system isn't perfect, and it also doesn't track the ceiling or anyone that comes into your play area, so it's important to be careful. If you do break a Touch Controller, you can order individual replacements.

Should I be concerned about my privacy?
Some users will have privacy concerns with the Oculus Quest because Oculus is owned by Facebook. If you'd like, you can remove your Facebook account from the Oculus Quest and also tweak several other privacy settings, including who can see your real name, what your friends can see, and what activity is shared.

In a year where Samsung set the standard for flagship phones at $1000 for the Galaxy S20 and $1400 for the S20 Ultra, LG rolled out the comparable V60 ThinQ 5G (henceforth, simply V60) for under $950. Despite the price savings, the V60 generally has the same specs and features, including a huge battery and 5G — and even has a couple novel features like a 3.5 mm headphone jack.
The issue is that LG isn't coming from a position of strength here. Its last few rounds of flagships have been lackluster, yet still commanded prices matching all of the superior competition. So it's a relief to see the V60 come out with an actually reasonable price that slots under the highest-tier phones and actually matches its capabilities. And interestingly, the result is a flagship that cuts on price and makes a case for itself as a solid value option.
At a glance
LG V60 ThinQ 5G
Bottom line: The LG V60 doesn't stand out in one specific area, but is instead a well-rounded flagship phone at a competitive price point. It's very large, and has software and a display that feel stuck in the past, but those are marginal issues. Elsewhere the phone looks and feels good, has incredible battery life, capable cameras, a headphone jack and a full spec sheet. There's great value here for under $1000.
The Good
- Incredible battery life
- Good speakers and headphone jack
- Solid-feeling hardware
- Capable cameras
- Complete spec sheet
The Bad
- Very large and cumbersome
- Software is stuck in the past
- 1080p 60Hz display with big bezels
- Dual Screen has limited use

The hardware isn't going to win any design awards, but frankly few companies are doing anything novel or interesting — in my review of the Galaxy S20 Ultra I pointed out how Samsung's design language has stagnated as well. LG's executed on the glass-and-metal sandwich properly with a solid frame, tight tolerances, a reassuring heft and a nice little bit of flair in this blue-and-gold colorway. And inside, you have the latest Snapdragon 865 paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Elsewhere, there's a really good optical in-display fingerprint sensor that's faster and more accurate than the Galaxy S20+, IP68 resistance and microSD expansion.

And even though this is a much less expensive phone than the Galaxy S20+, it still includes complete 5G support for the carriers it's launching on. I've been using the AT&T model in New York City, and regularly found its 5G network (Sub-6, from what I can tell) in upper Manhattan. Speeds landed in the 100-150 mbps range (just 10-15 mbps upload), which is much like my experience using T-Mobile's burgeoning mmWave 5G network. Both carriers clearly don't have a ton of spectrum in this area, so speeds aren't blistering fast, but you aren't going to buy this phone to use 5G today — it's a long-term play.
Now, the extras. LG is once again nailing the audio game. The V60's stereo speakers are crisp and clear, even at max volume, which is also noticeably louder than the Galaxy S20 Ultra and Pixel 4 XL I was using previously. And of course, there's a headphone jack! The increasingly rare port is here, and it's paired with LG's standard Quad DAC for solid wired sound.
LG also clearly prioritized battery life here, and it paid off. The V60 has incredible battery life, combining an efficient processor, 1080p display and relatively simple software with a 5000mAh battery yields fantastic results. I never ended a day with less than 30% battery, even on a heavy day with 5 hours of "screen on" time and an hour-long Duo group video call. On an easy weekend day, I was off the charger for about 13 hours and only used only 50% of the battery, even with over 3.5 hours of "screen on" time and both streaming music and using GPS for a 1.5-hour run.
This is beyond what I experienced on the Galaxy S20 Ultra set to the same screen resolution and refresh rate. This is some of the best, most consistent battery life I've seen on a high-end phone, and it's one of the V60's biggest strengths. When you realize how great battery life is here, you can start to understand why LG was willing to make the phone so thick and heavy.
Continuing in the positive column are the cameras, where LG went "basic" with just two lenses and no dedicated telephoto camera in a year when zoom is set to be a big differentiator. The main 64MP sensor uses 4-to-1 binning to take 16MP photos, and I actually really like the look. Coming off the heels of using the Galaxy S20 Ultra, which feels burdened by Samsung's heavy-handed processing, the V60 has a very light and subtle amount of processing. Photos look very natural, with balanced colors and no harsh over-processing even in HDR.
The trade-off is a distinct lack of fine detail — as soon as you zoom in on photos, you see that details are soft across the board, though it's rarely noticeable when viewed at full size. You also notice that dark areas brightened through HDR are quite grainy, but much like the simple colors this is something I'd prefer to edit later myself than have the phone try and likely to a bad job of processing itself.
The exact same characteristics are present in low-light photos, with natural colors and softness in fine details. But once again LG's approach of not over-processing works in its favor — many camera apps try too hard to smoothen, sharpen and brighten, and get it wrong. The camera tends to lean on slow shutter speeds (1/10 second was a common occurrence), though, which can produce blurry shots with seemingly small amounts of hand shake. But if you can hold steady, you can get surprisingly good low-light shots.
You give up zoom quality, but main camera and wide-angle shots are really good.
The camera app offers up 2X to 10X digital zoom on the main sensor. 2X photos look totally fine, with no discernible quality drop-off, but 4X zoom is definitely dodgy, especially at night, and the maximum-allowed 10X is really rough even in good lighting. And even though the 2X photos are fine, it's just a digital crop, so you aren't actually getting a change in field-of-view or perspective that make "telephoto" photos look truly different. Zoom is just one of the things you're giving up with the V60 compared to the S20+, and that's probably fine for a lot of people.
The wide-angle camera is just as solid as any other out there, providing a worthwhile trade-off in quality in exchange for an interesting an dunique field of view. Though with 1-micron pixels and no OIS, it struggles in low-light scenes in ways that the S20's doesn't. Even with this limitation, and the reality of where the zoom quality stands, I would still take an ultra-wide over a telephoto if the decision has to be made to just keep one.
LG V60 What I don't like
It was tough to decide which section the display belongs in — as you can see, I put it down here. On one hand, it's really solid: the 6.8-inch OLED panel is bright and colorful, and plenty clear outdoors in sunlight. It will get the job done for anyone; but it's also not as good as what Samsung has on offer. Off-axis color shift is more severe, it doesn't get as bright, and most noticeably it's stuck at 60Hz refresh rate when the entire industry is moving to 90 or 120Hz. It's also surrounded by hilariously large bezels, which are in full view with no curving on the sides, and a conspicuous teardrop notch for the front-facing camera
The V60's downright too big to hold comfortably in many situations, and that may give some people pause.
The size of the screen bezels are a harbinger of the remarkable size of this phone. If you can believe it, the V60 is wider and taller than the Galaxy S20 Ultra, which was already beyond the limit of what many people would consider manageable in one hand. I've obviously been conditioned to this size of phone having just used the S20 Ultra (in a case, no less), but even still I found myself struggling to deal with it. The V60 is effectively the same weight as the Galaxy S20 Ultra, but feels much larger because of its dimensions and its squared-off slab-like design does nothing to hide its size.
Reaching anywhere near the top of the screen requires some hand contortion, and even still you probably won't get your thumb up there. And with this width and weight, hand fatigue is a real concern when you want to hold it in one hand and scroll through feeds or read for any length of time. Even though I recognize that the size is part of the deal when you get a battery this big, this could easily be a deal-breaker for some people.
Let's shift to software, where you find another one of LG's historically weak areas. This is Android 10, thankfully, and it has LG's latest overall design language refresh that has a simplified interface, thinner lines, lighter colors and many elements that have been shifted toward the bottom of the screen to make it easier to use on bigger phones. Unfortunately, it's still burdened by years and years of cruft that just makes it feel downright old and unintuitive when coming from any other Android phone.
LG's software feels stuck in the past, even though everything works and it's relatively feature complete.
The launcher has ancient animations, no gesture for dropping the notification shade, an app drawer that doesn't stay sorted when you add/remove apps, and old iconography throughout. The software even still warns you to not remove your battery when your phone freezes, an error message still hanging around from the G5 in 2016. Things mostly work as you expect, and none of the quirks get to real annoyance levels, but when you set it side-by-side with software from Samsung, Google and OnePlus you just scratch your head and wonder if anyone in LG is willing to take a critical look at its own software and bring it up to modern-day expectations.
And I have to mention what AT&T has done to this phone's software, because LG isn't selling the phone unlocked here in the U.S. — only through Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. AT&T pre-loads over two dozen apps, and includes another utility that pushes notifications and attempts to trick you into re-installing its apps and other app trails. It's just disgusting. My understanding is the T-Mobile model is far better in this respect.
The Dual Screen works as intended, but it doesn't have mass appeal.
Nope, I didn't forget about the Dual Screen attachment — though you may have, if you knew about it in the first place. This is what looks at first to be a rough-and-tumble rugged case with a fold-over screen cover, but that cover actually has a second identical 6.8-inch display inside. The case provides no extra battery, and runs the display over USB-C built into the case.
I can give LG credit for executing on its idea — the Dual Screen works. You can run two apps simultaneously, or span many apps across both screens, and it works in landscape and portrait. The screen also turns off when folded around the back of the phone. But for that extra utility, you're burdened by even more thickness, width, height and weight — on a phone that's already huge. It'll be interesting for some people, but it isn't a feature with mainstream appeal.
LG V60 Should you buy it?
In keeping its focus, and not trying to do anything new or particularly exciting, LG set itself up to actually make a really good phone. It doesn't have any blunders or missteps here; the only thing you can accuse the V60 of is being, well, boring. It doesn't have one thing that would make anyone lust after it or choose it over the Galaxy S20+. That is, until you factor in pricing: the Galaxy S20+ is $1200, the S20 Ultra is $1400 ... and the V60, at its most expensive, is $950 at Verizon. And it's $900 at AT&T.
The value is particularly strong at T-Mobile, where you can get the V60 without the Dual Screen for just $800, or just two-thirds the price of a Galaxy S20+. With these specs, the only comparable phone in my eyes is the Google Pixel 4 XL, which has a considerably better camera and software experience, but considerably weaker battery life and is missing some of the V60's extras.
For only $800, or even at $900, the V60 offers a really good flagship phone experience — even though it isn't a perfect match for every single top-end spec and feature, and can't match Samsung's qualities in display, or the rest of the industry in software design. If you can look past some of its quirks and small shortcomings, and deal with its size, you'll save hundreds of dollars and get excellent battery life in a well-rounded 5G flagship phone.
LG V60 ThinQ 5G
The V60 offers you most of what you'd get in a Galaxy S20+ for hundreds less. It lacks some polish, but has good specs, nice hardware and exceptional battery life.

While it may not be worth upgrading your phone for 5G, if you need a new phone, it makes a lot of sense to make sure it's compatible with the next generation of mobile broadband. With coverage constantly improving and plenty of phones to choose from, it's time to get 5G service.

Samsung Galaxy S20 5G
Top specifications with sub-6 5G built in
Samsung's latest Galaxy comes with a fast Snapdragon 865, a large 4,000mAh battery, and a great camera. It also supports sub-6 5G.
You already have 5G coverage
A year ago most people didn't have any 5G options in their areas, especially if they didn't live in a big city but with sub-6 5G, T-Mobile and AT&T have greatly increased the range of their 5G towers. In fact, AT&T now claims to cover more than 120 million people with its combination of sub-6 850Mhz (n5) and 39GHz mmWave (n260) 5g coverage. T-Mobile claims to cover more than 200 million people with coverage in all 50 states. T-Mobile's rapid expansion comes with its large quantity of 600Mhz (n71) spectrum with capacity added thanks to Sprint's 2.5GHz (n41) spectrum as well as T-Mobile's own mmWave nodes at 39GHz (n260) and 28GHz (n261).

Make the most of your new phone
Many people commit to a couple of years before upgrading their smartphones. With 5G deployment right around the corner for most people, having a phone that will be ready for this new technology makes sense. With a 4G-only phone, you could be paying for a network you can't even access until your next upgrade opportunity.
Buying electronics for next year rather than this year is a common practice for many people. It's annoying having a phone that doesn't support the newest tech when it's only a few months old. Luckily the majority of flagship Android phones to come out this year have come with some sort of 5G network. This includes the newest OnePlus 8, LG V60 Thinq, and of course the Samsung Galaxy S20 series of phones.
What is 5G technology?
5G has more capacity
If you are connected to 5G technology you are connected with the most modern, most powerful wireless network available. With 4G LTE Advanced, you can get many of the speed benefits of 5G, but your latency will be higher and the network won't be as efficient at handling a full load. Greater latency will be felt when navigating many different apps that require a constant online connection.
The extra milliseconds it takes 4G LTE to form a connection can really start to add up for a heavy user. To add to this, 5G will be able to route a large number of connections simultaneously to help the network feel responsive even when it is hit with a heavy load.
More room to grow
When it comes down to it, bandwidth is the biggest factor affecting speed and consistency on a wireless network. In this case of mobile networks, it depends on how much spectrum a carrier has been able to use in a location that isn't consistent across the entire country. Still, 5G has been making use of a much wider range of spectrum from sub-6 bands from AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, to millimeter-wave 5G operating above 28GHz. Even still, the FCC is opening up additional spectrum on the C-Band, around 3.5GHz, to be used for 5G.
A better hotspot
Verizon at least offers more hotspot data on 5G. Even if you have your standard hotspot limit, 5G offers a connection much more competitive with a home connection and in many cases, faster than cable or even fiber. 5G as a home internet service is in the early stages of being rolled out but it skips most of the coverage concerns of mobile 5G while keeping all of the benefits.
Move to the cloud
A lot of us know the benefits of cloud saving — save space on your phone and reduce clutter by offloading apps and saved files to the cloud. 5G can help you retrieve these files with little delay and can allow you to work from multiple devices fluidly. It can also simply reduce the load on your local machine.
Treating data like a limited resource can really hurt the usefulness of a phone. When data is an afterthought, you are free to use your phone to the best of its ability without worrying about your connection. New phones have beautiful, high-resolution displays and having the data needed to push full HD videos and even games with 5G finally takes advantage of these beautiful screens.
Cutting edge
If you're like me, you like living on the cutting edge of technology. Having the fastest possible connection on my phone is a path towards a more useful and more complete smartphone experience. As more of my computing moves from home to my laptop or phone, a fast connection is more important than ever.
At the end of the day, new technology only matters if you can use it. With solid coverage, the experience available with 5G will be transformative for someone that needs to move a lot of data or demands immediacy in their daily life. 5G deployment is picking up steam and I, for one, want to be on the first train out.

5G is the newest and coolest mobile technology currently being built into phones but there are still a few reasons to wait.

This year, stores have had trouble keeping consoles like the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 4 Pro in stock at their regular prices. However, with the all-new PlayStation 5 models finally released in mid-November, retailers may take this opportunity to offer customers the PS4 or PS4 Pro at a low, discounted price one last time — if there's any stock left, that is.
PlayStation 4 Black Friday deals are generally available each year, so there's still a good chance we may see a discount on the Slim or Pro console at retailers like GameStop or Kohl's. The likelihood that we'll see a deal on a refurbished PlayStation 4 console from GameStop is even higher — one such offer is even available right now. Below we're gathering all the best PS4 Black Friday deals as they go live to make shopping for your next console even easier. Plus, we'll be including any early Black Friday deals we see on these consoles as this year, stores aren't waiting for the end of November to offer their best savings. Check out our Black Friday deals guide for even more early ways to save.

When is Black Friday 2020?
Black Friday is officially November 27, 2020 this year, though stores will be doing things a bit differently than usual. Black Friday-worthy deals are going live starting as early as mid October as retailers hope to keep customers from crowding stores during the end of November. That also means we'll be seeing more online deals than ever before, and your chances of snagging a PS4 deal from home, if stores do offer a PS4 deal, is higher than ever before. Learn more about this year's Black Friday in our guide to Black Friday 2020.
Should I buy the PlayStation 5 instead?
The PlayStation 5 looks to be a solid upgrade over the PlayStation 4, but it also comes at a heftier price. The digital-only PlayStation 5 model is priced at $399, while the PS5 with Ultra HD Blu-Ray Disc Drive is priced at $499. At that cost, it may be worth picking up the PlayStation 4 for now if you don't have $400+ in your budget for a new console. It will likely be some time before we see any substantial discount on the PS5.

There are many choices when it comes to charging cables. For the Oculus Quest, a USB-C cable is provided for charging. But, what are your options if that cable is lost or damaged? Most cables will provide the charge you need, but why accept a mediocre charge when you can have the best?
- Link compatible: Party Link
- The reliable one: Anker Powerline+
- Precision manufacturing: Belkin USB-IF Certified cable
- Budget cable: Cable Matters USB-C Cable
- Versatile and stylish: JSAUX USB Type C Cable
- USB-C to USB-C: UGREEN USB C Cable
Link compatible: Party Link
Not only is this a great replacement charging cable for your Oculus Quest, but it's also Link compatible with over 1,333 Mbit/s data transfer rate. This will allow you to play Rift S games on your Oculus Quest.
The reliable one: Anker Powerline+
This strong, braided cable will withstand quite a bit of use. Perfect if you're always on the go and need something that will withstand a lot of wear and tear.
Precision manufacturing: Belkin USB-IF Certified cable
This cable is manufactured with precision to protect your device's components. Coupled with a power charger, this cable will meet all your Quest charging needs.
Budget cable: Cable Matters USB-C Cable
This cable provides an affordable, but reliable option to charge your Quest. Designed to be repeatedly unplugged, it's perfect for a device that needs constant recharging.
Versatile and stylish: JSAUX USB Type C Cable
This cable is built with military-grade materials and comes in many stylish colors. Also, it provides a fast charge, which will guarantee you will be back to your VR session in no time at all.
USB-C to USB-C: UGREEN USB C Cable
If you lose your Quest cable, but still have the included plug, you might consider buying another USB-C to USB-C cable. This way, you can always charge your Quest from an outlet as opposed to a USB port.
The best charging options
As you can see, if you lose or damage your Quest's charging cable, there are many options to choose from. Since the Quest uses a standard USB C port, most options will work to some degree. However, matching your Quest with a good quality cable will ensure you get a fast and safe charge.
These are the best options we've found for the Quest and will be suitable replacements for your original cable. Now that the Quest is capable of playing Oculus Rift S games through Oculus Link, having a super-fast cable that can do both is key. My personal favorite is the Party Link. Use this cable to tether your Quest to your PC for some excellent VR gaming. For a more budget solution, you should check out Cable Matters USB-C.

This feature, which is expected to start as a Beta in November, allows you to connect a USB-C cable from the headset to your gaming PC so you can play Oculus Rift S games on your Standalone VR headset.
As features go, this is a bombshell. Oculus Rift S and Oculus Quest launched on the same day, and the general thought was you'd get one if you wanted high end PC-class VR experiences and the other if you wanted a truly portable VR platform with Six Degrees of Freedom in movement for controllers and the headset. Both headsets are incredible, but with Oculus Link it kind of sounds like you only need one right?
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
I spent some time with Oculus Link here at Oculus Connect 6, and got some answers to the burning questions many have about this crazy new feature.
Does this actually work, or is there a bunch of latency?
Yeah, this really works. In my demo, there was a USB-C cable already connected to the headset and the Oculus app was running on a gaming PC. When I put the headset on, I saw the Oculus Quest UI with the option to choose Oculus Quest titles from the library. However, when I heard the mouse click on the other side of the room, the Oculus Rift S title Asgard's Wrath started loading.
When the game loaded, it felt like I was in a Rift S. The controllers in my hand were suddenly more detailed, and the game I was standing in was absolutely not the experience you get from a normal Quest title. As I moved around, picking up anything I could find to throw and see how natural it felt, I couldn't really pick up on any additional latency. This demo is set up under ideal conditions, and Oculus wasn't sharing what the hardware in that gaming PC was, but the latency difference was imperceptible for me.

What about graphics quality? Does it really look like a Rift S?
It looks as close to a Rift S as you can get when the hardware you're using is measurably less than the Rift S. The display isn't as dense and the lenses aren't as good on Quest, so you still have some small Screen Door Effect and God Rays that you wouldn't usually experience on Rift S. That having been said, when you look through those things it's damned close. I've played Asgard's Wrath twice on a Rift S before today, and this felt close to those other experiences.
Oculus is doing a lot of trickery to make this work. During a session explaining the mechanics of this transition, it was made clear Oculus Link deploys a unique set of custom graphics pipelines to make all of this happen. The encode/decode for everything happens in slices instead of the individual frame all at once, and during that encoding there's a distortion curve applied to the outer edges of the image, so most of the quality loss is happening where your eyes are least likely to be looking. It's never going to be 100% the same experience as a Rift S, but the amount of work Oculus is putting into making this happen in a way that isn't off-putting is significant.
Do I really need the special Oculus Link cable?
Not at all. Oculus has repeatedly said you can use any USB-C 3.0 cable and this will work. In fact, when the Beta for Link opens in November, you'll need to supply your own cable to test it out anyway.
Oculus made this cable because it had trouble sourcing a 5-meter cable that didn't have quality or weight issues, and that length was important for a tethered experience to still feel like you had lots of mobility. However, to make it all work, Oculus made its own Fiber Optic cable to meet all of the specifications it had for this experience.
Fiber Optic? Does the Oculus Link cable still charge the headset?
It does! During the demo today the headset charging light was constantly lit, and the battery in the headset claimed to be charging. As near as I can tell, this cable is also keeping the headset fully charged.
But it's also worth pointing out the cable I saw and used today is not the final design, so there may be changed made when the cable moves from Industrial Design to final product. It seems very unlikely that charging would be something sacrificed though.
How much will the cable cost?
A previous version of this article didn't have a price yet, and instead just speculation. We now know, however, this cable is going to be a whopping $79 when it is available to purchase.
And to make things slightly more complicated, fiber optic cables are notoriously fragile. If you regularly run over your normal Oculus Rift cable with your chair, there's a good chance you're going to end up buying more than one of these cables.
In the end, the cable might not be worth it, but the experience it provides might be.

5G is moving quickly and with coverage finally reaching more people thanks to Sub-6 5G. Verizon has been moving quickly on its Ultra Wideband network as well consistently adding new cities and towers. The best plan for you might depend on whether or not you get coverage. The best overall plan for 5G is T-Mobile's Magenta plan with unlimited data and Netflix included.
- Best Overall: T-Mobile Magenta
- Best Value: 10GB High-Speed
- Best International: Google Fi Flexible
- Best on AT&T: AT&T Unlimited Extra
- Best Hotspot: Sprint Unlimited Plus
- Best Speed: Verizon Play More Unlimited
Best Overall: T-Mobile Magenta
Unlike other carriers, T-Mobile doesn't relegate its most expensive plans for 5G so if you upgrade to a 5G capable device, you can get connected on any plan. T-Mobile's 5G network isn't the fastest right now but it has the most coverage by far. The speeds on T-Mobile 5G should be plenty for normal phone usage. With that in mind, the Magenta plan is one of the best values on T-Mobile thanks to its unlimited data with deprioritization at 50GB and Netflix included.
This plan only includes 3GB of LTE hotspot so it may be worth it to step up to the Magenta Plus plan for $15 more if you use a lot of data on your other devices. Similarly, you can drop down to the Essentials plan if you only need the basics. This makes T-Mobile one of the easiest ways to try out 5G without needing to go for the most expensive plan.
Pros:
- All plans get 5G
- Low-band and high-band
- Netflix included
- 5GB in Canada and Mexico
- Unlimited 3G speed hotspot
Cons:
Best Overall
T-Mobile Magenta
A dense 5G network and all you need is a 5G phone
T-Mobile's Magenta plan has everything smartphone users need without requiring a top-tier plan or a temporary discount.
Best Value: Metro by T-Mobile
Metro by T-Mobile brings T-Mobile's network, including 5G, without contracts. You'll get access to the same 5G network that regular T-Mobile customers do as long as you have a compatible phone, although it's worth noting that some LTE coverage may be weaker. You also don't get access to a hotspot.
This plan comes with 10GB of data which should be enough for most people especially considering that music streaming doesn't use up your data. Metro by T-Mobile is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to try out 5G. It's worth noting that Metro only offers the Galaxy Note10 Plus 5G in stores and does not sell other 5G capable T-Mobile phones.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Value
10GB High-Speed
A big 5G network without unlimited.
Not everyone needs a ton of data. Metro by T-Mobile includes 5G with all plans, along with the 10GB plan with free music streaming.
Best International: Google Fi Flexible
If you have a phone that works with T-Mobile's 5G network, you can get it connected with Google Fi. Google Fi's main flexible plan comes with unlimited calls and texts in the U.S. for $20 per month. Data comes in at $10 per gigabyte but Google Fi stops charging you at 6GB of usage. After this, your data is unlimited but it's significantly slowed down at 15GB. Still, if you make use of Wi-Fi points, this is enough for most people.
If you find you need more, Google Fi does have an unlimited plan available that slows down at 22GB. All of Google Fi's plans come with hotspot capability, which shares your standard data. One of Google Fi's most remarkable features is data roaming at the same cost in over 200 countries worldwide. This makes Google Fi a great option for frequent travelers.
Using a 5G phone on Google Fi means you will only have access to the T-Mobile network so whether you are in a 5G area or not, you will be limited to T-Mobile. There are no phones available for Google Fi that support the entire Fi network as well as 5G yet.
Pros:
- Only pay for what your use
- Same price for international data
- Hotspot included
- Bill protection at 6GB
Cons:
Best International
Google Fi Flexible
Pay for what you use
Only pay for the data you use with T-Mobile 5G and stay online while traveling abroad with no extra fee.
Best on AT&T: AT&T Unlimited Extra
AT&T has been working on its mmWave network for a while but so far it's only available to business customers. Recently, however, AT&T launched a low-band 5G network for consumers. This is different from AT&T's 5GE service, which was more of a well-developed LTE network. This is real 5G.
AT&T Unlimited Extra is the cheapest 5G capable plan and it comes with unlimited talk, text, and data with data deprioritization after 50GB. The plan does come with unlimited talk, text, and data in Canada and Mexico as well. Streaming, however, is limited to SD quality, making streaming less compelling on this plan.
It's worth remembering that the price per line comes down quite a bit with multiple lines. For example with four lines, the price comes down to $40 per month per line.
Pros:
Cons:
Best on AT&T
AT&T Unlimited Extra
A growing low-band 5G network
The Unlimited Extra plan helps you make the most of it with 15GB of hotspot and 50GB of premium data on a growing 5G network.
Best Hotspot: Sprint Unlimited Plus
Sprint chose to build its 5G network on its 2.5 GHz spectrum. This is significantly lower than Verizon's network, but it results in larger coverage areas similar to 4G LTE and good consistency. While speeds are slower than 5G deployed on higher bands, the extra coverage makes up for it in most use cases. It's also worth keeping in mind that Galaxy S20 series of phones on Sprint will have access to the T-Mobile low-band 5G network but Sprint customers.
Sprint offers two plans for 5G phones starting with Unlimited Plus. The more expensive Unlimited Premium plan gives you a few more streaming extras and bumps the hotspot up another 50GB.
Sprint's Unlimited Plus plan grants access to an impressive number of extras including Hulu Tidal with HD streaming. You also get 50GB of hotspot data and 10GB of roaming data in Canada and Mexico as well. Data is deprioritized at 50GB of usage, however. This plan starts at $70 per month with discounts available for multiple lines.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Hotspot
Sprint Unlimited Plus
A bigger footprint with more streaming extras
Sprint's 5G plan is a great value and the Unlimited Plus plan gives you the speed and consistency of 5G at a competitive price.
Best Speed: Verizon Play More Unlimited
Verizon has an impressive 5G network so far. Though the current coverage area isn't as dense as other carriers, Verizon's 5G speeds will outclass the Sub-6 networks — that is until you go inside. While the connection is very fast when it's in range, the higher frequency bands give it worse coverage and building penetration.
Verizon's 5G plans feel tailored for 5G with sensible upgrades, like the boosted maximum quality of streaming video. It also offers Unlimited 5G data and hotspot. That's because at first, 5G capability on Verizon was part of a $10 upgrade package. The upgrade is included with current phones but only for a limited time.
Apple Music is included and it comes with 15GB of hotspot data on LTE. With 25GB of premium LTE data to hold you over between 5G nodes, this plan is a good balance. Of course, the cost per line does decrease as you add more lines.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Speed
Verizon Play More Unlimited
Fastest wireless on a phone
Access one of the fastest 5G networks with Verizon's Play More Unlimited Plan. Support for 4k video and Apple Music is included.
Bottom line
All 5G networks in the US are growing rapidly with new cities being added all the time. Verizon has continued to focus on its fast network but progress is slow. Even so, unless you have coverage in your area and are willing to upgrade to a 5G capable phone, 5G service isn't worth worrying about. For the time being, most people will find 4G LTE service to be fast enough for their usage.
However, if you are interested in jumping on the 5G bandwagon, T-Mobile has one of the most robust 5G solutions so far and it's only improving with consistent updates and millimeter-wave capacity ready to deploy when more people hop on 5G. T-Mobile considers 5G to be a normal part of its network and, luckily for you, doesn't a premium to use it. T-Mobile Magenta is the best way to experience 5G today at a reasonable price, Netflix included, and the largest 5G network by far.

Surfshark VPN
From $2.49 per month (81% off)
Bottom line: Surfshark VPN is a relative newcomer but has already earned a strong reputation. It's one of the most affordable options on the market and has a solid feature set, though its current low price expires soon. It has a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you should definitely give it a try today.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$12.95||0%||$12.95 at Surfshark|
|6 Months||$6.49||50%||$38.94 at Surfshark|
|12 Months + 12 Months Free||$2.49||81%||$59.76 at Surfshark|
Pros
- Servers worldwide
- No user logs (British Virgin Islands jurisdiction)
- Unlimited device connections
- Apps for all major platforms plus smart TV platforms
Cons
- Sparse support site
- Finicky kill switch
Surfshark VPN is a relatively new service, though it has quickly gained a solid reputation for itself thanks to its balance of features and affordability. It has 1,000+ servers in 60+ countries, strong encryption, and keeps no logs. There are apps for major platforms like Android, iOS, and Windows, as well as smart TV apps for Apple TV and Fire TV, games consoles, and more. You can also connect as many as you want with one subscription.
Surfshark is one of the most affordable VPNs out there offering 12 months free with its 12 month plan. That means you're only paying $2.49 per month over the course of the two years and saving a total of 81% versus paying per month for that length of time.
Surfshark VPN
Surfshark offers one of the best cheap VPN options already, but this discount makes it an even better value. It's hard to beat this deal, especially considering everything that Surfshark does already and how well it performs. The deal won't be around forever, though.
Private Internet Access
$2.59 per month (78% off)
Bottom line: Private Internet Access is really affordable at under $3 per month. It has lots of available servers and you can run it on 10 devices at once which is more than most other providers allow. It's got apps everywhere you'd expect, though there's no live chat for support, just an email ticket-based service.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$11.95||0%||$11.95 at PIA|
|12 Months||$4.16||49%||$49.95 at PIA|
|24 Months + 3 Months Free||$2.59||78%||$69.95 at PIA|
Pros
- 3,300+ servers in 32 countries
- Strong performance, unlimited bandwidth
- Apps for all major platforms
- 10 simultaneous connections
- Affordable pricing
Cons
- U.S.-based
- Email ticket support
Private Internet Access is pretty popular, partially thanks to its already-affordable pricing such as its 1-year plan that costs just $4.16 per month. But right now, you get an additional 3 months thrown in for free with the 2-year plan dropping the relative monthly cost to $2.59. It has over 3,000 servers, though they are spread across only 32 countries. It has apps for all of the major mobile and desktop platforms as well as browser extensions.
One downside of PIA is that it's based in the U.S. which means any information it has could be requested by intelligence agencies. That being said, PIA states it keeps no logs so there would be nothing to hand over, but it's still worth considering when you are looking around.
Private Internet Access
PIA is a U.S.-based VPN provider that gives you an unlimited amount of data to use each month and up to 10 simultaneous connections.
NordVPN
From $3.71 per month (68% off)
Bottom line: NordVPN is one of the best VPN providers out there. Its balance of features and pricing makes it a smart choice for those wanting to protect their privacy with a no-logs VPN. There's a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can try it out risk-free, too.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$11.95||0%||$11.95 at NordVPN|
|12 Months||$4.92||58%||$59 at NordVPN|
|24 Months + Up to 24 Months Free||$3.71||68%||$89 at NordVPN|
Pros
- Plenty of servers in many locations worldwide
- No user logs (Panama jurisdiction)
- Anonymous payment options
- Apps for all major platforms
- Lots of extra features
Cons
- Fluctuations in server performance
- Recent security concerns
NordVPN is one of the best virtual private network (VPN) providers out there, due to its lack of user logs, plenty of servers, and P2P connectivity. It has apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and, and you can use one subscription across six devices simultaneously.
With NordVPN, the longer you prepay the cheaper your monthly cost becomes. It goes from $11.95 per month down to just $4.92 per month when you commit to its 1-year plan, for example. However, the best NordVPN deal right now is on its 2-year plan. Not only do you save 68% by going for that option, dropping the monthly cost to just $3.71, but you will also win an additional month, year, or 2 years on top of the 2-year plan you bought. It's a random chance but you'll get some kind of freebie regardless as long as its Cyber Month promotion is live.
It's worth noting that NordVPN was the center of a security blunder previously. One of its hundreds of servers was accessed by an outside party, though Nord assures customers that nothing major was taken during the attack and that the security has been enhanced as a result. While it may not be a make or break point in your decision process, it's worth keeping in the back of your mind.
Be sure to always check for a NordVPN discount before signing up, though.
NordVPN
NordVPN is one of the most well-known VPN providers out there right now, and it's plans get extremely affordable when you commit to using it long-term. You can sign up and prepay for two years to ensure you are always connected and protected and get some extra time on top of that for free.
FastestVPN
$20 lifetime license (95% off)
Bottom line: FastestVPN's $20 lifetime plan ensures you have access to a VPN when you need it most without any recurring costs. It's a feature-rich service that's easy to use and even if you only use it a few times per year it's worth purchasing at this price.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|Lifetime||$20||95%||$20 at FastestVPN|
Pros
- Affordable one-time payment
- Works on 10 devices at same time
- Fast speeds with Smart Connect feature
- Easy bypass for geo-restricted content
Cons
- Sparse support site
- Finicky kill switch
FastestVPN is running a new promotion that offers you lifetime access to its service for a one-time $20 fee.

You can use it on a wide variety of devices, including phones, tablets, computers, routers, Fire TV sticks, and more.

There are no monthly bandwidth limits, so you can leave it connected all the time if you want, and the company offers a 15-day money-back guarantee if you aren't satisfied.
Be sure to check it out before this deal is gone!

IPVanish
From $3.25 per month (73% off)
Bottom line: With its current deal, IPVanish is fairly-priced for its average feature set. The added free cloud storage is a nice perk and it has a 30-day money-back guarantee just in case.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$5||59%||$5 at IPVanish|
|3 Months||$4.50||63%||$13.50 at IPVanish|
|12 Months||$3.25||73%||$39 at IPVanish|
Pros
- 1,300+ servers in 50+ countries
- Reliable, speedy service
- Apps for all major platforms
- 10 simultaneous connections
- Free cloud storage
Cons
- U.S.-based
IPVanish falls in the middle of the pack for features, server availability, and price. None of that is bad necessarily, as a fairly-priced and reliable VPN service is the kind of product you want to get behind. It offers unlimited P2P traffic, powerful apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and even Fire TV, as well as a speedy connection.
With its current promotion, you can snag the one-year plan at a 73% discount. Billed as $39 upfront, you're effectively paying just over $3 per month for the service in your first year. One neat addition to this current deal is the inclusion of 250GB of SugarSync cloud storage at no extra cost which is extremely handy for going back to school or for working from home.
IPVanish is also one of very few VPN providers to be discounting its monthly plan right now meaning you can snag one month for just $5, down from its usual $12 cost. IPVanish recently moved from a 7-day money-back guarantee to a 30-day guarantee, too.
IPVanish

More VPN Deals
We've mentioned our favorites above, but there are plenty of other VPN providers out there offering some great savings. Each company has a slightly different advantage, some offering better customer support, some have cheaper plans, and some even have free trials. Here are some more VPN deals in case you couldn't commit to one of the above.
TunnelBear
TunnelBear is ideal for VPN novices with super easy-to-use apps, 24/7 customer support, and a free trial for those wanting to test it out before buying. Opting for a 2-year plan will save you 58% off its regular price.
ZenMate

Namecheap VPN
You may know Namecheap as a domain registrar but it also has its own VPN service. You can get your first month free ($5.88 thereafter) or sign up for a whole year for just $10.
hide.me VPN
You can score a year of hide.me's Premium VPN subscription for $60 and get a further 6 months thrown in at no extra cost. That drops your equivalent monthly cost down to just over $3 from the regular price of $13.
Windscribe
Windscribe always offers a free VPN plan, but you have to jump through some hoops to get up to 15GB a month. Or you can pay to upgrade your account.
What is a VPN?
VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. A VPN takes your Internet connection and makes it more secure, by cloaking your internet activity in anonymity and stops you from being tracked across the web for advertising, having your traffic intercepted, or running into malicious sites. They are also great if you want to access content that is blocked in your region as you can use one to appear as if you are in another country.
VPN 101: What is it?
You can run a VPN on everything from your computer or phone, to devices like your smart TV, Wi-Fi router, games console, and more. They come in at all different price points, so you're likely going to want to find a great VPN deal or discount to take advantage of when signing up.
How do you pick the best VPN provider?
There's so much to consider when deciding which VPN provider is right for you. Of course, you want to ensure it is available on all of the devices you wish to run it on, but you should also think about things like the service's server variety (both in number and physical location) to ensure you have a reliable connection and speed, what data (if any) may be logged, strength of the encryption used, ease-of-use, and the quality of customer support. On top of all of that, price may be a huge factor in your decision-making.
Why is it important to use a VPN?
As with many things in life, you tend to get what you pay for with VPNs. That being said, most providers will have a free trial or a money-back guarantee so you can try them out without risking your money. We've gathered up the best VPN deals above with the most pertinent information to help you make an informed choice.
How to get the Best VPN Deals
VPN providers generally offer better discounts the longer you subscribe for, so opting for a 3-year or 2-year plan is usually going to save you the most money. The majority of services have money-back guarantees so you can try out the apps on your devices and cancel your subscription if it's doesn't work out for you. Be sure to read the terms when signing up.
A few VPN services have free plans but these are usually restricted in terms of bandwidth. However, it can serve as a useful way to dip your toe into the VPN waters with no financial commitment. That being said, there are sometimes privacy implications with totally free services. If you're not paying for their product, they have to make their money back somewhere so make sure you take an in-depth look at the privacy policy for such services so you know what you're getting yourself in for.
We keep this list updated with the latest offers from the most reputable VPN providers, so bookmark it and check back in whenever you're in the market for a new VPN service. If you're unsure of which to choose, we have also put together a comprehensive guide on the best VPN services in 2020. We've also got a separate roundup highlighting the Best Free VPN Deals that you might want to check out.
Are there any free VPNs?
The short answer here is yes. You can find some free VPN providers, but they may not be the best option for everyone. Often times you are trading off speed, reliability, data limits, and more to get a free VPN, which makes it ultimately more of a pain to actually use the service. With the costs mentioned above, you are better off spending a few bucks each month on your privacy instead of trying to make a free one work for you.
Some providers offer free trials, and some have money-back guarantees. If you aren't sure whether or not a VPN is right for you, this is a great way to test the waters.
Can you use a VPN on your phone and PC?
Most VPN providers allow you to have simultaneous connections, which means that you can connect up to a set amount of devices to the VPN service at the same time. Most companies offer up to five devices at once, though some are slightly lower or higher than that number. This allows you to keep it running on your phone, tablet, PC, and even streaming hardware without worrying about whether you need to disconnect another device to connect the new one or not. A neat way around this, if your provider of choice supports it, is running your VPN on your router so any device connected to your Wi-Fi network is automatically on the VPN while only using up 1 device slot!
We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:
1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).
2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad.
We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services. Consuming pirated content that is paid-for is neither endorsed nor approved by Future Publishing.

Security and privacy
Pros
- Netflix unblocking
- Double kill switch
- Fast live chat support
- Dual layer encryption
Cons
- Slightly above average prices
- Browser extensions are basic
NordVPN is a very impressive service which has been around for years, perfecting its offering which is now used by over 12 million people worldwide. The Panama based VPN has a huge number of servers dotted all over the globe, offers lots of apps for various platforms, uses layers of powerful security and – crucially – is really good at unblocking Netflix. It's one of the few VPN providers included in our best VPN list as well.
It is worth noting that there was a server breach in 2018. Although the issue was the mistake of a third-party which has been fixed and, apparently, caused no leakages of data since NordVPN doesn't display data of real-time sessions or user information. The company assures users it's more secure than ever now as a result of this 'test'.
If you need a VPN to unblock Netflix, to keep banking and emails secure when on open Wi-Fi, like at hotels and coffee shops, or if you simply want to keep your browsing anonymous – you're in the right place. Here's everything you need to know about the NordVPN service so you can decide if it's the best VPN for you.
Pricing and plans
NordVPN has a selection of pricing plans which should mean there's a deal for everyone. As is often the case with VPNs, the longer you commit to, the cheaper your overall charges will work out.
If you go for the three year plan then you make a saving that represents a whopping 70 percent. Although this deal isn't always available.
A month by month plan will cost you $11.95 per month. A year long plan is charged at $6.99 per month. That three year option works out at $3.49 per month – billed every three years. This is similar to other options like ExpressVPN, but a bit more expensive than some others.
You can pay securely and anonymously using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies via CoinPayments. Or use Paypal, Amazon Pay, UnionPay, SOFORT Banking and plenty more.
You get a 30-day money-back guarantee so it's easy to try the service and if, for any reason, you don't like it, you can cancel and get your money back in full. Also, be sure to check out our best VPN deals roundup to ensure you always get the best price when commiting to a new VPN.
Testing and performance
NordVPN is all about layers of security which usually means you need to sacrifice speed. This isn't a big problem here though based on testing in real-world situations.
Connections, even to the most distant servers, work the first time, everytime and got us up and running in as little as four seconds and as long as six seconds. Impressive.
In the U.S. we used a 200Mbps line. The top test was with no VPN connected, the second was to a location in New York, and the final one was when connected to Germany. That makes this one of the faster VPN services out there, despite the extra layers of security.
For the UK we tested using a 75Mbps line and managed to get a very impressive 65-69Mbps.
For international connections, far further afield from our real-world location, we got decent 30-60Mbps speeds. Once again that's above average for VPN services.
Features
One of the most stand-out features of NordVPN is its ability to unblock Netflix. This is ideal if you're out of the country and still want to access your shows, despite them being geo restricted where you are. Lots of VPNs do struggle with this as many streaming services actively block VPN use. In the case of Nord, it was able to connect to Netflix first time and worked well with streaming at full quality.
NordVPN is also really useful when it comes to P2P content, or torrenting. This isn't something the company actively advertises, as some people may use it illegally. We don't condone that, but for legal use, where you may want a VPN to cover you in case you accidentally download something that's copyright protected, then Nord is ideal. While torrents aren't supported on all servers there are hundreds that do, which is a lot more than plenty of the competition offers.
Nord is a great option if you want to use it on lots of devices, not only because it works on six gadgets at once, but also because of the wide range of clients available for each device. This means dedicated software for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Android TV plus 20 other types it can be set up on including Chrome OS, Raspberry Pi, routers and more.
The company's very own NordLynx high-speed protocol is worth mentioning as it's based on Wire Guard tech and works to get you top speeds wherever you're connecting from.
Another unique and useful feature is auto reconnect. This is great if you disconnect to do something locally, but forget to reconnect – which happens more often than you'd think. This way, even if you forget, Nord will have you protected again in no time.
Privacy and security
NordVPN is crammed full of useful security features. In fact security is still one of its main features, despite all that 2018 attack mess. For example, you get not one but two encryptions along with Onion support. Nord also offers malware protection and phishing safety to keep you secure and anonymous. There's also a double kill switch and OpenVPN support backed by DNS leak protection.
That's a really impressive list of security features that all add up to one very secure online experience. But this is also backed up by a no logging policy that should help with your privacy. Since you can pay using Bitcoin or a number of other cryptocurrencies you should be able to stay totally anonymous. Since Nord says it doesn't store data on users' information, that should also mean that you're kept secure even in the event of a leak or attack.
Should you sign up?
If you want lots of layers of security that are also backed by smart protocols to keep you running super fast, then this is a great VPN option for you. Prices are decent, with excellent deals for longer term commitments. Privacy is superb and payment options are varied to suit most people.
This works on lots of devices and is backed by a great 24/7 customer support team meaning you should always get what you want out of this VPN no matter what you're doing or where you are on the planet. Yup, that includes Netflix unblocking and P2P torrenting too.
NordVPN happens to be one of the best Android VPN options available right now, so give it a shot for yourself.

How to pick the best VPN service?
Picking the right VPN service for you is not as hard as it may seem. There are a few things that you will want to consider when purchasing a new VPN subscription, so let's break them down now. The first thing you will want to make sure you find is a VPN provider that has a good app that's easy to use, which we've considered strongly in our rating of these services. Nearly all of the best VPN options will work on Mac, PC, Android, iPhone, Fire TV Sticks, gaming consoles, and more.
Another thing you will want to consider is how many devices can be used by your subscription at the same time, whether or not the companies offer strong customer support for when you run into an issue, and the overall cost of the service that you are signing up for. The best VPN services vary in cost big time and range anywhere from $2.49 per month up to over $6 per month. Our top pick, ExpressVPN, happens to be one of the most expensive, while our second favorite option, Surfshark, is one of the cheapest.
We have a full list of picks further down in this guide, but our top three best VPN options right now include ExpressVPN, Surfshark, and NordVPN.
1. ExpressVPN: The absolute best VPN option for most people
This is our top pick for anyone looking to get started with a VPN. It offers a great mix of speed, reliability, outstanding customer service, and affordability. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee, so give it a shot today.
2. Surfshark VPN: The best cheap VPN out there
With plans starting out at about 8 cents per day, it's really hard to skip over Surfshark because it's a paid service. It offers a ton of great features that you'd expect from a VPN provider, and is super simple to use.
3. NordVPN: The most well-known VPN for security
NordVPN offers an insane amount of server locations that you can pick from and is one of the best services for unblocking streaming services. It's definitely the most well-known brand in the VPN space right now.
1. ExpressVPN
The single best VPN service for almost everyone
|Category||DeviceNameTKTKTK|
|Compatible with||Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux|
|Streaming services unblocked||Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube|
|Servers||3,000+|
|Server Locations||160 in 94 countries|

Pros
- Superb 24/7 live chat customer service
- Fast & reliable connections
- Lots of international locations
- Netflix unblocking
Cons
- More expensive than some competitors
- Limited to five devices simultaneously
ExpressVPN is the closest you can get to being the single best VPN for every person out there. We've extensively tested the platform, it's apps, and more in our full ExpressVPN review, and it came out with a perfect five star rating. There are a number of factors that weigh into our decision here, like the amazing customer support, strong security measures, and an abundance of servers that are spread throughout various countries. There are no data limits each month when using ExpressVPN either, which means you can set it and forget it which makes it even easier to use.
It's common for VPN providers to have apps for your PC or Mac, and even your phones and tablets. Where ExpressVPN stands out even further is its custom firmware that is offered for some routers, its DNS content unblocking for a variety of streaming hardware, and its browser extensions that make connecting to access it all such a breeze. It's even one of our top VPN for Android picks.
Some of this sounds a bit intimidating, especially if this is the first VPN that you'll ever use. Worry not, though. The software is extremely easy to understand, and couple that with ExpressVPN's stellar customer service and you'll quickly realize there is nothing to worry about. The support agents actually understand the platform and are able to answer questions with actual information, which is surprising to see these days.
When it comes to security, ExpressVPN offers industrial-grade encryption, P2P support, DNS leak protection, a kill switch, no-logging policy, and much more.
When it comes to downsides, there isn't much to complain about. The service checks a lot of the key boxes for what most VPN users will care about and want, though it does charge a bit of a premium for it. The pricing structure is higher than some of the competition, but using our link you can actually save up to 49% on your first year of service, along with an extra three months free. Remember, ExpressVPN gives you a free 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you don't find it valuable or just can't figure it out, you can always get your money back with ease.
ExpressVPN
This is our top pick for anyone looking to get started with a VPN. It offers a great mix of speed, reliability, outstanding customer service, and affordability. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee, so give it a shot today.
When trying to pick the best VPN provider for yourself there are a lot of things to consider. Encryption is one of the most important features of a VPN, and one of the main uses for most people. Think about how much time you spend online each day. You enter banking details, credit cards, passwords, and more all around the web, and sometimes from an unsecured public connection. Using a VPN you can keep all that data secure as it's passed from your phone through the virtual tunnels of the internet.
Another great vpn use is that you can easily connect to a server in a different location than where you are. This is called "spoofiing", and it makes it appear as though your traffic is coming from somewhere it isn't actually. That means you can access local content like concerts, sporting events, news, and even things like Netflix libraries.
The hardest part about a VPN is not actually using it, but instead understanding which one to pick for yourself. Nowadays you can find tons of different VPN options, some of which are free and others that are paid. Some of them have data limits, and others cap the number of simultaneous connections, and picking out the best VPN is not an easy task. Don't panic, though. We've done the hard part and have put various options through their paces so that we could break it down for you. Our top pick, for a number of reasons which are listed below, is ExpressVPN. It provides the best overall balance between price, speed, reliability, ease of use, and customer service.
Check out a full breakdown of all the best VPN services to see the good, the bad, and all the differences that make them unique below. We've also rounded up the best Android VPN apps and best free Android VPN options for your consideration.
2. Surfshark VPN
Best VPN service for those on a budget
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, BBC iPlayer, Amazon | Servers: 1,700+ | Server Locations: 100+ in 63 countries | Trial Period: 30 days
Pros:
- Over 1,000 servers available
- Company based in British Virgin Islands
- 30-day money-back guarantee
Cons:
- Privacy policy wording is vague
- Android app is less reliable than other versions
Surfshark may have a fun, cute name for its service, but that doesn't mean it's not one of the best VPN options out there to sign up for. The company allows you to connect an unlimited number of devices to your subscription and keep them all secured at the same time. With Surfshark, you'll have access to over 1,000 different servers that are spread throughout 60 different locations. This gives you plenty of variety when trying to change your location and access content not available locally.
The company is based in the British Virgin Islands and has all the basic VPN requirements in place, including AES-256 encryption, a kill switch, DNS leak protection, and an extra security measure in place via its Double Hop capabilities.
You'll be able to easily use and navigate the interface of the apps, as the Surfshark team has stripped out all the extras. The wording in the official privacy policy is a bit unclear, but Surfshark maintains that it does not keep any logs nor user histories for any sessions.
It comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, giving you enough time to try it out and see if it's the VPN service for you or not. Be sure to check out our Surfshark review as well. The company recently changed its pricing structure, now giving you 24 months of access for just $59.76 total, which breaks down to about 8 cents per day. After the first two years, it renews annually at this price.
Surfshark VPN
You can connect as many devices as your heart desires at the same time and never worry about any of them being logged. Surfshark also offers a 30-day guarantee that you'll like the product, or it will give you your money back.
3. NordVPN
Best server options of any popular VPN
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, iPlayer, Amazon | Servers: 5,300+ | Server Locations: 80+ in 59 countries | Trial Period: 30 days
Pros:
- Nearly 6,000 servers
- 2048-bit encryption
- Multiple plan options
Cons:
Now, NordVPN and why it's potentially your next VPN service. The company continually matches or beats all of its competitors in terms of features and speed. There are more than 5,600 servers (see why only one of them being breached seems a bit less impactful now?) in more than 60 countries, and Nord opts to go for 2048-bit encryption instead of 256 that others are using.
As you'd expect, NordVPN offers all the standard security features that the competitors do, but comes with some extras as well. You'll have DNS leak protection, a kill switch, apps for nearly every platform out there, and an easy built-in feature to allow you to get around geo-blocks with ease.
While there is a lot of stuff to enjoy about NordVPN, that doesn't mean that it's perfect. Finding servers is a painful experience because they are not organized alphabetically, and trying to navigate the menus is equally as frustrating. The apps could use a bit of an overhaul, but that's a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things.
Back in 2018 one of the company's servers was compromised, but it was just one of more than 5,600. After investigating it, and the confirmation from Nord, it was understood that it was a single server with limited information being obtained. There's a lot at play here beyond just Nord's involvement, and our pals at TechRadar have a great breakdown, so be sure to check that out.
When signing up for NordVPN, you can opt to pay for just a single month of access, or go with a one-year or three-year plan. The cost per month drops significantly as you commit to a longer period of time, with the best pricing being on the three-year plan.
Be sure to check out our full NordVPN review now!
NordVPN
NordVPN is one of the most common and biggest names in the VPN space, and it also happens to be one of the best. It offers amongst the largest number of server options and some high-quality app experiences.
4. IPVanish VPN
Best VPN with free cloud storage
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, YouTube, Hulu | Servers: 1,400 | Server Locations: 75+ in 50 countries | Trial Period: 30 days
Pros:
- Over 40,000 shared IP addresses
- Great customer support
- Now offers unlimited devices to be connected simultaneously
Cons:
- Server locations don't match what's said
- No iOS kill switch
IPVanish is a provider you won't want to rule out. It offers 1,300 servers spread across 75 different locations, allows for up to 10 devices to be connected at the same time, and boasts an impressive 40,000 shared IP addresses.
There are apps for all the popular platforms, including Roku, Fire TV, Mac, Android, iOS, Windows, and more. They aren't bogged down with useless features, and make connecting to the service the fastest and easiest thing to do from within it.
Throughout testing IPVanish we noticed the servers were almost always up and running, the download speeds were consisent, and slightly above most of the others we tested. One odd thing that was noticed was that not every server actually existed where it was said to be, which could be problematic for those looking to unblock content in specific area. This is only a minor thing, but something that's absolutely worth considering.
Another area where IPVanish excels is customer support. You can get support any time since the company offers 24/7 coverage, and agents are able to be reached right from within the iOS and Android apps. It really doesn't get easier than this, and the company just moved from a 7-day to 30-day money-back guarantee. Give our IPVanish review a read and then get started today.
IPVanish VPN
IPVanish may not have the biggest numbers for stats, but the service that the company offers is reliable and fast. Getting set up takes just minutes, so start today!
5. PIA VPN
Best beginner VPN option
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 3,300+ | Server Locations: 65+ in 45+ countries | Trial Period: 30 days
Pros:
- Easy to use apps
- No data limits
- Supports 10 devices at once
Cons:
Before sending the data of your session out anywhere, PIA assigns you a new IP address to help hide your online identity. It uses AES 256-bit encryption and has a no traffic logging policy.
There are more than 3,300 servers, which is great, but they are only spread amongst 50 locations, which is lower than most of the competition. Luckily, there are no data limits, though. This means that you're able to keep your sessions connected for everything you do without a worry of running out of data each month.
The apps are easy to use, and once you set them up the first time all you have to do is click a single button to instantly get connected.
As a United States based VPN company, PIA does store a little bit of user data on hand. Lots of VPN companies talk about no-logging and not keeping any information, so this is something worth keeping in mind as you sign up for it.
PIA VPN
While PIA may have lower server locations than most of the competition, it features zero data limits, 10 simultaneous connections, and easy-to-use apps, meaning it still remains a winner in our book.
6. PureVPN
Best shared IP address selection
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 3,000+ | Server Locations: 160 in 94 countries | Trial Period: 31 days
Pros:
- Over 2,000 servers
- Round-the-clock customer support
- Tons of shared IP addresses
- Works with almost every device & browser
Cons:
These days, odds are you stream a lot of your media via an app or online, and PureVPN is one of the best VPN providers for this. The service works with Android TV, Roku, Kodi, Xbox, PlayStation, and so much more. There's also a router VPN option that lets you use PureVPN on up to five devices that are connected through the router.
PureVPN offers over 300,000 IP addresses (which is amazing) and there are more than 2,000 servers that are spread across 140 different locations. Given the variety of locations, PureVPN is able to maintain fast speeds for streaming relatively easily and allows you to easily unblock content on Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services with ease.
There's an automatic kill switch that ends your internet session should the VPN disconnect so you don't have to keep monitoring it in the background. This little bit of behind the scenes magic just adds a bit more of a sense of security while you are using the service. It supports up to five simultaneous connections, which is a bit lower than some of the competition.
PureVPN offers round-the-clock customer support 365 days a year, and edges out the competition by offering a 31-day money-back guarantee instead of just 30 days. We have a full PureVPN review to check out as well.
PureVPN
PureVPN is so confident you'll like its service, that it offers a whole extra day on its money-back guarantee than Express does. Jokes aside, it offers a ton of server options spread wide in different areas, and offers great customer support.
7. Hotspot Shield VPN
Best free VPN service with lots of features
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, YouTube | Servers: 3,200+ | Server Locations: 130+ in 80+ countries | Trial Period: 45 days
Pros:
- Great customer support
- Unlimited bandwidth each month
- Over 2,500 servers
- Great free plan available
Cons:
Almost every complaint that we have with Hotspot Shield in our best free VPN post is solved by just paying a few bucks for the company's premium offerings. You step right up to unlimited bandwidth and gain full access to all of its 2,500+ servers that are scattered across 70 different locations. You can connect up to 5 devices at the same time still, and you get that wonderful 24/7 support as an added bonus.
Hotspot Shield is completely ad-free, doesn't log any data. The service is available on a variety of devices, like iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Routers, Chrome, and more. The company switched from OpenVPN support to its own Catapult Hydra protocol, which means you can't set it up on your router, Chromebook, and a few other places.
While talking about areas that Hotspot Shield is lacking, it's worth noting that there is no Bitcoin support, and the raw speeds that it delivered in testing were lower than many of the other services we tested. Hotspot Shield does offer a free 7-day trial, though, so it's definitely worth giving the service a shot.
Hotspot Shield VPN
This is our top recommendation for those looking for a free VPN. You do need to enter your credit card number, but the company won't charge you and you can use the service for free beyond the 7-day trial.
8. CyberGhost VPN
Best streaming VPN with easy one-click connections
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 6,400+ | Server Locations: 110+ in 90 countries | Trial Period: 45 days
Pros:
- Over 6,200 servers available
- Based in Romania & Germany
- Automatic server matching for geo-restricted content unblocking
- 45-day money-back guarantee on 3-year plan
Cons:
CyberGhost is a company that's based out of Romania and Germany. It has more than 6,200 different servers that span more than 110 locations, which is quite impressive.
Where CyberGhost really excels though is in its interface. The company doesn't make you guess which server to use for certain tasks, it helps you identify them with ease. Select the geo-blocked service that you want from a list, like Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, etc, and then it will show you the best servers to connect to in order to view the content. Once connected to the server, the app will even open a browser window for you so you can start streaming. That's convenience if we've ever seen it.
Additionally, the service can block ads, trackers, and malicious sites. It automatically sends you to the HTTPS version of each site to ensure you are viewing the most secure option you can. On mobile, you can enable data compression to help save you some MBs while on the go.
Thanks to the ease of use, speeds, and reliability it offers, CyberGhost has been able to bring over 10 million users to its service. The pricing is quite competitive, and by signing up for longer-term plans you can help reduce the per-month cost of the service as well. Will you be the company's next subscriber? Check out our full CyberGhost VPN review for all the details.
CyberGhost VPN
CyberGhost makes using a VPN easy by helping you choose the best server to use for certain tasks, and it generally offers some of the best pricing around as well.
9. TunnelBear VPN
Best easy-to-use VPN option
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 1,000+ | Server Locations: 23+ | Trial Period: 30 days
Pros:
- App is super simple to use
- Uses independent specialists to conduct audits
- Apps available for major platforms
Cons:
TunnelBear may not be the best option of this list for those looking for granular control over where they are connecting or how their VPN is operating. The company goes for a much more simplistic approach, which works for most people in all honesty. The interface is very clean and easy to understand, and the apps are available on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and there are even a few browser extensions.
Beyond just the app, Tunnelbear offers a pretty simple experience all around. There are only 20 different server locations
The focus on simplicity goes beyond just the app, though. There are only 20 server locations, which is a good bit less than many of the others are offering. That's not a huge concern, though something to note if you're looking to connect to specific locations.
On the privacy front, which is what most people are using a VPN for, TunnelBear scores some extra points for its hiring of independent specialists to run a security audit on its servers. This is something no one else is doing, and we wish that more companies would follow suit and do the same.
TunnelBear VPN
The data limit is low, but if you are just lookint to test the water or use it infrequently, TunnelBear is a great choice to consider.
10. StrongVPN
Best gaming VPN for players & streamers
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 950+ | Server Locations: 60+ in 30+ countries | Trial Period: 30 days
Pros:
- Great connection speeds
- No logging at all
- Built-in WireGuard support
Cons:
StrongVPN really excels when it comes to those looking to game while connected to a VPN, but that doesn't mean that you can't use it for other things as well. It comes with WireGuard integration that allows for an industry-leading speed and performance level which is something that's very important. Beyond just gaming, it works across other platforms like Android, Mac, iOS, Windows, Linux, and more.
There is an absolute zero-logging policy which means that StrongVPN collects no data on your sessions, what pages you look at, your location, or any of that. You can connect up to twelve devices at the same time, which should cover pretty much all of your devices at the same time.
While it may not seem to compete when it comes to the number of servers, how many locations they are in, and all that, but StrongVPN manages to have some of the best connection speeds around. You can also use it to easily unblock media content from different streaming services that may not be available where you are. With prices starting at under $6 per month, you'll want to give StrongVPN a try!
StrongVPN
The built-in WireGuard support here makes StrongVPN a gamers dream VPN. Give it a try today and see how you like it!
11. ProtonVPN
Best security-focued VPN provider
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 800+ | Server Locations: 50+ | Trial Period: 30 days
Pros:
- Based in Switzerland
- Many servers utilize 10 Gbps connections
- Has great free plan with unlimited bandwith
Cons:
- Free plan users are deprioritized during peak hours
Proton may not offer the most servers, or have them spread out in the most locations, but if there is one thing that the company knows it's privacy and security. ProtonVPN is designed to ensure that no one can eavesdrop on your connection, and it does so by routing your connection through fully encrypted tunnels.
The company is based in Switzerland, which means that it benefits from additional strong legal protection. Switzerland offers some of the world's strongest privacy laws, and remains outside of the EU and U.S. jurisdiction, meaning that it can't be coerced into spying on any users.
There are strong no-logging policies, DNS leak protection, a kill-switch, and it can be used as an always-on VPN that automatically reconnects to a server should the connection be interrupted at any point. All of the servers have a minimum speed of 1 Gbps, and many of them actually use a 10 Gbps connection.
Before you get started with the paid service, you can always try ProtonVPN out for free. It is worth noting that the company does prioritize paid users during peak times, so on a free plan you may notice slower speeds when more people are online.
Whether you end up wanting a free or paid plan, Proton is definitely a VPN provider worth considering.
ProtonVPN Free
From the creators of the secure and encrypted ProtonMail comes ProtonVPN. There are no data limits here, but free users are deprioritized in favor of paid ones during peak usage times.
12. Windscribe VPN
Best free VPN with option to earn extra data monthly
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 400 | Server Locations: 110
Pros:
- Free plan offers generous data bucket
- Supports unlimited simultaneous connections
- Apps for all major platforms
Cons:
We featured Windscribe on our best free VPNs post as well because of the unique approach it takes to data allotment. With the paid plans, however, you get an unlimited amount of data to use each month and can connect an unlimited number of devices at the same time. It has more than 400 different servers that span across 60 different locations, which is about average.
There are clients for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and extensions for all the popular browsers. You can manually set up Windscribe on your router, Kodi, and more with a little extra effort.
Unfortunately, Windscribe speeds can be a little bit slow (due to the low overall server count, likely), and there is no 24/7 support which means that you may have to wait a bit to get any issues you encounter resolved. It may not be the fastest, or offer the most options, but Windscribe is definitely worth considering. You'd be best off to check out the free plan for a month first, and then upgrade based on your needs.
Windscribe VPN
You can add to the healthy 10GB data allotment by tweeting your love for the Windscribe service and inviting friends. It's a great way to bring even more data to your free pool.
What about the other VPN companies?
There are hundreds, if not thousands, of other VPN providers. We've worked with our pals at TechRadar to test as many of them as possible and come up with a list of just the best. It seems like a new VPN provider pops up each week, and some of them make some pretty crazy promises.
We'd recommend sticking to one of the options mentioned here when you get started with a VPN. We are constantly looking at new offerings, reviewing our picks on this list, and ensuring that the information included in this guide is as accurate as possible.

VPN FAQs
If you're in the market for a VPN and need a little more information on exactly what a VPN is, what you can use a VPN for, and some basics like that, we have you covered. There are a lot of competitors covered above, but picking the right one for you is dependent on your needs. Let's take a look deeper into VPNs, and help you further in your buying path.
✏️What is a VPN?
A VPN is a Virtual Private Network. The idea behind it is to add an extra layer of security to whichever network you are trying to connect to, including both broadband and internet hotspots. It allows you to send a receive data privately while connecting to a public network.
Once connected, your traffic is routed through a "tunnel" which encrypts the data so that outside eyes can't monitor it. The protection prevents people from being able to not only see what is happening, but also prevents them from knowing where it is happening from.
In addition to adding security, you can use a VPN to "spoof" your location by connecting to a server that's based in a different location. This means you'd be able to bypass some geo-restrictions, and view content that you may not have been able to otherwise.
⚙️How do VPNs work?
A VPN works in a pretty simple manner, even though it may seem complicated. Behind the scenes, the VPN provider takes your data, routes it through a set of servers that can then protect it and change its location, and encrypts it. That means other's can't see what you are doing on public connections.
Instead of going from Your Device to the website, a VPN adds a middle step. Now the pathway actually looks goes from Your Device to Secure VPN servers then ends up at the website.
All of this is done in the background once you are connected to the service and a server. One of the coolest parts is that you can be sitting in an airport in New York and connect to a server in Europe, without having to move. You'd think that this extra step could slow your speeds, or put a delay in getting things done, but many of the best VPN providers offer fast speeds and reliable connections, so you barely notice that it's even connected in the background.
⚖️Are VPNs legal?
In most areas of the world, VPNs are perfectly legal. Some countries have put bans in place to restrict VPNs as a whole, and others have limitations on their use cases, though these generally apply to people who live there not travel there.
For the countries that do restrict VPN uses, there's often times some providers that are specifically approved for use there. This means that you may not have as many options, but some are better than none. For example, in China companies have to get Chinese government approval, and those who use unapproved VPNs can be fined heavily.
On the other hand, in the United Arab Emirates, things are far more serious. The fine for using a VPN (any of them) is over half a million dollars and you can be sentenced to jail time.
If you are unsure of the legalities of a VPN where you live, be sure to seek some information from local authorities before getting one installed.
❓Is a VPN worth it?
At this point, having a VPN is a really smart choice to make, and we would suggest that everyone uses one especially while connecting to public Wi-Fi spots. These don't offer any of their own security measures, so you'll want to make sure your data is safe while you use it.
So much of our day to day activity is done online. Think about how many times you've accessed bank information from a public network, or logged into your most personal accounts from the airport. All of it is unprotected, and in the hands of the wrong people it could be bad for you.
In most cases, a VPN is a nominal cost each month, and there are even some free options that are definitely worth considering. For the price of a cup of coffee, or a fast food lunch, you could add protection to all your browsing sessions for the whole month. It's a pretty great trade off, honestly.
💻What are the best VPN uses?
There are many use cases for having a VPN, though two main ones stick out. Most people will use a VPN to secure their traffic, especially when connecting to public and open Wi-Fi. This is becoming a more popular requirement in the business world where people are constantly traveling. Many companies require the use of a VPN in order to access the company's intranet and services.
Alternatively, many will use a VPN to be able to connect to a server in a different location to access content that may be regionally blocked. This is known as "spoofing" your location, and it allows you to do things like watch Netflix, Disney+, and more from anywhere even if it isn't officially supported where you live.
There are plenty of other uses for VPN services as well.
💰Is a paid VPN better than a free VPN?
Many VPN companies these days offer both free and paid VPN options, but when you opt for the free one you make some sacrifices. Most of the time, the free versions allow for less devices to be connected at the same time, and the data allotments for each month are often substantially less.
Some services, like ProtonVPN offer unlimited data but will offer better speeds to paying customers during peak times. Windscribe allows you to score extra data each month by referring friends and tweeting about the service, so there are definitely ways to live with a free VPN, you just need to be a bit more aware of the limitations.
Upgrading to a paid plan ensures that you see no ads, often times means that there are no data limits, and many companies offer unlimited connections as well.
Any VPN (free or paid) is better than no VPN at the end of the day. Give a free service a shot to see if it works out for you, and if you are happy with it, then maybe you should consider upgrading to a paid option for an even better experience.
🔎What to look for when picking a VPN?
There's a whole lot of information above about different VPN providers, but knowing what's important to look for isn't always easy. We've broken it down into a few easy things that everyone should be focused on when researching different VPN providers.
- Does the provider have servers in the country you need? Sometimes you are looking to watch specific content, or you only want to be able to connect to local servers, and every single VPN provider operates in different areas. The server count isn't always the biggest factor in determining speed or reliability, so be sure to care more about location.
- Can you connect everything you want at the same time? Some providers offer only one connection at a time while others offer an unlimited amount. This is critical because you don't want to be worrying about disconnecting one device to protect another. Get one that works for everything you need it to.
- What is the logging policy? Many providers have a "no-logging" policy, but that doesn't always mean the same thing to each of them. Be sure to read through the Q & A and the privacy policy so that you totally understand what information (if any) is being collected when you use the service, and how it is used.
- Are you comfortable with the pricing structure? Prices vary from free to $15 per month for some services. The longer you commit to using the service (buying a one or three year plan) the cheaper you can get the per-month rate. It may prove worth spending a little more upfront to keep yourself protected for a longer period of time, for less.
📺Can a VPN unblock regional content?
One of the big selling points for many people is that you can use your VPN to spoof your location, meaning that you can access content that may not be available locally where you are at that moment. This is great for those who frequently travel and want to keep up with local shows. You can use it to unblock content from Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, and much more. Normally, you just need to connect to the VPN, then select a server based where the content you want to watch is streaming, and then you are able to watch it like you are in that country.
📱Should I use a VPN on my phone?
In an ideal world, you would use a VPN on every device that connects to the internet. This is the absolute best way to keep yourself and your data safe from tracking, hacking, and more.
Luckily, every one of the VPNs mentioned in this best VPN guide offer mobile apps, which means you can easily get started using it on your iPhone or Android device. We've also rounded up the best VPNs for Android along with the best VPN for iPhone, so be sure to check those out.

Thrill ride: Epic Roller Coasters
With Epic Roller Coasters, you get more than just a simulation of a roller coaster. The game allows you to race, shoot enemies, and compete with your friends.
Relaxing: Bait!
Bait! is a basic fishing game. In it, you catch a variety of fish to help a struggling aquarium. There are four different lakes to fish in, and each has its own types of fish.
Learning VR: Oculus First Contact
This game almost feels like an extension of the virtual welcome area you're placed in when setting up the Oculus Quest. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with the Quest's controls and allow you to practice grabbing, shooting, and more.
Virtual pet: Bogo
This is a lighter game than the others on this list, but this one gives you a chance to play with a cute virtual pet. You can feed it, take care of it, and explore a scaling play area.
Future pilot: Space Dodge2
This Oculus Go game is now available on the Oculus Quest. In it, you're a futuristic pilot on a mission. You travel through the galaxy and overcome challenges using just your piloting skills.
Flying free: FREE FLIGHTER
This combat flying game places you inside a dangerous nebula to battle your enemies. You have to protect your interstellar base and leaders from "the defilers." It's another Oculus Go game that can run on the Oculus Quest.
Simple but challenging: Cubism
At first glance, this puzzle game seems simple, but within it, you create increasingly complex shapes from colorful blocks. It has 60 levels to make you think in unique ways.
Get started with some free games
There aren't a ton of free Oculus Quest games, but you can explore several of the headset's features and have fun while you save to build up your library. Rec Room is the most impressive title on this list. Its variety of gameplay and a seemingly unlimited number of rooms allow you to play for hours with or without your friends. You get so much here, and you don't have to pay a dime.
Echo VR is another excellent free game on the Oculus Quest. It takes advantage of the untethered nature of the headset and has you move freely inside a virtual arena. Just make sure you don't bump into your furniture or another person!
If you haven't grabbed an Oculus Quest 2 or Oculus Quest yet and are just scouting out which games are avaialble, make sure to see how much storage you need for the Oculus Quest. On the Oculus Quest 2, choosing between the 64GB version and 256GB version comes down almost entirely to how many games you plan to store on the device.

Nest Wifi
Great value
Google Wifi
Nest Wifi is a natural progression for the Google Wifi line of home mesh networking equipment. With support for faster Wi-Fi connectivity and a faster CPU, the Nest Wifi should be capable of delivering great speeds with a solid connection between the mesh points. If you're looking to take advantage of a gigabit internet connection, Nest Wifi is worth the upgrade. Google Wifi is still a great solution for people that don't need that much speed on their network. If you don't need to download many large files or utilize cloud computing, such as working on a remote PC, that requires a flawless high-speed connection, Google Wifi is the option for you.
Sufficient speed
Both Nest Wifi and Google Wifi utilize Wi-Fi 5, or 802.11ac, to deliver a fast wireless connection. Google Wifi falls behind when it comes to pure speed thanks to a lower top speed than Nest Wifi. In most cases, both systems should carry enough speed for typical internet usage but with people using more data all the time, planning ahead can be very beneficial.
Keep in mind, these routers also have to use their Wi-Fi bandwidth to talk to each other so in the real world you'll never see the top speed of either connection. Mesh-style Wi-Fi systems aim for consistency and connection quality over pure speed. If you're a heavy network user with network storage or you access files from one computer on another, such as a media server, you'll find the extra bandwidth of the Nest Wifi provides a smoother overall experience.
Nest Wifi can be expanded with more Nest Wifi routers but you also can use the less powerful, but cheaper, Nest Wifi points for expansion.

yes (point)
snow, mist, sand (point)
As far as aesthetics go, Google Wifi only comes in white. The Nest Wifi router is also only available in white, however, Google calls it snow.
The Nest Wifi points are available in snow, mist, and sand colors to better match with the decor of your home. This is important because the points will likely be featured more prominently than most other mesh Wi-Fi points thanks to a built-in speaker and microphone.
It's worth keeping in mind that the Nest Wifi points don't have an Ethernet connection so they can't be used to extend a connection to a wired device and they can't be connected to the mesh with a wired backhaul. If you want this functionality, you'll need to add another Nest Wifi router or Google Wifi instead.
Coverage
Each Google Wifi is identical and covers approximately 1,500 square feet. The Nest Wifi improved on this figure with the router covering approximately 2,200 square feet and the point covering 1,600 square feet. You likely won't get any of these numbers in real-world usage due to interference that would affect any router, but the takeaway is that the Nest Wifi system is capable of covering a larger area with fewer units than Google Wifi.
Compatibility
Nest Wifi and Google Wifi are compatible with each other. This means if you have an existing Nest Wifi or Google Wifi network in place, it can be expanded with either product. If you want to upgrade your Google Wifi network to Nest Wifi you don't need to send your Google Wifi routers to recycling. You can use them to expand your Wi-Fi network to areas with poor coverage such as a basement or garage.
If you want to add the functionality of the Nest Wifi points to your Google Wifi network, you can, although you'll only get the speed of Google Wifi. Of course, you should place the fastest available router at the center of your network to ensure the best possible speed.
Smart home
The Nest Wifi Points come with a speaker and microphones built-in so you can access Google Assistant. While the speaker isn't Hi-Fi quality, it should be similar to the surprisingly decent Nest Mini.
It's a nice addition that each Wi-Fi point also handles the job of a smart speaker. This feature can help you reduce the number of electronics you have set up in each room and wire clutter.
These smart speaker features aren't available in the Nest Wifi routers but adding in a smart speaker with Google Assistant can fill in the gap. You'll need to set it all up in the Google Home app (also available on iOS) to get all of your points connected and working.
Which should you get?
Thanks to the additional speed and coverage of the Nest Wifi system, it's the more sensible base to your home mesh network. While Google Wifi still has a place to help expand your mesh or provide an Ethernet connection at a mesh point, its technical inferiority makes it much less compelling. The smart speaker in the Wifi points also increases the value of the Nest system. All things considered, Nest Wifi offers a more complete experience with the specs to keep it all running smoothly.

Here are some of the top Ring accessories that we think you shouldn't be without.T-Mobile has one of the most ambitious 5G plans of any carrier out there and with its purchase of Sprint, T-Mobile has a ton of spectrum and a great platform to build a great 5G network. T-Mobile has already deployed a nationwide 5G network on its low-band 600MHz spectrum and is continuing to add capacity with its 2.5GHz spectrum. T-Mobile also has mmWave spectrum that has been deployed in a few cities. This combined network is poised to be one of the strongest in the nation.
The 5G Galaxy
Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G
Fast, smooth, and cutting edge
Samsung's new flagship, the Galaxy S20+ supports all of T-Mobile's 5G bands including Sprint's 5G bands making it one of the best ways to get connected with 5G. It also has a great set of cameras, a beautiful display with a high refresh rate, and a massive battery.
Do I have 5G coverage on T-Mobile and Sprint?
Most people that have T-Mobile 5G coverage right now are covered by a low-band network built on its 600MHz spectrum. This low bandwidth helps the signal travel further than a lot of 5G networks. Reclaimed from broadcast TV, the 600MHz spectrum has allowed T-Mobile to upgrade its existing towers with 5G equipment and provide the same level of coverage people have come to expect from 3G and 4G.
Save big on these VPN services ahead of Black Friday
T-Mobile states that it already covers more than 250 million people in over 7,500 cities with 5G. This coverage is thanks in large part to the low band 5G T-Mobile is using to build its network though, thanks to 5G standalone, or 5G SA, coverage recently improved by 30% thanks to no longer needing to be able to connect to an LTE network at all.
If you want to know if you're covered by this network, check the 5G coverage map to be sure.
While our initial tests don't show the huge speeds people have come to expect with 5G, this low-band network does show some improvement over LTE and should be able to provide much better coverage in the long run.
T-Mobile has been hard at work making use of it's mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum. This spectrum will allow for higher speeds over low-band but it will be a bit slower to deploy. Still, T-Mobile is well underwar and making good progress in 2020.

T-Mobile is still building a high-band, millimeter wave, 5G network in a few cities. This deployment of 5G is on bands N260 and N261 at 39Ghz and 28Ghz respectively. With some coverage in New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Dallas, Cleveland, and Atlanta, the number of cities is high compared to other carriers but the actual 5G coverage is still quite low.

Which phones work with T-Mobile 5G?
T-Mobile phones will be compatible with different networks depending on their software and hardware. For the most part, most 5G phones will work with both of T-Mobile's sub-6 bands.

T-Mobile is using Sprint's 2.5GHz spectrum to bolster its own 5G network and to do so has taken the Sprint 5G network down. Sprint customers with a Galaxy S20 device got an update that enabled access to T-Mobile's 5G network but that's it. Older devices like the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G or OnePlus 7T Pro 5G will not be getting an update to support T-Mobile's 5G. T-Mobile is offering these customers a discounted upgrade to the Galaxy S20 but it is still a drag for those using Sprint 5G.
Should you buy a 5G phone in 2020?
Do I need a special T-Mobile 5G plan?
All T-Mobile plans can access the 5G network. T-Mobile makes no distinction between its networks so any customer with a compatible phone should be able to access it. This has also carried over to T-Mobile Prepaid and MVNOs such as Metro by T-Mobile and Google Fi. Sprint has also enabled 5G on all of its plans.
Boost Mobile is now owned by Dish and is transitioning its customers to the new T-Mobile network with the goal of eventually moving all of its customers to its own standalone 5G network.
What tech is T-Mobile using for 5G?
T-Mobile started with high-band 5G on 28Ghz and 32Ghz bands. With this network, T-Mobile should be competitive with what Verizon and AT&T have been doing once the network has more time to mature. This high-band deployment should be capable of very high speeds but building penetration and coverage are much more limited than we're used to with 4G.
T-Mobile launched a 600Mhz, low-band, 5G network in December of 2019. With new equipment, T-Mobile was also able to update its 4G LTE service on the same tower. This deployment should sound familiar to 5G enthusiasts since U.S. Cellular announced similar plans this October. AT&T has also followed along with its own low-band 5G deployment starting in late 2019.
Of course, there's Sprint's 2.5GHz spectrum. We got an early look at Sprint's 5G and while things were promising. T-Mobile has already begun to integrate this spectrum into its network adding more speed and capacity. T-Mobile has more than 160MHz of spectrum at 2.5GHz in the top 100 US markets and has already shut down Sprint's 5G network so it can continue implementing the spectrum into its network.
On August 4, 2020, T-Mobile launched its standalone 5G (5G SA) network. 5G SA can work alone without devices needing to connect to an older, less efficient LTE network first. Previously, 5G phones required this existing infrastructure to work properly.
Functionally, this is essentially the same network as before with some nice improvements. According to T-Mobile's announcement, 5G SA improves coverage by 30 percent since phones will no longer need to connect to a mid-band LTE signal that doesn't reach as far a 5G at 600MHz. While there were still many improvements with non standalone 5G compared to LTE in speed, the 5G network was held back. T-Mobile estimates a 40 percent improvement in latency thanks to the switch which should help data access be much more immediate.

What happens to Sprint's 5G customers?
T-Mobile's purchase of Sprint is complete and with it comes great potential. Many people will have flashbacks to older failed mergers but T-Mobile points to its well-handled Metro PCS integration as a model for this joining. T-Mobile estimates that fully integrating the networks will take up to three years so however, both Sprint and T-Mobile customers are starting to see some new benefits.
Sprint customers have gained access to LTE roaming on the T-Mobile network when Sprint signal is low. Also, Sprint customers with the Galaxy S20 can now connect to T-Mobile's 5G network including low-band 600MHz 5G as well as the 2.5GHz 5G network. T-Mobile customers currently can access the 2.5GHz 5G network in New York and Philadelphia.
T-Mobile recently shut down Sprint's 5G network in order to continue building its own. If you have a Galaxy S20, you still get 5G access but all other Sprint customers with 5G devices will be stuck with LTE. T-Mobile has indicated that it will start by allowing customers to voluntarily transfer to the T-Mobile network if they have a compatible device, but that hasn't started yet. While the Sprint network is still active for Sprint customers, the Sprint brand is no more and even Sprint's website redirects to T-Mobile.
Is T-Mobile 5G worth it?
On T-Mobile, it comes down to if you want the phone because there is no current separation of plans. The Samsung Galaxy S20 5G is quite a good phone with everything you would expect from a modern flagship device. If you just want the advanced speed and improved connection consistency of 5G, the Galaxy S20 5G is a strong phone, and T-Mobile has even demonstrated speeds over 1Gbps on its predecessor.
While 4G LTE will continue to be fast enough for most people for a few years into the future, eventually everyone will transition to 5G. With the high speeds we're currently seeing on T-Mobile's low-band 5G and no solid date for how long it will take to fully integrate the Sprint network, there's no rush to jump into 5G. That being said, with the newest 5G phones on T-Mobile set to work with both networks when the time comes, if you're ready for a new phone, 5G is the way to go.
What is 5G for Good?
5G for Good is an initiative to use the power of 5G to help the community. While some people have accused T-Mobile of putting on a show to grease the government's wheels in approving its merger with Sprint, it's nice to see technology making a positive impact on the world.
It's worth noting that all of the projections here depend on the merger going through and T-Mobile likely won't be able to get it done without the extra spectrum from Sprint.
Connecting Heros Initiative
The Connecting Heroes Initiative is a program that intends to bring free 5G access to first responders in America. This includes both public and non-profit law enforcement, fire, and EMS agencies. It's first-come, first-serve for those that sign up so if you want your agency to get connected on 5G, get registered as soon as possible.
Project 10Million
It's been shown that children without access to the internet likely won't receive as good an education as those that do. Of course, this is also linked to income inequality.
Project 10Millions aims to get rid of the homework gap that is caused by millions of children not having access to the internet for school work. The project intends to offer free service, hotspots, and reduced-cost devices to 10 million households over the next five years.
T-Mobile Connect
T-Mobile connect is simply a low-priced phone plan with access to the 5G network. Plans are offered at $15 per month for unlimited talk and text with 2GB of high-speed data. There is also a $25 per month plan with 5GB of data. Interestingly, the plan is set to grow as usage does by increasing the data allowance by 500MB a year for five years. This is by no means a huge amount, but for a low-income family, this can be a lifesaver.
These plans have already been released on T-Mobile prepaid.

Neato is introducing three brand new robot vacuum models this year, all three of which are designed to offer deep cleaning of your home without the hassle or that some other robot vacuums require. This announcement comes in lieu of the show floor announcements Neato has traditionally done at IFA, since IFA 2020 is a digital-only tradeshow this year. Keeping in line with Neato's existing product lines, the new D8, D9, and D10 robot vacuums cover a wide range of cleaning abilities and will be available starting this Fall. All three robots feature Neato's signature D-shape design, wide roller bushes underneath, large dustbins, and LaserSmart navigation.
Starting at the bottom, the Neato D8 sports a runtime of 90 minutes on a single charge with the ability to top-up the battery once it learns your floorplan. That cuts down on cleaning time since it won't need to fully charge before finishing cleaning your home. The Neato D8 supports both Cleaning Zones and No-Go Zones and will feature an "entry-level price" for this new premium line of robot vacuums. It's got a brushed finish in an indigo blue color and supports Neato's latest app and simplified setup experience.

The next step up is, of course, the Neato D9, which comes in a black brushed finish. An upgraded HEPA filter captures up to 99.7% of allergens like pet dander and dust, as small as 0.3 microns in size. It's got all the same features from the D8 but with an improved 120-minute runtime, thanks to a larger battery.
The cream of the crop is the Neato D10, which is Neato's new flagship robot vacuum. Neato is pitching this one as the "ultimate cleaning machine for house-proud techies, health-conscious individuals, and pet owners", partly because of the 150-minute battery life and partly because of the new pet mode. This pet mode alters the vacuum's suction and behavior to more effectively pick up pet hair, and the HEPA filter will make sure none of the dust or dander makes its way back into the air. It's got a sleek silver high-gloss brushed finish and, of course, has all the features of the D8 and D9. Expect specific price announcements as Neato gets closer to release this Fall.
A great robot vacuum for less

It can track the room you're in and your movement in six directions, which opens the world up when it comes to gaming. The Oculus Quest has an impressive library of launch titles, but these are the first five that you absolutely need to try.
- ★ Featured favorite: Beat Saber
- Use the force: Vader Immortal: Episode I
- Lone shooter: SUPERHOT VR
- Robo violence: Robo Recall: Unplugged
- Shooting zombies: Dead and Buried II
★ Featured favorite: Beat Saber
Beat Saber is an incredibly popular and addictive game in VR. You swing two lightsabers to slash through floating blocks to the rhythm of songs with bumping beats. Thanks to the Oculus Quest's support for two touch controllers and six degrees of freedom, you can lean, duck, and swing away at blocks to try to beat your high score.
Use the force: Vader Immortal: Episode I
Technically, this is a VR story more than a game, but in it, you get to see Darth Vader in VR and swing a lightsaber. In the story, you're a smuggler who winds up on Darth Vader's home planet. You hone your lightsaber skills and discover secrets about Vader along the way.
Lone shooter: SUPERHOT VR
In SUPERHOT VR enemies come at you from every direction. It features a unique slow-motion combat system in which you use a variety of weapons to slash and shoot enemies. The game takes advantage of the Quest's features by utilizing 360 degree tracking to surround you with enemies and letting you dual wield weapons.
Robo violence: Robo Recall: Unplugged
Homicidal robots are on the loose and Robo Recall: Unplugged lets you shoot them with a variety of weapons. It's a bullet storm game that's significantly boosted by the Oculus Quest's ability to track movements in 360 degrees.
Shooting zombies: Dead and Buried II
This multiplayer shooter sets you up against other players online or AI as you use six shooters to defeat your enemies. It's set in a western world and is a sequel to the popular Dead and Buried that launched on the Oculus Rift and Oculus Go.
The essentials
The Oculus Quest provides a unique opportunity to use popular VR titles without being tethered to a PC. Games that require movement, both around the room and with your hands, feel liberated by the Oculus Quest's lack of wires.
There's a wide range of games and apps available on the Oculus Quest, and that list is set to grow quickly as developers jump on board. The games on this list stand out for their ability to take advantage of the Oculus Quest's tracking features and support for two controllers.
Beat Saber is a top-rated game that is a hit at parties. It has various skill levels, so it's an excellent game for beginners and experts. The Oculus Quest's built-in speakers fire music directly at your ears and the tracking system means that you can swing away at blocks without any risk of snagging a wire.
SUPERHOT VR's slow-motion gameplay and unique look and feel creates a combat experience you won't get in any other game. It's also an excellent game to test out the Oculus Quest's features and to take advantage of the fact that you don't have to wear any wires. SUPERHOT VR requires you to make complicated sequences of movements, and the Oculus Quest feels like it was built for titles like this.

Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!Beat Saber is one of the best games on the Oculus Quest 2 and the Oculus Quest. It has you slash blocks and dodge bombs to the rhythm of pop, drum, bass, and more. While Beat Saber has a nice selection of songs built-in and has more songs through DLC, it falls short when it comes to most contemporary music. Thankfully, users have created custom song levels for Beat Saber.
It's worth noting that some updates to Beat Saber stop some methods for sideloading songs from working. This guide includes the latest method that's been confirmed to work, but might not work with all versions of Beat Saber. For example, the multiplayer update does not currently allow sideloading songs.

How to unlock developer mode
The first thing you need to do to install custom songs onto Beat Saber is download SideQuest. SideQuest is a free tool that makes it simple to sideload content, including apps and games, onto your Oculus Quest 2 or Oculus Quest.
To instal SideQuest onto your Oculus Quest 2 or Oculus Quest, you need to enable developer phone, which can be done through the Oculus app on your phone.

Select your Oculus Quest headset.
- Tap the arrow to the right of your device name to drop down more options if they don't show up immediately after selecting your device.
- Select more settings.
- Select developer mode.
Toggle the developer mode setting to on.
- This opens a website (unless you've unlocked developer options on an Oculus device before).
- Scroll down and select the link below create an organization.
- Log in to your Oculus account

- Toggle the developer mode setting to on if it isn't already switched on.
How to set up SideQuest on your PC
Now, you need to get SideQuest setup on your computer. You can grab SideQuest through GitHub, which is easily accessed through SideQuest's website. The links on SideQuest's website download an executable file for SideQuest. Here's a quick breakdown of those steps.
- Go to SideQuestVR.com.
- Click on the GET SIDEQUEST button at the top of the page.
- Select the version for your computer's operating system, either Windows, Mac, or Linux.
- Open the downloaded installer file.
Accept any security dialogs that appear and run through the installation process.
Once the installer has completed, launch SideQuest from your Start Menu, applications menu, or quick launch bar.
How to connect your Oculus Quest and SideQuest
Once SideQuest is ready, you can connect your Oculus Quest 2 or Oculus Quest to it on your computer.
- Connect your Oculus Quest or Quest 2 to your PC using a USB cable.
SideQuest should recognize the headset and show a green circle with the name of your headset on the top bar.
- Put on your headset, and select Allow USB debugging.
- Make sure to check Always allow from this computer.
How to create a backup of Beat Saber
While we haven't run into any issues sideloading custom songs onto the Oculus Quest, it's always a safe practice to create a backup. That way, you can restore previous versions if anything goes wrong. SideQuest has a tool built-in to create and manage backups.
- Select browser.
- Select my downloads.
- Select backups.
- Scroll down to Beat Saber and select the settings icon
- Select backup APK file.
You now have a backup of your Beat Saber APK in case anything goes wrong. You can also use this same section of SideQuest to backup and manage backups of apps you have on your Oculus Quest.
How to install BMBF and prepare to sideload songs
BMBF is a relatively new way to sideload songs onto Beat Saber. BeatOn and other methods of sideloading songs stopped working after Beat Saber updated to version 1.6. If you have a newer version of Beat Saber, you'll need to use BMBF to sideload songs.
The first thing you need to do is download BMBF from GitHub and install it onto your Quest.
Note: The most recent time we performed these steps loading Beat Saber took a significant amount of time waiting on a black screen. It did, however, load eventually.
- Go to the BMBF GitHub page.
- Download the latest BMBF apk.
- Install BMBF onto your Oculus Quest by dragging the APK files onto the SideQuest logo of SideQuest.
- Put on your Oculus Quest.
- Open the Oculus Menu and select Library.
- Select Unknown sources
- Select BMBF
- Scroll down and press Continue.
- Select Uninstall Beat Saber.
- Select OK.
- Select Patch Beat Saber (this step will take a while).
- Select Install modded Beat Saber.
- You might receive a prompt regarding unknown sources. If not, skip to step 15.
- Select Settings
- Toggle on Unknown Sources.
- Press B to go back.
- Select Install patched Beat Saber.
- Select Install.
You're now ready to sideload songs!
How to sideload songs
The easiest way to sync songs to your Oculus Quest is to use SyncSaber. This is built right into BMBF, so you don't need to install more software. You do, however, need an account that works with SyncSaber.
The first few steps are easiest to do on a computer.
- Go to the bsaber.com.
- Select Log in.
- Enter your desired username and a valid e-mail address.
- Go to your e-mail and follow the link to create a password.
Now, put on your Oculus Quest for the next steps.
You can now actually sideload songs! To sideload a song just follow these steps:
- Browse the BMBF website, which you get to by opening BMBF and the Oculus Quest.
For any song that you'd like, just select the Arrow icon for "Download a zip file from Beat Saver."
- When you've selected all your songs, select Sync to Beat Saber in the upper right-hand corner.
- Select Start Beat Saber in the upper right-hand corner.
- The first time you do this, it will prompt you to allow storage permission for Beat Saber, select Allow.
You can now install and play custom songs on Beat Saber!
How to install custom songs onto Beat Saber
Following an update of Beat Saber to version 1.6, some older methods of sideloading songs no longer work. We've left this here in case you've elected to keep an older version of Beat Saber.
- Click on browser on the left panel of SideQuest.
- Navigate to https://bsaber.com (the browser opens on this page by default).
Click on the songs dropdown menu and go to the category you'd like to select music from, such as "most liked this week."
- Tap on the down arrow icon to download any song that you'd like.
- Click on My Downloads in the upper right-hand corner of SideQuest.
- Drag and drop songs into My Song Packs.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!One of the most iconic elements of the Final Fantasy series has to be the summons, and Final Fantasy 7 Remake is no exception. While many were concerned, based on the original game and the way Remake is being split up, that there wouldn't be much summoning to be done, worry not! There are several Summons you can obtain in this game, and I've got all the details on where to get them and what special abilities they bring into battle!
What are Summons anyway?
Summoning is a core mechanic to any Final Fantasy game. In Final Fantasy 7 Remake, your Summons are tied to Red Summon Materia. These Materia give you the ability to bring a powerful spirit to fight alongside you. These spirits are so powerful that some can only be brought into the most challenging of boss battles, but once summoned, they can turn the tide in your favor. There are nine Summons in total, but not all of them are available to every player.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
How do I use Summon Materia?
Once you've obtained a Summon Materia, it works similar to any other Materia. You equip it to the character of your choice and it will be available in battle... almost. The caveat is that the larger Summons can only be used in boss battles and each character can only be equipped with one Summon Materia. To equip your Summon Materia:
- Press the options button to open your Main Menu.
- Press X to select Materia & Equipment.
Select the character you wish to equip.
- Press △ to set Materia.
Select the Materia specific slot to the far right.
Select the Materia you wish to equip.
- Press X to equip Materia.
Be sure to check out our Materia Guide for more on equipping Materia and where to find all the other Materia in Final Fantasy 7 Remake!
How do Summons work in battle?
Once you have your Summon Materia of choice equipped, you head into battle. If the battle is big enough for that particular Summon, you will get a purple Summon bar on the right side of the screen. I found this part of the game took a little trial and error. Even with a smaller Summon, like Chocobo Chick, there didn't seem to be a whole lot of consistency in when the bar would show up. If that purple bar shows up, you will be able to summon by following these steps:
- First, you need to fill the Summon bar. It fills up more the more damage you take and the longer the battle takes.
Once the bar is full, press X to open the Commands Menu.
Move down to Summon.
- Press X to open the Summon Menu.
Press X to summon or scroll over to another party member if you want to use another member's Summon.
For a limited time, your Summon will fight alongside you.
- If you want to give the Summon specific commands, press X to open the Commands Menu again.
- Select Summon.
Press X to use a Summon ability.
When your Summon's bar is depleted, it will use its Ultimate Ability and vanish.
Keep in mind that while each of your party members can be equipped with one Summon Materia, you can only summon once per battle. So choose wisely!
What are all the Summons I can get?
While you will get your first Summon Materia as part of the story, the rest will need to be earned, and a few can only be gained through DLC. Most of your Summons are earned through Chadley's Battle Intel Reports. Here's all the Summon Materia and where to find them:
|Summon||Ultimate Ability||Obtained|
|Ifrit||Hellfire||Jessie, Ch. 3, conclusion|
|Chocobo & Moogle||Stampede||Ch. 6, hidden behind fans|
|Shiva||Diamond Dust||Battle Intel Report 5|
|Fat Chocobo||Kerplunk||Battle Intel Report 10|
|Leviathan||Tidal Wave||Battle Intel Report 15|
|Bahamut||Megaflare||Battle Intel Report 20|
|Chocobo Chick||Chocoflare||Preorder|
|Carbunkle||Diamond Dazzle||Deluxe or Collectors Edition|
|Cactaur||10,000 Needles?||Deluxe or Collectors Edition|

Get spooked with these great horror games for the PS4
Enjoy getting the pants scared clean off you? You might want to check out these horror games.The OnePlus 8 is a fantastic phone with great hardware and the company's beloved OxygenOS software atop Android 10. Like many other high-end phones released this year, it features support for the budding 5G network, which sounds great at first glance — but most markets still don't have a 5G network to connect to. In the meantime your OnePlus 8 will be draining its battery searching for a network that isn't there. Luckily, you can tell it to stop looking.
Products used in this guide
- 5G powerhouse: OnePlus 8 ($700 at Amazon)
- LTE only: OnePlus 7T ($525 at Amazon)
How to disable 5G
While 5G theoretically allows you to hit incredible gigabit speeds and download huge movies and games in a matter of seconds (in ideal situations), it takes a considerable toll on your phone's battery life. That may well be worth it in exchange for those speeds, but if your area doesn't have 5G, you're draining power without gaining any benefits. Disabling 5G connectivity only takes a few steps in the system settings.
- Open the Settings app.
- Tap Wi-Fi & network.
- Under Cellullar Data, tap Preferred network type.
In the pop-up window, tap 2G/3G/4G (Automatic).
That's it! Just like that, your phone will stop looking for 5G networks and revert back to LTE.
Even if your area has 5G availability, there are still reasons to disable the network. In my particular case, T-Mobile's 5G network reaches my house in central Indianapolis just enough for the OnePlus 8 to show 5G in the status bar, but the signal is so poor that my speeds are worse than when used over LTE. This problem will likely be resolved as 5G networks expand over time, but for now, I'm sticking with LTE and Wi-Fi until 5G is more reliable in my area.
Our top equipment picks
5G powerhouse
OnePlus 8
One of the most affordable 5G phones
The OnePlus 8 is available in two stunning finishes and features a bright 90Hz display, three cameras, ultra-clean software, and 5G support. With the latest Snapdragon 865 processor, it's able to handle any task you throw at it with ease, and the power efficiency means you won't need to charge it often.
Still excellent
OnePlus 7T
Still a great option in 2020
The OnePlus 7T may be last year's news, but it shares most of the same DNA as the OnePlus 8, with the same huge 90Hz display and excellent hardware design. If you don't plan on using 5G in the next few years, this is still an excellent device to grab.

Bonus savings
NordVPN
VPNs are super popular right now and NordVPN is one of the best services out there. This plan saves you $305 and you'll get an extra month or a whole extra year on top of the 3-year plan you've bought at no extra cost.
$125.64
$430.20 $305 off
Billed upfront at $126, you're saving $305 on the 3-year plan versus the regular month-to-month cost for that period of time. That drops the equivalent monthly cost down to just $3.49 making this one of the best VPN deals out there. If you get the free year on top, that monthly price is even less. Even if you get a free month it's better than nothing.
You've probably heard a lot about VPNs of late, and for good reason. They enable you to keep your private information private, feel safe in the knowledge that your device's security is intact, and get around geographical barriers that otherwise restrict online content.
NordVPN offers a secure, fast and anonymous browsing experience. It uses military-grade 256-bit AES encryption, DNS Leak Protection, and keeps no logs about user activity so you surf anonymously. NordVPN is also speedy and has an unlimited bandwidth so there's no data cap to worry about.

There are 5,000+ servers in NordVPN's network spread across 58 countries.

It works on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows, so you can protect whatever devices you use most. There's also support for Linux and Android TV, as well as browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. Your subscription allows you to have 6 devices protected simultaneously and you can even use NordVPN with your router to protect all of the devices in your home while using up only one of those slots. Check out our NordVPN review for a more in-depth look at its pros and cons. We also named it on our list of the best VPNs of 2020.
NordVPN has a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can try it out risk-free. If you don't want to commit to the 3-year plan, there are some solid savings on the 1-year and 2-year plans, though you'll miss out on the additional free month or year promotion.

1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).

What are AP and how do I use them?
The more you use a particular Materia, the more AP or Ability Points your Materia will earn. Unlike SP which you spend to enhance your characters' stats, AP are applied automatically. So, use those Materia a lot and you'll find they level up, granting you access to even more magic.

Get spooked with these great horror games for the PS4
Enjoy getting the pants scared clean off you? You might want to check out these horror games.Water, Earth, Fire, Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony...oh wait. Wrong fandom. Ahem. Genshin Impact is a magical game where every playable character is the master of an Element. The way that these Elements interact with each other sometimes results in added effects or damages to your opponents. So, you'll definitely want to take advantage of certain Elemental combinations in order to defeat enemies more efficiently.
Depending on what Elements the characters in your party have can also result in party bonuses. Here's everything you need to know about Genshin Impact Elements, Status Effects, Elemental Reactions, and Elemental Resonance.
Looking to find even more fun on your phone? Check out the best Android games.
Genshin Impact Elements
There are currently seven different Elements in Genshin Impact, though it's possible that more will be added into the game as time goes on. Different nations across Teyvat worship different members of The Seven Archons. These are godly individuals who bestow their elemental powers on their followers.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
|Element||Nation||Archon|
|Anemo (Wind)||Mondstadt||Barbados (Venti)|
|Cryo (Ice)||Snezhnaya||The Tsaritsa|
|Dendro (Nature)||Sumeru||God of Wisdom|
|Electro (Lightning)||Inazuma||The Immortal Shogun|
|Geo (Earth)||Liyue||Rex Lapis|
|Hydro (Water)||Fontaine||God of Justice|
|Pyro (Fire)||Natlan||Murata|
Status Effects
When cast on enemies, certain elements can cause status effects:
|Element||Status Effect|
|Cryo||The opponents Movement Speed gets reduced.|
|Electro||Electro spreads in water and affects any enemies who are Wet.|
|Hydro||When a character or enemy touches water they become Wet, which opens up the possibility for an Elemental Reaction.|
|Pyro||Burns the affected individuals and causes damage for a certain length of time.|
Ley Line Disorders
There are some enemies and challenges that emit elemental auras. If players get too close to these enemies or enter these challenges, characters on the field can be affected with the following Disorders.
|Disorder||Element||Status Effect|
|Condensed Ice||Cryo||Makes it so you consume more Stamina.|
|Engulfing Storm||Electro||Makes it so your Energy Recharge constantly drains.|
|Slowing Water||Hydro||Makes CD take much longer by -80%, so you have to wait an extended period for a move to be usable again.|
|Smoldering Flames||Pyro||Makes it so you get damaged by burns repeatedly over a certain amount of time.|
Elemental Reactions
When some Elements collide with other Elements it can result in an Elemental Reaction that can cause added damage or other effects to those nearby.
|Reaction||Elemental Combinations||Effect|
|Burning||Dendro + Pyro||Inflicts Pyro DMG to the affected individual over time.|
|Crystalize||Geo + Cryo, Electro, Hydro, or Pyro||Creates floating crystals on the battlefield. When picked up, these create an Element shield around the player.|
|Electro-Charged||Electro + Hydro||Continuously inflicts Electro DMG to the affected individual over time.|
|Frozen||Cryo + Hydro||Temporarily freezes the target in place.|
|Melt||Cryo + Pyro||Deals extra DMG to those affected.|
|Overloaded||Electro + Pyro||Inflicts those within its influence with AoE Pyro DMG.|
|Superconduct||Cryo + Electro||Reduce the target's Physical RES by 50% while dealing AoE Cryo DMG.|
|Swirl||Anemo + Cryo, Electro, Hydro, or Pyro||Spreads any Elements that the wind comes in contact with and deals extra Elemental DMG.|
|Vaporize||Hydro + Pyro||Does more DMG than usual.|
Elemental Resonance
Elemental Resonance are passive effects that happen when certain combinations of elemental characters fill your party. These effects also stack. For example, if your party is made up of two Geo characters and two Pyro characters, everyone in your party will benefit from the effects of Enduring Rock and Fervent Flames.
|Reaction||Elements||Effect|
|Enduring Rock||2 x Geo||Your interruption resistance goes up and if your characters are protect by a shield, their Attack DMG increases by 15%.|
|Fervent Flames||2 x Pyro||Increases your ATK by 25% while making it so Cryo effects last 40% less of their usual time.|
|High Voltage||2 x Electro||Superconduct, Overloaded, and Electro-Charged Reactions will always generate an Electro Elemental Particle with a CD of 5s. Additionally, any Hyrdro effects will last 40% less of their usual time.|
|Impetuous Winds||2 x Anemo||Decreases Stamina Consumption by 15%, reduces Skill CD by 5%, and increases Movement SPD by 10%.|
|Protective Canopy||Four unique Elements||All Elemental RES increases by 15%.|
|Shattering Ice||2 x Cryo||Increases your Party's CRIT Rate against Cyro Frozen enemies by 15%. Also, reduces the effect time of Electro by 40%.|
|Soothing Waters||2 x Hydro||You party's incoming healing increases by 30% while any Pyro effects last 40% less of their usual time.|

There's a lot to discover while exploring Genshin Impact's massive open world. Hopefully knowing more about each type of Element and how it reacts to others will help you along your journey.

Washington has the ability to go from fourth to tied for first in the NFC East division with a win over the Cowboys. You can bet the team will be playing tough to swing their season in the right direction with one huge win. Luckily for them the Cowboys are hurting on every front and might not be able to stop them from advancing.
Speaking of hurting, Prescott, Smith, and Collins are all out of the rest of the year which was clearly an unseen hurdle. While the Cowboys were on fire offensively with Prescott at the helm, their defense has never really been adequate. Washington will be looking to take advantage of that as well as press the offensive which doesn't look so hot anymore either. Kyle Allen hasn't been great at getting Washington's offense going, but he'll need to pick it up if there's any hope of turning things around.
Again, this game will probably be pretty sloppy and a mess, but if Washington can eek out a win here, it will immediately make the worst division at least a little more interesting in future weeks.

Disney+
More than just streaming
Amazon Prime
With so many video streaming services to choose from and more joining the market each year, subscribing to all of them is no longer an option for the average consumer. Backed by one of the biggest entertainment companies on the planet, Disney+ will be available beginning Nov. 12 and already poses a threat to other streaming services like Amazon Prime. With most of the biggest box office hits in its library, Disney+ is not held back by it's significantly smaller collection of movies and shows.
Why pick one streaming service over another?
While a cable or satellite package is still the primary way most people watch TV and movies, streaming is steadily taking up more and more of that market. You can watch any available content any time of day or night, pause and pick back up hours or even days later, and often have access to entire seasons of content instead of one episode a week — it's easy to see why more people are opting to subscribe to streaming services.
There are certainly plenty to choose from, but how do you choose, especially when you're on a budget? Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ are both relatively inexpensive for the year, but for many, it might not be worth getting both.
|Disney+||Amazon Prime Video|
|Price||$70/year||$99/year|
|Quantity||7,500+ episodes, 500+ movies||~2,000 shows, 18,000+ movies|
|Simultaneous Streams||Up to four devices at once||Up to three devices at once|
|Quality||more popular movies and shows||fewer box office hits|
|Variety||more family focused||both adult and family focused|
Two devices with the same show or movie
At first glance, Disney+ beats out Amazon Prime Video in price, number of simultaneous streams, and quality. Amazon Prime Video beats Disney+ in quantity, variety, and supported devices but do either make up for the price difference alone?
Price
Disney+ is cheaper than Amazon Prime Video and allows more simultaneous streams for that price. However, Amazon Prime Video is part of an Amazon Prime membership, which includes far more than just its video streaming service. For customers who shop on Amazon often, the free two-day shipping alone could cover the cost of the annual membership. Prime memberships also include a music streaming service, an e-book service, access to a number of specialized shopping experiences and more.
While Disney+ is cheaper, it is unlikely that customers who use all the other features of a Prime membership will see the $15-29 in annual savings as enough reason to switch.
Ways to watch
|Platform||Disney+||Amazon Prime Video|
|Android TV||✔️||Only on Shield TV|
|Fire TV||✔️||✔️|
|Xbox One||✔️||✔️|
|PS4||✔️||✔️|
|Apple Devices||✔️||✔️|
|Roku||✔️||✔️|
|Nintendo Switch||❌||✔️|
Disney+ is at a disadvantage in this category if only because it is new. Amazon has had more time to develop apps for various streaming devices, smart TVs, and gaming consoles. As a result, you can watch Amazon Prime Video in more places than you will be able to watch Disney+ at launch.
Both services work on desktops, and both Android and Apple phones but Disney+ won't stream to Roku devices or the Nintendo Switch at launch. Likewise, many smart TVs and cable boxes won't have support for Disney+ just yet.
Content
When it comes to content, both Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video have some incredible options.
|Platform||Disney+||Amazon Prime Video|
|Films available||500+||18,000+|
|TV series available||7,500+ episodes||2,000+ shows|
|Notable Original Series||The Mandalorian||The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel|
|Notable Films||Captain Marvel||The Big Sick|
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier
Fleabag
Good Omens
The Man in the High Castle
Star Wars Episode I-VIII

I Am Not Your Negro
At launch, Disney+ will have about 7,500 episodes of television shows and about 500 movies, a small fraction of what is available on Amazon Prime Video. If having the most choices is your priority, Disney+ just can't compete. That having been said, no one person, not even a large family, could possibly watch even a fraction of that. Which brings us to the next and, in my opinion, the most important category: variety.
Disney+ is going to have access to its decades-old library of family-friendly movies and TV, along with the catalogs form Lucasfilm, Marvel, and now 20th Century Fox. While not every option from those backlogs will be available, there will be a lot of recognizable, big-budget content.
Amazon Prime, on the other hand, is more scattered. It offers movies and shows rated higher than PG-13 and allows members to add on additional channels in much the same way a customer adds HBO or a sports package to their cable. While most of these additional channels cost between $6 and $15 a month, that can add up fast. If you're completely cord cutting, you may already be picking up some of these channels but for someone who is still subscribing to cable, it is likely cheaper to go through your cable provider than to add on the channels to your Prime membership.
Quality
As both Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ have more shows and movies than anyone could ever watch, it's more important to assess the quality of the shows and movies. Unless you were living under a rock last April, you probably heard about the box office hit Avengers: Endgame. When Endgame hit theaters, one of the biggest questions being asked (besides which Avengers survived to the end) was if Endgame would beat out the number one grossing movie of all time: Avatar. It did unseat the former champion but the real irony there is that both movies are owned by Disney. In fact, if you look back at the highest grossing films of all time, only three of the top ten are owned by a company other than Disney.
Still, Disney+ may have most of the top grossing films in the world but Amazon Prime has invested more into developing its original content and the world is certainly taking notice. Nearly 100 Amazon Prime Original series have been nominated for or won awards.
So, Disney+ or Amazon Prime Video?
Both of these streaming services will provide countless hours of entertainment and both will offer programming the other cannot. As a result, many will choose to pay for both. If I were only comparing the movie streaming services, Disney+ would win out hands down but because Amazon Prime Video is part of a Prime membership, although people might not cancel that just to get Disney+.
Ways to save on both
Fortunately, there are ways you can get Disney+ included with another service, so you may not have to choose at all. If Verizon is your current cable, internet, or wireless provider, you can get Disney+ for free. For current subscribers of Hulu and ESPN+, Disney offers a bundle of the three services for $13 a month. And if you're already ordering frequently on Amazon, the savings you get with free shipping can easily pay for your Prime Membership.
Even if you don't get Disney+ free or discounted and you don't use enough of the other Amazon Prime membership benefits to justify the cost, both together are still cheaper than most cable packages. For some, a choice will have to be made between Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video but for many, the real choice will be which show or movie out of the tens of thousands they offer will you be watching tonight.

The Pixel 4 introduced new ideas like a telephoto camera, face unlock system, and unique gestures, but it did so at the expense of battery life. This time around, Google's trying something a bit different.
Rather than be concerned about having the highest-end processor or five cameras, Google designed the Pixel 5 to be a meat and potatoes Android phone that does everything you need it to do, has all of the core features you could ask for, and comes in at a much lower price than the latest flagships from Samsung and Apple.
Whether you want to learn more about its price, release date, specs, or anything else, here's everything you need to know about the Google Pixel 5!
Buy the Pixel 5
Google Pixel 5
The newest Pixel has arrived
Google packed a lot into the Pixel 5, including a 90Hz OLED display, dual cameras, wireless charging, you name it. It's also the cheapest flagship Pixel we've had in a long time, making it a great alternative to pricier options.
Google Pixel 5 Price
One of the most interesting things about the Pixel 5 is its price. In a world where top-of-the-line phones from most other companies cost upwards of $1,000, the Pixel 5 is refreshingly affordable at just $699. It's worth noting that there's just one storage configuration being offered, with the Pixel 5 coming with 128GB of space for your apps, games, and movies.
When you compare this side-by-side with 2019's Pixel 4 series, it's pretty impressive how much more affordable the Pixel 5 actually is. The 128GB Pixel 4 retailed for $899, with the 128GB Pixel 4 XL costing $999.
There are some spec changes/cuts that allowed Google to hit that lower price tag, but especially in the economic climate we live in today, we're more than happy to see Google focusing on affordability for its top offering.
Google Pixel 5 Availability
After being unveiled on September 30, 2020, Google officially launched the Pixel 5 a month later on October 29. It's available in Just Black and Subtle Sage colors, with Google choosing to not offer a white model at all this year.
Google Pixel 5 Review
Yes, we've reviewed the Pixel 5. And to be blunt, it's really darn good. This isn't the absolute best Android phone you can buy in 2020, but as noted in our written review, it is the best Pixel ever.
Unlike the Pixel 4 series from last year, the Pixel 5 nails all of the fundamentals. It's fast and responsive, has excellent cameras, battery life is top-notch, and it's sold for a very reasonable price. Extra features like Motion Sense and face unlock are gone, but the core aspects remain strong.
Google's decision to bow out of the flagship spec race is an interesting one, and for the most part, it paid off.
Google Pixel 5 Specs
Here are the Google Pixel 5 specs:
|Category||Google Pixel 5|
|Display||6-inch|
|Operating System||Android 11|
|Processor||Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G|
|Rear Camera 1||12.2MP primary camera|
|Rear Camera 2||16MP ultra-wide camera|
|Memory||8GB of RAM|
|Storage||128GB|
|Battery||4,080 mAh|
|Charging||18W wired charging|
|Security||Fingerprint sensor|
|Colors||Sorta Sage, Just Black|

90Hz refresh rate

f/2.2 aperture
15W wireless charging
5W reverse wireless charging
The Pixel 5 has an amazing price. But how in the world did Google pull it off? A quick look at the spec sheet makes it clear why the Pixel 5 is able to cost as little as it does.
The main takeaway here is that Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor. All previous Pixels (not counting Pixel a devices) have shipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800-series chip — the highest-end option offered by Qualcomm. Other flagships like the Galaxy S20 and OnePlus 8 Pro utilize the Snapdragon 865, but that's not the case for the Pixel 5.
The Snapdragon 765 chipset inside the Pixel 5 is more than powerful enough for any app or game you throw at it, and with this decision, you get to benefit from high-end performance without having to pay out the nose for it.
Looking at some of the other specs, it's great to see that Google once again offers a 90Hz refresh rate for the Pixel 5's display, along with an OLED panel for great colors and deep blacks. The 4,080 mAh battery is also substantially larger than the 2,800 mAh unit the Pixel 4 shipped with, which should allow for a night and day difference when it comes to battery life. All of the makings are here for the Pixel 5 to be one of the new best Android phones, and when you factor in that low price tag, it becomes that much more impressive.
Google Pixel 5 Compared to other Pixels
The Pixel 5 isn't the only phone Google's releasing this year. Earlier this summer, Google released the Pixel 4a, which is a budget-friendly device aimed at the mainstream. It's small and doesn't have many of the premium features we take for granted in many premium devices, including waterproofing or wireless charging. It's also running a slower Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 chip, has a modest 3,080mAh battery, a 5.8-inch display, and only a single rear camera.
Later this year, the Pixel 4a 5G will be available. It packs a more powerful Snapdragon 765 platform, along with the same dual-camera setup as the larger Pixel 5. Its 6.2-inch screen is the largest of all the Pixels this year, but it doesn't get as bright as the Pixel 5's, nor does it share the same 90Hz panel. Its 3,885mAh battery is also slightly smaller than the Pixel 5's, and the bezels around the display are ever-so-slightly thicker. Of course, as suggested by the name, it also has 5G, like the Pixel 5.
Above, you'll see a comparison chart from Google showing off the main differences between the three phones.
Google Pixel 5 Competition
Moving beyond the Pixel family, there are plenty of non-Google phones that are going toe-to-toe with the Pixel 5. In the Android space, one of its top competitors is the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE. The FE touts the same $700 retail price of the Pixel, yet manages to offer a more powrful Snapdragon 865 chipset, 120Hz display, a larger battery, and three cameras instead of two.
The Pixel 5 still has the advantage when it comes to camera quality, and if you prefer smaller phones, its compact design is more fitting. That said, the Galaxy S20 FE drives a hard bargain for anyone looking to get the absolute most bang-for-their-buck.
Another Android handset that's gunning for the Pixel 5 is the OnePlus 8T. This is another phone with a few technical advantages over the Pixel — namely its 120Hz screen, 65W wired charging, and additional rear camera sensors. While all of that's great, the OnePlus 8T doesn't have wireless charging or an IP water resistance rating even with its higher $749 asking price.
And, of course, we have Apple's latest iPhones — the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini. Comparisons like this ultimately come down to the differences in software more than anything else, but if you need a new phone and have around $700 to spend, they're definitely worth considering.

Google doesn't offer a ton of color options for its smartphones, but with every release, there's usually one that stands out over the more generic black and white options. This year's colors are even more limited with just two to choose from, including Just Black and Sorta Sage.
Just Black is exactly what the name implies — a black paint job and nothing more. The matte aluminum finish is much preferred over the glossy glass we had for the Pixel 4 in Just Black, but outside of that, there's not much else to say.
On the other hand, we have Sorta Sage. It's not nearly as bright or punchy as the Pixel 4's Oh So Orange color, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It has a cool, earthy tone to it that looks really nice, and it's definitely the color we prefer this time around.
Google Pixel 5 Cameras
Camera quality is always the number one reason to buy a Pixel phone over anything else — that's why the Pixel 4 XL, despite its problems was one of the best Android phones you can buy — and for the Pixel 5, Google's trying something it's never done before.
The primary camera is the exact same 12.2MP sensor that we've had for years, but on the Pixel 5, it's joined by a 16MP ultra-wide camera. This is the first time any Pixel phone has shipped with an ultra-wide lens, and the telephoto one that was introduced on the Pixel 4 is nowhere to be seen.
Google made a big deal last year about how telephoto was more important than ultra-wide, so it's a bit funny to see the company correcting course one generation later. The telephoto camera on the Pixel 4 was very good, but the switch to ultra-wide is one we're excited to see.
Overall, photos taken with the Pixel 5 are excellent. There isn't a dramatic difference compared to the Pixel 4, but it solidly establishes itself as the best smartphone camera available in 2020. Images turn out great regardless if it's daytime or night, portrait mode continues to be a strong point. and the astrophotography mode continues still impresses.
Google's also doing some new stuff on the video front, such as new stabilization features and support for 4K60. Per Hayato Huseman in our Pixel 5 review:
I think my favorite new shooting mode is Cinematic Pan, which automatically shoots in 60fps, then slows down and stabilizes your footage to create an ultra-smooth 30fps clip. It's a trick I used to do all the time when I had a 4K60-capable camera, since it allows you to create longer, steadier footage in a short amount of time. The results look great — just remember that not everything needs to be slow-mo. Use this mode sparingly.
Ultimately, the Pixel 5 still isn't going to top phones like the Xperia 1 II, LG V60, and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra when it comes to video. Each of these phones have far more manual controls than Google offers, including the ability to shoot in various picture profiles and set manual focus. But considering how far behind previous Pixels have been, this is a huge step in giving the Pixel 5 a more well-rounded overall shooting experience, rather than just a great computational camera for photos.
You'll notice there are only two cameras present on the back of the Pixel 5. In a world where so many phones are shipping with four or five different rear cameras, Google's decision to only offer two does go against market trends. However, as we've seen time and time again, having one or two excellent cameras instead of a bunch of extra ones that aren't any good is usually preferable.
Google Pixel 5 Software
Whenever Google launches a new Pixel phone, it often uses it as a vehicle for introducing new Android features. This is no different with the Pixel 5, which comes with a few software goodies not previously seen anywhere else.
One of the biggest new additions is an Assistant feature called "Hold For Me." When you're placed on hold when on a phone call, you can now tap a button that has the Assistant hold your place in line while you go off and do anything else. When a customer service agent comes on the line, the Assistant lets you know so you can hop back on the phone and start talking.
Something else that should be quite promising is Extreme Battery Saver. If you find yourself running out of juice but need to keep your phone powered on a bit longer, you can enable this mode to extend your battery life by up to 48 hours. It's not something you'll want to have on all the time, but in certain instances, it could be a life-saver.
Google Pixel 5 XL model
Speaking of changes to the Pixel family, you might have noticed by now that we haven't said anything about the Pixel 5 XL. That's because there isn't one 😶. While we've typically gotten a Pixel 4 and 4 XL, Pixel 3 and 3 XL, and so on, the regular Pixel 5 is the only entry in the entire Pixel 5 family.
As Alex Dobie explained this past September, Google seems to have gone through a few different branding decisions while creating this year's Pixels. The phone that we have now as the Pixel 4a 5G is thought to have originally been the Pixel 5, with the Pixel 5 we're talking about today previously referred to as the Pixel 5s — a higher-end, more premium version of what would have been the Pixel 5 but is now the Pixel 4a 5G.
You could argue that the Pixel 4a 5G is a pseudo-Pixel 5 XL given its slightly larger 6.2-inch display, but that phone sacrifices things like the 90Hz refresh rate, wireless charging, and has slightly less RAM.
Google Pixel 5 Accessories
As we often say here on Android Central, no phone is complete without the right accessories. This is just as true for the Pixel 5, so make sure you grab a few things to round out your experience with the phone.
First and foremost, you should absolutely get a screen protector. The Pixel 5 is a great-looking phone, but a year or two down the road when the screen is littered with scratches, it's going to be a lot less appealing. A screen protector is a fast and easy way to prevent this from happening, no matter if you get a film or tempered glass one.
We also recommend picking up a case for the Pixel 5. While the aluminum design sure is something, all it takes is one drop to chip its paint and ruin the experience. There are already a ton of excellent cases to choose from, whether you want something ultra-rugged or prefer style over function.

iPhone & iPad

Best VPN for
Netflix, Hulu, and streaming

Security and privacy
Pros
- Super affordable
- Great connection speeds
- Netflix unblocking
- Superb security
Cons
- Too basic for some
A full featured and high-speed VPN doesn't have to be expensive. Surfshark proves that point perfectly by offering one of the best services out there for nearly half the price of the competition.
Surfshark VPN is a relatively new service compared to some other options out there, but what it lacks in age it makes up for in features. From tight security and privacy to feature-rich apps and the ability to unblock Netflix – this packs in everything most people look for in a VPN. It's one of the best Android VPNs available right now.
With over 1,040 servers spread across 160 locations worldwide this is a super capable VPN that's perfect for anyone travelling. But with AES-256 level encryption it's also just right for anyone looking for a VPN to keep themselves anonymous and secure at home – or anywhere else for that matter.
So is this the VPN for you? Read on to find out everything you need to know about Surfshark VPN.
Pricing and plans
Surfshark keeps it nice and simple when it comes to pricing options with three tiers to pick from. These are time based, with monthly, annual or two year plans which go down in price based on how long you commit for.
The monthly option is the most open, allowing you to pay month-to-month with no commitment. As such this is the most expensive, usually priced at around $12.95. Jump up to a six month plan, paid in one lump sum, and you get a big reduction that equates to $6.49 per month.
But the best plan, which gives you one of the most affordable VPN prices of any out there right now, is the two year plan. Pay this sum up front and it works out at just $2.49 per month. That's a saving of a massive 81% savings compared to the regular monthly cost.
Testing and performance
Despite being a budget VPN you can rely on Surfshark to offer some really great speeds, according to our testing. On a reliability level we found no connection failures and connection times that are faster than average plus all servers returned IP addresses for their advertised locations. So all ticks then.
When it came to performance speeds, we tested in the US using a 600Mbps connection. On the whole results were consistent denoting a reliable performance. Speeds averaged 150Mbps, which could have been our ISP affecting that to be fair. The lowest speed we got, across 40 test locations, was 119Mbps – still plenty fast then.
Over in the UK the line tested was 75Mbps and we got an impressive average of around 68Mbps meaning very little bandwidth was lost due to Surfshark.
Server locations affect speeds so if you're after pure performance, a bit of testing various servers could help you perfect your connection for the ultimate speed result.
Features
One of the big features for VPNs these days is Netflix unblocking and Surfshark specifically advertising this is something its service offers. In fact it even names 14 countries where it can do this, including the U.S., France, Japan, Australia, Italy and more.
Aside from Netflix you can enjoy geo restriction unblocking for the likes of YouTube, Amazon Prime Video and even the often challenging BBC iPlayer. The only one that presented issues here was Amazon Prime Video, which did work for going abroad and accessing home country content, but blocked accessing other countries' content when using your account setup at home.
Getting online in countries that otherwise block VPNs is an option here thanks to a service called NoBorders mode. This, presumably through obfuscating your traffic, gets you around any blocks to go online – ideal for China and Iran then.
A Whitelister panel is a nice touch that allows you to select applications, websites and IP addresses that can bypass the VPN. This is great if you want to access your banking app without setting off alarms about you being out of the country, for example.
The CleanWeb feature works well to block ads, any trackers and links that could be malicious to help keep your online experience as clear as possible.
The mobile apps allow you to select a "use small packets" option which is able to improve performance on some networks which could help speeds while also saving you money on data use.
Support is another great feature, with 24/7 live chat available wherever you are. This is a great way to get online if you're having issues, or find the right server to unblock something like a media player. While there are lots of details on the company's website that can help, it's nice to have a human waiting to help, should you get stuck.
Privacy and security
Surfshark uses the enterprise level AES-256 encryption meaning all your data is kept locked so even if it were compromised it would remain unintelligible. Not that it should be at risk thanks to a kill switch, keeping you safe if your connection drops, and a double hop VPN. That means your address is even more secure, should you activate this feature, making you highly anonymous and difficult to track.
There are some of the best modern security protocol options including OpenVPN UDP and TCP plus IKEv2. Plus the company is based in the British Virgin Islands meaning no logging is required. The fact that each server has its own private DNS is yet another layer of security to set your mind at ease.
A third party test of Surfshark by German security firm Cure53 led it to conclude that it was: "highly satisfied to see such a strong security posture on the Surfshark VPN extensions, especially given the common vulnerability of similar products to privacy issues."
Should you sign up?
If you want to save a packet on a really decent VPN that offers lots of features, then Surfshark could be for you. Presuming you're ok with paying that two year up front cost then you can get this cheaper than most other VPNs, without sacrificing quality, speed, security or reliability. In fact, this budget VPN is above average and beats a lot of the more expensive services with its offerings.
Features like unlimited device use make this a genuine option for use across all your gadgets. You could, conceivably, even split the cost with someone and share this impressive and comprehensive VPN service. Looking for other VPN deals? We have you covered there as well!
We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:
1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).
2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad.
We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services. Consuming pirated content that is paid-for is neither endorsed nor approved by Future Publishing.

There are some great mesh systems to choose from, but which is the right one for you?
Early Black Friday deals: Amazon's Echo, Fire TV Sticks & more on sale with prices starting at $10
Google has updated its original Google Wifi with a lower $99 price tag and a new power supply with USB-C.
Google Wifi and eero have a lot in common on the surface but the real differences come from their ecosystems and expansion options.
If your Wi-Fi at home is busted or you want to make a change, which should you buy? We break down the differences to help you make the best decision for your home.
If you've been trying to work at home with a shoddy internet connection, it's time to make a change. Lowe's is home to way more than tools; you can find plenty of home office essentials there too from routers and cable ties to desks and more.
The Google Home app's newest update means it can now control advanced settings for your Google Wifi system. Previously, a user would have needed to download the dedicated Google Wifi app.
Google Wifi is a great value for building a simple and functional mesh network but thanks to it's higher speeds and the inclusion of a smart speaker, the Nest Wifi system makes the most sense today.
If your phone is working fine, it may be time to give some thought to the position of your router, or even upgrade it. Here's what we recommend.
Having cables running all over the place can be frustrating to see, especially if you have a few Google Wifi routers around the home. So why not clean things up and mount your WiFi to clean things up a bit? These are the best Google Wifi wall mounts you can get.
Google Wifi was one of the first mesh systems around and it's still one of the most intuitive. For many people, it's still a great system with enough speed for most online activity.
The best part of a mesh network is that it can be expanded to fit your needs. Both the Eero Beacon and Google Wifi can work as an easy node but the Beacon can plug straight into the wall and making placement a breeze.
If you want to build a mesh network at home without Google, there is a ton of competition. Whether you want better speeds, prices, or a different experience, there are plenty of options to get connected.
It wasn't the first consumer mesh Wi-Fi router set, nor is it the best. But Google Wifi was cheap and accessible to everyone.
We've all put off gift shopping before. Luckily, there's still time to grab some new smart home tech for your friends and family.
Google’s second-generation wireless home router goes by a new name, Nest Wifi, and its range extender now features a built-in Google Assistant speaker. The single and two-pack options are now available, but which is best for you?
The Nest Wifi system is made up of two devices: a router that plugs into your modem or fiber optic cable, and a satellite with a built-in Google Assistant speaker that extends connectivity. Pre-orders go live later today, with a two-pack retailing for $269.
Google's annual fall hardware event is nearly upon us — it's all going down on October 15 in New York City.
The Google Store now has a new refurbished section where you can pick up a Pixelbook or Google Wifi 3-Pack at a discount.

Thrill ride: Epic Roller Coasters
This game lets you race friends or ride alone on roller coasters. It also has a shooting mode, so you aren't just riding around. As a warning, this game causes motion sickness for many, which is common for VR games where you're moving around visually but not physically.

The Oculus Quest has a growing ecosystem of games that allow you to enjoy virtual reality in different ways. While some titles make you jump around and dodge bullets, all of the titles on this list can be enjoyed from the comfort of your favorite chair.

It's a great game for parties because it can get everyone involved, and it doesn't require a lot of space, so it's perfect for the living room.

It's an art application that gives you the unlimited canvas of virtual reality. You can sculpt in 3-D and create beautiful pieces of artwork.
In addition to all of the Oculus Quest games above, you can check out the supported Oculus Go games that you can play on the Oculus Quest. The Oculus Go only supports three degrees of freedom, so Oculus Go games should work well on the Oculus Quest while you're seated.

One size fits most: Razer Kishi
Built to slot in almost any Android phone with a center USB-C port, the Kishi runs off your phone battery and supports passthrough charging. Unlike most Bluetooth controllers, you'll never have to charge it, it collapses into a convenient travel size, input lag is never a problem, and it's less conspicuous than a gaming-clip controller when playing on the go.
Built for phones, tablets and PC: SteelSeries Stratus Duo
The Stratus Duo uses Bluetooth to sync with Android and a Wi-Fi dongle to connect to your PC, meaning you won't have to disconnect from one to play on the other — just flip a switch on its back and you're good to go! It's quite comfortable to hold for marathon sessions its rechargeable lithium-ion battery should last you 20 hours. The only thing that's missing is haptic feedback, but that shouldn't be a dealbreaker for most mobile gamers.
For elite configurations: Razer Raiju Mobile
The Razer Raiju Mobile is an expensive controller, but for your money you get one of the best Bluetooth controllers for a smartphone that you will ever own. Features include remappable buttons and an accompanying app that lets you set up custom control profiles for games. It's also got a study phone mount, and can remember and instantly pair with two different phones over Bluetooth or through a wired connection.
Modern meets retro: 8Bitdo SN30 Pro
Calling all 90s kids! 8Bitdo has created this Bluetooth controller to include all the modern features you demand from a controller including rumble functions and dual-stick controls while staying true to the iconic design of the Super Nintendo controller. This is an especially good option if you're a nostalgic gamer looking to install some retro gaming emulators on your phone.
Get a better grip: GameSir F2 Grip
Sometimes the worst part about gaming on a phone for long stretches of time is that our phones weren't designed to be held in landscape for hours at a time. If you regularly get hand cramps while gaming, this universal phone grip accessory can give your palms something substantial to rest on while also including an on-screen joystick adapter that works pretty good with MOBA-style games.
Block out distractions: TaoTronics Active Noise-Canceling Bluetooth Headphones
When you're gaming, the last thing want is distractions — and this issue is worse with mobile gaming where you might be playing on a bus or somewhere else that's noisy. With these TaoTronics over ear Bluetooth headphones, you'll be able to cut out most of that noise with the built-in noise cancellation while enjoying 30-hour battery life and a price that fits any gamer's budget.
Best USB-C earbuds: OnePlus Type-C Bullets Earphones
The slow death of the 3.5mm headphone jack has been well documented — but few know just how good that USB-C audio can be. The OnePlus Bullets are some of the best USB-C headphones you can buy and the best part is they're also dirt cheap compared to the competition.
All-in-one portable charger: Ventev Powercell 6010+
This is my go-to battery pack that I bring with me everywhere. I love it because it not only has a built-in USB-C cable for charging my devices, but also built-in AC prongs for charging the battery back up. You can also plug this battery pack in and use it as a makeshift wall charger, too.
Extend your gaming sessions: Aukey PD Power Bank (10000mAh)
Aukey offers a sleek and slim phone-sized battery pack that will let you extend your gaming sessions or quickly recharge your phone on the go. The reason we recommend this one over other similar battery packs is that it offers USB-C Power Delivery 2.0 output with total power output of up to 18W.
A retro gamers' best friend: Samsung 128GB Evo Select microSD
Not all Android phones support expandable storage via microSD — but if yours does you can absolutely use one to sideload your phone with games not found on the Google Play Store or your favorite ROMs from your childhood. Samsung makes reliable cards and the EVO Select 128GB offers the best value.
Get ready for Project xCloud: 8BitDo SN30 Pro for Project xCloud
If you're specifically looking to stream Game Pass titles on your phone, 8BitDo has teamed up with Microsoft for a themed version of its popular SN30 Pro, due out in September. Unlike the original version, this controller comes with a phone clip and lets you customize trigger and thumbstick sensitivity as well as button mapping — plus you get the Xbox home button.
Google gaming must-have: Stadia controller
Stadia subscribers can play with any Bluetooth controller, but it's worth investing in the official controller, which is extremely comfortable for long play sessions and has useful Stadia-specific buttons like the one-touch capture button. It will work across your PC and Android devices, including non-Stadia platforms like Steam. For mobile gaming specifically, however, you'll need to invest in a phone stand.
Bottom line
When choosing between the best Android gaming accessories for you, especially the best Android controllers, don't just go with our top picks by default. Consider whether you'll want to use this controller with another platform besides your phone, if you'll be playing in public places where a phone clip would be too conspicuous, and which gaming streaming platform (if any) you plan to use the most. Then consider how you plan to keep your phone and controller charged on the go, or which headphones will block out the world so you can hear your opponents sneaking up on you.
The Razer Kishi is a strong pick because it simplifies a lot of these questions. It's powered by your phone and supports USB-C passthrough, so you only need to worry about keeping one device charged. It works seamlessly with xCloud, GeForce and Stadia just by plugging it into your phone, with no app needed or long Bluetooth pairing process. Just make sure your phone will fit inside it before buying.
As for keeping your phone charged, I always recommend the Ventev Powercell 6100+ because I can take it with me everywhere without worrying about cables or wall bricks. Beyond that, if you can expand the storage on your phone you absolutely should — and then do some independent research on emulators and ROMs. It's a particularly great way to expand your mobile gaming beyond what streaming platforms have to offer.

Game like a pro with these controllers for your Samsung Galaxy phones
Are you ready to have some fun with your new Samsung Galaxy phone and get some serious gaming done? Before you can, you'll likely want to get an awesome controller to pair up and make the most out of the experience.Updated May 18, 2020: Hand tracking is now generally avaialble. The Oculus Store will start accepting titles with hand tracking on May 28, 2020. You can read more about hand tracking here.
I'm standing in the middle of a magical laboratory, complete with glowing rocks and bubbling coundrons, and all I have to do is stand still and not poke the eyeball. The disembodied voice was very clear about not touching the eyeball, but it's right there you know? It's looking at me, sitting in the cavity of this chest like a lock. I give in to my curiosity, lean in, and extend my finger straight into the center of this giant eyeball. As it flinches, the top of a chest flings itself open and several other eyballs come flying out to cause a mess in the lab.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
I have some cleaning up to do, but I won't be doing it with a controller. Like poking that eyeball, I'll be using my actual hands in VR. And I'll be doing it with no extra hardware at all, just my fingers and the Oculus Quest.
It is crazy how well this works
Oculus announced hand tracking during its keynote as a feature that was coming to Quest soon, but anyone at Facebook's conference this week can check out Elixir, a demo made specifically to show off this tech. It's a simple 10-minute experience, but what you get from it is beyond cool.
As soon as the headset is on, you can see your hands. As you rotate your wrists and touch your fingers together, the virtual hands in front of you do the same. In Elixir, you're encouraged to put your hand on pads to unlock things, pinch eye droppers to play with chemicals, and even grab wires to fix a broken circuit, and you do all of this with your actual fingers to spectacular effect.
As you continue to play through the demo, different chemicals spill onto your hands and cause different effects. At one point, I could close my fists and see Wolverine-style claws come out of my knuckles, or see rings of electricity form and dissipate. There's even a bit where you grab a pen floating in the air and sign a scroll floating in front of you. And it worked: My actual signature appeared on the page in front of me as my hand gripped an imaginary pen in the real world.
One thing you don't get from this, which daily Oculus users will immediately notice is missing, is any kind of feedback. Vibration is a huge part of the Oculus (or general video game) experience, and Oculus controllers are better than most at delivering on that feedback. It's downright weird to hot have feedback when there's green goo bubbling over your hands or when you reach out and grab something and see your hand catch fire in VR. It's not a bad thing, just a thing you're likely to immediately notice is different from other Oculus experiences.
Getting better with time, and coming soon
As cool as this is, and I genuinely can't wait to try it again, there are some clear limitations based on how the tech works. Right now, hand tracking exists thanks to a combination of model-based tracking and deep neural networks to figure out where your hands are and what they are doing. That means, on some level, the computer sitting next to your head is making some educated guesses about what your hands are doing based on lots of pictures and videos of other hands. In most situations, I could throw at it in my limited time with the experience, it was great.
You're able to do some REALLY cool things when you can use your actual fingers so I don't think the lack of haptics is going to be a big deal for most folks.
But occasionally I noticed when I pressed by thumb and ring finger together in the real world, I wouldn't actually see my fingers touch in VR. Took me a second to figure out why, but it's because most of the time my middle finger was in the way and the headset couldn't actually see my whole finger. Something similar happened when I tried to put my hands together, to clap or something. Instead of risking getting it super wrong, the hands would just disappear for a moment and wait until two clear hands could be identified again.
The range on this feature right now is also fairly limited compared to the reach you get with a controller in your hand. The cameras on Quest can reliably track you hands in roughly a three and a half foot bubble in the front of the headset. If I tried to fully extend one of my arms, or if I tried to reach too far above my head, the hand would disappear entirely and wouldn't return until my real hand came back.
This features is obviously stil in its very early days, and it's likely hand tracking will continue to improve before it ships, but for the moment it's clear you're not going to have the same kind of range you get with physical controllers. However, you're able to do some REALLY cool things when you can use your actual fingers so I don't think it's going to be a big deal for most folks.
Oculus plans to ship hand tracking on Quest as a beta early next year, and start setting the stage for developers to submit their own experiences with hand tracking. When that happens, the most popular standalone VR headset on the planet will have a feature that works natively in more things than just about any other consumer-based hand tracking system available today.The Oculus Quest family has a fantastic library of apps and games available, but you can open up new possibilities by sideloading. Both the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 are Android devices at their core, so you can put APK files onto it just like an Android phone. This means you can install anything from the Android version of Netflix to cough other video streaming apps cough thanks to SideQuest, which is designed to streamline sideloading.
How to unlock developer mode
For this guide, you'll need a PC in order to get things set up properly. That begins with downloading SideQuest to get started. SideQuest is a free utility that makes connecting the Oculus Quest or Quest 2 to a PC an easier process. It also unlocks a world of indie games that you can't get on the official Oculus Store.
The first thing that you need to do with your Oculus Quest or Quest 2 to sideload apps is to enable developer mode. This is done through the Oculus app on your phone.
- Open the Oculus app.
- Select Settings.
Select your Oculus Quest headset.
- Tap the arrow to the right of your device name to drop down more options if they don't show up immediately after selecting your device.
- Select more settings.
- Select developer mode.
Toggle the developer mode setting to on.

- Tap the arrow to the right of your device name to drop down more options if they do not show up immediately after selecting your device.
- Select more settings.
- Select developer mode.
- Toggle the developer mode setting to on if it isn't already switched on.
How to set up SideQuest on your PC
Next, you'll need to get SideQuest ready on your PC. You'll have to download SideQuest from GitHub and install it. It's an executable file, so if you've used those before, it should work like any other. You can download it on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process on Windows.
- Go to SideQuestVR.com.
- Click on the GET SIDEQUEST button at the top of the page.
- Select the version for your computer's operating system, either Windows, Mac, or Linux.
- Open the downloaded installer file.
Accept any security dialogs that appear and run through the installation process.
Once the installer has completed, launch SideQuest from your Start Menu, applications menu, or quick launch bar.
How to connect your Oculus Quest and SideQuest
To set up SideQuest and to install any applications, you'll need to connect your Oculus Quest and your PC.
- Connect your Oculus Quest or Quest 2 to your PC using a USB cable.
SideQuest should recognize the headset and show a green circle with the name of your headset on the top bar.
- Put on your headset, and select Allow USB debugging.
- Make sure to check Always allow from this computer.
How to install apps through SideQuest
Now that the setup is out of the way, you can sideload apps. If you've done everything correctly, you won't have to repeat any of the steps above.
SideQuest has a great library of apps and games available directly from the SideQuest app on your computer. To install any of those, follow these steps.
Installing apps already on SideQuest
- Browse or search for an app inside of SideQuest using the search bar located at the top of every page.
Click the Install to headset button at the top of the store listing.
- A progress notification will be displayed on the bottom of the SideQuest window.
To check the status, select the tasks button at the top of SideQuest. It looks like a checkmark.
That's it! You can also uninstall an app using the same process, but select uninstall instead of install.
Installing APKs from elsewhere
You can also install APKs that you download from anywhere else.
Click the Install APK file from folder on computer button at the top of SideQuest.
- Select your APK of choice from the pop-up dialog box and click open
How to launch sideloaded games
Now that you have your games or apps installed, you need to launch them.
- From the Oculus home screen within the headset, select Library on the bottom bar. If you don't see the bottom bar, press the Home button on your right controller.
- Select Unknown Sources from the right-most drop-down menu.
Select the game or app you'd like to use.
That's it! SideQuest makes it simple to sideload apps and games and is an excellent resource for the Oculus Quest.

This has been one of our favorite Android smartwatches since it was released, and today, if you have a Samsung Galaxy phone and the Galaxy Watch Active 2, you can start monitoring your heart with ECG, electrocardiogram, readings from your wrist.
How to take an ECG reading on your Samsung Galaxy Active 2
- Download and install the Samsung Health Monitoring app from the Galaxy Store onto your Galaxy phone.
- With the watch on your wrist, open the Samsung Health Monitoring app on the watch.
Following the directions on your watch, rest your forearm on a table or chair.
- Hold your index finger in the top button of the watch, careful not to press it.
- The watch will detect your finger and begin the reading.
- Hold still with your finger on the button for 30 seconds.
- When the reading is complete, you'll receive a notification on your phone to review the results.
Within the app, there are four categories that readings from your watch will fall into sinus rhythm, AFib, inconclusive, and poor reading. The app will give you definitions of each section with some disclaimers as well.
While the FDA has approved this feature, it isn't the end all be all for detecting heart conditions. You can export your reports from the app so that you can share it with a medical professional.

- A great new experience: Oculus Quest 2 ($299 at Amazon)
Oculus Quest 2 controllers More comfortable, more capable
Oculus labs at Facebook have learned a thing or two over the years about virtual reality controllers. That's why the third-generation Oculus Touch controllers for the Oculus Quest 2 are better than ever, with a more comfortable grip, wider spacing between buttons on the front, and redesigned grip and trigger buttons that are easier to use. If you've used both first and second-generation Oculus Touch controllers, you'll immediately recognize that these new third-generation Oculus Touch controllers look like a hybrid between the two older generations.
The face buttons and joystick up top now feature more padding around each one, including a new dedicated thumb rest for those games where you don't press buttons very often. The Home and Menu buttons on each controller have been moved away from the normal reach of thumbs and are now concave-shaped. Have you ever accidentally pressed the home button while playing Beat Saber? You're not alone, and this new thumb rest should help users avoid that in most circumstances.
On top of that, the handgrips are a bit larger and feature a stronger battery compartment that won't slide off as easily as before. Have you ever been playing the Oculus Quest or Oculus Rift S and the battery compartment slips right off? That shouldn't happen as much (if ever) with these new controllers. Some users say the new larger grips don't fit smaller hands as well, though, so be aware that this could be a comfort issue for some folks.
Haptics and battery life on the Oculus Quest 2 controllers
The Oculus Quest 2 controllers still use a single AA battery to power each one. While that seems a bit odd in 2020, Facebook has been able to quadruple battery life on the Quest 2's controllers when compared to battery life on the Quest 1's controllers. That's great for making AAs last a bit longer, especially if you're using rechargeable ones.
Last, but certainly not least, is the introduction of more advanced haptic motors inside. Improved haptic feedback is something we've seen from mobile devices and video game controllers alike. Enhanced haptics mean a more realistic rumble that can simulate real-world scenarios, like the difference between tapping a wall with your finger and hitting two swords together. Enhanced haptics give developers ways of making virtual reality feel more like actual reality, and that's a great thing.

The regular Samsung Galaxy Note 20 left out a microSD slot this year, but, in comparison, the Note 20 Ultra supports microSD cards up to 1TB in size. While most of us won't quite need that level of DOWNLOAD ALL THE THINGS storage, it's a great idea to invest in a good microSD card so that you can store music, movies, and photos on that and leave internal storage for more intensive files like games and apps. Here are the best microSD cards for the Note 20 Ultra, whether you need a little room or a lot.
- All-around excellence: Samsung EVO Select 256GB MicroSDXC Card
- Just a little more: SanDisk Extreme 64GB
- Double your storage: PNY Elite-X 128GB
- Ready to expand: Kingston Canvas Go Plus 128GB
- Best value: Lexar 633x 512GB
- Go big or go home: SanDisk Extreme 1TB Memory Card
All-around excellence: Samsung EVO Select 256GB MicroSDXC Card
A Samsung phone deserves a Samsung memory card, right? This is easy when Samsung makes our favorite microSD card on the market. This 4K capable card will triple the storage on your Note 20 Ultra.
Just a little more: SanDisk Extreme 64GB
If you just need a little extra breathing room, the SanDisk Extreme is a long-lasting microSD card that is optimized for storing and running apps. The V30 rating means it should handle 4K like a champ.
Double your storage: PNY Elite-X 128GB
PNY's cards can go the distance — mine is going on four years now — and it will give you 100% more storage space on your Note 20 Ultra for less than date night.
Ready to expand: Kingston Canvas Go Plus 128GB
Kingston's microSD card lineup got an upgrade this year, with the Canvas Go Plus adding better app optimization. The V30 speed rating means it should be more than enough for capturing 4K video.
Best value: Lexar 633x 512GB
Half a terabyte of space should take you months and months to fill, and Lexar offers it up for a fraction of the price of Samsung and SanDisk without compromising on write speed or durability.
Go big or go home: SanDisk Extreme 1TB Memory Card
If you absolutely need to hold every movie, song, or book in your digital collection on your Note 20 Ultra, this is the biggest microSD card on the market and it should hold hundreds of films or millions of files with ease.
What are the best microSD cards for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra?
When selecting a microSD card, I tend to buy a card slightly larger than I think I'll need. For example, if you tend to only need a little extra space for some offline music and movies, you might be okay with a 64GB card, but I'd recommend grabbing a 128GB card like the PNY Elite-X. After all, if you run out of room, you'll have to buy a new card and go through the hassle of transferring everything over.
Given that the Note 20 Ultra starts out with 128GB of storage, the best size microSD card you could get is the 256GB Samsung Evo Select. This will triple the available space and leave you plenty of room for high-quality movie downloads for long road trips — yeah, I listen to movies while I drive, it beats the pants off podcasts — and storing your entire music library if you need it. You'll also be able to hold months and months of photos and videos on the Evo Select, though it's important to note that Samsung still saves Burst photos and Super Slow-Mo videos to internal storage regardless of how fast a microSD card you have inserted.
What all those symbols on a microSD card mean — and why they don't always matter
Manufacturers cover every centimeter of a microSD card in classifications and certifications as if it were some miniature race car, but I'm here to tell you that most of these symbols don't mean much (if anything). The ones that matter most on a microSD card are the values below, and they all measure the same thing: write speed.
- Video Speed Class — Indicated by a stylized V followed by numbers from 6 to 90, this class is one of the newer classification systems and was developed specifically for shooting ultra-high-definition video. V30 starts at 30MB/s write speed, V60 starts at 60MB/s write speed, and V90 starts at 90MB/s, but unless your phone somehow shoots 8K video, you probably don't need a V90 card.
- UHS Speed Class — Indicated by a 1, 2, or 3 inside a U, this class is still used on most cards today. U1 starts at 10MB/s write speed, U3 starts at 30MB/s write speed, and both are perfectly adequate for most Android phones.
- Speed Class — Indicated by a number inside of a C, this was the original classification system for SD cards. Class 10 was as high as this class went, 10 MB/s write speed, and practically every card worth buying today is well beyond this speed at this point, so it's not as helpful an indicator of power/quality these days.
Another important note: read speed is almost always faster than write speed, so if you see a card that only mentions "transfer speed" of 100 MB/s but is a V30 card, we can infer that the read speed is 100 MB/s and the write speed is at least 30 MB/s.
It's essential to look beyond the symbols in a microSD card. Some V60 cards have a listed write speed of 80 MB/s, and there are some V30 cards out there with 90 MB/s write speeds. So read the specs!

- Lee played a significant role in the global rise of Samsung, however, he was also a controversial figure due to multiple accounts of corruption.
- Lee's son and current vice-chairman, Lee Jae-yong, is most likely to be named the successor.
On October 25, Samsung Group announced that Samsung's long-time chairman, Lee Kun-hee, died at 78, with family by his side.
While the company has not confirmed the exact cause of death, Lee has had a long history of heart problems. Notably, he had to be hospitalized for years after experiencing a heart attack in 2014.
As Samsung chairman since 1987, Lee led the company in its meteoric rise to becoming a global powerhouse. During his tenure, Samsung heavily invested in R&D and changed its entire product line. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, the company transitioned from being an affordable TV and appliance brand to being one of the top manufacturers in semiconductors and display technologies.
From then on, Samsung has been recognized as a leading brand across multiple industry verticals. Most notably, the company has been the world's largest phone manufacturer, with wildly successful product lines including the Galaxy series.
Samsung's growth under Lee is undeniable, though it's not without controversy. In 1995, Lee was found guilty of bribing the country's President, Roh Tae-woo. Over a decade later, in 2008, he was found guilty of tax evasion and accused of massive corruption and further tampering of the South Korean government. Samsung is one of Korea's biggest companies, and the largest of the family-run chaebols, which are comprised of Samsung, LG, Hyundai, SK and Lotte.
Lee's son and Samsung vice-chairman, Lee Jae-yong is expected to be named successor, but he has his own history with law-breaking. Lee Jae-yong spent almost a year in prison after being found guilty on multiple charges of bribery and corruption connected to the now-removed President Park Geun-hye.
In 2020, Samsung continues to thrive as the global conglomerate it is today, and Lee Kun-hee's involvement cannot be understated, in both good ways and bad.

Moggie the Moogle is here to spread joy across all of Gaia... well, sort of anyway. This cute kid runs the Moogle Emporium, a place to spend all those Moogle Medals you've been collecting. He says people love collecting Moogle Medals, so by trading them to him, he can sell them to these collectors, bringing joy to everyone in the process. Given some of his merchandise, the kid's claim might not be so far fetched either!
Moogie the Moogle?
Inspired by Mog the Moogle, a character from a famous fairy tale, Moogie just wants to spread happiness to everyone in the slums — well, that and make some money for the orphans. Moggie is a new character in Final Fantasy 7 Remake and he is here to sell you some really amazing items.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
But Moogie doesn't take Gil like the rest of the merchants. He is looking for Moogle Medals. By the time you meet Moogie, in Chapter 8, you will likely have picked up at least a few Moogle Medals, but if you haven't, don't worry. There are plenty of opportunities to earn the currency of the Moogle Emporium.
Moogle Emporium
The Moogle Emporium Moogie's little shop where you can buy some exclusive merchandise with Moogle Medals. Between his first location in Chapter 8 and a second appearance in Chapter 14, you can get exclusive weapons, items for side quests, and 10 additional SP for each character on your team. If you don't plan on spending much time farming, I suggest prioritizing the SP books. Each of these costs five Moogle Medals, but they grant their respective character 10 additional SP. There are lots of useful items though and Moogle Medals are pretty easy to farm, so it's not hard to buy out the shop:
|Item||Use||Moogle Medals|
|Moogle Membership Card||Allows you to shop at the Moogle Emporium||1|
|20. Golden Saucer||Adds a song to your collection||1|
|Ether||Restores 20 MP||2|
|Silver Staff||Weapon for Aerith (Sorcerous Storm)||2|
|Whistlewind Scarf||Start battle with some ATB||3|
|Salvation Badge||Boosts healing when HP is 25% or lower||1|
|Graveyard Key||Used for side quest: Paying Respects||1|
|The Art of Swordplay - Vol. I||Grants Cloud 10 SP||5|
|Sharpshooter's Companion - Vol. I||Grants Barret 10 SP||5|
|Way of the Fist - Vol. I||Grants Tifa 10 SP||5|
|Telluric Scriptures - Vol. I||Grants Aerith 10 SP||5|
|Turbo Ether||Fully restores MP||2|
|Elixir||Fully restores HP and MP||8|
|Steel Princers||Weapon for Barret (Charging Uppercut)||7|
|Enfeeblement Ring||Start battle with toad status||1|
|Moogle's Mortar||Ingredient for side quest: Secret Medicine||1|
Moogle Medals
If you haven't amassed enough Moogle Medals by the time you meet Moogie, don't worry. They're pretty easy to come by just by playing the game. Whenever you see Shinra boxes, be sure to slice them open. They have a chance of hiding Moogle Medals. Moogle Medals will also occasionally be given as rewards for completing quests. However, if you have a little time to spare, you can farm all the medals you need shortly after meeting Moogie in Chapter 8. If you complete the side quest: Kids on Patrol, you will unlock a minigame called Whack-a-Box. Whack-a-Box is free to play and grants a number of prizes, including a Moogle Medal for every playthrough. It's super easy; just follow these steps:
- Talk to Sarah, the girl at the back of the Children's Secret Hideout.
Press X to select Yes.
Attack the boxes to score points. The more points a box, the more durable it is. Hint: target the 1500 Boxes with your Abilities.
Keep an eye out for red timer boxes. These aren't worth points but will add time to your clock.
Continue attacking boxes until you run out of time.
- Repeat until you have enough Moogle Medals.
Depending on how many Moogle Medals you've picked up along the way, this could take a little while. However, you get one Moogle Medal for every play, and there are a few other items you can win for getting high scores. It takes a total of 50 Moogle Medals to buy all the items from Moogie in both Chapter 8 and Chapter 14, so make sure you get enough to buy everything you want.

You might want to check out these horror games.Best answer: There is no evidence of risk to your health from mmWave 5G and Sub-6 5G since they use the same frequencies that have been in use for years. Certain 28 GHz bands could lead to weather information disruption if the power levels are too high.
- The first 5G-only Galaxy phone: Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G ($1400 at Samsung)
- Affordable 5G on Verizon: Moto Z4 ($400 at Amazon)
Is 5G different from 4G?
5G and 4G are mostly similar from a radio frequency and radiation perspective. Some 5G deployments like T-Mobile's 600 MHz 5G and Sprint's 2.5 GHz 5G use frequencies that have already been in use with 4G at similar power levels. If you remember UHF television, T-Mobile's 5G occupies the space that used to be channels 35 through 51. These frequencies are nothing new.
What is new is millimeter wave 5G, which includes mmWave and Ultra Wideband 5G.
The main difference is that mmWave uses very high frequencies to transmit more data. A side effect of this high frequency is that the signal doesn't travel as far as the lower frequencies. That's why mmWave 5G requires many more cell sites. While this may seem like you're getting doused in a greater amount of radiation, the signal degradation makes the radiation levels nothing new.
Don't panic about radiation
According to The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), radiofrequency fields are listed as possibly carcinogenic to humans. As Digital Trends pointed out in its article, this is the same classification given to coffee.
In the same article, the FDA is quoted saying that it "continues to believe that the current safety limits for cell phone radiofrequency energy exposure remain acceptable for protecting the public health." For now, there appears to be no risk to health from the radio waves produced by phones and towers. At least no more than already existed.
As pointed out in a BBC News article, the power levels 5G is broadcasted at means it is non-ionizing. This just means that the signal doesn't have the strength to break down cells or DNA.
Predicting the weather
The high-frequency 24GHz bands that some upcoming fast 5G will use to produce top speeds are quite close to the 23.8GHz area that meteorologists use to measure water in the atmosphere. This is because tower equipment may not be precise enough to not interfere on the lower bands when power is pushed higher than -20 decibel watts per 200 megahertz. When amplified to these power levels for maximum coverage, the signal can become noisier and get in the way more.
With a little imagination, it's easy to see the kind of problems that can come from not being able to accurately measure the weather. As predictions suffer, people in severe weather conditions may not have the best information to make a decision. Staffing for crews that respond to weather conditions on roadways may not have the resources in place as quickly with a less accurate prediction.
As noted in an article by ScienceMag FCC Chairman Ajit Pai claims that with beamforming as well as millimeter-wave deployments being more isolated to dense areas, there won't be an issue.
Only time will tell the exact impact of the interference, but the major impact on mobile users might be a reduction in signal strength in the faster, high-frequency bands. Hopefully, carriers will work to make sure their equipment does as little damage to measurements as possible.
Conspiracy theories
There's been no shortage of wild theories regarding the purported dangers of 5G, which far too often get amplified by users with large audiences on social media. Many of these posts are presented without any verifiable sources, and make bold claims that 5G has lead to widespread sudden deaths or even that it caused the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
With a small bit of research, these conspiracy theories are easily debunked. Once again, most of the radio frequencies used for 5G have been in place for years, and the higher frequencies used for millimeter wave 5G non-ionizing. There are simply no signs pointing to 5G being any more dangerous than the LTE networks preceding it. The best thing you can do to prevent the spread of misinformation is to share scientifically backed, well-researched articles and sources demystifying the technologies behind 5G.

The Oculus Quest has a growing library of games ranging from first-person shooters to musical saber swinging. There's no shortage of excellent titles for the VR system, but there are some games that stand out above the rest. Some games, like Arizona Sunshine, became popular on other systems and are now on the Oculus Quest. Other titles launched on the Oculus Quest, like the trilogy of Vader Immortal games. Our top pick, Beat Saber, was available on other systems long before the Quest came out, but provides an incredible on the Quest experience thanks to the headset's lack of wires.
- Best Overall: Beat Saber
- Best Strategy Game: SUPERHOT VR
- Best Unique Shooter: Pistol Whip
- Best Free Game: Rec Room
- Best Arcade Shooter: Robo Recall: Unplugged
- Best Melee Fighter: Ironlights
- Best Story: Moss
- Best for Artists: Tilt Brush by Google
- Best Horror Game: Arizona Sunshine
- Best Rhythmic Shooter: AUDICA
- Best Sci-fi Game: Vader Immortal: Episode III
- Force Fun: Vader Immortal: Episode II
Best Overall: Beat Saber
Beat Saber is an incredibly addictive game. In it, you swing sabers through blocks to the beat of popular music. Much like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, Beat Saber is easy to enter but difficult to master. As a result, it's fun for newcomers to VR and gaming experts trying to skyrocket up the leaderboards.
The untethered nature of the Oculus Quest improves Beat Saber because you won't have wires in the way when you're swinging your arms around. Also, because the Oculus Quest is so easy to take with you on the go, you can take Beat Saber with you anywhere. The only real downside to Beat Saber is that it doesn't officially support custom songs. You can still add custom songs, but it requires another device and a few extra steps.
Pros:
- Easy to jump right into
- Difficult to master, increasing replayability
- Fun for solo gaming or parties (if you cast it to a TV)
Cons:
Best Overall
Beat Saber
Fun for everyone
Because Beat Saber is easy to jump into but difficult to master, it's a great game for beginners and hardcore gamers.
Best Strategy Game: SUPERHOT VR
This game received a massive boost when jumping from console to VR headsets. The Oculus Quest's lack of wires made it even better. You can completely lose yourself inside this game as you dodge, dip, duck, dive, and dodge again. In this game, the world moves at the same speed you do. That means you can pause to make a plan to take down enemies or to dodge a bullet. It requires precise planning and exact movements to clear many of its levels. Alternatively, you can speedrun as you master all of its levels.
The game supports full locomotion, meaning you can freely move throughout levels. In fact, you can move to areas of levels that you can't on some other platforms because the Oculus Quest is wireless. That's mostly a positive, but it means you can't get as good of an experience within limited space. It's still an incredible game, though, and a must-have for Oculus Quest owners.
Pros:
- Incredibly immersive
- Unique and challenging
- Huge range of motion
- Good for slow and steady gamers or speedrunners
Cons:
Best Strategy Game
SUPERHOT VR
Living in the matrix
Because the Oculus Quest is wireless, you can freely dodge bullets and move to defeat your opponents in this game.
Best Unique Shooter: Pistol Whip
What do you get when you combine John Wick-style action and dubstep? Pistol Whip. This game lets you shoot your enemies to music while flowing between shots. You can dodge bullets, mow down foes with a machine gun, and feel like you're in an action movie. It's earned an almost perfect rating in the Oculus Store for a reason.
Pistol Whip calls levels "scenes" because each level combines combat with a cinematic experience. While Pistol Whip has some great scenes and recently got an expansion, it only has 13 scenes in all. Those scenes are fun, but there aren't enough of them right now.
Pros:
- Brings a unique style to the shooter genre
- Makes you feel like an action movie star
- Incorporates fun music
Cons:
Best Unique Shooter
Pistol Whip
Shoot to the rhythm
In this rhythmic shooter, you shoot, dodge, and dance your way through levels while feeling like you're in an action movie.
Best Free Game: Rec Room
Don't let the simple graphics fool you; Rec Room is a great game on the Oculus Quest and it's free! It has several different play areas, so you can jump into different games. There's also a lounge to hang out in with other people. One of my favorite games is paintball, which lets you play capture the flag with sniper rifles, pistols, and shotguns.
The biggest downside of Rec Room is the other people in the game, at least some of the time. While playing online can be fun and provide an easy way to play multiplayer games, many people in Rec Room are rude or offensive. Unfortunately, I've seen people make vulgar comments and motions in the game on several occasions.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Free Game
Rec Room
Multiple games in one
Rec Room packs several games into one, including paintball, a pirate ship adventure, laser tag, and many more ways to play.
Best Arcade Shooter: Robo Recall: Unplugged
In this game, you have to stop an outbreak of out of control robots. You can use pistols, shotguns, mecha suits, and more weapons to dismantle — I mean, cough, "recall"— robots. You can also pick up a robot, bash it into the ground and throw it at another robot. It's all-around robot mayhem that'll get you laughing as you smash them to bits.
The game plays best when you plant your feet and fire away like an arcade game. It struggles a bit when it comes to moving around, especially against quicker enemies. It would benefit greatly from a locomotion option.
Pros:
- Laughably fun, 💥smash 💥 smash💥
- Has a varied set of weapons
- Let's you jump into a mecha suit and fire lasers
Cons:
Best Arcade Shooter
Robo Recall: Unplugged
Blastin' bots
This bullet storm game has you to spin 360 degrees to destroy killer robots en masse.
Best Melee Fighter: Ironlights
This game tosses you in an arena to combat fighters from a range of classes. You can play as a ninja, knight, crusader, monk, or duelist, each of which has a unique set of weapons and fighting styles. Ranged combat is full speed while closeup melee combat is slowed down. This slower combat mode makes you strategize how to hit your opponent rather than just hacking and slashing at a manic pace.
Ironlights has a campaign mode, which can help you learn the basics of the game, but multiplayer provides the game's best experience. You can battle opponents in real-time over the web and compete on online leaderboards.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Melee Fighter
Ironlights
Strategic slashing
Ironlights combines unique melee combat with different classes of warriors in campaigns and online battles.
Best Story: Moss
While you can have a lot of fun hacking and slashing in some excellent titles on the Oculus Quest, Moss brings a different feel to the headset. It's a charming story that you get to work through alongside Quill, an adorable little mouse. In the game, you help Quill solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and journey through the woods filled with relics and magic.
Moss is built for VR, but instead of just focusing on movement mechanics, it immerses you into a heartfelt story set inside a virtual environment. Some might dislike the fact that it's a VR game that has you control the main character through a third-person view. That doesn't seem to have bothered many considering the game's nearly perfect rating.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Story
Moss
Just plain charming
In this game, you lead a charming mouse around a beautiful world full of puzzles and a gorgeous story.
Best for Artists: Tilt Brush
It's hard to say if this is a "game" in the strictest definition, but it's a lot of fun either way. Tilt Brush allows you to create beautiful artwork inside a 3-D virtual space. Whether you're an experienced artist or a beginner, you can have fun playing inside Tilt Brush. You can flow through your artwork with your Touch Controllers to create anything you want.
While Tilt Brush can be immersive and fun to use, it's a little limited by its lack of some tools. Many have asked for additions like copy and pasting, a better toolbar, and other artists to make creating easier.
Pros:
- Has easy to learn basics
- Allows you to create vast pieces of art
- Works well with immersive nature of the Oculus Quest
Cons:
Best for Artists
Tilt Brush by Google
Building beauty
Tilt Brush takes advantage of the wireless nature of the Quest and lets you create on an almost infinite canvas.
Best Horror Game: Arizona Sunshine
Arizona Sunshine is a tremendously popular title from other VR platforms, so Oculus Quest users met it with anticipation. It's a zombie thriller with a complete campaign mode that you don't normally see on the Oculus Quest. It has a large arsenal of 25 weapons that allow you to blast away zombies in several ways.
Arizona Sunshine has a campaign mode, horde mode, and allows you to play in co-op multiplayer. In some ways, it's one of the most comprehensive games on the Oculus Quest. With that, though, comes a high price. It's one of the most expensive games on the Oculus Quest. Many won't feel like that's an issue, though.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Horror Game
Arizona Sunshine
Sunny zombies
This game is a high action, high scare zombie shooter based in the beautiful Arizona landscape.
Best Rhythmic Shooter: Audica
There are plenty of good shooters on the Oculus Quest, so picking the best one for you can be a bit difficult. Audica has you blast targets and bat them down with your Touch Controllers. It's set to the beat of club-style music, so you can get your groove on while shooting things up. As opposed to a game like Pistol Whip that encourages dancing around, Audica is more focused on destroying targets perfect to a song's rhythm.
While Audica has some great music for shooting around, the songs that it comes with generally fit into a limited set of genres. If that music isn't your scene, you can grab its DLC packs that have more "normal" music.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Rhythmic Shooter
AUDICA
Bang bang
From the makers of Rock Band and Dance Central, this game has you shoot blasters to the rhythm of songs.
Best Sci-fi Game: Vader Immortal Trilogy
Generations of sci-fi fans have pretended to swing a lightsaber. Now, you can wield a lightsaber, use the force, and battle the most iconic character from Star Wars, Darth Vader. In this trilogy of games, you can take your skills to the dojo and block laser blasts and destroy robots, or play through story modes. The conclusion of the series has you raid Vader's castle with an army of forces.
Each title in this trilogy adds abilities that make fighting more fun, such as the Force push. That's the biggest downside of this set of games, that it's a set. If you want to play all three, you'll have to purchase each one and jump between them through your Oculus Quest's menu. Luckily, the trilogy is complete so you can buy them all instead of having to wait.
Pros:
- Let's you fight with a lightsaber
- Features incredibly fun training dojo
- Adds abilities throughout the trilogy
- Decent Star Wars story
Cons:
Best Sci-fi Game
Vader Immortal: Episode III
Facing Vader
In the third installment of the Vader Immortal series, you raid Vader's fortress alongside an army and learn how to use the Force.
Force Fun
Vader Immortal: Episode II
Learning from Vader
This second entry in the series has you learn the Force from the Sith Lord himself, learning how to throw people and objects.
Lightsaber Antics
Vader Immortal: Episode I
Become a padawan
This game allows you to slash your lightsaber through foes and swing it to block lasers. Just don't sleep on the training dojo!
Bottom line
The Oculus Quest has a vast and growing library of games. Whether you're old, young, an experienced gamer, or completely new to VR, there's a title that you can enjoy. Developers have done an excellent job supporting the Oculus Quest. As a result, the system has almost 200 apps and games you can use. The untethered nature of the Oculus Quest brings new life to older titles and makes it easy to move around inside games.
If you're just getting started, Beat Saber is an incredible game that's easy to play but difficult to master. It's an excellent title for beginners or hardcore gamers and is made even better by the wireless nature of the Oculus Quest. If you get bored with its library of songs, you can sideload your own into the game.

The best Samsung Galaxy Note 20 cases are protective, grippy, and stylish. While the regular Note 20 doesn't have a glass back, it's still a big, honking phone and you shouldn't dare step out your door without protecting it with a case. From thin and colorful to ruggedly handsome, these are the cases you can trust with your new Note 20.
- Clear and clean: Spigen Liquid Crystal
- Functional fabric: Samsung Kvadrat Cover
- Mesmerizing majesty: Caseology Parallax
- Texas tough: ArmadilloTek Vanguard Series
- Understated grip: Ringke Air-S
- Upgraded armoring: Speck Presidio2 Grip
- Thin and vibrant: Anccer Colorful Series
- Fit for a king: UAG Monarch
- Beautiful protection: Spigen Tough Armor
- Luscious luxury: Samsung Leather Cover
- Showcase in safety: Ringke Fusion-X
- Combine and condense: FYY Leather RFID-Blocking Wallet
Clear and clean: Spigen Liquid Crystal
Want to show off your lovely Mystic Green phone? The Liquid Crystal will offer grip and scratch protection while keeping things slim and sanguine. If you want a little more pop, I adore the Glitter variant!
Functional fabric: Samsung Kvadrat Cover
This sustainable case is bright, cheerful, and feels wonderful in the hand. The color choices are a bit small compared to the S20+, but the bright pink case mislabeled as Red is lovely, so why would you need anything else?
Mesmerizing majesty: Caseology Parallax
The Parallax's Aqua Green adds a new level of depth to the Mystic Green Note 20, and while it may not look grippy at first, that cubist pattern across the back offers plenty of places to perch your fingers and keep your Note balanced in your hand.
Texas tough: ArmadilloTek Vanguard Series
This heavy-duty case is made to last, and the kickstand on the back is great in both portrait or landscape. I also use it as a phone grip from time to time. The red and purple stand out less than previous years' colors.
Understated grip: Ringke Air-S
Want a slim but grippy case that won't draw the eye to your shiny new flagship? The Ringke Air-S's subdued color palette plays perfectly with the Note 20 line while guarding it against slips and scuffs.
Upgraded armoring: Speck Presidio2 Grip
This is the quintessential grip case, from Speck's trademark grooves on the back to the robust impact protection, which should help keep your screen from shattering should you face a dreadful drop.
Thin and vibrant: Anccer Colorful Series
This ultra-thin hard case won't offer much in the way of impact protection, but it can guard your Note 20 against scratches, add a little grip, and give you a more vibrant red or blue color if you're not into green and bronze.
Fit for a king: UAG Monarch
UAG knows how to make a case fit for a king, and the Monarch is that rare instance where heavy-duty and luxury overlap in a way that actually makes sense, with the leather or carbon fiber accents feeling solid and sublime in the hand.
Beautiful protection: Spigen Tough Armor
Want a durable case that matches the color of your Note 20? Spigen offers a rugged dual-layer case in each of the Note 20 colors — Green, Bronze, and Gray — and it even sports a small kickstand for watching YouTube in the break room.
Luscious luxury: Samsung Leather Cover
Samsung's leather cases never disappoint when it comes to fit and feel. These cases continue the somewhat natural, earthy look of the Note 20 color lineup this year, with a lovely brown and a deep, deep green.
Showcase in safety: Ringke Fusion-X
The Fusion-X has always been a divisive case, but love it or hate it, you can't deny that it's an excellent option for protecting your Note 20 while showing off those earthy colors. There's also a Camo option that will look awesome with Mystic Green.
Combine and condense: FYY Leather RFID-Blocking Wallet
If you're going to carry a phone as big as the Note 20, you might as well spring for a wallet case so that you only need to grab your phone and go. This wallet fits three cards plus cash and has RFID-blocking filament to prevent skimming.
What are the best cases for the Galaxy Note 20?
The Galaxy Note 20 might be the smaller of the two new phones, but it's still a sizeable phone with a sizeable price tag, so the best cases for the Note 20 will offer grip and impact protection to protect your precious new phone. If you prefer your protection in a more streamlined form, the Spigen Liquid Crystal will let that Mystic Green or Mystic Bronze show through in full glory while still offering great grip and scratch protection.
If you prefer a more rugged case, the Speck Predisio2 Grip is grippier than ever and should help your Note 20 survive most reasonable drops; Speck says it can survive up to 13-foot drops but let's hope we never have to actually test that out. The MicroBan coating on it is nice to see, just remember that it's designed to kill odor and stain-causing bacteria, not to kill every virus spore your phone comes in contact with.
Once you've got a great case in hand, make sure to follow it up with a screen protector to keep that beautiful front glass from scratching or shattering.

- Still ticking: Fitbit Sense ($330 at Amazon)
What Fitbit trackers support Fitbit Pay?
Mobile payments are so convenient, whether that's on a phone or smartwatch, but did you know that Fitbit trackers with Fitbit Pay can pay on the go too? While not all Fitbit devices can use Fitbit Pay, some of the newest trackers do.
While the new Fitbit Sense can utilize Fitbit Pay, it's also available on a surprising number of the company's other trackers to let you pay from your wrist. Here are the models it's available for:
- Sense
- Versa 3
- Versa 2
- Versa Special Edition
- Ionic
- Charge 3 Special Edition
- Charge 4
What is Fitbit Pay?
Fitbit Pay is the mobile payment solution for Fitbit's fitness trackers. Just like there's Google Pay on phones and Wear OS watches, Fitbit Pay uses near field communication, NFC, to work with enabled payment terminals. Mobile payments are great for more than just the ease of leaving your wallet in your pocket or purse, but it's also secure. This is because each purchase gets a one-time token to send through the payment processing rather than your actual card number.
Getting started with using Fitbit Pay is a relatively simple process. All you need to do is add your credit or debit card from one of the participating banks, then set up a security PIN on your device. Now you're ready to pay for that post-workout water or snack using your favorite Fitbit fitness tracker.

- Google has begun selling refurbished hardware through its store.
- The Pixelbook and Google Wifi 3-Pack are the first two and only products available for sale.
- All devices sold have been renewed and feature a 1-year warranty.
Google makes some great hardware, but it can also be a bit pricey and leave a sizable dent in your bank account. Most of the time if you want to save a few bucks, you'd be left waiting for a random sale for whatever device you're pining for.
However, Google now has a new way for you to get that tech you want without paying top dollar through its Certified Refurbished storefront.
Currently, the Pixelbook and Google Wifi 3-Pack are the only two available products. The Pixelbook is the Core i5 model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for $749. That's not the cheapest this model has ever been available for, but at least you can pick it up right now. That's better than waiting on some sporadic sale that may or may not happen.
Chromebook
Pixelbook
Great Chromebook, better price
The Google Pixelbook is one of the best Chromebooks on the market with a stunning display and fantastic battery life. The one downside has been the price, but you can take the sting out of that by now buying it refurbished directly from Google.
The Google Wifi 3-Pack for $179, on the other hand, is at one of the best prices we've ever seen for the mesh Wi-Fi system, which can cover homes up to 4500 square feet.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Buying refurbished electronics to save money is nothing new, but until now, Google hardware was only available refurbished from third parties. Buying refurbished directly from Google comes with a host of benefits.
Mesh Wi-Fi
Google Wifi 3-Pack
Wi-Fi everywhere
A mesh Wi-Fi system is one of the best and easiest ways to seamlessly cover your entire home with wireless internet. The Google Wifi 3-Pack can help you accomplish this and by purchasing refurbished you can save some money at the same time.
First, Google says the "products undergo our rigorous quality control process to ensure each device lives up to Google standards." That includes inspecting the product, repairing, restoring, and cleaning the device to bring it back to "like-new" condition.
Next, the product goes through testing to "ensure everything works as it should." Finally, it is packed with "accessories that fit Google's standard." If that's not enough to ease your concerns of buying refurbished, each product also comes with a 1-year warranty.
Both devices are in limited quantities, so get them while you can. And buying directly from Google also means you can take advantage of its financing options, in case the price tag is still a little out of your budget.

When you think of protecting your home from disaster, what crosses your mind? Fire? Burglary? Natural disasters? Water damage often gets forgotten until the day you walk home, and your basement is flooded. Smart water monitors were created to prevent these very situations. leakSMART is our pick for best smart water monitoring solution, as it can detect leaks throughout your home and automatically shut off your water in the event of a leak, all for a lot less than the competition.
- Best Overall: leakSMART leak detection starter kit
- Upgrade Choice: Flo by Moen Smart Water Shutoff
- Best for Businesses and Large Homes: Phyn Plus Smart water assistant + shutoff
- Best for Just Monitoring: Flume Water Monitor
- Best for Rentals: Streamlabs Smart Home Water Monitor
- Best on a Budget: Dome Home Automation Water Shut-Off Valve
- Best Budget Leak Detector: Govee Wi-Fi Water Leak Detector
Best Overall: leakSMART leak detection starter kit
The leakSMART leak detection starter kit includes a valve, sensor, and the hub that controls all of them. leakSMART utilizes an included Zigbee hub to communicate with all of its components, meaning it's not reliant on Wi-Fi being available to work fully. It'll also work with existing Zigbee sensors, so if you already have one, you can save money by just buying the leakSMART valve.
That main leakSMART valve gets installed directly on your main water line and can be controlled via the smartphone app, allowing you to turn off your water from anywhere. That's particularly great if a freeze or some other issue causes a leak at your home while you're away. Even if you can't get to your phone right away, leakSMART will automatically shut off the water within five seconds of a leak being detected, making this one amazing piece of technology that could potentially save you thousands of dollars.
Unlike some other sensors though, leakSMART relies on wireless sensors placed around your home to detect leaks instead of monitoring the water right from the valve. These battery-powered wireless units can be placed underneath bathroom sinks, behind the dishwasher or washing machine, or in the HVAC closet to detect leaks from appliances that wouldn't necessarily show up from just a water pressure difference in the pipes.
Impressively, leakSMART has a battery backup system built-in making this the best value on the list. leakSMART's system works best in smaller homes. The Zigbee hub has a specified range, and if sensors are too far from the system, you'll run into communication issues. leakSMART sensors are also a bit pricey, so if you need more than a few, it makes more sense to choose a system like Flo by Moen.
Pros:
- Most affordable system with a shutoff valve
- Built-in battery backup
- Can shut off water to the home in case of water leaks
- Several options for different pipe sizes
- Comes with Zigbee hub
Cons:
- Shut-off valve can be complicated to install
- Single hub might not have great wireless range
- Sensors can get expensive
- No water flow statistics

Covers all the basics for less cash.
leakSMART helps you monitor your home's plumbing and shuts off water in an emergency, all without costing a lot.
Upgrade Choice: Flo by Moen Smart Water Shutoff
Flo by Moen isn't just a single product; it's a family of devices that are designed to detect water leaks anywhere they could happen in your home. In addition to the in-line Flo by Moen device that attaches to your main water line, Flo offers a Smart Water Detector that goes under sinks and behind large appliances to help detect leaks in all sorts of places.
These additional sensors are vital to catching every possible leak scenario, as there's no way for a water pressure detector to know that the bathtub is overflowing or the washing machine is leaking if it's not coming from a problematic pipe. In addition to that, Flo by Moen can be equipped with an optional battery backup unit, ensuring that water monitoring doesn't stop when the power goes out. This can be particularly important during severe weather when the power goes out, as monitoring for broken or frozen pipes can still occur, and water can be shut off in the event of an emergency situation.
The Flo by Moen app aggregates all the data from the Flo devices in your home and presents them in one easy-to-use dashboard, including the ability to shut off water to your home with the touch of a button. Flo by Moen also suggests handy tips for reducing water consumption and specializes in conservation, helping you reduce the price of water bills over time. The FloProtect service is an additional annual cost. Still, it offers supplemental insurance coverage, live support, and a host of ways to view your data and make your home more efficient.
Pros:
- Can shut off water to the home in case of water leaks
- Additional household sensors
- Battery backup option
- Several options for different pipe sizes
Cons:

More options
Flo by Moen is the most versatile leak detection system on the market. It's worth the cost, but you will end up paying more.
Best for Businesses and Large Homes: Phyn Plus Smart water assistant + shutoff
Phyn Plus is the most expensive single product on this list, but you get what you pay for. Phyn Plus is installed on the main water line going into your house, and, because of this, it's recommended that you get a professional plumber to install it for you. While the initial cost of Phyn Plus is substantially more than other options here, there's no subscription model to get to your data, which means a lower cost of ownership in the long-run.
Phyn Plus can be used to monitor not just the pipes in your house, but also the pipes for the irrigation system in your yard. Phyn Plus also uses an ultrasonic flow meter to detect leaks and frozen pipes, resulting in more accurate detection than other methods. Phyn Plus is weather hardened and can withstand extremely hot or cold temperatures. It also has no moving parts, giving this product a long lifespan.
The built-in shutoff valve can be configured to automatically shut off your water in the event of a detection, or via more manual methods like the smartphone app or the physical valve on the Phyn Plus. Phyn Plus supports up to 1.25-inch pipes, so if you have a larger home or commercial property with pipes larger than this, the upcoming Phyn XL is what you'll need. The biggest downside to Phyn Plus is the lack of a battery backup solution, but the unit doesn't require power to allow water to flow, just to collect data. That means, in the event of a power outage, you won't be without the flow of water.
Pros:
- Can shut off water in case of leaks
- Monitors the whole home including irrigation systems
- No additional subscription costs
- No moving parts means longer lifespan
Cons:
Best for Businesses and Large Homes
Phyn Plus Smart water assistant + shutoff
The most reliable one
Phyn Plus has most reliable and accurate readings around, especially for your large home or business.
Best for Just Monitoring: Flume Water Monitor
Flume Water Monitor is an excellent product for people who don't want to spend a lot and don't want a complicated installation. There's no need to cut into pipes or hire a plumber. Flume attaches to the outside of your main water meter and is said to be compatible with 95% of water systems found in homes. Since it attaches to the main water line, it can monitor both the water lines inside your home and the ones found in your yard for the irrigation system.
That makes Flume one of the easiest and most affordable ways to ensure your home's water pipes are operating normally. Flume's app delivers notifications when a problem is detected, but it also monitors water usage and helps you determine better ways to conserve water and lower your utility bill. Flume has deep hooks into Alexa and can be controlled by Amazon's popular virtual assistant, helping you link up additional smart home products for better home control.
The biggest downside to Flume's design is that it can't turn off your water in the event of an emergency; it can only alert you to the problem.
Pros:
Cons:
Best for Just Monitoring
Flume Water Monitor
Affordable and easy
Flume monitors your home's plumbing without the need for cutting those pipes or complicated installation.
Best for Rentals: Streamlabs Smart Home Water Monitor
Living in a rental usually means one big thing: no modifications of the household structure like walls or pipes. That knocks most of the products off this list, but not the Streamlabs Smart Home Water Monitor. Steamlabs designed its water monitor to strap to the outside of any pipe easily and effectively monitor your home or rental home's pipes. Steamlabs utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect water movement and volume, and can accurately detect changes in pressure or flow.
That allows the Streamlabs Smart Home Water Monitor to detect freezing pipes, leaking pipes, and to account for metrics and other vital statistical data to help save you money on water usage. When you leave home, you can set the unit to away mode, which will alert you if there is any water usage in the home when there shouldn't be. Streamlabs also has an additional subscription service that will provide more historical data, as well.
The real value isn't just the inexpensive price tag; it's the peace of mind that monitoring water leaks will bring you and your landlord. It will not only protect their property from water damage, but it'll also keep your belongings safe from the terrible damage that leaks and broken pipes can cause. While it won't shut off the water in the event of a leak, it's likely your landlord wouldn't let you work on the plumbing anyway.
Pros:
- Ultra-simple snap-on installation
- No need to remove pipes or do any plumbing
- Monitoring and historical data via the app
- More affordable up-front
Cons:
Best for Rentals
Streamlabs Smart Home Water Monitor
Water monitoring without the hassle
Streamlabs offers leak and frozen pipe alerts without the expense or complicated installation. Your landlord will love you for it.
Best Budget Shut-Off Valve: Dome Home Automation Water Shut-Off Valve
While it won't study the flow of your water for leaks or gives you advanced statistics about your water usage, Dome Home Automation Water Shut-Off Valve will shut your water off in case of an emergency. Dome created a rather unique mechanical solution that doesn't require any pipe cutting or complicated installation. Instead, it simply fits onto the pipe where your existing manual water shut-off valve is and, when requested via any connected smart home app, the Dome Home shut-off valve will turn the knob as if you were shutting the water off yourself.
Dome integrates seamlessly with popular smart home control systems like Wink, SmartThings, Home Seer, Nexia, and many other hubs, making it easy to integrate right into the smart home you already have. Dome sells its own automated leak sensors, but since this system integrates so nicely with other smart home systems, you could easily opt for a less expensive set of leak detectors for your sinks and other appliances and save a few bucks. Dome Home relies on a Z-Wave hub for communication to your home's network and other smarthome devices, so you'll need to purchase something like a Wink Hub in order for this to work.
Pros:
- Very affordable
- Integrates seamlessly into smart home control systems
- Easy installation for a shut-off valve
- No need to cut pipes
Cons:
Best on a Budget

Saving you cash while saving your home
When an emergency happens, Dome Home can get that water shut off in a flash, all without cutting into your pipes.
Best Budget Leak Detector: Govee Wi-Fi Water Leak Detector
Sometimes you just need the basics, and that's where Govee has your back. For around 50 bucks, you get a three-pack of Govee water detection sensors and a wireless hub for Wi-Fi communication with your sensors. These battery-powered sensors are fully wireless and can be placed anywhere that you might expect a leak to happen, like underneath the bathroom sink, inside the HVAC closet, or behind the water heater. All sensors hook up to the wireless hub, and all that data is aggregated with the app on your smartphone.
Additional sensors can be purchased for around less than you'd think and can easily be placed in any location where you might have leaks. Between the loud alarm and the smartphone notifications, you'll be notified of a leak the second it happens without delay. It won't stop the water flowing, but it can help you take action the moment a leak starts and before it can cause real damage.
Pros:
Cons:

Govee Wi-Fi Water Leak Detector
Cover your sinks, tubs, and toilets
When all you need is a simple way to detect leaks under sinks, appliances, or near pipes, Govee has your back.
Bottom line
Protecting your home doesn't just mean locking the doors and ensuring that your fireplace has been extinguished at night; it also means making sure your pipes don't burst and flood portions of your house. Water damage is much more likely than a fire or burglary to happen to a home, so it makes sense to purchase a product that can help mitigate disaster without much hassle.
Most folks will find that the leakSMART leak detection starter kit does everything they need for a lot less cash. It monitors your water every day and not only provides useful statistics via a smartphone app, but it also ensures there are no water pressure issues in your home. It can also shut off water to your whole home in case of an emergency, making it an invaluable investment into your most valuable asset.

Working from home can be great, assuming you approach it the right way. Whether your job is 100% remote or your company is shifting to remote work as a temporary thing, having a good office desk and other office equipment is essential to staying productive and having an enjoyable workday. If you're shopping for a new desk, there are lots of excellent ones out there that are selling for shockingly low prices. Here are a few of our favorites!
- Our favorite: FURINNO Econ Multipurpose Desk

- Tuck it in the corner: SHW L-Shaped Home Office Corner Desk
- As cheap as it gets: FURINNO Efficient Computer Desk
- Lots of cabinet space: INTERGREAT Office Desk

Our favorite: FURINNO Econ Multipurpose Desk
We're happy to recommend any of the desks on this list, but if we were to pick one as the best overall, it'd have to be the FURINNO Econ Multipurpose Desk. We'll mention FURINNO a few times today, but the Econ desk stands out for a few reasons. It's offered in a ton of different finishes, there's a slide-out drawer for your keyboard, and the various platforms/surfaces give you ample ways to organize your gear. We also love the included cubby on the bottom!
Keep it simple: SHW Home Office Large Desk
If you'd rather have something a bit more simple, you can't go wrong with this desk from SHW. You won't find any drawers or cubbies here. Instead, it's just a flat 55-inch surface of workspace for you to use however you see fit. The steel frame allows it to be nice and stable, there are two grommets to keep your various cords orderly, and assembly should be quite simple. You can get it in Espresso, Cherry, Grey, or Walnut — all of which look fantastic.
Tuck it in the corner: SHW L-Shaped Home Office Corner Desk
SHW makes a few different desks, another one of which is this L-shaped option. The desk comes in Espresso, Walnut, or Oak colors, with the L design allowing for two 51-inch surfaces to do all of your work. That's a lot of room, so the fact that you're getting so much at this price is rather remarkable. We're big fans of the included cable organizer, open shelves for storing books/binders, and easy assembly.
As cheap as it gets: FURINNO Efficient Computer Desk
All of the desks we're talking about come with competitive price tags, but if you're trying your very hardest to spend as little as possible, you can't ignore the FURINNO Efficient Computer Desk. This isn't the most impressive desk around, but for how little you're paying, it's an incredible value. It's compact enough to fit in just about any room easily, has a few different shelves for storing all of your goodies, and FURINNO has a multitude of finishes available.
Lots of cabinet space: INTERGREAT Office Desk
Depending on the kind of job you have, you might need a desk that allows you to store a bunch of files and paperwork easily. If that's the case, INTERGREAT's desk fits the bill nicely. It comes with two drawers that offer ample storage space, making it possible to keep everything tucked away without compromising your organization. The top of the desk has scratch-resistant tempered glass for a premium look/feel, and the 46-inch surface should be plenty for most folks.
Industrial design: Flash Furniture Clifton Computer Desk
Another small and simple desk that's worth a look is the Flash Furniture Clifton Computer Desk. Right off the bat, the thing that catches our eye the most is the industrial design. The emphasis on metal for the design is a very distinct look, and it's one we think is quite nice. There are a total of three surfaces to work with, Flash Furniture has Black and White colors available, and the price is right. In other words, it's definitely worth checking out.
No tools required: Convenience Concepts Modern Desk
The Convenience Concepts Modern Desk is a pretty straightforward desk, but the execution is top-notch. Convenience Concepts has a myriad of finishes available, each one giving the desk a very distinct appearance. Storage is aplenty, including the main 47.25-inch desk, a section below that for storage, and four shelves for whatever else you have. The kicker? The entire thing can be assembled without any tools.
Rustic look: TOPSKY 55-Inch Computer Desk with Bookshelf
Employing a gorgeous, rustic look made from engineered wood, this desk has a large desktop surface for getting work done and multitasking. A neat bookshelf underneath is perfect for storing notebooks, texts, and other items. It's a great spot to store a wireless keyboard when you aren't using it as well. It comes with a neat metal grommet hole cable cover for keeping charging cables neatly running at the back and out of sight.
Stay standing: FEZIBO Height Adjustable Electric Standing Desk
It isn't the cheapest on the list, but there's a reason to spend a bit extra: you can stay healthy and stretch by swapping from a seated to a standing position while you work using this height adjustable desk. It can adjust from 27.36 inches up to 46.06 inches using four preset buttons and keep favorite settings in memory so you can switch throughout the day to spend some time standing as well. Made with an industrial-grade steel frame, it has a large workspace for all of your essentials and is easy to assemble.
Love working from home without spending a ton of cash
Working from home doesn't have to be stressful. In fact, if you have the right gear, it can be very enjoyable. A good desk is essential to this, and if you want one that's easy on the wallet, the FURINNO Econ Multipurpose Desk is an easy buy.
When it comes to budget office desks, this one has it all. It's relatively compact, has plenty of workspace, and convenient storage options. Thanks to the various colors/finishes FURINNO offers; you can find one that works perfectly with your home decor.
Should you need more room to stay on top of your game, another great choice is the SHW L-Shaped Home Office Corner Desk. This might be overkill for some of you, but for others, the added real-estate will be just what you need to work efficiently and productively.
Finally, we want to mention once again the Convenience Concepts Modern Desk. Not only does the desk look great while offering tons of storage, but the fact that you can install it without having to mess with any tools is a dream come true.

- Facebook will continue to support the Oculus Quest for the foreseeable future with new games and apps.
- The Oculus Quest 2 will deliver higher-resolution, more detailed experiences with new and old games, similar to how a PS4 Pro or Xbox One X works.
- The Oculus Quest 2 will eventually receive exclusive next-generation VR games, but there's no current timeline for when this move will happen.
Thinking about sitting out the Oculus Quest 2 for a little while? Happy with your Oculus Quest? Don't worry, because you won't be missing out on all the great new games coming for a while, at least, according to an interview on UploadVR with Chris Jurney, Head of Developer Strategy at Facebook. The Oculus Quest will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future, with the Oculus Quest 2 receiving enhanced versions of Quest games, similarly to how the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro operate.
There's a lot of folks (with an Oculus Quest) and we and developers are super motivated to support those customers.
Chris Jurney, Head of Developer Strategy at Facebook
Facebook's strategy echoes the playbook being used by both Microsoft and Sony with this new generation of consoles. Older hardware is still being supported for a period of time (at least one year, in the Xbox One's case), and that seems to be the case with the Oculus Quest, as well. The Oculus Quest 2 looks to provide a significant increase in horsepower, with some developers even issuing upgrade patches for games well ahead of the October 13th release date of the Oculus Quest 2.
As the industry begins to shift to a less hardware-restrictive view of gaming, more affordable hardware options are opening up earlier than ever. Consoles like the Xbox Series S are surprising many consumers with budget-friendly pricing for a next-generation console and, likewise, Facebook's announcement of the $299 Oculus Quest 2 was a huge surprise during last week's Facebook Connect.
Included with that, of course, are all the big games announced for the Quest platform, which includes the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2. While it's not clear just how big of a leap we might see once games are exclusively built for the Oculus Quest 2, the huge jump in visual clarity and environment quality with the initial round of patches (Red Matter, Gravity Lab) certainly bodes well for anyone investing in the Oculus Quest 2 right now and in the future.

August has taken this definition to heart with the design of the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock, a fourth-generation product that's chock full of convenience features that actually make this lock feel smart.
The significant changes this time around include a considerable reduction in size when compared to previous generation August Smart locks, approximately 45% to be exact. On top of that, August has finally included the Wi-Fi chipset inside the lock itself. That means that, unlike previous-generation August smart locks, you won't need a Z-Wave hub to connect it to the Internet.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
As has been the case for all August Smart Locks, the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock doesn't replace your entire deadbolt. Instead, the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock replaces your interior deadbolt thumbturn only. The auto-locking and unlocking features are a godsend in many regards and make this lock feel simply brilliant in most circumstances. It's just a shame that Google Pixel owners likely won't find this feature very useful, as it doesn't work reliably with those phones.
August Wi-Fi Smart Lock
Bottom line: The August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is the perfect solution if you want to keep your existing keys but just want to add some smarts to your door. It's significantly smaller than previous generations and offers the same great features, all without requiring a Wi-Fi bridge to connect to the Internet.
The Good
- Wi-Fi connectivity built-in (no hub required)
- Smaller, sleeker design is easy to use
- Can be installed over your existing deadbolt
- Door Sense knows when the door is open or closed
- Automatic locking/unlocking
- Biometric remote unlocking security
The Bad
- No local protocol support (Z-Wave, etc.)
- Auto-locking/unlocking can be finicky with some phones
Reface, don't replace
August Wi-Fi Smart Lock: What I like
One of the biggest selling points of August smart locks for generations has been the ability to add intelligence to your existing deadbolt without replacing it. While it's not quite as simple as slapping the new hardware onto the old lock, August's included hardware adapters make it easy to pop off the old screws, drop the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock into place, and screw it right back in the same place the old thumbturn was.
It turned my scrappy old basement door into a thing of beauty.
It's a seemingly non-intrusive way to upgrade your lock without going through all the hassle of replacing the entire thing. It's also a great way to add intelligence to a rental home or apartment, as it leaves the keyed deadbolt outside while improving on what's used on the other side of the door. On top of that, the design of the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is super sleek and a further improvement upon the more industrial looks of the first three generations, but more on that later.
Another brilliant feature is Door Sense, which allows the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock to understand when the door has been completely closed and when it's open (or just ajar). Door Sense can be installed inside of the door frame or attached to the outside of the frame with included adhesive tape. This seemingly small but immensely important feature will give you peace of mind that other smart locks simply cannot. That's because it guarantees that you know that the door isn't just locked; it's also fully closed.
Now, these two big selling points aren't new to the August Smart Lock family. What is new, however, is the inclusion of a Wi-Fi chip right inside of the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock. That's a stark contrast to the first three generations of August Smart Lock, which only featured a Z-Wave radio inside and needed an external hub to connect to the Internet. That Wi-Fi chip inside means that the only thing you'll need to install in your home is the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock. No extra hub, no additional configuration, and no extra power port or Ethernet cable that needs to be set up.
August Wi-Fi Smart Lock Get a grip on great design
If you already own one August Smart Lock, you'll immediately notice just how much smaller the new August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is. At 45% smaller than the first three-generation products, the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is a gorgeous device that will look great on your exterior doors. Designed by world-renowned Swiss designer Yves Béhar, the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock looks similar enough to the original to be immediately recognizable as an August Smart Lock but different enough to be a noticeable improvement upon the original design.
If it weren't for the new smaller size, I wouldn't be able to use it on this door.
A new ribbed grip adorns the entire circular facade of the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock, which, in conjunction with the massive size decrease, makes the lock significantly easier to use than previous generations. In fact, thanks to these two important design changes, the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock was more pleasant to use on my door than the deadbolt thumbturn that it replaced. It's kind of weird to think about locking or unlocking a door as a pleasing experience, but the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock made every operation an enjoyable one.
Physical operation is only a small part of the experience, and, if you're using the lock in conjunction with your favorite virtual assistant or smart home service, you may not even physically turn the lock most of the time. If you're using the auto-lock and unlock functions, you may not ever even have to touch your phone at all. The August Home app can utilize your phone's location to automatically lock your door when you drive away and unlock your door when you arrive home. It works brilliantly with most phones and is probably the most convincing use of the term "smart" I've seen in a smart home product.
The August Home app is as pleasant and simple as ever to use.
The August Home app is as pleasant and simple as ever to use, and it makes managing an August-filled smart home an easy task. The lock is front and center the moment you open the app, and you'll be able to clearly identify the door and lock's status in a single glance. A filled red circle means the door is shut and locked, while a hollow green circle indicates the door is closed and unlocked. Tapping the circle in the app will change the lock's status in an instant and, thanks to the new biometric authentication support, can even be required to make sure that you are actually you before the remote operation takes place.
That's a vitally important role to play in smart home security, as it provides a genuinely secure biometric-level of 2-factor authentication for your home's most important security tool: the door locks. You can even link it to Google Assistant and lock or unlock the door, making it simple to open your door without scrounging around for keys. When unlocking via Google Assistant, you'll be required to give Google a security PIN, ensuring that even if someone were to somehow get into your Google account, they couldn't unlock your door without the secondary PIN code.
A snag in the setup
August Wi-Fi Smart Lock: What I don't like
The setup process, as a result of the simplified hardware, is easier than ever. Once you've physically installed the lock on your door, you'll open the August Home app and run through the setup steps. Setup is literally as easy as removing the battery tab on the lock, opening the app, and selecting the lock it finds. It'll be automatically added to your August account, and, from there, you can configure any additional features you want.
Now here's the deal, and it's going to be quite a raw deal for some people: the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock doesn't play nice with Google Pixel phones. August has had this issue for some time now, and it's a result of some sort of incompatibility between the Bluetooth chips Google uses and the ones August uses. I have several phones in my possession, and I can confirm that none of the Google Pixel phones (Pixel 1, 3, and 4) could finish setting up the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock.
The August Wi-Fi Smart Lock doesn't play nice with Google Pixel phones.
Summarily, every other phone I tested had no issues getting the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock set up the first time. iPhone, Samsung, LG, you name it, they all worked just fine. The Pixels also couldn't set up the automatic unlocking feature either, and it's because of the same issue. After speaking with an August representative, it was made clear that the problem here resides on Google's end and is entirely out of August's control.
Once the lock is set up, manually locking and unlocking the lock from your Pixel phone will work perfectly through the app. If you want to test out the automatic unlocking and locking features, just expect some wildly inconsistent results if you've got a Pixel phone. Regardless of who is at fault, the fact of the matter is that Pixel owners are going to have a tough time using this lock to its full potential.
Lastly, if you're already invested in an August Smart Lock ecosystem, it's worth noting that this unit doesn't have any support for the Z-Wave protocol. While this likely won't affect many buyers in any way, folks who have deeply invested in smart homes up to this point might find that the newest lock doesn't function as quickly or reliably with their existing hub setups, simply because it requires a Wi-Fi connection to operate.
The competition
If you're looking to keep your existing deadbolt key and just add some smarts to it, Open Sesame is the most straightforward way to do it. Unlike August Smart Locks, Open Sesame actually does sit right over the top of your existing deadbolt's thumbturn and requires zero tools for the installation. It's also quite a bit cheaper at $150, but its more limited range of compatibility with locks might reduce the chances of it working in your home.
If you're looking to ditch the keys all together, the Nest x Yale Smart Lock is the best way to go. For the same price as the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock, you'll be getting an entire deadbolt replacement that completely changes the look and functionality on the inside and outside of your door. The keyless entry system can be activated through the app or with the keypad on the outside. The biggest downside, other than the more complicated installation, is that it only works with Google Assistant.
August Wi-Fi Smart Lock: Should you buy
You should buy this if ...
You're not ready or able to ditch the keys
While it does require some installation, the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is designed to be installed over your existing deadbolt hardware instead of replacing it. The only part of the deadbolt that gets replaced is the thumbturn, which is generally held in place by one or two screws. Unscrew those, pop the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock on in its place, and screw it in. You'll still have your keys as a backup, or if there's a need for the maintenance crew to head into your dwelling.
You don't want to deal with annoying smart home hubs
The August Wi-Fi Smart Lock has Wi-Fi built right into the lock, as the name suggests. Unlike previous generations of August Smart Locks, you won't need a hub to connect this one to the Internet. That's great for anyone wanting a simpler setup and fewer gadgets to have plugged in around the home.
You want a smart lock that actually feels smart
Automatic locking and unlocking is a game-changer that truly makes the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock feel more than just smart; it feels brilliant. The August Home app also packs in some of the most intelligent security features I've ever seen in a smart home gadget, including the ability to restrict remote unlocking to biometric authentication. That means that even if someone steals your phone and tries to use it to unlock your house, they won't be able to because the phone can't authenticate against their face or fingerprint.
You should not buy this if ...
You have a Google Pixel phone
We're a Google Pixel household, and, while I love the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock's many intelligent features, it's operation is super unreliable with Google's own brand of phones. Even if you manage to get the lock setup with another phone or device, you won't be able to use one of the absolute best features reliably. If auto-locking or unlocking doesn't interest you, this is much less of a negative point.
You want to stop using keys completely
August designed its locks to augment the traditional deadbolt. That's evidenced by the fact that August also sells replacement deadbolts that perfectly fit the styling of the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock. At the end of the day, however, the physical key is still the backup of choice for August. If that's not something you want, this isn't the lock for you.
You have a bunch of Z-Wave devices
While building in Wi-Fi connectivity is a huge plus for many people, some folks are deeply invested in Z-Wave smart home ecosystems and have lots of automation built around that technology. If this is you and you absolutely need all of your automations to work even if there's an Internet or Wi-Fi outage in your home, you should check out one of the other August Smart Locks.
The August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is the ideal evolution of the quality experience we've come to know and love from August. It lets you keep your existing deadbolt and keys yet, somehow, blows other smart locks out of the water with its advanced functionality. But it's not just great features like automatic locking and unlocking that are sure to impress you regularly; it's also excellent app design and biometric security that totally seals the deal. The only downside is if you've got a Google Pixel phone where the experience is, unfortunately, an unreliable one.
August Wi-Fi Smart Lock
Bottom line: The August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is a joy to use every day, and, thanks to the automatic locking and unlocking, you may never even have to operate the lock again manually. That new, smaller size also means it's going to fit better on many doors, and it's a lot easier to use because of that, too.

If you're already a fan of the Note lineup, then you'll have a lot to be excited about with the new generation. If you aren't a fan, you should be. The phones have all the latest from Samsung, including a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ processor, a triple camera setup, 5G connectivity, and a new and improved S Pen stylus.
Being brand new, these phones are going to set you back a penny or two, but we're on top of that. With sales like Black Friday just around the corner, it's no doubt we'll be seeing more offers on the Note 20 soon. We've got every place you can find the Note 20 (or the Note 20 Ultra) and every deal available right now.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 5G | $799 at Amazon
The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 5G device is also $200 off at Amazon currently. Choose between Mystic Bronze, Mystic Gray, and Mystic Green while supplies last.
The Note 20 starts at $1,000 and the Note 20 Ultra starts at $1,300. The more you add, like extra storage, the more you're going to pay. Obviously investing in a new phone, especially one as advanced as the Note 20, is not a super cheap proposition. Given all the features on these phones, though, it's tough to imagine there's anything but that high price holding you back.
You can cut into both of those prices by finding the right carrier, making a switch to save some money, or even trading in your older phone for a few bucks off your new one. One thing to look out for is bundled deals. Samsung released a lot of other new products, like the Galaxy Buds Live true wireless earbuds, alongside the Note 20. It would not be surprising to see the smartphone bundled with the earbuds at a discount eventually.
Where to Find the Note 20
This section is less about deals and more about "Please, I need one now, I can't find one, where can I find one?" With a phone this popular, and the current supply issues we've seen pestering other popular tech devices as a result of COVID-19, we may see the Note 20 have a hard time staying in stock a lot of the time. If you're out there just scrounging around for your chance to own this phone you've been looking forward to, here's everywhere we know you can find one right now.
Note 20 or Note 20 Ultra at Verizon
Verizon has monthly payment plans for device purchases so you could pay $41.66 monthly for the Note 20 or $54.16 per month for the Note 20 Ultra. You also have the option of paying the full price of either phone to own the device of your choice instantly.
Note 20 or Note 20 Ultra at AT&T
With a 30-month commitment, you'll pay $33.34 a month for the Note 20, $43.34 a month for the Note 20 Ultra 128GB, or $48.34 a month for the Note 20 Ultra 512GB. You can even snag the Note 20 for $10/month right now by trading in an eligible device and adding a line on select Unlimited plans, or the Note 20 Ultra for $20/month with the same terms.
Note 20 or Note 20 Ultra at Samsung
Go straight to the source. Samsung has both phones. You can choose to get either one unlocked or through a specific carrier. Plus, there are ways to save through Samsung, too, including up to $650 off via trade-in.
Best Note 20 Unlocked Deals
Between unlocked and carrier deals, the former tend to have a lot more options just because carriers have lots of ways to save between sending you gift cards, offering trade-in programs, and doing "buy one, get one"-type discounts. Carrier deals often mean long-term commitments and monthly bills, though, too. If you'd rather avoid that and just pay for everything upfront, these are the best unlocked deals available right now.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 5G | $799 at Amazon
The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 5G device is also $200 off at Amazon currently. Choose between Mystic Bronze, Mystic Gray, and Mystic Green while supplies last.
Note 20 | Up to $650 off via trade-in at Samsung
To get the max savings on this trade-in program, your phone will have to be fairly recent and have a good screen. Older phones get less, but you'll still save as much as $350 even on older generations. A cracked screen reduces the maximum savings to $400 even for newer phones.
Note 20 Ultra | Up to $650 off with trade-in at Samsung
Save up to $650 on the Note 20 Ultra when you trade-in an eligible device at Samsung. Even devices with cracked screens can earn you up to $400.
Best Note 20 Carrier Deals
Carrier deals generally require a commitment between 18 and 36 months (most often just 24). The "savings" also usually come in the form of a promo credit applied to your monthly bill over the course of that commitment. So these deals tend to be a bit more long-term than other deals, but you also have the potential to save a whole lot more over that time period. If you're a long-term thinker, you should feel good about the opportunities for saving here.
$10/month Note 20 at AT&T
Buy the Note 20 on a 30-month installment plan, sign up for AT&T Unlimited, and trade-in an eligible smartphone to get a credit applied to your monthly bill which brings its price down to just $10 monthly. You can also complete the same steps with the Note 20 Ultra to snag one for $20/month.
Up to $650 off via trade-in at Samsung
To get the max savings on this trade-in program, your phone will have to be fairly recent and have a good screen. Older phones get less, but you'll still save as much as $350 even on older generations. A cracked screen reduces the maximum savings to $400 even for newer phones.
Up to $550 off via trade-in at Verizon
If you're upgrading to the Note 20, trade-in your old device and get up to $550 off as long as you're upgrading on a select Unlimited plan. You can also score a $250 Verizon gift card when switching from another carrier.
Buy one, get one $700 off at Verizon
Another option now available at Verizon lets you score two of the Galaxy Note 20 devices at a major $700 discount! You'll need to add one of the phones as a new smartphone line on select Unlimited plans, including Above, Beyond, Do, Play, or Get Unlimited. You can also score $500 in Verizon gift cards with this offer when switching to Verizon from another carrier.
Buy one, get one free at T-Mobile
T-Mobile is offering you the Galaxy Note 20 or Note 20 Ultra for free when you purchase one at regular price and add two lines of service for your new devices.
Note 20 Price Tracking
The first deals we'll see on the Note 20 are incentive deals. The "We know you're going to buy it, so buy it here" sort of deals that probably won't save you a whole lot but will be designed to make you pick Place A over Place B. You also can expect to see major carriers offering deals that don't really save you money on the phone but could save you money in other ways, like if you buy one Note 20 you can buy another Galaxy phone and get that one discounted (sometimes up to $1,000 off). The trick to tracking prices is really how do you compare all the different little incentives these companies have? What's better, $1,000 as a promo credit over the course of 24 months or $700 off right now with a trade-in? Are you even eligible for the trade-in? Do you want it unlocked instead, and are you willing to pay a lot more upfront for that? What sort of deals can you expect in that case?
All of these deals are good in one way or the other, and there will be some that speak more to your situation than others. We keep an eye on the deals as they arise and drop them all in here for you to decide. The great thing about the Galaxy Note 20 being so popular is that deals will not be rare. Pick your favorite carrier, make a switch to a new one, or abandon the multi-month commitment altogether with an Unlocked phone. The choice is yours.
Note 20 vs. Note 20 Ultra: Which one should you buy?
Despite being a part of the same lineup, these two phones actually have a lot of differences. Despite having the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ processor, AMOLED displays, a few extras like 5G connectivity, and similarities in the design and aesthetics, the Note 20 Ultra brings a lot more to the table. In particular, the Ultra has a resolution of 3088 x 1440 with a 120Hz refresh rate compared to the Note 20's 2400 x 1080 pixel resolution and 60Hz refresh rate. The Ultra has a much more advanced triple camera system and a larger battery. Of course, as should be expected, it also costs more. The deals will probably favor the Note 20 more overall, too.

eero
The name you know
Google Wifi
Both Google Wifi and eero are excellent entry-level mesh Wi-Fi systems and each delivers on their main promise — better Wi-Fi throughout your home. Eero takes the lead thanks to having a wider variety of expansion options as well as competing directly within Google Wifi's price point.
Google Wifi vs. eero The need to know details
Internally, the Google Wifi units and eero units have similar hardware. The quad-core ARM CPU and 512MB of RAM don't seem like much, but it's more than sufficient to keep your Wi-Fi network running smoothly and send the information where it needs to go.
Both devices offer the basic networking control you'll need for your home network.
Both devices are focused on the user experience with consistent security and feature updates and great apps. They offer all the basic networking control you'd need for your home network and have additions like access control, easy-to-share passwords, guest networks, and device prioritization and pausing.
Wireless standards are quite similar to Google Wifi supporting 802.11AC, or Wi-Fi 5, in a dual-band configuration. While Google confidently states AC1200 speeds, Eero leaves that detail out but based on the hardware you should be able to expect similar speeds. Eero does only recommend this system for connections up to 550 Mbps.

Google Wifi vs. eero You can't go wrong with either option
Each system comes highly recommended; you can't go wrong here and we can't stress that enough.
The third-generation eero offers similar performance to Google Wifi and the prices are similar enough. They each offer similar upgrade paths as well with Google Wifi offering compatibility with the faster Nest Wifi routers and eero working with the faster eero Pro 6, eero 6, and unobtrusive eero Beacon.
You can't go wrong with either system.
Both a single eero and a single Google WiFi will cover approximately 1,500 square feet in a home. While this can seem significant, it's not 100% efficient and will broadcast more of a sphere around the router. Your secondary router will need to be within the range of this signal and will perform better with a fairly unobstructed line of sight. Luckily both of these systems will support many additional routers to improve your mesh. It's hard to know if you actually need a mesh system but if you have inconsistent coverage around your home, a mesh can fill in the weak spots more consistently than a powerful standalone router.
You'll need the Android or iOS app to set up either of these networks. Make sure to grab the Google Wifi app on Android or iOS or the eero app on Android or iOS before disconnecting your old network,
Google Wifi vs. eero Expanding Google Wifi
Expanding your Google Wifi mesh is as simple as it could be. Simply add in more Google Wifi routers or Nest Wifi routers and set them up in the app. As long as you have a connection to the rest of the mesh you are good to go. This can also be accomplished with an Ethernet cable if your home is already wired or you can run one further strengthening your mesh.
If you want to stick with the Google Wifi ecosystem but need a bit more speed, you should check out the newer and faster Nest Wifi compared to Google Wifi. If you need to expand an existing Nest Wifi setup, Google Wifi is a solid option, especially with its dual Ethernet ports.
Google Wifi vs. eero Expanding the eero family
The eero family has grown a lot recently with both older Wi-Fi 5 and newer Wi-Fi 6 options available. If you're looking to expand your existing eero system, this third-generation eero is a great choice with solid speeds and Ethernet ports on every box. Keep in mind that this eero isn't as fast as the older eero Pro models or either of the newer Wi-Fi 6 variations.
If you're building out a system of mixed eeros, do your best to keep the fastest router at the center connected directly to your modem. The remote mesh points will only ever be as fast as their source connection so chaining an eero Pro 6 to a base eero would be a waste of resources. The same goes for the eero 6 though the eero 6 extender cannot be used as a core router. Unless you plan to upgrade to an eero 6 or eero 6 Pro down the line, there's no benefit to getting the standalone eero 6 extender. You can get the eero Beacon as a compact extender though it is the slowest eero on sale including past eeros.
Google Wifi vs. eero Eero competes on price and wins on flexibility
It's quite possible to build a great mesh network with both Google Wifi and eero. In this situation, eero's added flexibility thanks to the other eero products makes it a more versatile router and a better value. Eero continues to be one of the best wireless routers you can get. With eero, it's even possible to upgrade to a tri-band or eero 6 setup later on if your needs change with this eero making a solid extender.

Keep your Eero out of harm's way with the best wall mounts
Having a mount for your Eero Wi-Fi router may not be the first thing on your mind, but it'll save you a lot of trouble in the long run. After all, who doesn't want to keep their Wi-Fi as safe as can be?Using one of the best free VPN services could end up bringing a lot of advantages to your daily work flow. Not everyone who uses a Virtual Private Network needs everything that a paid service offers, and often the free ones are enough to get by. We've compared the advantages between free VPNs vs. paid VPNs. If you're looking for the best VPN to use, we have you covered.
As of right now, we have ProtonVPN as the best free VPN option in 2020, followed closely by Hotspot Shield Free. With ProtonVPN, you get unlimited bandwidth on a single device when using the free plan, and Hotspot Shield also offers a generous data allotment and rich feature set.
Moving from a free VPN to a paid VPN will get you some feature enhancements, extra data allotments, and more. A VPN provider like Surfshark comes in at just $1.99 per month, which breaks down to just six cents per day. The feature set is strong, the apps are easy to use, and it provides great speeds. ExpressVPN is our top overall pick for VPN providers for most people, and we also highly recommend NordVPN.
Top Paid VPN Alternatives
- : 1. Surfshark VPN: Best affordable paid VPN option
- : 2. ExpressVPN: Best overall VPN for most people
- : 3. NordVPN: Top VPN with most server options
- : ProtonVPN Free
- : Hotspot Shield VPN
- : TunnelBear
- : Windscribe
- : Hide.me VPN
- : Speedify
1. Surfshark VPN: Best affordable paid VPN option
With plans starting out at about 8 cents per day, it's really hard to skip over Surfshark because it's a paid service. It offers a ton of great features that you'd expect from a VPN provider, and is super simple to use.
2. ExpressVPN: Best overall VPN for most people
3. NordVPN: Top VPN with most server options
NordVPN offers an insane amount of server locations that you can pick from and is one of the best services for unblocking streaming services. It's definitely the most well-known brand in the VPN space right now.
A VPN can add an extra layer of security to your phone, tablet, PC, and even gaming console. They've become increasingly popular over the past few years, and for good reason.
The best way to protect your data while you are out and about (and even when at home) is by using a VPN. With this, your data is routed through an extra server that makes it impossible for someone to spy on or intercept. There are lots of service options ranging in price from free to a couple bucks per month. There are lots of great options, with our top pick being Hotspot Shield followed closely by ProtonVPN. There are a few differences between each service, so let's break the best free VPN services down now.
1. ProtonVPN
Best security-focused free VPN
Bottom line: ProtonVPN is a Switzerland-based company that has a strong focus on security. The company makes a ultra-secure email app, and its VPN app has no shortage of features.
Data limit: Unlimited | Works on: Windows, Mac, Android, iOS | Servers available: 3 | 24/7 live chat support: No
Pros:
Cons:
ProtonVPN comes from the same folks that are behind ProtonMail which offers secure encrypted email. The company is based out of Switzerland and puts a security focus on everything it does. Where it stands out in the free VPN space is that there is actually no data limit each month, so you can use as much data while connected to the VPN as you desire, but there are a few other trade-offs that come along with it.
You can only use the free VPN service with a single device, and Proton limits the free plan to be able to select from only three server location. While there is no data limit for usage each month, Proton does deprioritize the speeds during peak times. This means that during evening hours and potentially over weekends, you could see things moving a little slower than you normally may during the day, though everything will still work as anticipated.
ProtonVPN does have a strict no logging policy, and you need nothing more than just an email address to get started with it. There are no ads on the website or any of the clients. Unfortunately, there is no P2P support.
If you find that the speeds during peak times are just a little too slow for you, it may be worth considering an upgrade, but for most the free package will do just fine.
ProtonVPN Free
From the creators of the secure and encrypted ProtonMail comes ProtonVPN. There are no data limits here, but free users are deprioritized in favor of paid ones during peak usage times.
2. Hotspot Shield VPN
Best free VPN provider overall
Bottom line: With a generous 500MB of data to use per day and one of the best-designed apps of the bunch, Hotspot Shield VPN is an option you don't want to sleep on.
Data limit: 500MB per day | Works on: Windows, Mac, Android, iOS | Servers available: 1 | 24/7 live chat support: No
Pros:
Cons:
Hotspot Shield is one of the few VPN companies that is offering both a free and paid version of its service, and it's one of our top picks for best free VPN. When a company offers both a free and paid tier, you usually expect the worst since it is incentivized to get you to jump up to a paid plan but Hotspot Shield offers free customers up to 500MB of data usage per day, the ability to connect five devices simultaneously, a one-click connection, and more.
With the daily limits, you max out at about 15GB total for the month which is one of the more generous allotments from a free VPN. if you do step up to the Elite version, that restriction is eliminated. On the free plan, you are also limited to just a few locations that the company selects for you, and there are ads. This isn't a huge problem in most situations, though.
One of the big selling points about Hotspot Shield is just how easy it is to use. Whether this is your first time using a VPN or you've used one for years, you'll be able to get set up in just a few minutes. The company offers a simple one-click connection, and the apps on both mobile and desktop are easy to navigate.
It's worth pointing out that, when you visit the Hotspot Shield site, it's not very clear how to sign up for the free plan. What you need to do is sign up for the 7-day trial of the Elite plan, which does require you to enter payment information, but after the seven days is over you can opt to continue using it for free. This makes it really easy if you ever wanted to upgrade to its paid offering to get more features and functionality.
If you want to get started with a VPN, we highly recommend Hotspot Shield, so give it a shot today.
Hotspot Shield VPN
This is one of our top recommendations for those looking for a free VPN. You do need to enter your credit card number, but the company won't charge you and you can use the service for free beyond the 7-day trial.
3. TunnelBear VPN
Best easy-to-use free VPN
Bottom line: Recent privacy policy changes require far less user data in order to sign up for the service. This Canadian-based company injects a little bit of bear-related humor in its VPN, but focuses on simplicity and privacy (both of which it nails).
Data limit: 500MB per month | Works on: Windows, Mac, Android, iOS | Servers available: 20+ | 24/7 live chat support: Yes
Pros:
Cons:
Like Hotspot Shield, TunnelBear offers both a free and paid tier, though its free offering is much more restrictive. Where you get 500mb per day on Hotspot Shield, with TunnelBear you are limited to just 500mb for the whole month, which is quite a small amount of data even for light users. Given how big web pages are getting, and auto-playing ads, etc. it's very easy to burn through that in just a single day. That being said, if you are someone who just wants to have a good VPN option on standby for occasional travel or public Wi-Fi surfing, TunnelBear's free plan might just fit the bill.
The company was acquired by McAfee in 2018 and there have been positive changes since then. Recently, some tweaks were made to its privacy policy so that even less data is collected from users (good news for a VPN). You no longer need to supply a name when signing up, and TunnelBear is ditching its record of how many connections you've made while using the service.
If you like the service and just need more data allowance, you can upgrade your account to a paid option. As well as giving you more data, it will also increase the number of countries available to connect to. Right now, you can sign up for TunnelBear's paid offerings for just $4.99 per month using our link, which is a massive 58% savings.
TunnelBear
The data limit is low, but if you are just looking to test the water or use it infrequently, TunnelBear is a great choice to consider.
4. Windscribe VPN
Best free VPN for earning extra bandwidth
Bottom line: There are a lot of key features available here and the pricing is pretty affordable each month. You can actually earn more free data each month by promoting the service on Twitter and referring your friends.
Data limit: 10GB per month | Works on: Windows, Mac, Android, iOS | Servers available: 10 | 24/7 live chat support: No
Pros:
- Generous 10GB data allotment
- Can earn more data from completing simple tasks
- Session data is erased 3 minutes after disconnecting
- Has built-in ad blocker and firewall
Cons:
Windscribe is a relative newcomer in the VPN space and the company has received a lot of attention lately. The base free plan offers 10GB of data per month, though we have seen promotions offering as much as 20GB periodically. There are other ways to score more data as well like referring a friend or tweeting about the service. If you refer someone who ends up signing up for a paid plan, Windscribe will even upgrade yours to an unlimited plan as well, which is a great bonus.
Just because it's free doesn't mean there are a lot of sacrifices when it comes to privacy and features. Windscribe doesn't store connection logs, IP stamps, nor a record of the sites you visited. For the time you're connected to a server, it does retain your username, but once you end the session, that data is erased within just three minutes. Did we mention there's also a built-in ad blocker and firewall?
What are you waiting for? Go ahead and give Windscribe a try now!
Windscribe
You can add to the healthy 10GB data allotment by tweeting your love for the Windscribe service and inviting friends. It's a great way to bring even more data to your free pool.
5. Hide.me
Best free VPN with tons of features
Bottom line: Hide.me offers almost all of the features you'd expect to find in a paid VPN but without any of the monthly cost. You get 10GB of data each month, and the company has 24/7 support in case you experience an issue.
Data limit: 10GB per month | Works on: Windows, Mac, Android, iOS | Servers available: 5 | 24/7 live chat support: Yes
Pros:
Cons:
Hide.me currently offers 10GB of data per month on its free plan which is five times what the company was recently offering. Limitations such as only being able to connect one device at a time and just five server locations available make it a little less useful depending on what your needs from a VPN are.
The company promises it does not keep logs of its users nor does it show ads which can be ways free VPN providers make their money from free users. Hide.me is a great way to get started with a VPN to see if it's the right fit for you, but may not be the best option for those who want to be able to connect to specific servers around the world or use a ton of data per month. You don't need to hand over payment information to try it out, either.
Hide.me VPN
You don't get a ton of data, but you aren't tracked and there are no logs to be found here. This is a solid choice for those in need of smartphone protection for when browsing while out and about.
6. Speedify
Best free VPN with fast speeds
Bottom Line: It's right in the name. Speed is the big focus here and the company uses some interesting technology to help keep it fast (and secure).
Data limit: 2GB per month | Works on: Windows, Mac, Android, iOS | Servers available: 50+ | 24/7 live chat support: No
Pros:
Cons:
No one wants to sit buffering and Speedify's main aim is to keep your VPN connection fast (in addition to an extra layer of security). Speedify claims that by using all of the available internet connections, including Ethernet and a tethered mobile connection it can offer faster "turbocharged" speeds.
With its free plan, you get access to Speedify's full range of servers from over 50 locations. That's the same as what the paid plan offers. The main restriction on free users is a 5GB data allowance for your first month which goes down to 1GB per month after that. If your main concer is maintaining speed, the free VPN plan is worht checking out to see if it works for you, though the strict data limit might be too much of a trade-off depending on your needs.
Speedify
It's a case of speed by name, speed by nature for Speedify. You also get all the great safety and security additions from other VPNs as though, so don't worry.
Depending on how much data you use on a daily or monthly basis, a free VPN may not be the way to go for you. Some premium VPN options are available for only a few bucks per month, so maybe you should consider giving up that next cup of coffee from Starbucks and securing your online life instead. For paid options, we highly recommend ExpressVPN. It offers fantastic customer support, an easy-to-use interface, unlimited data, and fast speeds. You also get a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there's no risk involved with trying it out for yourself now. It's a great combination of everything, and using our exclusive discount you can save on an annual plan and get an extra three months free.
You can also check out these fantastic VPN deals to help you save some cash on the premium services and we also rounded up the best cheap VPN services. If you don't want to pay, don't worry. Here are the best free VPN services in 2020.
What should you consider before using a free VPN?
The biggest thing you'll want to remember is that everything has a cost associated with it. Sure, we are talking about free VPN options here, but nothing in life is actually free, right? What you aren't paying for with real money you may be paying for with your personal data or usage habits.
You don't have to look far to see some VPN provider maliciously using customer data or storing things that the company says it doesn't, and at the same time there are a lot of companies that are doing great things and working hard to protect customers. Since you can't actually see what every company is doing with the data for yourself, you need to have trust in the protection that it offers and feel safe using it.
We've put together a list of a few things to consider when researching a new VPN. We've considered all of these when crafting the list above, and continue to think about them as we look at new options. Here are some things to think of when looking at options not included in our best free VPN list.
- What information is required to sign up? Some VPN providers want you to create an account that includes personal information like your name, email, and a password, while others will let you use the service without any information. As you'd imagine, the less information required, the better. It helps you stay annonymous to the service, and that's important.
- What is the business model? You'd be surprised at how much money it costs to maintain servers around the world, employ developers and customer support staff, and other general expenses. The money has to come from somewhere, and if you are using a free service, where is it coming from? Some of the companies offer very limited free plans in an attempt to convert the people to its paid offerings, while other companies will include ads in the apps or sell off user data to recover some of the profits. You don't want your data sold, so be sure to check into this before just signing up for a service.
- What sacrifice do you make by using the free plan? As mentioned above, on most of the plans there are large sacrifices when you opt to go with the free option. Some have insanely low data allotments available each month to free users while others will deprioritize the speeds of non-paying customers during peak times. For some, these sacrifices are well worth it, and for others it's a breaking point.
- Does the service log any data? Many VPNs say that they have a no-logging policy, but you'll want to read the terms to really understand what that means. It's important to ensure that the End User License Agreement (EULA) says that everything from each of your sessions is erased after it is disconnected. You don't want any remnants of it hanging around, because that's almost as bad as not being protected in the first place.
Beyond these key points, you'll also want to look into how many servers are available, and where they are located. If you're main focus is to be able to spoof your location to unlock geo-restricted content, it's critical to know where the servers are.
When should you ditch the free VPN and start paying for one?
The timing of when an upgrade from a free VPN to a paid option is different for each person. You'll want to take a look at your usage habits and whether you are happy with your overall experience or you feel features are lacking. If you are feeling like you could use more from the VPN that you are connecting to, then you'll want to strongly consider the upgrade.
Alternatively, if you are only using it while traveling or only connect for a few minutes here and there, then you could probably live with a free VPN forever. There's no right or wrong way to do it, it's really just a matter of what works best for you.
There's no line in the sand that you cross to know that you need to upgrade. This is something you'll want to consider when you become frustrated with the limitations of your current free plan, or when you see the benefit of a feature from the paid plan. Often times, the paid plans can be had for just a few dollars a month, so it may be worth just trying it out for a few months to see if it offers a better experience for you or not.
What can you use a free VPN for?
When using one of the best free VPN options, you can actually do many of the same things that you can do with the paid VPN counterparts. Feature-wise most of the offerings are quite similar, the differences come more in the little nuances between them all. You can still spoof your location, protect the data being transmitted from your device, and much more.
You make sacrifices like number of devices you can connect at the same time, sometimes the speed that the connection offers, and often the number of servers that you can pick from. Overall, the free VPN can be used for pretty much everything you'd expect to see a paid VPN provide.
We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:
1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).
2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad.

First off, there have been plenty of remastered and remade games that just didn't live up to the hype, and to be fair to developers, there is a fine line between preserving the aspects of a game fans loved while also improving it enough that new players can pick it up and enjoy without the nostalgia factor.
On top of having that difficult balance to strike, Square Enix set out to make this game across two consoles and two mobile app stores with seamless crossplay. The developers also wanted to provide a free or lite version that would allow players to try the game out while being able to join in with friends playing the full version. It was an ambitous undertaking to say the least, and is probably why it was delayed a couple of times to August 2020.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Luckily, I am happy to say that Square Enix and the team responsible for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition were largely successful. Sure, there are a few complaints, but on the whole, this game is a beautiful tribute to the original. It's fun and engaging, not to mention so very pretty.
At a glance
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition
Bottom line: This is an absolute must have for fans of the franchise, but also a fantastic game for those new to the series. Multiplayer and crossplay both work incredibly well, and offering both an inexpensive full version and a free lite version means everyone can play together, regardless of their device or budget.
The Good
- Preserves the spirit of the original
- Beautifully remastered graphics
- Incredible new and remastered music
- Online multiplayer and crossplay
- Free Lite version for newcomers
The Bad
- Solo play is extremely difficult
- Multiplayer requires a lot from every player
- Mobile controls are rough
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition — A labor of love

|Console||Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android|

Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles challenges you and a team of up to three others to seek out Myrrh, an enchanted liquid that can purify your town's Crystal, protecting you and everyone you care about for another year. You must work together and face a slew of monsters, all while unraveling the mysteries behind the Miasma that has covered your world and the Crystals that ward it off.
This is the action role-playing game that started a franchise, and these days, it seems like every game, cartoon, and story we loved as kids is getting a remake, reboot, or re-release. In many cases, these rehashes seem like a lazy way to cash in on nostalgia, but sometimes it's incredibly clear that the teams behind these creative endeavors truly love the source material. Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition is, without a doubt, one of these labor of love projects.
Even before the game launched, I was cautiously optimistic. Having loved the original and having a handful of kids who loved it even more, I've been following closely since it was first announced. However, seeing this particular Inside look left me especially hopeful. It shows the team loved the original even more than I did.
It has beautiful art and phenomenal music
While part of remastering games is updating the visuals and music, the team at Square Enix outdid itself with Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition, creating something that both feels like the original while looking and sounding new. The remastered graphics are so clean and crisp, like comparing standard definition on a tiny television to high definition on the big screen. For a game originally released in 2003 on the GameCube, this had to have been a real challenge, and yet, this team did a masterful job. The game is worth it for the artwork alone.
On top of remastering the existing graphics, all four Tribes have new designs as well. You can now choose from 10 different appearances for each Tribe when building your characters. You can build up to eight characters, each customized with a Tribe, appearance, gender, and job. While these additional appearances are new, the team designing them included the original creators, so they all fit into the aesthetic perfectly.
The artwork isn't alone. We also get to experience remastered versions of all the original, charming music, as well as brand new songs by the original composers. Having played more than my fair share of video games while also being a busy parent, I've lost count of the number of times a game was left on a menu and the same music played on repeat. I'm sure most gamers can relate on some level, getting a looped song stuck in their head.
The music in Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition is so good that I intentionally left the game on while working or cooking. I could listen to this for hours (and I have) without getting sick of it. It's charming and fits perfectly with the fantasy feel of this game.
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition Original Soundtrack
If you loved the music of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition as much as I did, this soundtrack is an absolute must have. Set to release on September 11, 2020, you can enjoy every beautifully remastered song, as well as new original songs over and over.
Online multiplayer and the Lite version mean everyone can play
When Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles orignally came out, video games were mostly played on consoles that weren't connected to the internet at all. Multiplayer meant gathering your siblings and/or friends in one room, plugging in multiple Game Boy Advances, and all playing on the same save file. Now, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition multiplayer is entirely online. This game supports crossplatform play, allowing you to join in with friends and strangers on the Nintendo Switch, the PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android.
Having played on all four, I am glad to say it actually works. Sure, there are going to be the occasional connection issue, and online multiplayer doesn't allow for the same level of communication as couch multiplayer, but the seamless integration of parties using all four versions of the game is impressive.
The addition of a free or lite version also means that people who aren't sure if they will enjoy the game can still join in. My kids have already invited some of their friends to play with them, and those friends were able to download the free version and have a similar, though understandbly more limited, gaming experience. The lite version gives you full access to the first three dungeons and character building, as well as the ability to join other players on most of the original dungeons.
The fact that multiplayer is done entirely online also means you can build parties anytime. You can match up with friends or strangers and take on dungeons to progress your own storyline, or just to level up and farm drops.
The game has improved controls and fun additions
Anyone who played Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles knows how much practice the timing of spell fusion took. While there is still some level of practice necessary in Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition, the battle system is definitely much smoother than the original. With the addition of the Spell Timer, players can see exactly when they need to cast their spells to perform fused magic. While it's not perfect, there is also a messaging system that allows you to direct your party members in performing more complicated magic.
The improved controls weren't the only upgrade Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition got. There are tons of new items, weapons, and gear to be found and crafted. There are nearly twice as many dungeons, most of which are high difficulty dungeons accessible after completing the storyline.
However, my favorite addition is the Mimic System. Throughout the game and in the DLC, you can gain Memory Crystals. Memory Crystals are unique items that allow you to change the appearance and voice of your characters to those of many of the game's NPCs. While this doesn't make a huge difference to the actual gameplay, it is a lot of fun to be able to play as these characters. It also gives one more option for customization, allowing you to stand out from the rest of the party.
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition — Not perfect for everyone
While Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition has definitely impressed me, I will admit there are some flaws. For starters, you no longer have couch multiplayer. Since a free or lite version of the game means you don't necessarily have to buy additional copies of the game, it's sad that families who may share a Switch or PS4 can't just all play on the same console.
The online multiplayer is a nice addition, but also comes with drawbacks. If you're playing with strangers, there isn't a good way to communicate during a dungeon. There are a number of preset messages you can use, but getting those messages out in the middle of a battle is a challenge. I definitely understand why — for such a light hearted, kid-friendly game, the last thing you want is abusive and profane messages. However, it makes coordinating difficult.
Solo play is an afterthought
Much like the original Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition was designed as a multiplayer game first. It is possible to beat the game solo, but it is more difficult. Having to balance physical attacks, magic, healing, and items alone is a real challenge. I ended up dying several times in the very first boss fight and I played the original enough to know how to beat it. On the other hand, I was able to beat that same boss quickly with just one other player.
What's more, while you can fuse some magic in solo play, the most powerful spells can only be cast in multiplayer. You absolutely should go into Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition understanding that it is primarily a multiplayer experience. For those who love Final Fantasy games but are new to Crystal Chronicles, this might just be a deal breaker.
Mobile and online subscriptions
I play just as many mobile games as I do console games, so I am used to the typical touch control issues many suffer from. Even still, having started on console, I couldn't get a solid handle over the mobile controls. If you play primarily mobile games or start out with the iOS or Android version of this game, you'll probably handle it just fine, but having played both, I won't be playing without a controller again.
Also, for the Switch and PS4 versions of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition, you have to have a paid online subscription to play multiplayer. Even if you're using the lite version of the game, you need either a Nintendo Switch Online Membership or a PlayStation Plus account. Neither of these services are particularly expensive, but it is still a recurring cost that you need to plan on.
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition — Should you buy it?
If you love action RPGs, especially multiplayer ones, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition is a must have. This game is absolutely a labor of love and it really shows just how much the creators adore this world and these characters. The graphics and music are beautiful and the gameplay is engaging and easy to learn. It's definitelty a multiplayer game first and foremost, but with online multiplayer and crossplay, you can find other players to join in at anytime of day or night.
With nearly twice the number of dungeons to play, the new Mimic System, and plenty of new weapons, armor, and accessories to craft, you will also be getting a lot for a relatively low cost. The addition of a free lite version and mobile versions also make this game super accessible. This is one of my favorite games to come out is a while, so I would definitely recommend buying it, but you don't have to take my word on it. You can try out the lite version for free and, if you decide to buy the full version, all your progress transfers over.
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition is now available to play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android.

Well... technically, it's been around for a few years now. First debuted at last year's Consumer Electronics Show and announced well before that, Wi-Fi 6 promised better speeds, higher bandwidth, and more efficient data management. Unfortunately at the time, the new standard was only available on a few devices, most of which were almost prohibitively expensive.
As we move into 2021, this is no longer the case.
More and more devices with Wi-Fi 6 functionality are now beginning to hit the market as it becomes more widespread and readily-available. It will likely only be a few years before Wi-Fi 6 becomes the new, de-facto standard. But what exactly will that mean for wireless networks?
Let's start with a bit of knowledge.
The mesh router of the future
eero Pro 6
Wi-Fi 6 capable, for all your smart home needs
Much like Wi-Fi 6 is a huge improvement over Wi-Fi 5, the eero Pro 6 takes everything that was great about the previous eero Pro and builds upon it. Tri-band and with improved speed and range, it's the perfect foundation for a Wi-Fi 6 capable home network. It's also fully backwards-compatible with older models.
Exploring the origins of Wi-Fi
Way back in the 90s, the institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) established the 802.11 wireless standards. While it's a little too complicated to get into here (and doesn't really serve much purpose in terms of explaining Wi-Fi 6), this set of constantly-evolving specifications basically acts as a framework for how wireless networks behave.
Shortly after the release of the first 802.11 standard, an organization known as the Wi-Fi Alliance was formed. Its founders quickly realized what a headache phrases like "IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN" would be for consumers, and so pioneered a new term. And no, it doesn't stand for "Wireless Fidelity" — in an interview with Scientific American, Alex Hills, author of Wi-Fi and the Bad Boys of Radio, explained that it's just a catchy name without much other meaning behind it.
The Wi-Fi Alliance has operated behind the scenes ever since, working with IEEE to ensure that Wi-Fi products meet the established standards. At this point, you're probably wondering what any of this has to do with Wi-Fi 6. We're getting to that.
What Wi-Fi 6 is (and isn't)
Back in 2018, the Wi-Fi alliance realized something. The laundry list of Wi-Fi standards that were now on the market was not only dry, but also terribly confusing. While anyone with a background in networking knows the difference between 802.11ac and 802.11n, they might as well have been written in a foreign language for the rest of us.
As a result, the organization pioneered a new naming system alongside the release of the latest standard, 802.11ax, now known as Wi-Fi 6. Consequently, 802.11ac, the current leading standard, is now known as Wi-Fi 5. It makes a lot of sense, right?
As you may have survived from the new naming convention, although Wi-Fi 6 represents a considerable upgrade over Wi-Fi 5, it's nothing revolutionary. The release of Wi-Fi 6 isn't going to change the world or cause widespread market disruption. Rather, it's something that will happen gradually, quietly leading to improved network performance and better support for the growing Internet of Things.
How fast is Wi-Fi 6?
On paper, Wi-Fi 6 appears to blow Wi-Fi 5 out of the water. The former has a top speed of 9.6 Gbps, while the latter maxes out at 3.5 Gbps. Given those numbers, you might expect a Wi-Fi 6 device to offer a considerable performance hike over a Wi-Fi 5 device.
That isn't likely to happen, though. A higher maximum speed doesn't mean a faster Internet connection. What it does mean, however, is better overall network performance.
And that's really what Wi-Fi 6 is about. Performance and efficiency. Wi-Fi 6 is a standard designed to support the modern smart home, which may have several dozen devices on the same network at the same time.
With Wi-Fi 6, gateway hardware is capable of communicating with more devices simultaneously. Wi-Fi 6 enabled endpoints, meanwhile, will be able to automatically "check in" with the router at set intervals, saving both bandwidth and battery life. What this translates to, in plain English isn't a network that's faster, but rather a network that's capable of maintaining its top speed even in incredibly dense, busy environments.
It's able to do this thanks to several new technologies. The first is an upgraded version of the multi-user, multiple input, multiple output (MU-MIMO) technology already present in Wi-Fi 5, doubling the number of maximum simultaneous connections from four to eight. The second is known as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), and essentially allows a router to deliver data to multiple endpoints with a single broadcast rather than communicating with each device individually.
What else does Wi-Fi 6 bring to the table?
Aside from general performance improvements and a higher top speed, the biggest change between Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 is in network security. The release of Wi-Fi 6 replaces WPA2 encryption with WPA3. That's pretty big news — especially given that the last time we saw a new wireless security protocol was in 2004.
In addition to stronger overall encryption, WPA3 has a few extra bells and whistles designed to better protect you and your data. First, it makes brute force attacks against wireless networks significantly more difficult to pull off. It also adds a new feature known as forward secrecy, which basically turns data into binary soup after it's been transmitted over a network.
Finally, natural password selection helps users choose more secure, easily-memorable network passwords. There are several additional features that apply exclusively to enterprise usage, but we don't really need to cover them here.
Do I need Wi-Fi 6?
At the moment, Wi-Fi 6 is still in its relatively early stage. That said, it will eventually become the standard. Within the next several years, the majority of smart devices available on the market will be shifted from Wi-Fi 5 to the new standard.
If you want to leverage the new features, you'll need a router or mesh network that's Wi-Fi 6 capable. Additionally, swapping over to the new standard means you're likely to enjoy improved performance, particularly if you have a large amount of smart devices on your network. Basically, upgrading now means you'll be ready for the standard's more widespread proliferation while simultaneously improving your own quality of life.
Here's where eero comes in. The recently-released eero 6 line of mesh systems offer enhanced speeds, a more pleasing aesthetic, and full backwards compatibility with existing eero hardware. More importantly, they fully support the Wi-Fi 6 standard, making them the perfect purchase for anyone looking to future-proof their smart home.

- Qualcomm has unveiled the Snapdragon 865 Plus, with the chipset offering modest performance gains over the regular Snapdragon 865.
- Qualcomm says the Snapdragon 865 Plus delivers 10% more performance in gaming and AI-related tasks.
- The first phones to feature the Snapdragon 865 Plus will be from ASUS and Lenovo.
We're just five months into availability of phones powered by the Snapdragon 865, and Qualcomm is already announcing a mid-cycle refresh that's aimed at the gaming segment. The Snapdragon 865 Plus is now official, and Qualcomm says the chipset delivers 10% more power in gaming and AI-related use cases.
Qualcomm says the Snapdragon 865 Plus will enable "desktop-quality" gaming at up to 144fps and 10-bit HDR gaming. Qualcomm hasn't changed too many things here, and there are three key takeaways:
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
- The Cortex A77-based prime core is now clocked at 3.1GHz, which is a 10% increase over the regular 865. This makes the 865 Plus platform the first mobile chipset to be clocked at over 3GHz.
- The Adreno 650 GPU has been turned up, and Qualcomm says it delivers 10% better gaming performance. Qualcomm doesn't detail the frequency of the Adreno 650, so we'll have to wait until we get our hands on it to know more.
- Device vendors will be able to pair the 865 Plus with Qualcomm's FastConnect 6900 platform to deliver Wi-Fi 6E connectivity with a total bandwidth of up to 3.6GHz.
The Snapdragon 865 is no slouch, but it is clear that Qualcomm is positioning the Snapdragon 865 Plus as a gaming-focused option. The Snapdragon 865 Plus will make its debut on ASUS' ROG Phone 3, and it will also make its way to Lenovo's Legion-branded gaming device that's slated to launch shortly. We'll also likely see more manufacturers launch devices based on the chipset in the coming months.

The Bills started strong with four straight wins, but have fumbled slightly dropping the last two games. Still, the first place Bills in week seven shouldn't have much of a problem coming up with another win against the 0-6 Jets.
The Bills' emerging weak spot seems to be its defense. Both the Chiefs and Titans exploited that weakness to get the best of the Bills. If the Jets want to pick up their first win, this is the spot to hit at the moment. Of course, it's hard to tell if the Jets are actually trying to win at this point or are accomplishing a different goal in trying to tank the season. Sam Darnold has not been anywhere close to the player the Jets need and may soon find himself replaced if something dramatic doesn't change soon.

But before you can take advantage of everything that the Quest is capable of, you'll need to make sure it's fitted properly on your face. You want a fit that is firm, without being tight. After all, you are going to be wearing this for a while, right?
How to get the best fit with Oculus Quest
- Remove your Oculus Quest from the box. You'll also want to remove any stickers on inserts at this time.
- With one hand hold your Quest up to your face.
- Using your free hand tighten the velcro straps on the left and right side of your head. It should feel firm but not tight.
- Using your free hand then tighten the top velcro strap until it is firm against the back of your head.
- Remove your hand to ensure that the headset is tight enough against your face.
- Adjust your headset up or down to make sure there is minimal light bleed and that it sits comfortably.
How to adjust Oculus Quest for best fit with glasses
For the folks out there who use glasses in order to see, there is another step you'll want to take advantage of. The Oculus Quest includes a plastic piece which will make it more comfortable to wear, and you'll need to install it before playing.
- Remove the plastic insert from inside the box. It has an icon of glasses on the top.
- Remove the foam insert from your Oculus Quest.
- Press the plastic insert onto the foam pad. You'll hear a click when it is correctly attached.
- Line up the foam pad with the cutouts around the lenses of the Quest.
- Press down firmly to reattach the foam insert into your Quest.
Getting the perfect fit with Oculus Quest is going to differ from person to person. Some folks will need to make sure the top strap is extra secure, while others won't need to worry about it as much. After all, everyone has a different face, which means the headset needs to be readjusted for each person as they get ready to play.
For the best experience you will want a firm fit that doesn't feel tight. If you're new to VR, you want the back of the strap to sit against the lower back of your head. It should sit at the top of your neck and the bottom of your skull. This way the headset's weight is better distributed and not all on the front of your face.
Our top equipment picks
You don't need much of anything to get started with Oculus Quest. That's because the headset and controllers all come together as a package deal. If you love VR and want the next level of freedom when playing, it doesn't get much better than this.

While it's not technically a "free trial" by definition, there is a way to try ExpressVPN with no risk. When you sign up and pay for the company's annual plan, you get a free 30-day money-back guarantee, which means that if you don't like the service within the first 30 days of trying it out, ExpressVPN will refund you your money.
Be sure you make note of when you sign up so that in the event you don't care for the service you remember to seek the refund within that 30-day period. After you pass the 30 days, you'll be locked in and already have paid for the next 15 months of access.
Is ExpressVPN a good VPN provider?

The company offers amazing 24/7 customer support that can help you get through just about any issue you experience with the service very quickly. Additionally, ExpressVPN offers a reliable connection, fast speeds, and tons of server locations that you can pick between.

How does ExpressVPN pricing compare to others?
ExpressVPN is definitely one of the more expensive VPN providers, but that shouldn't automatically deter you from the service. We are talking about a difference of just $2 or $3 each month, which is a few cents a day. Once you try ExpressVPN and see just how well the service works, you'll understand why the company is charging a premium for it and you'll find it easily justified.
If you are looking for something more affordable, consider giving Surfshark VPN a try for under $2 a month, or NordVPN for just over $3 each month.

What started off as an experimental invite-only gadget back in late 2014 has since become the most popular family of smart speakers on the market, with Amazon crushing competition from Google and Apple without breaking a sweat.
It's become a tradition that we get new Echo hardware every year, with one of the latest entries in the series being the Amazon Echo (4th Gen). It's the new middle child in between the Echo Dot and Echo Studio, and with a retail price of just $100, it's packing a ton of value.
There's nothing about the Amazon Echo (4th Gen) that'll make you an Alexa convert if you still don't like how the virtual helper works compared to something like Google Assistant, but for existing Alexa fans or anyone that's been wanting to finally jump on the bandwagon, this is one of the best speakers you can buy right now.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!

Amazon Echo (4th Gen)
Bottom line: The new 4th-gen Amazon Echo is the most radical redesign we've ever seen for the smart speaker, and the risk Amazon took paid off in spades. This latest Echo sounds considerably better than past generations, the new round aesthetic is quite pleasing, and it has all of the same Alexa features you've come to know and love at this point. You get all of this for the same $100 asking price we've had since the 2016 model, making it a must-buy whether you're looking to expand or start your Alexa household.
The Good
- Lovely new design
- Seriously impressive audio
- 3.5mm audio jack
- Built-in Zigbee smart hub
- Great price
The Bad
Amazon Echo (4th Gen) Price and availability
The Amazon Echo (4th Gen) is available for purchase as of October 22, 2020. The speaker costs $100 and is available in three colors: Charcoal, Glacier White, and Twilight Blue. That's the same price as the Echo (3rd Gen) that came out before it, which is great to see when you consider all of the upgrades offered with this latest model.
In addition to buying the Echo on its own, Amazon also offers a few different bundles to help you save a bit of cash. If you want to buy two Echos in one transaction, entering the code ECHO2PK at checkout will save you $30 off the original pricing — bringing it down to just $170 for both units.
Some other options include:
- Amazon Echo (4th Gen) with TP-Link smart plug ($118 at Amazon)
- Amazon Echo (4th Gen) with Philips Hue A19 smart bulbs ($130 at Amazon)
Amazon Echo (4th Gen) What I like
The design of the Echo (4th Gen) is the elephant in the room for this review, so let's start there. All past Echo speakers up until this one have featured a tall, cylindrical shape that changed ever-so-slightly with each new release. The 2nd Gen model added fabric for the first time, the 3rd Gen rounded out the shape a bit more, and the new 4th Gen Echo we have now has gone complete circle.
It's a stark difference compared to all of Amazon's past Echo hardware, and personally, I'm very here for it. There's a hard plastic base on the bottom half of the Echo, but the top portion that you see when it's sitting on a desk or table is entirely fabric. It's warm, inviting, and allows for a new speaker array that I'll talk about more below. The unit I have is Amazon's Glacier White color, but you can also get the Echo (4th Gen) in Charcoal and Twilight Blue.
There are four playback buttons on the top of the Echo (all of which are very clicky), a rubberized base keeps it secure on whatever surface you place it on, and you'll find a 3.5mm audio jack next to the power output for playing your audio to another speaker or listening to music from an external source. You also get a 1/4" thread mount on the bottom, making it easy to place the Echo on a speaker stand for easier placement around your home. Features like that and the 3.5mm jack might be insignificant to some shoppers, but I've always appreciated the extra utility Amazon adds to its speakers compared to something like the Google Nest Audio.
Going back to the speaker array I prefaced above, Amazon made sure to take full advantage of the Echo's new circular housing. Inside the Echo (4th Gen) is a 3" woofer and two front-firing 0.8" tweeters. The woofer is the same size as the Echo (3rd Gen), with the big benefit being that you now get two tweeters instead of just one. They also switch to a front-facing array instead of the upward placement of last year, and the end result of all this is damn impressive sound quality.
The Amazon Echo (4th Gen) sounds way better than it should for being a $100 speaker.
No matter what I listen to on the Amazon Echo (4th Gen), I'm constantly impressed with how it handles all of my music. The Echo kicks out a ton of bass, but it never gets to the point where it sounds too muddy. You get a nice thump on the low end, but the mid and high end still sounds good to my ears. If the out-of-the-box listening experience is too bass-heavy for your liking, you can always open the Alexa app and change EQ settings for bass, midrange, and treble.
Songs like Colors by Beck are especially impressive on the Echo (4th Gen), with the speaker doing justice to the constant bass throughout the song. It's a punch I was not expecting for a $100 speaker, and like I mentioned above, it manages to do this while still keeping other parts of the song clear and enjoyable. The violin from the opening of Sometime Around Midnight comes through beautifully, Ashe's vocals in Save Myself are wonderful. It's all good stuff.
I used to rely on the Sonos One as my office speaker for listening to music throughout the day, and coming to the Echo (4th Gen) from that, it's impressive just how well the Echo holds up to it. I'd argue that Sonos still delivers audio that's more well-rounded, but we're talking about a speaker that costs twice as much as the Echo. For $100, the Echo (4th Gen) knocks it out of the park.
In regards to how the Echo performs as a smart device, there's a ton on offer. Just like we saw in the now-discontinued Echo Plus, the Echo (4th Gen) can act as a smart hub for Zigbee-enabled devices — such as Philips Hue bulbs and Yale smart locks. When they're available, you'll also be able to use the Echo as a hub for Ring Smart Lighting devices.
Where Google Assistant can feel a bit stagnant, Alexa is constantly improving.
The Alexa experience offered here is just like it is on any other Echo device, which is to say you can do a lot with it. Ask about the weather, control music playback, or set up Alexa Guard to keep your home safe while you're away. I also put the microphones to the test by saying "Alexa" with music playing at a blistering volume, and the Echo managed to hear me without a problem.
It's been a while since I've had an Alexa speaker in my home, but using it over my Google Assistant device has been a perfectly seamless experience. I still prefer the way Google handles certain questions and the integration it has with my Google account, but Alexa doesn't feel noticeably crippled in its functionality. It's encouraging to see Amazon still expanding on Alexa to this very day with features like Alexa Care Hub, Guard Plus, and more natural language processing.
The Echo (4th Gen) is also one of the first speakers to use Amazon's AZ1 Neural Edge processor, which touts up to 2x faster speech processing and lower memory usage by up to 85%. These are innovations we aren't seeing enough of from Google, and it paints a promising future for Alexa many years down the road.
Amazon Echo (4th Gen) What I don't like
During my time with the Amazon Echo, I found that the playback buttons aren't always the most responsive. They feel great to press and have a wonderful click to them, but they don't always perform the action that they should. More than once, I found myself pressing the volume or mute buttons and them not doing anything. Adding a bit more force does the trick, but does take away from the overall experience just a little bit. I also would have preferred touch gestures for the controls, as the physical buttons interrupt the otherwise seamless design.
Outside of that, everything else about the Amazon Echo (4th Gen) has been fantastic.
Amazon Echo (4th Gen) The competition
The Echo (4th Gen) is a great purchase, but before you click that Buy Now button on Amazon, there are a couple of alternatives you should first consider — the first of which is the Echo Dot (4th Gen). It's $50 cheaper than the regular Echo, though you get the same circular design and in a smaller form factor. Audio quality isn't quite as impressive on its own, though you can pair two Echo Dots together and get stereo sound for the same price of one regular Echo.
If you have a bit more cash to spend and want to remain in the Alexa ecosystem, it's also worth considering the Echo Studio. It costs twice as much as the Echo (4th Gen), but you're getting even better sound. Thanks to its larger speakers (and more of them), it still remains as the go-to pick if high-end audio is at the very top of your shopping list.
Finally, if you aren't 100% committed to Alexa, it may be worth checking out the Nest Audio. This is Google's latest smart speaker offering, and it has many of the same features of the Echo (4th Gen): great sound, a sleek design, and reliable microphones. If you like the idea of the Echo (4th Gen) but would rather talk to the Google Assistant, the Nest Audio is for you.
Amazon Echo (4th Gen) Should you buy it?
You should buy this if ...
You want an affordable speaker that sounds great
$100 may not be "cheap," but it's considerably less than a lot of other speakers out there from Sonos and Apple. If you don't want to spend more than a hundred bucks but still want a speaker that sounds great, the Echo (4th Gen) strikes that balance almost perfectly.
You want to expand or start your Alexa household
Chances are you already have at least one Alexa device in your home, and if you do, the new Echo (4th Gen) will fit in perfectly. If not, it's a great jumping-off point to dive into the platform and get started with it.
You have Zigbee-enabled smart devices
Whether it be Philips Hue bulbs or a Yale smart lock, having the Echo (4th Gen) double as a Zigbee hub means you can simplify your smart home setup — something we could all use a little more of.
You should not buy this if ...
You don't like Alexa
This should be pretty obvious, but if you still don't like how Alexa works, nothing about the Echo (4th Gen) will change your mind. Just stick with your Nest Audio or HomePod.
I think the best way I can describe the Echo (4th Gen) is that it's just a fun piece of tech. The design is refreshing, it's a joy to listen to music on, and there are virtually endless features to expand its functionality. You get all of that for just $100, making it impossible to ignore for anyone that finds themselves in Camp Alexa.
The core feature-set of the Echo (4th Gen) isn't any different from the one you get on any other past or present Echo speaker, but its magic lies in being able to deliver all of those things and a legitimately great audio experience without breaking the bank.
I'm personally too invested in Google Assistant devices to completely convert my apartment into an Alexa-powered one, but my time with the Echo (4th Gen) has certainly made me compelled to start paying closer attention to what Amazon's doing in the smart speaker space. Whether you're buying for yourself or a family member this holiday season, it's hard to think of a reason why you shouldn't buy the new Echo (4th Gen). Amazon nailed it with this one.
Amazon Echo (4th Gen)
Bottom line: The Amazon Echo (4th Gen) checks all the boxes for a great smart speaker: Excellent audio, a pleasing design, robust features, and a competitive price. Amazon didn't necessarily reinvent the wheel with this one, but the changes and improvements it did make are greatly appreciated.

1. TP-Link Archer AX1800: Best Wi-Fi Router Overall
With its Archer AX1800, TP-Link delivers affordable Wi-Fi 6 with a spec list that most people should be quite happy with. A four-stream dual-band wireless setup pushes 574Mbps at 2.4GHz and 1201Mbps at 5GHz. WPA3 security is supported and a 1.5GHz quad-core CPU keeps the modern software features running smoothly.
Around back, there are four gigabit Ethernet ports for wired devices flanked by four antennas. There's also a USB port though speeds are limited to USB 2.0. This should still be enough for HD video streaming in a pinch.
TP-Link keeps the styling traditional with a fairly large main housing coming in at 10.2 inches wide and 5.3 inches deep. This router isn't winning any beauty contests but as far as delivering solid Wi-Fi 6 speeds at a great price, it succeeds.

If you're for a wireless router with enough speed for HD streaming and even browsing on a few devices, TP-Link's Archer A7 gets the job done with no frills. The Archer A7's dual-band Wi-Fi 5 connection can deliver up to 1,300Mbps on the 5GHz band and 450Mbps on the 2.4GHz band. Typically, the 2.4GHz band will have a greater range thanks to better wall penetration. While this router lacks support for MU-MIMO, it should be able to handle several devices at once without issue. If you're looking to connect a lot of smart home devices, consider something with greater capacity.
TP-Link estimates this router should be able to provide a signal for a three-bedroom home thanks to its three external antennas. If you find out you need more coverage down the line, you don't need to replace your router. OneMesh allows you to connect other TP-Link routers with OneMesh in a mesh. Unlike a traditional extender, you only use one Wi-Fi name and your devices will connect to the best available connection automatically.
Basic QoS and parental controls are included with this router if you want to block certain URLs and prioritize a connection. Luckily, this router can be set up and configured with the Tether app on Android or iOS.
Pros:
- AC1750 speeds are plenty for most homes

The speed breaks down to 1300Mbps on the 5GHz band and 450Mbps on the 2.4GHz band. With a solid signal, this router should be able to keep up with just about any streaming and browsing a small family can throw at it.
Asus recommends this router for large homes and its array of three external antennas should be able to reach most of your home with plenty of speed. If you find you need more coverage, you can add another Asus router with AiMesh support to your home and configure the two routers to work together as a mesh system. Most new Asus routers support AiMesh.
The thing that makes this a great choice for families is Asus' AiProtection Pro software. AiProtection Pro comes with antivirus software powered by Trend Micro as well as advanced parental controls. Asus includes this software free of charge for the lifetime of the product. Whether you are looking to block inappropriate web content or simply set up limited internet hours to keep students on task, this is a great inclusion.

The RAX50S is a version of the RAX50 Wi-Fi 6 router that comes with a one-year subscription to Netgear Armor. Netgear Armor is a security suite backed by Bitdefender that normally costs $70 per year and offers great network security so you don't have to worry about network intrusion and can focus on work.
The RAX50 has a dual-band Wi-Fi 6 connection capable of speeds up to AX5400. With 600Mbps possible at 2.4GHz and up to 4.8Gbps at 5GHz, this router will keep up with pretty much anything a typical family can throw at it. Four Ethernet ports are available for wired devices with one USB 3.0 port for storage. You will need some space for this router with its four large antennas and wide 11.65 inches wide and 8.11-inch deep housing. Still, this router should be fast enough for the whole family for quite a while.
Pros:
- Superfast AX5400 speeds
- One year of Netgear Armor included

Cons:
Netgear Nighthawk RAX50S

8. eero: Best Mesh Wi-Fi Router
- Top speeds: Dual-band Wi-Fi 5 for Internet up to 550Mbps
- Top features: 2x auto-sensing Ethernet ports per unit, Easy setup, Works with all other eeros
If you're looking to cover your home with a mesh network, Eero is one of the easiest systems to get up and running. While Eero doesn't disclose the exact speeds of its routers, we typically see speeds max out around 400Mbps. If you have gigabit internet, this is not your best option since much of your speed won't be utilized. Still, for most people, Eero is fast enough.
If you're a fan of the Eero platform but need a bit more speed, the Eero 6 and Eero Pro 6 will provide enough speed for internet connections of up to 500Mbps and 1Gbps respectively. Even without a Wi-Fi 6 device, the increased mesh performance can improve your connection.
Each compact unit measures 3.86 inches wide and 2.36 inches tall and has two Ethernet ports on the back. The Ethernet ports can be used to strengthen the mesh connection or to connect wired devices. The node will be able to automatically switch between modes. If you need more coverage than you get with the included node, you can add any Eero router to your mesh for more coverage including older units.
Pros:
Cons:
Eero
You can add as much coverage as you need with eero. Dual-band Wi-Fi 5 wireless speeds are fast enough for most people.
9. Netgear Orbi RBK752: Best Mesh Wi-Fi Router Upgrade
- Top speeds: 2400Mbps 5GHz backhaul, 1200Mbps @ 5Ghz, 600Mbps @ 2.4Ghz
- Top features: Wi-Fi 6, 3x Ethernet ports on each node, USB 3.0 ports, Dedicated wireless backhaul
The Netgear Orbi RBK752 is a mesh system that comes with one router and on satellite. This delivers up to AX4200 wireless speeds thanks to a tri-band Wi-Fi 6 setup. One 5GHz band is reserved for the mesh backhaul and can connect at up to 2400Mbps. Another 5GHz band operates at 1200Mbps alongside the 2.4GHz band that can deliver 600Mbps for devices. The benefit of a dedicated backhaul is that your mesh speeds stay high but it does mean that connected devices need to share the remaining band.
At 9.1 inches tall and 7.2 inches wide, each node is quite large but thanks to its understated matte white housing, it blends in well. One thing to consider when you buy into the Orbi line is that not all Orbi products are compatible with one another. You need to buy from a limited selection of satellites making it much more difficult to upgrade your coverage down the line.
Pros:
Cons:
Netgear Orbi RBK752
The Orbi RBK752 from Netgear offers a solid tri-band mesh experience at AX4200 speeds and 3 Ethernet ports on each node.

- Top speeds: 4804Mbps @ 5Ghz, 1148Mbps @ 2.4Ghz

This router is rather large with eight antennas around the outside of the unit's 10.3 inch long sides. While it doesn't have a gamer aesthetic, it's large size will make it hard to blend in with your decor. You also get access to TP-Link's HomeCare package which includes antivirus, parental controls, quality of service software to keep games running fast.
Pros:
- Fast Wi-Fi 6 speeds for dual-band
- 8 Ethernet ports let you connect all of your wired devices
- USB-C and USB 3.0 ports allow for easy network storage
Cons:
TP-Link Archer AX6000
The TP-Link Archer AX6000 is a great option for someone that needs a ton of connectivity with modern speeds and compatibility.
11. Netgear C6250: Best Wi-Fi Router with a Modem
- Top speeds: 1300Mbps @ 5Ghz, 300Mbps @ 2.4Ghz, up to 680Mbps download with 16x4 channels
- Top features: DOCSIS 3.0, 2x Ethernet ports, USB port, Works with most ISPs
The Netgear C6250 is a cable modem and wireless router in one piece of equipment. With 16 downstream channels and DOCSIS 3.0, this router is capable of a theoretical 680Mbps internet connection. Wi-Fi 5 delivers AC1600 speeds which break down to 1300Mbps at 5GHz and 300Mbps at 2.4GHz. While these speeds aren't crazy, 1300Mbps link speed on the 5GHz band helps it handle fast connections.
This router stands upright in a fairly compact 7.68 inch wide and 7.79-inch tall black housing. There are only two Ethernet ports on the back so if you need more than a couple of wired devices, you'll need to add a switch to the mix. This modem works with most cable internet providers including Xfinity, Spectrum, Cox, and Cablevision. If you're looking to get your wireless devices online with as little equipment as possible, this router is a solid option.

Cons:
Netgear C6250
The Netgear C6250 combines a modem and router into a single unit to get you online as simply as possible without any rental fees.
Bottom line
When it comes to choosing the right router, there are a ton of options available. Your best bet will be to get a little more speed than you need now so you'll have room to grow. People are using their home internet more than ever thanks to working from home as well as increased streaming making a fast network more important than ever.
Luckily, Wi-Fi 6 prices have finally come down to a place where most people can afford them and with more and more devices starting to support the technology, it's the right time to upgrade. The TP-Link Archer AX1800 is a great balance with enough speed to keep most people happy for quite a while and support for future Wi-Fi 6 devices.
Is it time to go Wi-Fi 6 or mesh?
Wi-Fi 6 is steadily becoming more common and as the prices continue to come down, these routers are quickly becoming some of the best values around. Of course, these routers are fully backward compatible with Wi-Fi 5 and early. Moving up to a Wi-Fi 6 router may be worth it if you want to be ready for the next generation of wireless LAN or want a more consistent connection.
If you're looking for more consistency and better coverage with little concern for wired connectivity or top speeds, a mesh solution might be the best bet for you. Mesh systems tend to be more expensive than a router alone but the ability to expand your coverage at any combined with the low-profile and stylish designs will make it worth it to many people.

What are the best robot vacuums you can buy today?
There are a LOT of great robot vacuum models that are available right now, and picking the right one can be a difficult task. We've done the research, though, and narrowed down all the picks into a concise list of only the top robot vacuum picks.
Our full list is below, but we believe that when you look for a single best overall pick the iRobot Roomba 960 is the best robot vacuum on the market today for most people. It offers all the standard features you'd expect to see in a robot vacuum, like scheduling, long-lasting battery life, powerful suction, and more. It can be controlled through an app or using an assistant like Amazon's Alexa. It's a bit more expensive than most of the others, but the price gets easier to justify once you see what it can do.
If you are looking for something more affordable, we also have some great picks from companies like Roborock, Ecovacs, iLife, Eufy, Neato, and more. These are all well-known brands and offer a ton of great features across various models.
1. iRobot Roomba 960
The best robot vacuum overall
Pros:
- Wi-Fi connectivity
- Alexa, Google Assistant, iRobot HOME app
- Schedule cleanings
- Recharge and resume
- Anti-fall/bump sensors
Cons:
There are a lot of things to consider when trying to pick the best robot vacuum, and through our testing, we've discovered the Roomba 960 is the top pick for most people. It offers a pretty solid combination of features, cleaning power, and while it's a bit on the more expensive side it's not the most expensive option.
It's a Wi-Fi-connected model, which enhances all the features and allows you to control it from anywhere. You can use the iRobot Home app to set schedules, define no-go zones, and much more. The vacuum itself has a bunch of sensors built in to help prevent it from running into walls, objects, and falling down staircases.
With the schedules, you can customize it to run at specific times on different days, or at the same time every single day. It's best to have a bit of consistency, so you can do a double check before the vacuum runs. You'll want to ensure there are no cords laying around, the doors are opened or closed as needed, etc. One downside to this model is that it only runs for 75 minutes per charge, so it may not be able to complete a full cleaning on each cycle. If it can't, it will return to the base, recharge, and then complete the cleaning.
It's a great pick for homes with pets as it uses rubber brushes for picking up debris and fur. It also traps 99% of pet allergens. A nice thing about it is that the vacuum lets you know when the dustbin fills up. Some don't let you know and just won't clean until you figure out that you need to empty the trash. All in all, this is a great pick for any home.
Best Overall: iRobot Roomba 960
It provides powerful suction, home assistant compatibility, and sensors to keep it from bumping into things. This vacuum is a great pick for any home.
2. iLife V3s Pro
The best budget robot vacuum
Pros:
Cons:
Not all of the best robot vacuums come with an expensive price tag, and these days you can actually find some really great options at extremely affordable prices. If budget is a top concern for you, the iLife V3s Pro is one of the best robot vacuums out there at well under $200. It's a bit more simplistic than others like the iRobot Roomba 960 or the Roborock S6, but that doesn't mean it's bad by any means.
In terms of features on the iLife V3s Pro, you still have the ability to schedule it, but instead of being done via an app, you will actually do it all from the included remote. It runs for up to 100 minutes, which is nearly half an hour longer than our top pick, making it great for larger sized homes.
There are no fancy features like Wi-Fi connectivity, no-go zones, etc, but there is a full set of sensors to prevent it from running into everything, falling downstairs, and more. This model is purely a vacuum, and it does not include any mopping features. It's perfect for people who are unsure whether or not a robot vacuum is even practical for them and allows you to affordably test out a great robot vacuum without investing much in terms of money.
You don't have to look far around the internet to find lots of buyers saying great things about this model. Be sure to give it a shot today and see if it's the best robot vacuum for you.
Best Budget: iLife V3s Pro
This unit runs for long periods, features a remote, and can be scheduled to clean at specific times. It's also an inexpensive option.
3. Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo T8 AIVI
The best object detection
Pros:
- Smart object detection and avoidance
- Learns and adapts to your home
- Runs up to 180 minutes
- Intuitive app
- Powerful suction
Cons:
The Deebot Ozmo T8 AIVI is a phenomenal robot vacuum for anybody willing to pay a little extra for the most conveniences. It features a camera to help it better detect objects in its path and uses advanced AI to learn and adapt to your home. It can even recognize obstacles and then mark them on the app map. For instance, it might tell you it avoided shoes in the hallway or a large cable in your living room.
Object detection isn't perfect, but it's by the far the best we've seen in any robot vacuum to date. You can control the vacuum and view the camera feed using the app. That means you can use the T8 AIVI to check on your home when you're on vacation or simply check in with your dog while you're at work. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a sliding camera cover, although when it's docked, the camera is blocked.
Since it has a long run time and provides excellent suction, this intelligent unit will leave a perfect back and forth line in your carpet while truly cleaning it. If you're willing to spend even more, the T8 AIVI is also compatible with an Auto-Empty Station, so you only have to take the debris out to the dumpster about once a month. The app is super easy to use and gives you plenty of controls like setting up cleaning schedules, no-go zones, and even determining how strong the suction is on the vacuum.
Best object detection: Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo T8 AIVI
The T8 AIVI can recognize and avoid obstacles using its camera. It has an impressive run time, allows you to set no-go zones from the app, and provides powerful suction.
3. Roborock S6
The longest-lasting robot vacuum
Pros
Cons
Of all the vacuums we encountered, the Roborock S6 offered the longest battery life while still being an attractive option. When in quiet mode, it can run for up to 180 minutes before needing to recharge. That means it can reach more areas in your home in one go. The dustbin is on the small side, so you'll need to change it out more frequently than you would with some others.
To get started, you can either give a voice command using Amazon Alexa, or you can use the Mi Home app. This unit has different modes to take care of a variety of situations. One of those modes includes mopping. Attach a microfiber towel to the underside, and the unit will spritz a small amount of water as it goes. It's designed to leave your floors relatively dry, so you don't worry about your hardwood flooring getting damaged.
While it can suck up a decent amount of debris and dust, it, unfortunately, can't detect the difference between carpet and floor, so the unit might attempt to mop your carpets. You'll just need to redirect it if it's heading somewhere you don't want it to go.
Best Battery Life: Roborock S6
It runs up to 180 minutes at a time and can be controlled using Alexa or the Mi Home app. The different modes provide a thorough cleaning.
4. Neato Botvac D4
Best robot vacuum for cleaning corner spaces
Pros:
- Mapping
- Can set No-Go lines
- Anti-bump sensors
- Works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Watch
- Automatically recharges itself
- Alerts you to empty bin
Cons:
Have you ever walked to a corner of your home and discovered a nasty buildup of dust and hair? The round design of most robot vacuums makes it hard for them to reach these cornered dust piles. Unlike other vacuums, the Neato Robotics D4 has a flat side, which allows it to reach these corners better and suck up neglected debris. Just be aware that it doesn't have side brushes. It employs sensors to help it navigate around objects and furniture.
It isn't the most expensive unit on the market, but the price is mid-range. That's because it offers several advanced features, like mapping. You'll need to take the time to map your home with the device, but once that's done, the vacuum will be able to clean in a more orderly fashion. You can even set boundary lines to prevent the vacuum from entering specific locations.
This vacuum won't run as long as other units as it tops out at 75 minutes. But it will go back to its charging dock on its own and will alert you if the bin gets full. You can control it using the app, Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple Watch.
Best for Corners: Neato Botvac D4
The special design of Neato Botvacs allows them to vacuum corners more effectively. This one features mapping, and you can even set no-go lines.
5. Roborock S5
Top pick for those with pets
Pros:
- Runs up to 150 minutes
- Scheduled cleanings via app
- Mapping
- Carpet boost
- Has mop mode
- Works with Alexa
Cons:
Things are a little different when you're looking for the best Robot Vacuum for pet hair. In addition to having the second-longest battery life on this list, the Roborock S5 is great at sucking up fur and allergens. Having 150 minutes of run time means it can reach more areas. Just note that it has a smallish dustbin, so you'll need to change it out frequently for the vacuum to be effective.
The vacuum detects when it's on the hardwood floor or when it's on the carpet and increases the sucking power when on the latter. This is a smarter device than some others as it can map your home and thus clean your floors in an organized fashion rather than randomly bouncing around. You can even tell it not to enter certain locations.
To help pick up all of the grime, you can even attach a small mop to the vacuum and have it clean your floors more thoroughly. Just be aware that it will try to mop your carpet as well as your hard floors. Should it come across any obstacles or stairs, the sensors will prevent it from hitting anything or falling. You can control it using the Mi Home app or Alexa.
Best for Pet Hair: Roborock S5
It detects when it's on hard flooring versus carpet and increases suction accordingly. You can set scheduled cleaning times and have it map your home.
6. Eufy RoboVac 15C Max
Top robot vacuum for homes with stairs
Pros:
- Sensor prevents bumps and drops
- Handles medium-pile carpets
- Four modes
- Works with EufyHome app and voice assistants
- Runs up to 100 minutes
- Decently priced
- Comes with remote
Cons:
The last thing you want is for your expensive robot vacuum to take a fatal tumble down a flight of stairs. You could always put up a baby gate, but it would just be nicer if you didn't have to worry about it in the first place. The Eufy RoboVac 15C Max features more than 10 infrared sensors to detect both ledges and obstacles to prevent your machine from getting damaged. It can run for up to 100 minutes on a single charge to clean a large area of your home.
You can also set up a cleaning schedule on the EufyHome app so that the vacuum cleans when everyone is out of the house. Since the sensors are in place, you won't have to worry about the device falling anywhere while you're away. If you happen to be out and about, and you want the vacuum to start cleaning, you simply open the app and choose from four different modes. Since it has built-in Wi-Fi, you can also use voice controls via Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. It even comes with a remote if you'd prefer to control it that way. It works great on anything from hardwood floors to medium pile carpets.
This particular vacuum doesn't come with boundary strips, and you cannot set up a no-go zone through the app. This means that you'll need to physically barricade areas that you don't want your vacuum entering. Unfortunately, it doesn't map your home either. However, considering the features it offers and the relatively low price, this is a great vacuum for any multi-level house.
Best for Homes with Stairs: Eufy RoboVac 15C Max
It features 10 infrared sensors to detect ledges or obstacles in its path. It can run up to 100 minutes and works with a voice assistant, app, or remote.
The bot to buy
When looking through the hundreds of different robot vacuums on the market, you might feel overwhelmed trying to decide which is the best fit for you. You'll want to take into consideration the unit's price, dustbin capacity, battery life, suction power, control options, and any extra convenient features it might come with. There are several good options to choose from out there.
Our personal recommendation is the iRobot Roomba 960. This is a powerful unit that can suck up anything from dirt to pet hair. It offers Wi-Fi connectivity so you can control it with the iRobot HOME App, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant from just about anywhere. It can map your home for a more thorough and efficient cleaning experience. You can also set up virtual barriers to prevent it from entering areas you don't want to be disturbed, making it the most appealing option on our list.

What features should you look for in a robot vacuum?
Before you can fully understand which is the best robot vacuum for you and the one you should buy, it's important that you understand all of the features that help set them apart. We've broken down a bunch of the most important things to look for in your decision process, and why you need to care about it.
Cleaning
I mean... duh. The most obvious feature you should be looking at in a robot vacuum cleaner is how it cleans. Specifically the types of floors it can clean like hardwood or carpet or (preferably) both, whether or not it can clean pet hair and whether or not that matters to you, and if it has a mopping function. Some of these features may be essential to your needs and some may not. The ability to switch between hardwood and carpet, for example, can make or break a purchase if you have a lot of rugs or a large floor area with multiple floor types.
Another essential part of cleaning with a robot vacuum is its ability to get into corners. Most robot vacuums are round thanks to the original ones being round. It's a tradition that has stuck, but if you think about it it's not the most practical shape for cleaning square houses. Most robot vacuums these days have a variety of brushes and other cleaning tools, though, with at least some designed to sweep up along edges and corners. Keep an eye out for this when evaluating your next purchase because you don't want dirt piling up in places your vacuum can't reach.
Navigation and Mapping
If I wanted to run around looking for a stuck robot, I'd just not buy one and do the cleaning myself. I need a robot vacuum that has the right kind of sensors and the smarts to be able to detect its surroundings and adapt accordingly. Depending on where you plan to use your robot vacuum, you want one that uses sensors to avoid drops like falling down the stairs.
Mapping is also extremely important to a robot's ability to navigate. Usually, advanced mapping causes a bump in the price for robot vacuums, but there's something to be said about the robot's ability to see an entire room and plan the most efficient cleaning route. They usually use a combination of lasers and cameras to map your home, and those are sensors that are different from the ones used for navigation, which is why it usually costs more.
I prefer are the robot vacuums with virtual no-go zones, places you can block the robot from going into. Some robots come with physical borders you can place down, but that means having some unsightly strip somewhere in your house. Virtual no-go zones usually mean the robot has very advanced mapping techniques, too, including creating its own floor plans that you can manipulate.
Size
How big your robot vacuum is can matter for a variety of reasons. When the robot vacuum is too small, it might not have enough clearance to shift between styles of floor. You may need a robot that can lift itself onto carpet from hardwood, for example. Of course, the necessary dimensions of your robot cleaner really depend on the layout of your home and what your furniture is like. You might have a couch so low to the ground you'd need a robot as thin as a sheet of paper to fit under there. If that's the case, maybe you don't care so much about how tall the vacuum is. However, if you need one that can go under furniture, make sure the one you buy is short enough to do so.
The other thing to keep in mind when it comes to size is that the larger the vacuum is, the more room it has for things like a decent-sized dustbin. The dustbin is the most manual part of the robot vacuum really. Unless you're getting a super-advanced product like the iRobot Roomba i7+ you're not going to get a robot vacuum capable of dealing with its own garbage. The larger the dustbin, though, the longer it takes until you have to empty it again. Find the right balance between size and functionality that works best for you.
Smarts and Control
How smart your robot vacuum is will determine how easy your life is going to be. There are a couple of ways robot vacuums show off their intelligence: how autonomous they are and how advanced the smart features are. Let's start with the first thing: autonomy. This ties into a lot of the features already mentioned, especially navigation. You need a robot vacuum that can do its job, figure out its own issues, recharge its battery when it's low, and finish the tasks you've assigned. If your robot vacuum lets you set its schedule, even better. With some, you can even send it to spot clean or clean a specific room it has in its databanks. All of that is pretty important if you want to eliminate the minutiae from your life.
You also need a smart robot with smart functionality. Some robot vacuums just come with a button or two on them you can press to send them to work. The better robots come with an app you can download on your smartphone. Connect the robot to your Wi-Fi network and you can program it in all sorts of ways just from the app. Even better is if the robot can connect to your smart home altogether. Control the robot with your voice using Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Higher end models give you the ability to assign commands like "Clean Bobby's room" to set the robot on a task.
How to choose the best robot vacuum
It can be hard choosing the right robot vacuum for your house. There are so many on the market with so many different abilities. There's more to it than simply getting something that can vacuum your home.
Each robot vacuum has different abilities and conveniences features that you'll want to consider. Typically, the more you pay for a robot vacuum, the more conveniences you get. However, you can still find some decently priced options. Here are a few things that can help you find the best option for your needs.
Battery Life
If a robot vacuum is super good at sucking up debris but doesn't last long, it's going to take a long time to clean your home. Ideally, you'll find a vacuum with a long battery life.
For something that can last for long stretches, we recommend the Roborock S6. It can last up to 180 minutes at a time before needing a recharge. That way, it can tackle large areas or particularly messy sections of your home. If it doesn't hit everything in its first run, it will recharge and continue cleaning.
The Roborock S5 also has an impressive run time of 150 minutes, so it'll be able to clean more floors before heading back to its dock. This one also has a recharge and resume feature, so it will make sure to get every section of your home after it gets more juice.
The third longest battery life goes to the Roomba i7+, which has a respectable run time of up to 120 minutes. This powerful vacuum will make the rounds in your home and reach more inches of the floor before needing to head back to the dock. If it runs out of juice before cleaning your entire home, then it will pick up where it left off once it's recharged.
The real important part to consider with battery life is the robot's ability to self-charge. Smarter robot vacuums can detect when their own battery is running low and return to the docking station to recharge, fill up the battery, and head on back out. So even if you choose a robot with lesser battery life, if it can do that then it will be able to finish the job no matter what. Obviously, just being able to stay out in the field is important, but compensating for that by recharging your own battery is pretty handy, too.
Dustbin Capacity
If a vacuum can run for a long time, but the dust container is small, then you'll need to empty the dustbin frequently to keep it running smoothly. Ideally, you'll choose a vacuum that has both long battery life and a decent-sized dustbin. Here are the devices with the largest debris containers.
Technically the Neato Botvac D4 has the largest container at 0.7 liters. However, it has a smaller run time than most of the other devices on this list - only 75 minutes. Still, if you only need it to go over a couple of rooms, this vacuum's larger-than-average dustbin is an ideal option.
The magnificent iRobot Roomba i7+ has a 0.6-liter dustbin, which is impressive on its own, but this device offers a lot more convenience than that. When the dustbin gets full, the vacuum empties its load into the included cleaning base. The cleaning base can hold up to 30 containers worth of dust and debris before you need to empty it. Since this vacuum also has a charge and resume feature, you won't have to do nearly as much work when dealing with the debris container.
There's a tie for the next best capacity. Both the RoboVac 15C Max and the RoboVac 11S Max have a 0.6 L dustbin. Between the two, the RoboVac 15C Max gives you more for your money while only costing about $10 more. Either way, these Eufy robot vacuums will help keep your floors clean with their large dustbins.
Smart Functions and Conveniences
There's more to a robot vacuum than simply sucking things up. The reason people buy these devices is for convenience. The most convenient vacuums create a map of your home and cover every inch of the floor instead of bouncing around haphazardly. The best also includes the ability to set up virtual walls on an app to prevent your vacuum from entering areas you don't want it to go. Some machines can even mop or can be controlled using a smart home assistant. Here are the best robot vacuums ranked by smart functions and convenience features.
When it comes to convenience, the iRobot Roomba i7+ is miles ahead of its competitors. For starters, you can control it with an app or a smart assistant. It maps your home and thoroughly covers every inch of your floor instead of bouncing around randomly. But what makes it the most convenient choice is the cleaning base. When the vacuum's dustbin gets full, it automatically heads to the cleaning base and empties its load. The cleaning base can hold up to 30 dustbin loads in all. That way, you won't have to keep emptying the dust and debris nearly as often.
The Roborock S6 is another helpful device that will make cleaning your house easier. It features 10 infrared sensors to prevent the unit from bulldozing into your belongings or fatally falling down a flight of stairs. You control it using an app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. It makes a map of your home and zig zags thoroughly all over your floors. You can even tell it where not to go. Should the battery run out of juice, the device will recharge at the dock and then resume cleaning. Finally, it even can mop your hard floors. You simply attach the included mop to the underside of the device and fill the included tank with water.
The Neato Botvac D4 is also an impressive device with several conveniences. The app is easy to use and allows you to both control and monitor the vacuum. You can also use the built-in Wi-Fi to control the unit using Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. This vacuum also maps your home, which allows it to clean your floors in an orderly fashion rather than running around randomly. You can use the virtual walls within the app to prevent the device from going into specific areas of your home.
Price (lowest to highest)
Price is going to be a factor for any purchase you make. Just keep in mind that the most economical options tend not to have as many conveniences as the more costly ones. If you're simply looking for a budget option, then here are some choices to consider.
The iLife V3s Pro is the least expensive unit on this list by far. It does a great job of cleaning hard floors and low-pile carpets without the help of any Wi-Fi functionality. You won't be able to control it using an app or a smart home assistant, but it does come with a remote.
Ecovacs Deebot N79S is a popular choice for many consumers. It only costs $250, but it can still be controlled using an app or smart home assistants. It might not have the ability to map your home, but it provides excellent cleaning for the areas it hits.
Finally, the Eufy RoboVac 11S Max is another great budget buy. It works great on hard floors and carpets up to medium-pile height. It also comes with a remote, so you can still control it from a distance even though it doesn't have an app.

Best Overall: Sunewlx Desk Organizer
Finished in black or brown, this stylish 11.8 x 7 x 5.8-inch leather desk organizer has six spacious compartments for storing everything from magazines and notebooks to a small laptop, remote control, smartphone, pens, notepaper, business cards, and more. A different configuration, which comes in khaki or pink, has a built-in tissue box instead of the front three compartments if that's a priority for you, which might be if this desk organizer is going to be used in an area like a front foyer or nightstand.
Along with the handmade leather exterior with neat stitching, the inside is coated with a velvet lining and the structure is made of wooden cardboard. All materials are environmentally friendly and won't give off a chemical smell. The surface is even slightly water-resistant so you can easily wipe it down with a damp cloth.
Two compartments have a neat flap cover so you can store valuables and keep them out of view, like a ring or wristwatch, a USB flash drive with sensitive information, or SD cards with precious memories you don't want to misplace. As a bonus, the organizer even comes with a matching large coaster for your coffee mug or water bottle, made of double-sided leather. If you don't like the organizer, it comes with a 30-day unconditional free return, offering peace-of-mind with purchase. But it's pretty slick so what's not to like?
Pros:
- Made of high-quality leather
- Convenient hidden compartment
- Spacious compartment can hold a small laptop or tablet

Spot for valuables
This stylish leather desk organizer has a spot with a flap cover to store valuables and is large enough to hold a small laptop.
Best for Simplicity: SimpleHouseware Mesh Desk Organizer
It says so in the name: this desk organizer is simple yet fulfills its purpose nicely. The space-saving design keeps everything in one spot, though it might be too big for some, depending on how your desk is configured. Measuring 13.25 x 13 x 9 inches, it's made of steel.
The organizer consists of a letter tray at the top with five slots that can be loaded from the front or back, along with a middle compartment large enough to hold file folders, notebooks, or 8.5 x 11-inch sized papers, and a three-compartment pull-out drawer underneath.
It would have been nice if you could detach each section and organize them in different spots of your desk to use up corners and different areas, and space things out. But the organizer is easy to set-up, nonetheless, without the need for tools. It's ideal if you are working on various paper-based projects, so you can organize them based on those that are in progress, those that are in the queue, and those that are completed, with quick access to pens, pencils, staples, sticky notes, and more in the drawer as you work away.

Best for Stylish Design: Honey-Can-Do Mail & File Desk Organizer
The double woven fabric makes this desk organizer simple yet also super elegant, ideal for the home office, craft table, student desk, or even your bedroom nightstand or living room side table for organizing TV remotes and other similar devices. In addition to the espresso brown finish, there's also a salt and pepper option if that fits better with your home décor.
Use the square-shaped organizer to store everything from mail to notepads and other desktop items. Each large compartment is pretty deep so you can store plenty inside. There are two large and two smaller compartments, and the organizer measures 12 x 10.25 x 7 inches overall.
The modern design can be coordinated with other items in the Honey-Can-Do line if you find more things you like, like the matching woven storage boxes. Along with the woven fabric, the organizer is supported by a durable steel wire frame that keeps it from sliding around on your desk.
Pros:
Cons:
- Compartments might be too deep
- Could be too big for some desks
- No smaller storage for things like paper clips, erasers

Best for Customization: The Office Oasis Desk Organizer
What's neat about this stylish desk organizer is that it's thin and long so you can position it at the back of your desk, out of the way. But at the heart of its appeal is the ability to move things around as desired. It includes six pieces that fit on a magnetic base so you can arrange them in hundreds of different configurations.
The pieces include a pen holder, pencil cup, smartphone stand, sticky note tray, paper clips storage, and office accessories caddy. You can rearrange them as needed, whether it's to accommodate being left-handed versus right or based on the project you're working on at the moment. But keep in mind that this one is only for small accessories like paperclips and pens – it won't hold things like large notebooks and full-sized papers.
The organizer is made of natural and solid bamboo wood (black and brown finishes are also available) as well as high-grade plastic with non-slip rubber feet so it stays in place. The U.S. patent-pending design is pretty clever and lets you change up the look of your desk whenever you want. If you don't like the organizer, you can return it for not only a full refund but also an extra 10%—no questions asked.
Pros:
- Natural bamboo base
- Magnetic pieces you can rearrange
- Deep and large compartments
- No questions asked refund
Cons:

Best for Students: Sorbus Desk Organizer Set
What I really love about this desk organizer is that it comes in separate pieces so you can arrange each piece on your desk where it best suits you instead of having to store everything in one spot. You might, for example, want to keep the paper tray on the right side of your corner desk but have the pen cup on the left, directly behind your computer. And if you want to keep everything in one spot, you can.
Made of durable metal with round edges along the bottom to prevent scratches, it comes with a total of five pieces in an attractive rose gold copper finish, including a pencil cup holder, letter sorter, letter tray, hanging file organizer, and sticky note holder. It's just as much stylish accents as it is for organizing.
The letter sorter has three divided sections for items like mail, stationery, and notepads while the hanging file organizer basket can accommodate files, books, and more. In the sticky note holder, you can keep things like Post-It notes and memos while the cup holder is ideally sized for pencils, pens, markers, scissors, and other writing tools.
Pros:
- Fits in smaller spaces
- Can organize different pieces on different parts of the desk
- Attractive, eye-catching finish
Cons:

Best for Phone Charging: FutureCharger Fast Wireless Charger Desk Organizer
This neat desk organizer also doubles as a wireless charger, able to wirelessly charge any Qi-enabled device, like a smartphone. The built-in smart chip in the charger automatically detects the device to enable fast charging, whether that's 10 watts for a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, for example or 7.5 watts for an iPhone. If you want to use the charger, however, you need to plug the organizer into a wall outlet or USB (wall adapter is sold separately.) It can charge a phone with a case as thick as 5mm.
Finished in black, the decorative box can hold pens, pencils, scissors, remote controls, notepaper, business cards, and other items. (A smaller version is also available in black or brown with just one compartment). Made of high-quality waterproof leather and anti-corrosion, it employs a high-end cross pattern PU material that is anti-slip so it stays in place.
The charger, positioned at the front, left side of the organizer, features an LED light that is soft green when the phone is charging and blue when it enters standby. It positions the phone at a 60-degree viewing angle, which is ideal for reading, manipulating the screen, or participating in video calls. The organizer comes with a micro-USB cable and manual.

Cons:
- Have to plug it in
- Doesn't include an AC adapter

Choosing the best desk organizer
I'm both a messy and organized person. Perhaps it's the result of watching too much Marie Kondo, but I love organizers that can keep things in their rightful place on my desk. But what organizer works for you depends totally on what items you need to organize as well as the shape, style, size, and set-up of your desk.
The Sunewlx Desk Organizer is a good option that will suit most desk set-ups. It's affordably priced, comes in attractive finish options, and has lots of compartments for holding everything from large-sized papers to small paperclips. I love the secret compartment as well where you can store valuables and hide them away. And the included leather coaster is a nice touch.
Organizers like that work perfectly for offices and student desks as well as other areas, like your nightstand, front foyer for holding car keys and stationery, jewelry, and more.

Best Overall: SMUGDESK High Back Mesh Office Chair
SMUGDESK produces a variety of quality, affordable office furniture, so it should come as no surprise that one of its ergonomic chairs tops our list here. Not only does it come with a lumbar pillow and neck support, but the adjustable height chair can also tilt up to 120 degrees.
Gamers get it: GTRACING Gaming Chair
No one knows better than gamers how important proper ergonomics are to a good chair, and virtually every gaming chair available these days reflects that. One of our favorites is this model from GTRACING, which features adjustable armrests, head, and lumbar pillows, and can even recline up to 170 degrees for those times when you need a quick cat nap.
For the Executive: BestOffice Ergonomic Office Chair
This chair offers a more conventional style that is equally well-suited to the business or home office. It features a high back and plush padding that can make the pain of sitting through that next marathon meeting or Zoom call all the more bearable.
Take a knee: Defy Desk Ergonomic Kneeling Chair
If the last chair was uber-conventional, then call this pick a bit unconventional. Kneeling chairs have long been popular among the health-conscious, and they're starting to trickle their way into the office due to how they can improve your posture and boost your performance.
Basic back support: SMUGDESK Ergonomic Office Chair
This is the second SMUGDESK chair on our list, but we don't mean to be smug about it. It's just a good, quality chair with a breathable mesh back and built-in lumbar support. It's great as a first or second chair or something to put around the conference table.
Stormtrooper-inspired: Hbada Ergonomic Office Chair
Gaming chairs may get all the attention, but for my money, this is one of the coolest-looking chairs that I've ever seen. It looks like something that might be around the table on the Death Star, but its adjustable armrests, high back, and excellent lower back support are firmly rooted here on Earth.
Fashion forward: YAHEETECH Ergonomic Mesh Chair
This reminds me of a chair that Don Draper would sit in if Mad Men were cast today. It sports a leather headrest and seat cushion framing a lumbar-supported mesh back. I'm not cool enough to pull off this look, but you probably are!

Choose your ergonomic chair with care
It has long been advised that we all should take better care of our necks and backs while we work or relax. However, now that so many of us are spending much of our working lives in makeshift home offices, couches, and kitchen tables, it's never been more important to have a good, ergonomic office chair in which to sit.
We went with the SMUGDESK High Back Mesh Office Chair as our top pick because it provides most of the benefits of some of the best office chairs available, but at an extremely accessible price point.
Another chair that we really like is the GTRACING Gaming Chair. It comes in colors well-suited for the office or the home, and it's just a known fact that gamers know comfort when they see it.
Heck, even if you are one of the growing numbers of folks who prefer a stand-up desk, having an ergonomic office chair is essential for those times when you need to take sit breaks or just rest.

Here are the best standing desk mats to consider in 2020
If you've decided that you want to work even just part of the time standing up at a standing desk, you'll need a good mat to help keep you comfortable. Here are some great options.What you need to know
- The Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap is a $50 head strap replacement that improves comfort over the one included with the Quest 2.
- Some users are reporting that it can be tightened too much, resulting in a screw falling out.
- It's possible that these issues are being caused by a loose screw that wasn't fully tightened at the factory.
- Tightening this screw could prevent the issue from happening.
The Elite Strap is one of the best accessories you can get for the Oculus Quest 2, but it seems like it might be a little more fragile than one would hope. Several users on Reddit are reporting that the Elite Strap's head cradle is popping off of the strap when tightened too much. The result is a screw that pops out of the black cranial cradle, which disconnects the cradle from the head strap.
Based on user comments, it seems that some Elite Straps are shipping with screws that are not tightened all the way. It's possible that this is the cause of the issue rather than a design or manufacturing defect, per se. That being said, you may want to take a closer look at your Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap before tightening it onto your head, as loose screws could definitely cause a few issues (and snag hair more easily). Ensuring all the screws that attach the black cranial cradle to the strap are tight could be the key to preventing this issue. It's not yet apparent if these headsets can be repaired after the cradle pops off or not, but some users have RMA'd their straps.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
While this doesn't yet appear to be a manufacturing defect, it could call Oculus' quality assurance into question. Thus far, we've seen sales that appear to be significantly higher than the original Oculus Quest, based on developer input and general availability of the product. Facebook, up until this point, has not been as successful as a hardware company as it has been on the software front, so a larger order of products could let possible QA issues like this slip through the cracks.

It's the best phone I've used in a long time, and will hopefully get better with a few camera-tweaking updates sure to come in the next few months.
It also surprised me — I've had access to all three Galaxy S20 phones for nearly two weeks now, and where I thought I'd immediately gravitate to the inimitable camera of the S20 Ultra, or the perfect-in-the-hand size of the Galaxy S20, it's the Goldilocks-just-right middle ground of the S20+ that I think will appeal to most people this year.
Let's get into it.

Samsung Galaxy S20+
Bottom line: The successor to last year's top-of-the-line phone is the middle child this time around, but loses none of its appeal. In fact, with a more manageable size and weight, plus a superb primary camera that's sure to improve with updates, the Galaxy S20+ could be the best phone of 2020.
The Good
- The best phone display I've ever seen
- Classic Samsung design and build quality
- Incredible specs and performance
- Cameras are a joy to use
- Outstanding battery life
The Bad
- In-display fingerprint sensor is too slow
- Camera paints over facial detail
- 8K video has little practical value
This review was written using a Samsung Galaxy S20+ loaner provided by Samsung Canada. It was used on the TELUS network for seven days, and had build G986WLU1ATBN the entire time.
Samsung Galaxy S20+ What is this middle child, anyway?
Let's get the differences out of the way first: the Galaxy S20 Plus, or S20+ for brevity's sake, is the middle child in this year's early spring Samsung line-up. It's a bit thinner, a lot shorter, a bit narrower, and a lot lighter than the Galaxy S20 Ultra, with a far less pronounced camera module at the back.
The specs are also slightly slimmed down — it has the same Snapdragon 865, 12GB of RAM, and either 128GB or 512GB of storage, but there's no option to supersize the memory to 16GB like there is on the Ultra. The battery's a huge-but-not-so-ultra 4500mAh, and it only supports 25W charging (though the difference from 45W is negligible) and its display is a respectable 6.7 inches compared to the 6.9 inches on the Ultra.
The main difference is with the camera: the S20+ and its smaller counterpart, the S20, share basically identical camera setups, with a 12MP primary sensor that is physically smaller than the massive 108MP part on the Ultra; and there's a 64MP sensor used for telephoto shots, which lacks the Ultra's periscope zoom lens. The front-facing camera is also a smaller and less-dense 10MP.
For $1200, the Galaxy S20+ is still a $200 premium over last year's S10+, but it does appear like you get a lot more for your equivalent bucks. But as you'll see throughout this review, after having used both the S20+ and S20 Ultra, I can safely say the former is a better phone for most people.
Samsung Galaxy S20+ The display is perfect
I came to the Galaxy S20+ straight from using the S20 Ultra for a few days, so it felt like shedding an extra layer of skin. Lighter and more manageable, I've come to terms with the fact that while still a big phone, it's extremely well balanced and easy to hold and navigate with one hand. Samsung's done what it can to alter its One UI 2 software to be one hand-friendly, and that definitely comes across here.
There's no question about it — this is the nicest mobile display on a phone right now.
The first thing I did after setting up the S20+ was enable 120Hz on the gorgeous 6.7-inch AMOLED display, which feels like the absolute best of all worlds — beautiful colors, perfect viewing angles, incredible 240Hz touch response, and dazzling fluidity — and change the navigation settings from Samsung's traditional three buttons to its interpretation of Google's gesture system that debuted with Android 10.
On a Snapdragon 865 and 12GB of RAM, this phone flies, though that's no surprise. What is surprising is just how impactful the switch to 120Hz really is: after a while it starts to fade into the background, but blends into a subtle ruining of any phone that isn't set to a high refresh rate. That it doesn't come enabled out of the box is disappointing; it feels like Samsung is leaning away from one of its best features.
Of course, the reason it's not enabled by default is concern for battery life — there's a reported 25% hit when it's turned on. But as you'll see later on, I've enjoyed 120Hz since day one with the S20+ and have been extremely pleased. If you're buying the phone, I'd highly recommend trying both and seeing whether your usage allows you to maintain a high-refresh rate because it's absolutely worth it.
Samsung Galaxy S20+ This is a Samsung phone, for better or worse
Samsung made a bunch of good design decisions around the Galaxy S20 series — especially the smaller two models. The pinhole front camera is now centered, which provides much-needed symmetry and balance, and the hole is now tiny enough that it's barely noticeable in daily use. While I miss the wallpaper potential of the much larger right-oriented solution, this is far more elegant.
I'm also so, so thankful that Samsung solved whatever design problem that forced it to put the power button on the left side of the Galaxy Note 10 series. I'm not trying to discriminate against lefties — my brother's a leftie and he's great — but I never did quite get used to it. Samsung also came to its senses and combined the power button with the Bixby button — or what's left of it — in the Galaxy S20 series. While I encourage anyone to immediately disable Bixby and remap it to something else, at least this solution is tolerable.
There's no headphone jack, which sucks, but I haven't carried a pair of wired headphones since the first OnePlus Bullets Wireless were released, and have since moved on to something better. In fact, I've been using the Galaxy Buds+ alongside the S20+ since I unboxed it and the pair is, to put it succinctly, delightful.
The phone is slippery, so I'd recommend a good case for it — I love this year's crop of first-party options from Samsung, if you're in the market for one — but the good news is that, even with a case, it doesn't feel thick or unmanageable.
Using this phone feels like the near-perfect balance of size, weight, and comfort. And even with a case on it doesn't feel too thick.
That's the predominant feeling I had using the Galaxy S20+ — the ergonomics are outstanding. It's slim and light and well-balanced, and the only criticism I'd make is that, now that the power button is back on the right side where it belongs, I feel like the volume keys are a bit too high up. Given that this 21:9 aspect ratio phone is already so tall (this is less of a problem on the smaller S20), I would have liked to see both buttons shift down a few millimeters. It would be a compromise: the power button would be a bit harder to reach, but the volume keys, which I use much more often, would be less of a reach.
Samsung Galaxy S20+ Can't quite put my finger on it
Before we get into the camera, I want to mention the one, and truly only one, pain point I have with the Galaxy S20 series: its fingerprint sensor. It's not bad per se, not in the way that the Nokia 9's in-display sensor was basically unusable, but it's just slow and tedious enough that I feel it on a day-to-day basis.
The phone's only major hardware problem is its fingerprint sensor, which is unchanged from the Galaxy S10 series.
When I went to Qualcomm's Tech Summit back in December, the company was demoing the second generation of its ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, a much larger and faster part that maintains the 3D-texture-reading security of the original. In my naivety, I was certain Samsung would find a way to include that upgraded sensor in the Galaxy S20, as it always seems to have access to Qualcomm's first batch of new Snapdragon SoCs.
Unfortunately, it wasn't quite ready for commercial use, and Android Central has learned that Samsung did consider swapping out the first-generation Qualcomm sensor for a more mature, but slightly less secure, optical sensor — the type found on most phones today.
I guess Samsung figured continuity wouldn't hurt it too much, but I disagree: coming from the Pixel 4's ultrafast and super reliable face unlock, and before that the OnePlus 7T's incredible in-display optical sensor, I feel like Samsung missed out on really fixing, once and for all, its biometric inferiority. I can understand the reasoning, but I don't necessarily agree with it.
On the other hand, Samsung redeemed itself in the haptics department. The vibration motor in the Galaxy S20+ is identical to the one found in the Note 10 series, which were the first Samsung phones to include high-quality haptic engines and to utilize them properly across the operating system. Not only does the S20+ produce powerful vibrations for phone calls and notifications — you're not going to miss an incoming phone call when this is on a desk in the other room — but the motor is capable of subtle and granular feedback, too, for situations like typing.
Given that I'm the kind of person who will disable vibrations entirely on a phone with a poor quality vibration motor, I am deeply appreciative that Samsung is finally taking it seriously.
Samsung Galaxy S20+ The cameras
The camera is the most important feature of this phone and, for most people, for any phone.
Most people reading this review will want to know whether A) the Galaxy S20+ takes photos as good or better than the gargantuan Galaxy S20 Ultra, and B) whether the Galaxy S20+ stands up to phones like the Pixel 4 and iPhone 11 Pro.
The short answer is that, for the most part, the Galaxy S20+ is a big upgrade over previous Galaxy phones, including the S10 series, primarily because the main 12MP sensor is just so much larger. It's not quite the massive 70% jump we saw from the Galaxy S10+ to the Ultra, but the S20+ is still a comfortable 28% beefier than last year's model.
So that's where we begin. Photos taken with the Galaxy S20+ during the day are as good as ever, with lots of detail and exceptional balance preservation of shadow detail and highlights, thanks to Samsung's excellent if slightly-overbearing HDR.
Unlike the S20 Ultra, the S20+'s primary sensor is much more traditional — there's no pixel binning going on here. The 12 million pixels that make up the sensor are just bigger than what we found on previous Galaxy phones, and that means they let in more light. Samsung's also taking advantage of many of the Snapdragon 865's own improvements around post-processing, resulting in less noise in low-light conditions and, theoretically, more detail preservation indoors under artificial light.
Galaxy S20+ (top left) | Galaxy S20 Ultra (top right) | Pixel 4 (bottom left) | iPhone 11 Pro (bottom right)
The reality is a bit mixed: outdoor shots from the main sensor are superb, and the dual pixel autofocus capabilities built into the IMX555 sensor allow the S20+ to avoid the focus hunting that we've seen on the Ultra. The smaller sensor size also results in less natural bokeh and a wider plane of focus on a foreground subject, producing photos that look a lot more like traditional phone photos — for better or worse.
My major bugbear, though, is something that's affected every Galaxy phone since I can remember: Samsung smooths facial detail to a stupefying degree, resulting in photos of people that look soft, artificial, and often downright unusable. I suspect the company does this to minimize grain in less-than-ideal lighting environments, but I'll take pockmarks over a painting any day of the week.
Galaxy S20+ Scene Optimizer OFF (top left) | Galaxy S20+ Scene Optimizer ON (top right) | Galaxy S20+ Pro Mode (bottom left) | Pixel 4 (bottom right):** Here you can see the difference in skin texture and detail between the Galaxy S20+ and the Pixel 4.
If you take a look at the above images (I need a shave so badly), you can see that Samsung processes skin wildly differently depending on the mode. I took the above photos outside to remove any post-processing bias, but note that indoors, under warm artificial lighting, the differences are even more pronounced. All of the photos were taken with the rear primary camera with filters and beauty mode disabled.
The Galaxy S20+ cameras are stupendous almost all of the time — but facial smoothing is still an issue Samsung needs to address.
By default, Samsung appears to apply a smoothing mask to the entire face and then, in Auto mode with Scene Optimizer on, it brightens the skin tones while trying to suppress highlights. It also sharpens the edges which, because the original photo lacked detail, looks artificial. When shooting in Pro mode, the image is even softer — to the point where I thought my face was just out of focus. But I took the same shot several times and got identical results. Pro mode just leaves the original smooth mask on and doesn't boost exposure or highlights.
All four photos are actually quite good, but the Pixel 4 looks the most natural, both in terms of preserving facial detail and in the white balance. Samsung's photos are warmer, which gives my face a yellow pall that doesn't belong.
Galaxy S20+ (left) | Pixel 4 (right): You can see the same skin-smoothing effects at play in this indoor scene.
The other major area without much progress is capturing movement. I have a toddler, and she moves — constantly. When taking photos with the Pixel 4 or iPhone 11 Pro, those phones generally know to lock the shutter speed at number that will minimize, if not eliminate, motion blur, even if it results in a darker or grainier photo. Samsung, once again trying to minimize grain, tends to set its shutter speeds in these situations low enough that blur is almost guaranteed, even with a small amount of movement.
Samsung's Pro Mode solves many of these problems, and can be relied upon to produce more natural-looking photos in most situations. It's extremely versatile, offering granular control of focus, shutter speed, light sensitivity, exposure, bracketing, and more. And Samsung saves the mode you were previously in when starting the camera app, so if you want the best experience taking photos with the Galaxy S20+, I'd just leave it on Pro mode all the time. You don't have to mess with any of the settings — even with everything set to auto, the Pro mode delivers.
Where the Galaxy S20+ really excels is in low light: this is a much better nighttime camera than any previous Galaxy phone, and I'd argue that, thanks to the sensor's larger pixels, an even better low-light camera than the Galaxy S20 Ultra, despite that phone's pixel binning.
Night mode comparison: Galaxy S20+ | Galaxy S20 Ultra | Pixel 4 | iPhone 11 Pro | Galaxy Note 10. The Galaxy S20+ looks like it does the best job overall on this very challenging scene.
I think my main takeaway from taking a lot of photos with the Galaxy S20+ is that it's a better experience than any other Galaxy phone before it, and also the Ultra. It's easier to wield and steady with one hand, and the primary sensor is faster to focus, with a wider plane, and fewer proclivities for producing oddities and aberrations than the Ultra's sensor, which Samsung has less experience tuning.
Then there's the 64MP sensor, which is used in a hybrid role as a telephoto shooter and a high-resolution primary camera. Yeah, it's weird. See, there's no actual zoom attached to the 64MP sensor — its "lossless" zoom is achieved by taking all of those pixels and cropping in by 3X, producing 12.2MP photos at a distance that actually look pretty great.
The solution isn't quite as elegant, nor as physically imposing, as the Ultra's periscope lens, but in decent lighting, you'll get some excellent long-distance photos from this phone. Plus, you can use the telephoto sensor to take 64MP photos at its native focal length, eking out as much detail from a scene as possible.
Galaxy S20+ 1X / 10X / 30X (above) | Galaxy S20 Ultra 1x / 10X / 30x (below)
You can see above that, compared to the Galaxy S20 Ultra, the S20+ performs comparably well up to around 10X zoom, and then beyond that you see the Ultra's periscope able to eke out more detail from a scene. The S20+ maxes out at 30X while the Ultra goes all the way to 100X, but as Andrew explained in his review, the benefits are minimal beyond 10X, anyway.
Oh, and here are a couple of photos of a Very Good Boy at 1x and 3X zoom, respectively.
Let's round things up in the camera department:
- The selfie camera is indeed much improved over last year's phones. Like way better. Annoyingly better, because once you disable the on-by-default beauty mode on the front camera, you'll actually get more facial detail from the front camera than the rear one. Maybe that's the point? I don't know anymore.
- 8K video is plain dumb unless you're going to use it to crop in closer to a subject in post. Otherwise stick with the incredible 4K60 footage or, even better, the smooth-as-butter Super Steady Mode at 1080p.
- The camera app opens instantly. Every. Single. Time. It's wonderful coughPixelcough.
- Single Take is a gimmick that occasionally spits out a few beautiful frames. (In case you missed it, Single Take is a mode that shoots photo and video together for about 10 seconds and creates a reel full of mixed media that's largely forgettable.)
Samsung Galaxy S20+ All day and all night
The Snapdragon 865 in here is the best there is right now for Android users. If you want benchmarks, we have those. There's 12GB of RAM inside here, too, which is plenty. Like, don't worry about it. My favorite thing is that you can pin three apps in memory so they'll never close. I did that immediately with the camera, Spotify, and Pocket Casts, so I never have to pause a song and try to return to it a few minutes later only to realize the phone bumped it out of memory.
More impressive is the battery life on this thing. Now, I don't have 5G in my region, so I can't comment on that, but with a strong LTE connection throughout my testing period, the 4500mAh battery lasted seemingly forever, though in reality, it was long enough that I didn't once have to worry about it.
I was a bit worried about battery life, but I shouldn't have been: this phone lasts all day and then some, and there's absolutely no battery anxiety.
I'm talking about screen-on-times of six to seven hours in a day with 20% of battery to spare. I'm talking about waking up at 6:30 and going to sleep at midnight (I know, I know) without ever having to top up the phone during the day and not being stingy with my usage.
Charging the phone is also delightfully quick with the included 25W charger, going from dead to full in just over an hour (though beware that to achieve the "super charging" speeds Samsung offers it must use the charger in the box, as it supports PPS).
Samsung Galaxy S20+ A nice gesture
The Galaxy S20+ is the best Galaxy S20 phone you can buy, which makes it the best phone you can buy right now. It's not perfect, but it's close. Aside from the minor quibbles I have with some aspects of the camera, and the not-great fingerprint sensor, I have nary a criticism of the experience so far, and I've really tried to find some.
Much of my positivity can be attributed to the gains Samsung has made in the software department. I'm going to leave the bulk of the thoughts to my colleague, Andrew Martonik, who reviewed One UI 2 earlier this year, but I'll say this: you don't really notice the cruft anymore. Samsung still does things its way, and there are times you wonder whether it should do another culling of extraneous features, but somehow — from Edge Display to Bixby — it all just kind of works. Actually, I take that back: Bixby still needs to go.
Once I switched over to Google's way of navigating Android 10, I felt right at home. And honestly, I haven't wanted to leave.

Samsung Galaxy S20+ Should you buy it?
At $1200, the Galaxy S20+ is not cheap. But if you're looking for a phone that does everything pretty well and a few things exceptionally, this should be your first choice. It's early still in 2020, but I don't see another phone coming along anytime soon that will unseat it — at least not entirely.
I still love the Pixel 4 XL and think the OnePlus 8 Pro, when it's released, will offer better value than the Galaxy S20+, but I can't dismiss the sheer volume of improvements Samsung made to this phone without losing the core vision of offering a giant screen on which you can do whatever you want.
The right stuff
Samsung Galaxy S20+
The successor to last year's top-of-the-line phone is the middle child this time around, but loses none of its appeal. In fact, with a more manageable size and weight, plus a superb primary camera that's sure to improve with updates, the Galaxy S20+ could be the best phone of 2020.

Facebook bumped up the Oculus Quest 2 across the board. It has 6GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage.
The headset also has a display with around 50 percent more pixels than the original. That display has a refresh rate of 90Hz, but it's important to note that Oculus Link won't support 90Hz until Facebook ships an update in the future. Also, apps and games that run natively on the Oculus Quest 2 will run at 72Hz unless the 'experimental' 90Hz mode is enabled.
There's always a risk with modifying a device. If you're willing to do so, you can enable 90Hz on the Oculus Quest 2 for all games through ADB commands.. If you have any hesitancy or don't want to risk anything, you can rest assured as Facebook states that 90Hz mode is on the way in the future.
The Touch Controllers for the Oculus Quest 2 have improved ergonomics. The new Touch Controllers take design cues from the popular original Rift's Touch Controllers.
Oculus Quest 2 Design
The Oculus Quest 2 is a white headset that's smaller and lighter than the original Oculus Quest. It has white Touch Controllers that feature black accents and buttons.
The Oculus Quest 2 has a soft touch strap that should make it more comfortable to wear than the original Oculus Quest. You can also purchase an Elite Strap for the Oculus Quest 2, which reduces pressure from the front of the headset.
The Oculus Quest 2 has a physical lens adjustment system, but it is different from that of the original Oculus Quest. It has three IPD settings of 58mm, 63mm, and 68mm.
The Oculus Quest 2 has a USB-C port and works with Oculus Link. That same port can also be used for charging from a plug or a battery bank. The headset has built-in speakers on its straps and a headphone jack on its body.
Oculus Quest 2 Accessories
Facebook announced several Oculus Quest 2 accessories alongside its launch, including an official Quest 2 Elite Strap, and a Quest 2 Fit Pack that helps the headset fit on your face better. There are also partner accessories from Logitech, including both over-ear and in-ear headphones for the Oculus Quest 2.
Oculus Quest 2 Games
The Oculus Quest 2 can play all games from the original Oculus Quest. That means that every game confirmed for Oculus Quest will work on the new and improved Oculus Quest 2.
Developers can make games even better by enhancing them for the Oculus Quest 2. Doing so takes advantage of the headset's improved hardware and makes games quicker and better looking. In our collection of every game for the Oculus Quest 2 and Oculus Quest, we add a mark to every title that's been Oculus Quest 2 enhanced.
The Oculus Quest 2 can also use Oculus Link, meaning you can play PCVR titles when the headset is connected to a PC with enough power to run PCVR.
Oculus Quest 2 PCVR
The Oculus Quest 2 can play PCVR games in a few ways. The headset works with Oculus Link, allowing you to play PCVR games on your Oculus Quest headset when you connect it with a wire to a PC that can power PCVR. You can connect the Oculus Quest 2 to a PC with a USB-C cable with the correct specs, just like you can with the original Oculus Quest.
If you prefer a wireless setup, there's an app called Virtual Desktop that allows you to stream PCVR games to your Oculus Quest 2. To get the best experience with this setup, you'll need a Wi-Fi 6 network and to follow the steps outlined in our complete guide.
In fact, Oculus Link has more of an emphasis on the Oculus Quest 2 than on the original Oculus Quest. Because Facebook is ending the Rift line of VR headsets, the Oculus Quest 2 with Oculus Link support will be the way to play PCVR games on Oculus hardware going forward.
Oculus Quest 2 Backward compatibility
Yes, the Oculus Quest 2 is backward compatible with Oculus Quest games. Facebook confirms that all games for the original Oculus Quest will work on the Oculus Quest 2. Many of the games will look better on the Oculus Quest 2 than on its predecessor, but at least for now the two devices share a game library.
Unfortunately, the Oculus Quest 2 is not backwards compatible with Oculus Go games. There are several dozen Oculus Go games that work on the original Oculus Quest, but they will not work on the Oculus Quest 2.
Oculus Quest 2 Controllers
The Oculus Quest 2 has improved Touch Controllers. The new Touch Controllers feature better ergonomics than those of the original Oculus Quest. They take design inspiration from the original Oculus Rift Touch Controllers.
In addition to feeling better in hand, the new Touch Controllers have some handy changes. They get better battery life, have enhanced haptic feedback, and a redesigned battery compartment when compared to the Touch Controllers of the original Oculus Quest. The new Touch Controllers also have a dedicated thumb rest.
We cover what's new with the Oculus Quest 2 controllers in more detail in our full breakdown. The long and short of it is that Facebook took lessons from all of its previous controllers and tried to bring them all to the new Oculus Quest Touch Controllers.
Oculus Quest 2 Keep it out of the sun
You should not use the Oculus Quest 2 outside. Sunlight can and will easily damage the headset's display. The Oculus Quest has lenses that allow you to immerse yourself into VR, which is great, but they also act as magnifying glasses for sunlight. If sunlight hits the lenses on the Oculus Quest 2, it can burn the display inside the headset.
In addition to sunlight being harmful to the Oculus Quest 2, moisture in the air can also damage the headset.
Apart from all of the safety-related reasons to keep your Oculus Quest 2 inside, the headset also might not work that well if you do take it outside. If sunlight is too bright, the cameras on the outside of the device can have a hard time tracking Touch Controllers.
An exciting time for VR
The Oculus Quest has moved VR forward during its run. The original Oculus Quest brought standalone VR to new levels and also improved significantly over time thanks to new features and software updates.
The Oculus Quest 2 continues that journey with improved internals, a refined design, and a fresh new color. Facebook bumped up the internals, reduced the headset's size, and improved things across the board when compared to the original.
Whether you are coming from the original Oculus Quest or considering jumping into VR, the Oculus Quest 2 is a good bargain. With a starting price of $299, it's one of the most affordable ways to get into VR.

We're still in the early days of the foldable phone re-emergence, but there are a couple of options available if you want to buy-in. These are no longer concepts or prototypes, they're complete phones that are on store shelves just like any other. Right now, the best overall option is the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2, but it's far from your only option. These are the best foldable phones you can buy.
Best Foldable Phone Overall: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2
The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is by far the most refined foldable currently on the market. It improves massively upon the hinge of the original Fold, and can stay open at various angles to use certain software features in unique ways. The cover display takes up the entire face of the device, and while it's a bit narrow compared to most phones, that helps keep it relatively useable one-handed, since the phone is particularly thick when folded shut.
The inner display features Samsung's Ultra Thin Glass (UTG) screen covering, making it more durable than other fully plastic options, and the 120Hz adaptive refresh rate makes everything you do on that display feel ultra-smooth. Of course, it's large enough to run two full-sized apps in split-screen view, and you can run even more without slowing down the Fold 2's ultra-powerful specs.
With a 4,500mAh battery, the Z Fold 2 can easily last through a full day, though it isn't without its setbacks. For one, foldables still have too many moving parts to offer water resistance, and this phone is no exception. You'll also run into the occasional unsupported app, which may scale abnormally to the large display. But the compromises mostly stop there; the Z Fold 2 is as close to perfection as we've seen so far, and goes a long way to earn its high price tag.
Pros:
- Massive 120Hz display when unfolded
- Snapdragon 865+ with 5G support and 12GB of RAM
- Strong battery life
- Most durable foldable screen
- Impressive triple camera array
Cons:
- Very thick and heavy
- Internal screen is still more fragile than most phones
- Extremely expensive

The most powerful foldable with the fewest compromises
Samsung's most refined foldable yet is a multitasker's dream, with a huge canvas and all-day battery life.
Best Flip Phone: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5G
Flip phones are back! Samsung's latest revision to the Galaxy Z Flip it launched earlier this year brings 5G support and the latest, greatest Snapdragon 865+ processor to a familiar design. At its core, the Galaxy Z Flip 5G looks and acts like an S20+, running Android 10 with Samsung's One UI software. But of course, it folds in half, allowing it to fit much more easily into your pocket than an S20+.
Along with that added portability, the Z Flip 5G can also be propped up like a laptop or compact mirror to take selfies or make video calls, but otherwise there's not much extra functionality versus a traditional smartphone. That's not such a bad thing, though, since it performs exactly as a traditional phone should. It's fast and responsive, and has decent battery life.
Like the Z Fold 2, the Z Flip 5G lacks water resistance, and its display is limited to just 60Hz and 1080p. You're also getting a pretty weak speaker system and no ultra-wide camera on the back, but if you're after something portable above all else, the Z Flip 5G is still a great option.
Pros:
- Durable UTG display
- Updated with modern specs and 5G
- Typically great Samsung build quality
- Fits comfortably into nearly any pocket
Cons:
- Cameras a step behind 2020 flagships
- No water resistance
- Bad speakers
- Low refresh rate
Best Flip Phone
Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5G
Great for users with tiny pockets
The best part of the Galaxy Z Flip is its ability to feel like a normal phone when it's open, and then quickly fold in half to a compact size.
Bottom line
When it comes to the limited selection of foldable phones, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is the best of the bunch. It doesn't offer the same level of durability and value as a normal non-folding smartphone, but that's not what we're evaluating here.
As far as a foldable goes, it offers the best combination of features and quality while limiting the compromises. When it's open, you have a tablet-like canvas for running multiple apps, and when it's shut, you get a relatively familiar (albeit narrow) form factor that's useable in one hand. Best of all, you can use the three great rear cameras regardless of which screen you're using.

However, that was a long time ago in the world of tech, and Samsung has since transitioned to its own wearable OS with Tizen. The Galaxy Watch Active 2 represents the manufacturer's peak offering for smartwatches — and it's beautiful.
While the watch itself is a polished piece of hardware with a gorgeous display, enough weight to feel premium, and its capacitive navigation ring, is something to behold — the software, though capable, sometimes feels undercooked.
Tizen offers a lot of customization, sometimes to the point that it can feel overwhelming. Indeed, it takes a fair amount of digging through the settings on the device and the phone app to get things the way you want them. If you are willing to take the time to set it up, the Galaxy Watch Active 2 will serve you very well.
Like a work of art
Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2
Bottom Line: Samsung has created a smartwatch that is sleek and stylish, but that can also be casual and sporty at the same time. Navigation is fast, and at times, intuitive. The potential for this device is seemingly limitless if Samsung can deliver on promised features and tighten up the reins on its wearable platform.
Pros
- Beautiful hardware
- Bright and vibrant screen
- Capacitive navigation ring is fun and functional
- Solid battery life
- Wonderful haptics
Cons
- Notifications are a bit clunky
- Slow charging
- Lacks app ecosystem and third-party integrations
Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 What I like
For the better part of a decade, I've been wearing some form of smartwatch or fitness tracker — and while some of them have been aesthetically pleasing to me, almost all of them have been chonky on the wrist. That is not the case with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2. Even with the 44mm case size that I have been wearing, it feels small on my wrist. I have larger wrists and have been wearing the TicWatch Pro 4G LTE for the past year, so switching to the Galaxy Watch Active 2 was quite a change.
While I enjoy the looks of a more industrial-styled watch, the pared back and sleek design that Watch Active 2 offers is wonderful. The build quality is top-notch with the pebble-like shape, and just enough heft to feel premium makes wearing the watch so comfortable. A slight curve to the glass covering the display that meets up perfectly to the rounded stainless steel case is so pleasing to the eye.
About that display, all I can say is wow. The prowess that Samsung has in terms of smartphone screens is on full display, no pun intended, with this watch. The 1.35" Super AMOLED display on the 44mm watch is as color-rich and vibrant as expected from Samsung, with clear, crisp text. It's also super bright, and reading notifications or fitness data while outside is no problem for me.
Navigating through the Tizen interface is smooth and fast, whether you are going the traditional route and use the touchscreen, or via the clever capacitive bezel. Previous Samsung smartwatches like the Gear S3 offered a physical rotating bezel for scrolling through text or moving through the watch's interface. The digital version, though not quite as satisfying, is fun to use and haptically clicks as though it's moving.
Much like clicking a pen when bored, sometimes I'll just "rotate" the bezel for fun.
We often discuss the importance of haptics on phones, and that feedback is just as crucial in your wearable. Outside of fitness, notifications are the most desired feature in a smartwatch — at least to me. The vibration motor used in this watch is sharp and strong. It provides terrific "clicks" for the navigation ring, and when I get a notification, I know it.
I hadn't used a Tizen-based watch since the Gear S2 three or four years ago, but the parts I remember enjoying about it are still there — and improved upon. On the Galaxy Watch Active 2, Tizen makes full use of the device's display when showing notifications, health data, or something as mundane as a watch face. Notifications have graphics related to the service it originated from with a good summary, and once expanded, offer useful, actionable information.

One of my favorite things about having a smartwatch is that it allows you to change the way your watch looks to suit not only your style but your mood as well. This applies to the style of the watch face down to the watch band. I'll change my watch face every couple of days, if not daily, depending on what I'm doing that day, what I'm wearing, or just how I feel. The first-party options that Samsung has loaded on the watch are great. You can customize everything from the color to the info displayed and whether you want a sporty look or a more classic style.
Then, if you find yourself bored with the pre-loaded watch face options, the Galaxy Store on the device or the phone app is full of third-party choices. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of watch faces to choose from. The Galaxy Store also has apps for other functions you may want. Regardless if that's a different weather app, fitness app, or even a game, there are options out there. However, while there are a lot of apps, many top-tier services like Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Runkeeper, and others don't offer a companion app for the watch.
The Galaxy Watch Active 2 has a robust fitness platform with Samsung Health, and the watch takes full advantage of it. Utilizing a suite of various sensors, the Watch Active 2 does a great job of automatically tracking workouts, sleep, stairs climbed, and much more. The built-in GPS does a fine job of tracking runs for the casual runner, and it's all displayed and analyzed on the watch and in Samsung Health. The platform allows you also to track your water, caffeine, and food intake, as well as help remind you to move and even to relax.
I'm glad that Samsung opted for Qi wireless charging for the watch, even if it is a bit on the slow side.
Another surprising discovery while using the Galaxy Watch Active 2 was how good the battery life was. Even with continuous heart rate monitoring, always-on screen, and sleep tracking, I was able to get about two days out of it. Samsung also has built-in a few battery modes aimed at extending the watch usage. Outside of the standard "all smarts on" mode, there are power saving and watch only options that restrict various parts of the watch's functionality to extend battery life. The watch only mode claims to get you over 30 days of usage, which is fine, but then it's not really a smartwatch.
Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 What I don't like
As I mentioned before, I haven't used a non-WearOS smartwatch in years. So when I saw all of the praise that Samsung's latest wearable was getting, I had to see for myself what the hype was about. While WearOS is nowhere near perfect, I feel that it gets some of the basics I find important very right.
My criticisms are as much about Tizen as they are about the device's companions apps. Because so many of the issues I have using the Galaxy Watch Active 2 have to do with managing the experience. Samsung has long been known for how expansive its settings and features can get — and its wearables are no exception here. Much of the watch's functionality is handled via two apps, the Galaxy Wear app and the Samsung Health.
Each of these apps is full of choices, and I love choice, but the problem becomes that too much choice can be a bad thing. Samsung has done a good job of attempting to categorize many of the settings as well as offering a "looking for something else?" section at the bottom of each category in case what you wanted wasn't where you expected it to be.
Part of the problem, in my eyes, is that managing nearly every facet of how the watch will operate can be found in the Galaxy Wear app. From notifications and widgets to sounds and button functions, it's all in there. One example of this confusing settings layout is with workout tracking. The watch can automatically track workouts, and to change those settings, you have to go to the Samsung Health app. That's fine, but shouldn't there be a link out of the Galaxy Wear app to it? Links out to Samsung Pay and Bixby are there, why not Samsung Health?
I wish I could count the auto-detected cycling while mowing as an actual exercise.
The confusion continues once you get to settings in the health app. When I mow on my tractor, the watch thinks I'm cycling, and oddly it doesn't think so when I'm on my zero-turn mower. While I'd love to count the workout, my wife won't allow it. So I head to the Samsung Health app to edit the workouts detected only to find that "Auto Detect Workouts" is on and greyed out. To change that setting, I have to edit the workouts within the health app on the watch, but nowhere does it tell me that directly.
One of the most important features of a smartwatch is that notifications are shared with my phone. How I like to manage notifications on my watch may seem a bit complex, so stay with me. I like utilizing the always-on display for my watch because I want to be able to tell time and not wait for the screen to turn on. I also keep the raise-to-wake feature turned off, as I don't need the added battery drain when the watch thinks I'm trying to access it every time my arm makes the slightest motion.
Thank you for all of the customization options Samsung, but why do you make is so difficult to find them?
Still here? Good. Both WearOS and Tizen offer the ability to secure your watch with a PIN as well as always-on displays. I mention the security point here because when a notification comes through to my watch, I want to get the haptic feedback, but not to show it on the screen unless I raise my wrist to see what the buzz is about — Tizen doesn't do that. I can be talking with someone, and my notification is in full-view to read; I don't want that. WearOS handles this part far better, in my opinion.
The other major downside when using the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the lack of familiar apps I enjoy with its WearOS counterparts. Having access to so much of the Google Play Store is great. When I install an app onto my phone while using my WearOS watch, I'll get a notification asking if I want to install its wearable companion. This continuity of services is a massive boon for Google's wearable platform. This is also true for third-party service integrations that are mostly absent from Samsung's offering.
I love the potential that is within this watch, but much of that has yet to be realized. Samsung released the Galaxy Watch Active 2 in mid-2019 with an ECG sensor; however, as of today, the watch still can't use it. The company also recently announced that blood pressure monitoring would be coming to the watch, but when that will be is still unkown.
Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 Should you buy it?
Sure the wireless charging is slow, the software is a bit confusing in places, and we're still waiting for Samsung to fulfill the feature promises it's made, but Galaxy Watch Active 2 is still fantastic. My nit-picking on notifications aside, I love this watch. Some much of my time with it has been nothing short of pure joy.
I can't say enough about the hardware. I love everything Samsung has done with it. As it typically does, Samsung offers choice within its products. There's a variety of case colors, materials, sizes, and even an option with LTE included. The choices continue with how you would like for your watch to behave when it's on your wrist.
From interaction with the watch to simply wearing it, the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is great. If you can get around the limited third-party apps, not having a capable voice assistant on board, and don't have as strict a set of notification requirements as I do, then you'll be delighted with this smartwatch. It's a health and fitness-focused device that looks far better than a basic fitness tracker, and it can do as much or as little as you choose.
Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2
If you want a smartwatch with serious fitness tracking capabilities, that also looks great, then the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is for you. The beautiful Super AMOLED display, along with the smart touch navigation ring, makes using the watch a joy.

Whether you're working at a Starbucks, trying to finish something up at the airport before your flight, or sitting in the public library, odds are you're connected to a network that isn't the most secure without even thinking about it. Daily we do things like accessing our bank account, pay bills, send personal emails, and much more, all while not knowing if someone is tracking these moves and getting ready to steal your information.
Sounds a bit scary, huh? Well, personal information is something that should be kept personal, and luckily there are some easy ways to protect yourself. Odds are, by now you've heard of Virtual Proxy Networks, or VPNs, but you may be wondering why you would want to invest in one, right? Some of them can be a bit expensive, and others are unusually cheap, leaving you wondering which to end up with. NordVPN is one of the many great services out there (it's on our list of favorites), and right now you can grab a three-year subscription to it for just $99.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
If you could protect yourself, and the information on your computer, from unprotected networks for just $2.75 a month, would you be interested? You should be! NordVPN offers double data encryption, which encrypts your data twice (and is the only company offering it), fast speeds, a strict no logs policy, automatic kill switch in case your VPN session drops off, and much more. The company has server locations in 57 different countries and covers every continent except for Antartica (because penguins don't browse the web!). Don't take our word for it, though. Check out this great review from the folks at Windows Central.
Purchasing a three-year subscription to the service scores you the discounted $2.75 a month rate, which equals a $99 one-time payment. You may be worried about investing in something you've never used before, but don't worry. NordVPN offers a 30-day money back guarantee, so there is no risk in trying its service. You won't know if a VPN works for you until you give it a shot. Here is a way to try it without worrying about losing a boatload of cash, and if you like it then you score a sweet deal on the next two years of protection!

After all, there are dozens if not hundreds of options on the market and you want to be sure that you're getting the best robot vacuum for your needs.
I've spent the last few weeks testing the 360 S9 robot vacuum. It's definitely not perfect, but it has one of the most intuitive and helpful apps I've ever seen. With its impressive suction, included remote control, and mapping abilities, it's definitely a great option for any home.
Reliable cleaning
360 S9 Robot Vacuum Cleaner
Bottom line: The dustbin and water tank are rather small, but this vacuum works really well by mapping your home, leaving perfect lines in your carpet, and allowing you to control it through the app. It's a great option for any home.
Pros
- Makes perfect vacuum lines
- Maps your house
- Phenomenal app and remote
- Runs up to 180 minutes
- Comes with universal adapters
- Mops and vacuums
Cons
- Only works with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi
- Small 420ml dustbin / 200ml water tank
- Low-quality sound
360 S9 Robot Vacuum Cleaner What I like
As with the best high-end robot vacuums, the 360 S9 cleans your floors in an orderly back and forth pattern and leaves perfect vacuum lines. The device also maps your home, allowing you to tell it exactly which rooms to clean and which ones to avoid.
Great functionality Suction and performance
The robot runs for up to 180 minutes if on its lowest settings, and when the battery gets low, it will run to the dock, charge up, and then resume where it left off. In all of the time that I spent testing it, it never got lost and only ever got stuck once when I accidentally left cables lying in its path. On top of that, it did an excellent job pulling in gobs dog and cat fur. That said, I did have to empty it more often than some other vacuums I've tested.
Something interesting is that the main plug works as a universal adapter. Simply slide in the contact points that work in your region and you can get it set up in no time. If you happen to be moving from one country to the next, you'll likely still be able to use this vacuum wherever you go.
Impressive app Intuitive and helpful
During one of my testing sessions, I realized that I'd forgotten to close a door in my house and the vacuum was cleaning a room I didn't want it to be in. I picked the robot up and placed it in the hallway. Not only did the vacuum realize that it had been moved, but the app asked me if I wanted to mark that area as a no-go zone. With just a few taps I was able to set up a virtual barrier.
The app also lets me view the path the vacuum has taken while cleaning my home, lets me set up cleaning schedules, adjust the vacuum's setting, and is just super intuitive to use. It automatically labeled different areas in my home, allowing me to create cleaning schedules where it only ever cleans specific areas of my house.
If you're not interested in using an app, this robot also comes with a remote control which allows you to turn the vacuum on, manually steer it, or send it back to its dock.
360 S9 Robot Vacuum Cleaner What I don't like
While I was seriously impressed by the vacuum's app and controls, it is rather lacking in other areas.
Connection limitations 2.4GHz Wi-Fi only
If you're using 5GHz Wi-Fi then you will not be able to control the robot with your phone. This is a pretty serious limitation for some folks. But once again, if you're planning on only using the remote control anyways, then this won't be a problem.
Smaller than average capacity Dustbin and water tank
This vacuum is better suited for smaller houses or apartments with pet-free homes.
When it comes to robot vacuums, it's best when they have a dustbin that's 500ml or larger. This allows the machine to pick up plenty of debris without running out of space, thus making the vacuum function more efficiently when cleaning your home. If you're someone like me who owns pets, then your dustbin will need to be emptied every day due to all the fur that gets sucked up.
Thing is, the 360 S9 only has a tiny 420ml dustbin and the water tank is especially small at only 200ml. That means you're going to need to empty out the refuse and fill the water more frequently than many other vacuums in order for this machine to function properly. That being the case, this vacuum is better suited for smaller houses or apartments with pet-free homes.
Bad sound quality Either the speaker or sound files
Now, I'm not entirely sure if it's actually the speaker or if it's the sound files associated with the vacuum, but whenever the robot tells me that it's performing a task, I cringe a little. The voice sounds compressed and a bit muffled, making it hard to understand when it's in another room. This has nothing to do with the actual performance of the vacuum, so if sound quality doesn't bother you, this won't be an issue.
360 S9 Robot Vacuum Cleaner Competition
If the 360 S9 isn't looking like the best robot vacuum for you home, you should check out these other options.
The Roborock S5 Max is a really impressive robot that's in the same league as the 360 S9. It does an excellent job picking up pet fur and other debris while also tidying your floors in tight back and forth passes.
ECOVACS Deebot Ozmo T8 AIVI is a bit more expensive than the 360 S9, but it's also a champion at avoiding obstacles thanks to its built-in camera. It supplies excellent suction and can even be used as a pet camera to check on your home while you're away.
iRobot Roomba i7 is an intelligent machine that provides excellent cleaning. You can control it via the app
360 S9 Robot Vacuum Cleaner Should you buy it?
Who it's for
- Those who want a super user-friendly app
- People with a smaller area to clean
- Anyone planning to move to another country
Who it isn't for
- Pet owners with particularly sheddy animals
- Those with large houses
- Anyone with 5GHz Wi-Fi
The 360 S9 has one of the best robot vacuum apps I have ever seen. It's super intuitive and allows you to make several customizations to your cleaning schedule and the vacuum settings. With it's orderly back and forth cleaning style, it's sure to mop and vacuum your floors clean.
If you're only needing a robot vacuum to clean up a small area or don't mind emptying out the dustbin on a regular basis then the 360 S9 is a great fit for you. Mind that the small dustbin will fill up incredibly quickly if the robot is tasked to picking up fur out of your carpets.

Google's new Shopping updates will help you find the best deals
As the holiday season approaches, Google rolls out updates to Shopping to keep you from getting ripped off.Under increased pressure from Chinese rivals, Samsung overhauled its budget strategy last year. The underwhelming Galaxy J series was gone, and the Galaxy A lineup essentially took its place. Samsung traditionally limited the Galaxy A series to the mid-range segment, but now it fields devices starting as low as $120 all the way to $600.
The new-found change in focus also came with better product releases. The Galaxy A50 was one of the best budget phones you could buy in 2019, featuring great hardware, a fresh design, and decent cameras. In typical Samsung fashion, the company introduced an updated model six months down the line in the Galaxy A50s, and now we have the Galaxy A51.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
The Galaxy A51 is a continuation of what Samsung has been doing in this segment for the last 12 months. There are a few enticing changes — particularly around the camera side of things — but the fundamentals are unchanged from last year. In fact, 80% of what I wrote in my Galaxy A50 review last year is relevant for the A51, because the underlying hardware hasn't changed much.
That said, the Galaxy A51 isn't a bad phone. If anything, the new design and the fact that it comes with One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 out of the box makes it a decent option for under $350. With the phone slated to go on sale in the U.S. and other global markets later this year, let's find out if it may just be the budget phone for you in 2020.
At a glance
Samsung Galaxy A51
Bottom line: The Galaxy A51 shares the same fundamentals of last year's A50 and A50s. The 48MP camera takes decent shots during the day, you get all-day battery life, a vibrant AMOLED display, 3.5mm jack, and Android 10. But the hardware just doesn't hold up in 2020, and there are much better alternatives available at the same price point.
The Good
- 48MP camera
- 3.5mm jack
- Gorgeous new design
- Long-lasting battery
- One UI 2.0 with Android 10
The Bad
- Aging hardware
- Laggy in daily use
- Low-light shots are unusable
- Macro lens is limited
Samsung Galaxy A51 Design and display
No other brand rolls out iterative updates quite like Samsung, and in the last five years it has managed to turn iteration into an art form. The Galaxy A51 takes a lot of cues from the A50s, which in turn was based on the A50. So essentially, a lot of the internal hardware that you get in the A51 is over a year old at this point.
But that doesn't mean there are no new features on the A51. Let's start with the back: the A51 has two diagonal lines across its surface that break up the design — just like the A50s — but this time there's a gradient effect that shows up when light hits the surface. That gradient effect is the basis for the device's colors, with the A51 available in Prism Crush Black, Prism Crush Blue, and Prism Crush White.
With a vibrant design and Infinity-O cutout, the Galaxy A51 is one of the best-looking phones Samsung has released.
The lower quadrants also feature subtle lines that further differentiates the design, and the overall effect is that the A51 is one of the best-looking phones Samsung has released to date. I'm using the blue option, and the vibrant color makes the phone stand out. Like last year, the back is made out of plastic, but the glossy finish gives it a glass-like feel. The best part is that it doesn't smudge as easily as a glass back, and it is more durable.
Another major change at the back is the camera housing. The rectangular camera housing is identical to that of the Galaxy S20 series, and it's clear that Samsung is trying to create a design identity here. While the camera housing is by no means attractive, it is consistent across all of Samsung's 2020 devices.
The major design change at the front is the Infinity-O cutout for the front camera module. Last year's A50 and A50s featured the Infinity-U cutout, and the cutout on the A51 is smaller and better integrated into the design. The bezels are razor-thin this time around, and it makes using the A51 that much more enticing.
Rounding out the design, you'll find the power and volume buttons on the right, and the 3.5mm jack, USB-C charging port, and a solitary speaker at the bottom. Samsung has also moved away from the 3.5mm jack on its flagships, so it's good to see the analog jack intact on the A51. The SIM card tray is on the left, and you get the option to slot two SIM cards as well as a MicroSD card. Of course, the variant of the A51 sold in global markets will likely have a single SIM slot.
The Galaxy A51 is astonishingly light at 172g for a phone that has a 4000mAh battery, and it has a great in-hand feel thanks to the subtle curves at the back. With a width of 73.6mm, the phone is also narrow, and while it isn't conducive for one-handed usage, it is on the lower end of the scale as far as phone sizes go in 2020.
The Galaxy A51 has the same AMOLED display as last year's A50, but that's not a bad thing.
Coming to the screen, the Galaxy A51 has a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display that ticks all the right boxes. Colors are vibrant, you get decent viewing angles, and there weren't any issues while using the screen under harsh sunlight. You get to choose from Natural or Vivid picture modes, and there's no option to manually tweak the color balance of the screen.
But you do a blue light filter that can be customized to run from sunset to sunrise, and you get the other scaling and font sizing options that are standard on all Samsung phones. The screen is protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass 3, another area that's unchanged from last year. That's true for the panel quality itself — other than the switch to an Infinity-O cutout and a minor 0.1-inch increase in screen size, there isn't any difference from the A50 or A50s. That's not necessarily a bad thing though, as the screen holds up just fine in 2020.
Samsung Galaxy A51 Hardware
Samsung has been recycling hardware on its phones for several years, and it's no different on the Galaxy A51. The phone is powered by the Exynos 9611, the same as the A50s. The A50 had the Exynos 9610, and while the Exynos 9611 is marketed as a new chipset, the only difference from the 9610 is that it can facilitate 48MP camera modules. Both the 9610 and 9611 use the same set of cores and the same Mali G72 for visuals, and they're both fabricated on a 10nm node.

If anything, Samsung is shortchanging buyers on the storage front this year, with the A51 offering UFS 2.0 storage whereas last year's A50 and A50s had UFS 2.1 storage. Let's get back to the hardware, because Samsung's decision to use the Exynos 9611 in the A51 makes things sluggish in day-to-day use. The chipset has four Cortex A73 cores at 2.3GHz and four energy-efficient A53 cores at 1.7GHz, and there's just not enough grunt to handle even basic tasks like web browsing.
You will notice lag at times even while navigating the user interface, with actions like opening the app drawer causing a negligible delay. Then there's the issue of gaming, and the Mali G72 just does not hold up in titles like PUBG and Fortnite. If you're serious about mobile gaming, you're better off picking a phone with a Snapdragon 730 instead. The A51 is barely adequate even for everyday use — you should not be able to see lag when exiting an app to go to the home screen.
The phone is available with 6GB/128GB and 8GB/128GB variants in India, but in other markets Samsung will offer the A51 with a 4GB option. There's a MicroSD slot that can accommodate cards up to 512GB in size, and you also get NFC with Samsung Pay, Bluetooth 5.0 LE, FM radio, and Wi-Fi ac. The optical in-display fingerprint sensor is fast and reliable, and I didn't face any issues with it.
On the connectivity front, the A51 has LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/17/20/26/28/38/40/41/66. That should be more than adequate to connect to most LTE networks around the world, and with the phone slated to go on sale in global markets, Samsung will tailor LTE bands according to the region.
Yet another area where things are unchanged is battery. The A51 has the same 4000mAh battery with 15W fast charging, and I didn't have any issues with battery longevity. The phone manages to last a day with ease, and although the hardware itself hasn't changed from the A50, I got better battery usage figures on the A51.
Samsung Galaxy A51 Software
One of the highlights of the A51 is that it comes with One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 out of the box. That wasn't always the case with Samsung's budget phones, so it is great to see the manufacturer offer its latest UI on all of its 2020 phones. One UI 2.0 integrates Android 10's system-wide dark mode, and you also get the ability to choose from Android 10's default navigation gestures or Samsung's take.
One UI 2.0 comes with Android 10 and a treasure trove of customization options.
Samsung's gestures include designated zones at the bottom of the screen from where you swipe up. It is an elegant solution, and is easier to get acclimated to if you're switching from the legacy navigation keys. But the fact that you also get Android 10's gestures — with the swipe-in from either side to go back, and swipe up from the bottom of the screen to go to the home screen — makes it that much more enticing.
Samsung has always offered a healthy list of customization features, and it's no different on the A51. You now get Edge screen, with the ability to configure pull-out Edge panels and set up Edge lighting for incoming notifications and calls. Edge lighting makes up for the fact that phones these days don't have an LED notification light, and there's just a lot of customizability to choose from here.
The A51 also has software-based face unlock, and while it isn't as secure as a fingerprint reader, it is fast. Elsewhere, you get the ability to use two instances of an app at once, Bixby, off-screen gestures, Digital Wellbeing controls, and one-handed mode. Samsung made a dedicated effort to modernize its UI in recent years, and the result is that One UI 2.0 feels modern and a far cry from the TouchWiz days.
Samsung Galaxy A51 Camera
The highlight with the Galaxy A51 is the quad camera array at the back: there's now a 48MP primary camera joined by a 12MP wide-angle lens, 5MP macro shooter, and another 5MP lens for portrait mode. You get a 32MP camera up front, which is a minor upgrade from the 25MP shooter on last year's A50.
The camera interface itself should be immediately familiar if you've used a Samsung phone recently. The main shooting modes are laid out in a ribbon at the bottom, and you can edit these as needed based on your preferences. There are toggles for flash, timer, filters and beautify effects, and you can easily switch between the primary lens and wide-angle shooter.
The 48MP camera is a known quantity at this point, and it takes great shots in daylight conditions. Resultant images have plenty of detail and decent dynamic range, and you get those saturated colors that define Samsung's cameras. One of the biggest changes Samsung made in 2020 is with the ultra-wide lens, with the shooter managing to produce shots with the same level of detail as the primary lens.
As good as the A51 is in daylight conditions, shots in artificial or low lighting are a blotchy mess. There's far too much noise, colors are washed out, and the final images are just nowhere near good enough for sharing on social platforms.
The macro lens does not have autofocus, and it struggles to dial in on busy subjects, like a watch face. Regardless of what I tried, I could not get it to focus on the watch face of my Promaster Skyhawk, and although the 5MP resolution is higher than what you get with most other phones, the macro lens is still very limited in its usability.
Samsung Galaxy A51 Should you buy it?
The Galaxy A51 isn't vastly different from what Samsung offered in this segment last year, but the upgrades to the camera and design allow it to stand out. The 48MP camera takes decent shots during the day, the display is one of the best you'll find in this segment, the battery life is fantastic, and you get the latest One UI 2.0 based on Android 10.
There are far too many trade-offs here to justify the $350 price tag.
That said, the hardware is slow compared to the rest of the field, and you will see noticeable lag in day-to-day use. Also, it doesn't make sense to switch to the Galaxy A51 if you're already using the A50 or A50s, because for the most part this is the same phone that Samsung released last year.
Obviously, the Galaxy A51 doesn't make much sense for the Indian market, because there are phones that offer much better value and beefier hardware in 2020. The Realme X2 Pro, Redmi K20, or the POCO X2 would be a better option if you're in the market for a phone under ₹25,000 ($350).
However, none of those phones will make it to most Western markets — unlike the Galaxy A51. The A51 will be going on sale in the U.S. and other global markets in a few months, and while there aren't many devices at the $350 price point, there are a few options like the Pixel 3a. If you're spending $350 on a phone in 2020, you'll want usable hardware, and the A51 fails to deliver on that front.
If you want to save some cash, you can just get the Galaxy A50s for ₹19,999 ($280) and get a phone that's nearly identical to the A51. Or if you're in the market for a device for gaming, the POCO X2 at ₹16,999 ($236) is my recommendation.
There aren't many alternatives to the Galaxy A51 in global markets. Samsung dominated with the Galaxy A50 last year for this reason alone, and while the phone by itself had a lot going for it, that isn't the case with the Galaxy A51. If you need a phone for under $400, you should pick up the Pixel 3a or wait for Google to launch the Pixel 4a series.
Too little too late

Decent design letdown by poor hardware.
The Galaxy A51 shares the same fundamentals of last year's A50 and A50s.

But the hardware just doesn't hold up in 2020, and there are much better alternatives available at the same price point.

Keep your Galaxy A51 in tip-top shape with the best cases
It's tough when you end up scratching or dropping your new phone, especially when you have a phone as great as the Galaxy A51. These are the best cases that you can get to help assist against any potential damage that could happen.The Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 have a lot of great things going for them, but battery life isn't one of them. Both headsets get between two and three hours of battery life in most situations. This has led to a growing range of battery packs, straps, and attachments to improve the battery life of the popular line of VR headsets.
NIVRANA reached out to me and sent over a NIVRANA Battery Pack for review. While this particular unit was built for the original Oculus Quest, the company has a variant for the Oculus Quest 2 up for preorder that is quite similar. To be completely honest, the version for the original Oculus Quest should work on either headset, and the battery pack for the Oculus Quest 2 looks similar, apart from its color.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
The NIVRANA Battery Pack is currently available for $30 from NIVRANA. Preordering the Oculus Quest 2 version costs the same $30.
Comfortable and balanced
NIVRANA Battery Pack for Oculus Quest
Bottom line: This battery pack is well-balanced, comfortable, and adds plenty of juice to your VR headset. I found using it more comfortable than having no battery pack on at all.
Pros:
- Massive 10,000 mAh battery
- Extremely comfortable
- Included wire is a nice length
Cons:
- A bit pricey
NIVRANA Battery Pack for Oculus Quest What I like
The design of the NIVRANA Battery Pack is straightforward and effective. The heart of the setup is a rectangular 10,000 mAh battery pack. It has two USB-A out ports, one that's 5V/2.4A and another that's 5V/3A. It also has a USB-C port that supports both input and output at 5V/2A.
The included cable has USB-C on one side and USB-A on the other, so you can use it to charge the battery pack with it then flip it around to charge the Oculus Quest while playing.
The battery pack supports passthrough charging, so if you'd like, you can charge the battery pack while it charges your headset. I wouldn't recommend that setup though as it'd involve multiple wires. The battery pack is large enough that between it and the headset you should be able to play for quite a while without a plug.
The battery pack sits inside a neoprene or neoprene-esque pouch that snaps closed around the Oculus Quest's head strap. The pouch is smooth and cool to the touch, which makes it quite comfortable to wear. An elastic strap wraps around the battery pack to hold it in place while you jump around.
I found the NIVRANA Battery Pack to be surprisingly comfortable. It isn't too heavy at 240g, but it counterbalances the front-heavy Oculus Quest beautifully. Strictly in terms of comfort, I actually prefer using the NIVRANA Battery Pack to not having a battery pack at all. Add in the fact that it has a massive battery, and it's a winner in my book.
NIVRANA Battery Pack for Oculus Quest What I dislike
There's not much to dislike about the NIVRANA Battery Pack. My biggest complaint is that its retail price is a bit high. Even though I like the battery pack a lot, I think $50 is too much for it. If you can grab a unit for the original Quest on sale or preorder the Oculus Quest 2 version for $30, I think that's a fair asking price.
NIVRANA includes some nice items in the box to go along with the battery pack that somewhat justifies the price. The carrying case is quite nice, and I like the pouch on the inside for storing microfiber cloths and other little bits. That being said, I think $50 is a bit too much for a battery pack.
For reference, you can get 10,000 mAh battery packs from well-known brands like Anker for $20. Are the add-ons and the pouch for attaching the pack to the headset worth $30? Probably not. Are they worth $10, which is what you're effectively paying when the IVRANA Battery Pack is on sale? Absolutely.
NIVRANA Battery Pack for Oculus Quest The competition
With battery packs gaining a significant market during the life of the original Oculus Quest, Facebook took notice and developed its own solutions. The Quest 2 Elite Strap with Battery is a premium strap with a built-in battery. If sold on its own, that strap would be real competition for the NIVRANA Battery Pack, but right now, you can only get the Quest 2 Elite Strap with Battery as part of a bundle that costs $129. That's a pretty significant jump from NIVRANA's offering, especially when compared to the NIVRANA sale price.
While they probably won't be as comfortable as the NIVRANA Battery Pack for Oculus Quest, there are power bank straps available. These let you attach a power bank you already have to the Oculus Quest or other VR headsets. If you already have a power bank, a strap is a nice way to save some money.
NIVRANA Battery Pack for Oculus Quest Should you buy it?
You should buy this if ...
You find the battery pack on sale
It's pretty easy to recommend the NIVRANA Battery Pack for Oculus Quest if you can get it for $30. It's comfortable, balances out the Oculus Quest, and adds a 10,000 mAh battery to your headset. Its $50 retail price is a bit harder to swallow, but it is a nice battery pack. I also like the fact that everything comes inside a convenient carrying case.
You should not buy this if ...
You already have a battery pack that you could
If you have your own battery bank, you can grab a powerbank strap that lets you use your current power bank with your VR headset. It might not be as comfortable, but it will save you money.
You can't find it on sale
I can't recommend this battery pack for its full retail price of $50. It's nice, but it's not worth the price difference between it and a normal battery bank.
Following this review, I'm adding the NIVRANA Battery Pack to our collection of the best accessories for the Oculus Quest. If the version for the Oculus Quest 2 meets the same standard, I expect it to appear on our best accessories for the Oculus Quest 2 list as well.
The NIVRANA Battery Pack for Oculus Quest left a good first impression with its nice carrying case and packaging, and that positive impression remained throughout my review. The battery itself is compact and easy to charge, and the pouch that allows it to attach to the Oculus Quest is comfortable and cool to the touch.
The most noticeable difference is that the NIVRANA Battery Pack for Oculus Quest balances the front-heavy Oculus Quest. The front of the Oculus Quest didn't press against my face as much while I had the NIVRANA Battery Pack for Oculus Quest on. I'd leave the battery pack in place even if it was dead, simply to keep the balanced feel it provides.

If you want to switch the Oculus account in use, you'll need to do a Factory reset on your headset. The good news is that you have two options to reset your headset, and both of them are simple.
How to reset using the Oculus app
- Open the Oculus App on your phone.
- Tap Settings in the bottom right corner. It is an icon that looks like a gear.
- Tap the Oculus Quest connected to your phone.
Tap More Settings.
- Tap Factory Reset.
- Tap Reset
How to reset using the headset
- Turn off your Oculus Quest.
- Hold down the power button and lower volumebutton down until the boot screen loads on your headset.
- Use the volume buttons to highlight Factory reset.
- Press the power button to select it.
A factory reset might seem like a bit much, but it's currently the only method that lets you switch user accounts. After you finish performing a factory reset on your Quest, you'll need to set it back up again from scratch. This means logging into the account you want, going through the steps to pair it, pairing the controllers, and connecting your Oculus Quest to a Wi-Fi network. From beginning a factory reset to being back online and gaming, it shouldnt take anymore than 15-20 minutes.
Untethered and Awesome

The best wireless chargers for the Note 20 are consistent, stylish, and speedy. They should never make you guess whether your phone is lined up properly, nor should they leave you waiting and waiting on a sluggish 5W charge instead of Samsung's Fast Charge wireless profiles. These are the best and brightest wireless chargers for the Samsung Galaxy Note 20, whether you need something light and nimble for your cubicle at work or need a sturdy stand for your nightstand.
- Fastest speed: Samsung 15W Fast Charge 2.0 Wireless Charger Stand
- Value pick: AUKEY USB-C Wireless Charger
- Charge it all: Samsung Wireless Charger Duo Pad
- Up or down: Spigen SteadiBoost Flex
- Charge your way: Ampere Unravel 3+1
- Fabric feel for less: RATEL Wireless Charger
- At home and on the go: Samsung Super Fast 25W Portable Wireless Charger (10,000mAh)
- Travel-friendly: ESR Mini Portable Wireless Charger
Fastest speed: Samsung 15W Fast Charge 2.0 Wireless Charger Stand
This is just about the only charger that actually charges the Note 20 at 15W, since most third-party 15W chargers use a different protocol than Samsung's Fast Charge 2.0.
Value pick: AUKEY USB-C Wireless Charger
This hockey pick-sized Qi charger will charge the Note 20 at 10W and won't stick out with its understated squircle design. It doesn't come with a QuickCharge wall adapter, but chances are you already have six at home.
Charge it all: Samsung Wireless Charger Duo Pad
If you have a Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Buds and a Note 20, this pad is perfectly suited to charging both at the same time. The right-hand pad is sculpted so its easier to align smaller accessories, and both pads can wireless charge a phone.
Up or down: Spigen SteadiBoost Flex
Can't decide if you want a vertical stand or a flat charging pad? Get you a charger that can do both! Spigen's convertible stand will charge the Note 20 at 10W whether you use it propped up or laying down.
Charge your way: Ampere Unravel 3+1
Few Qi chargers accept Power Delivery input, but the Unravel needs that higher power in order to charge three devices at 10W at the same time. You can also rearrange it as a stand or accordion-fold it to save desk space.
Fabric feel for less: RATEL Wireless Charger
This phenomenally thin pad is great for crowded desks and tiny nightstands. The top of this pad is covered in soft-touch fabric and it uses USB-C rather than the outdated Micro-USB port most value Qi chargers do.
At home and on the go: Samsung Super Fast 25W Portable Wireless Charger (10,000mAh)
The wireless charging speed here might not be as fast, but it makes up for it with the ability to be a power bank when you're traveling and a wireless charging pad when you're safe at home.
Travel-friendly: ESR Mini Portable Wireless Charger
This wireless charger comes with a silicone cover that serves two purposes. It can help block the indicator light so it doesn't keep you up at night, and it's also a cable organizer so you can keep things tidy while traveling.
What are the best wireless chargers for the Galaxy Note 20?
There are multitudes of wireless chargers out there, but if you want to charge the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 at the full 15W Samsung advertises, you'll have to stick to first-party chargers with the Samsung 15W Fast Charge 2.0 Wireless Charger Stand. 15W charging is only supported by a handful of Samsung phones — from the Galaxy S10 series to the Note 20 series — and as such there's only one Samsung wireless charge model so far to support it.
If you're happy charging at 10W instead, your options absolutely explode. If your Note 20 came with Galaxy Buds — or you used that pre-order credit for a Galaxy Watch Active 2 — then you'll probably want to opt for the Samsung Duo Pad so you can charge both devices easily without wires covering your nightstand. There's also a plethora of inexpensive wireless chargers like the AUKEY USB-C Wireless Charger that are perfect for plopping on your desk or in the living room so you can top off while watching TV with the family.
Just keep in mind most of these chargers need a Qualcomm QuickCharge 2.0/3.0 charger to power them if they don't have a wall plug in the box. The chargers that Samsung phones used to come with, the ones with USB-A, those are perfect for these if you still have them laying around, but if you don't. QC 3.0 chargers are plentiful and affordable these days.

- Untethered VR experience: Oculus Quest (From $399 on Amazon)
What are your rights?
The Oculus Quest warranty is a pretty standard warranty. The main purpose of the warranty is to ensure the device works as intended. This covers things such as manufacturer defects and other flaws caused by Oculus or their partners.
However, many people might think a warranty covers accidental damage, or other external factors after you purchase the Quest, but this is not the case. Damage from accidents or other misuse are specifically excluded from the warranty.
Other types of damage
Many other types of damage are not covered by the warranty. Another big one is food or drink. Liquid damage is a big problem for VR users, since only a small amount of moisture can damage the sensitive internal parts. Modifying your Quest in any way also voids the warranty. For example, replacing the lenses or other parts with your own will definitely void it.
This warranty also does not apply in the case of resell. Another thing not covered by the warranty is data loss, so it is important to take care of your software by frequently backing things up. In the case of apps on the Oculus store, you always have the ability to download your old purchases, so data loss is easy to avoid.
Getting in touch with Oculus for repairs
Should you find yourself needing to repair your Quest, you can submit a support ticket here to get in touch with Oculus Support. Submitting the ticket takes just a couple of minutes, and once you send it off, Oculus says you can expect a response within one to two business days.

Get to gaming!
The Oculus Quest 2 has hundreds of games and apps available, and its library grows just about every week. These titles range from melee combat to shooters to nightmare-inducing horror games. The game that will get you on your feet and be the life of any party is Beat Saber. Its easy game mechanics mean anyone can jump in and start playing right away, but its range of difficulty levels and variety of songs will keep even the most skilled veterans engaged.
Echo VR is unique, immersive, and a blast to play. It's basically zero-gravity sports which cranks up the intensity through the 360-degree viewing ranges of VR.
Superhot VR is one of the first games that a lot of people grab for the Oculus Quest line. It's a different kind of shooter that has the world speed up and slow down to match your pace. You can dodge bullets, blast away enemies, and pick the speed you want to clear levels.
While we do our best to make sure every game available at launch arrives on this list, we don't always catch them all. We aren't Ash Ketchum. We will continue to update this as and when we can, to make sure it is as up to date as possible.

Wyze Cam Outdoor
Don't miss it
Blink Outdoor
When you look at the Wyze Cam Outdoor vs. Blink Outdoor camera, you're considering two of the best values in home security technology. Both come in at under $100 with hubs, have limited free cloud storage, and local storage options have incredible battery life. So just what sets them apart, and why would you choose one over the other? Let's get into those questions now.
Wyze Cam Outdoor vs. Blink Outdoor: Spec comparison
These two tiny outdoor security cameras have so much in common that you might just think they're related. Some of the differences between the two are minor or even superficial, but there are a couple of reasons why you might want to pick one over the other. Specifically, those reasons come down to overall battery life and smart assistant compatibility.
|Wyze Cam Outdoor||Blink Outdoor|
|Dimensions||2.3 x 2.3 x 2.8 inches||2.8 x 2.8 x 1.4 inches|
|Weight||9.8 oz / 277 g||1.7 oz / 48 g|
|Temperature range||-4ºF to 120ºF||-4ºF to 113ºF|
|Colors||White||Black|
|Field of view (FOV)||110º||110º diagonal|
|Frames per second (FPS)||Up to 20||Up to 30|
|Resolution||1080p HD||1080p HD|
|Battery life||Built-in; lasts 3-6 months on a charge||Up to 2 years on 2 AA batteries (included); upcoming option for separate Battery Extender that runs on 4 AA batteries for up to 4 years|
|Audio||2-way with speaker||2-way with speaker|
|Cloud storage||Free 14-day storage; no subscription required||Free through 2020, then $3/month per camera or $10/month for unlimited cameras|
|Local storage||Yes, up to 32GB via microSD card on both camera and base station||Yes, up to 64GB using the included Blink Sync Module 2|
|Motion detection||Yes||Yes|
|Privacy zones||Yes||Yes|
|Weather resistance||IP65||Yes; Amazon doesn't give a specific rating|
|Smart home compatibility||Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, IFTTT||Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, IFTTT|
Wyze Cam Outdoor vs. Blink Outdoor: Similarities
As we mentioned, these two camera systems have a lot in common. Even though the Wyze Cam Outdoor is shaped like a cube and the Blink Outdoor like a square, their dimensions on two of the three axes are nearly the same. They can also operate in nearly identical temperature ranges (the Wyze Cam Outdoor technically wins out here on the upper end). Both have a wide 110-degree field of views, though the Blink Outdoor's is diagonal.
Both cameras record at 1080p, both are capable of two-way audio, motion detection, and custom privacy zones, and both have a degree of weather-resistance, limited free cloud storage, along with local and on-device storage.
Wyze Cam Outdoor vs. Blink Outdoor: Differences
With so many similarities, you might be more confused than ever as to which device to buy. If that's the case, consider the areas in which these two security cameras differ.
While these are largely cosmetic differences, it's worth noting the Wyze Cam Outdoor is only available in white, while the Blink Outdoor is only available in black. That won't matter much for most people, but if it's important to you that your security camera blend in (or stick out), you'll want to consider which best matches your home's decor. The Wyze Cam Outdoor weighs also significantly more than the Blink Outdoor, though it comes with a mount, so that shouldn't really make too much of a difference in your decision process.
Both cameras sport amazing battery life, though the Blink Outdoor wins this contest by a wide margin. It can last up to two years with its two AA batteries (which are included), and you can even purchase an expansion pack to double that up to four years. The Wyze Cam Outdoor has a respectable 3-6-month battery life thanks to a built-in battery, and you can recharge it in just a few hours through a Micro-USB cable.
Both of these devices work great with Alexa and Amazon Echo and Fire products, though only the Wyze works with the Google Assistant. If you have a Nest Hub/Max or similar product, you're going to want to skip the Blink Outdoor.
Finally, we come to the price. While each camera comes in under that $100 price point, the Wyze Cam Outdoor is significantly cheaper than the Blink Outdoor. If you pre-order from Wyze's website, you can get the bundle with the included hub for just $50, and even at retailers like Home Depot, the package is $70. The Blink Outdoor, on the other hand, comes in at $90. Blink does win in bulk, though, as you can purchase it in packs up to five, whereas the Wyze Cam Outdoor only has individual supplemental units for sale.
Wyze Cam Outdoor vs. Blink Outdoor: Which should you buy?
While you can't really go wrong with either outdoor security camera, I think the best choice for most people will be the Wyze Cam Outdoor. It offers nearly identical functionality and multi-smart assistant compatibility, for much less the Blink Outdoor camera. However, if you need an affordable smart outdoor camera right now and are comfortable in the Amazon ecosystem, the Blink Outdoor is the way to go.

The Oculus Quest provides a completely untethered VR experience, but if you want to play for more than a few hours, you'll need to plug in your device. The Oculus Quest uses a USB-C charging port that can also transfer data, but using a magnetic attachment will help protect your port and also make using it even easier. By attaching magnetically, these cables and adapter make it, so your headset isn't yanked to the ground if you accidentally pull on the cable.
- Best overall: Knaive USB C Magnetic Adapter
- Best budget: NetDot Gen12 Micro USB and USB-C Magnetic Fast Charging Data Transfer Cable
- Best for battery packs: NetDot Gen10 Micro USB and USB-C Nylon Braided Magnetic Fast Charging Cable
- Best circular design: Kyerivs Magnetic USB Charging Cable
Best overall: Knaive USB C Magnetic Adapter
This magnetic adapter supports 20V/5A Quick Charge, data transfers up to 10Gbps, and works with the USB-C cables you already own, including the USB-C cable that ships with the Oculus Quest. The connector also rests at a 90-degree angle, which allows you to point a cable directly up or directly down depending on how you're charging the device.
Unlike some of its competitors, this adapter has a reversible design, meaning you don't have to worry about which way you connect your cable to the device. It also has an LED indicator to help you make sure your Oculus Quest is charging.
Pros:
Cons:
Best overall
Knaive USB C Magnetic Adapter
Power and data
This reversible adapter supports quick charging and works with the USB-C cables you already have. It will easily connect to your Oculus Quest.
Best budget: NetDot Gen12 Micro USB and USB-C Magnetic Fast Charging Data Transfer Cable
These cables have a magnetic attachment on the end that can work with USB-C and Micro-USB thanks to their interchangeable heads. As a result, they can work with the Oculus Quest using USB-C and older devices with Micro-USB.
Their circular head design means that you can charge your Oculus Quest at any angle that you'd like. They also come at a bargain since a three-pack of cables that are over six feet long is cheaper than some Youcables on their own. These longer cables are great for plugging your Oculus Quest directly into the wall but are too long to be used with battery packs kept on the headset or in your pocket.
Pros:
- Circular design means you can charge at any angle
- Option for long cable
- Three-pack at an affordable price
Cons:
Best budget
NetDot Gen12 Micro USB and USB-C Magnetic Fast Charging Data Transfer Cable
Long and affordable
These cables come with magnetic attachments that allow you to charge your Oculus Quest at any angle. They're available in lengths up to 6'6" so they're long enough to plug into the wall while you're wearing the headset.
Best for battery packs: NetDot Gen10 Micro USB and USB-C Nylon Braided Magnetic Fast Charging Cable
Many Oculus Quest users want to extend their playing time with external battery packs. These can be mounted to the back of your headset so you can continue to play while you charge, but also help counterbalance the front-heavy headset. This magnetic cable is only a foot long, so it won't have a lot of excess wiring in the way while it's plugged in. It supports charging up to 9V/2A, and will easily detach if bumped while playing.
If you use a battery pack, you can move around freely while still charging your device. You'll still have a wire plugged into your headset, but mounting a battery pack to your headset means you can freely walk around. It's more convenient and portable than plugging your headset directly into a wall outlet, which tethers you to the wall. This cable is only a foot long, which means it can plug into the side of your headset and attach to a battery pack mounted on the back of your device.
Pros:
Cons:
Best for battery packs
NetDot Gen10 Micro USB and USB-C Nylon Braided Magnetic Fast Charging Cable
Out of the way
This cable is short enough that there won't be wires in the way if you wear your Oculus Quest while charging it.
Best circular design: Kyerivs Magnetic USB Charging Cable
This braided cable features a circular design that gives you more flexibility because it can charge at any angle. It also supports fast charging up to 5V/2.4A and has an LED indicator to let you know that it's charging your device. At 3.3 feet, this cable is the right length to use with a battery pack that you keep in your pocket or attached to your waist.
If you attach this cable to your headset and use it with a battery pack on your waist or in your pocket, you'll be less constricted. The 360-degree design of this cable means that the cable doesn't have to point directly up, down, back, or forward. Instead, it can comfortably slide into the perfect angle for you.
Pros:
- Charge your device at any angle with circular design
- Supports fast charging
- Long enough to work with a battery pack on your hip
Cons:
Best circular design
Kyerivs Magnetic USB Charging Cable
Supporting all angles
This magnetic cable has a circular head that supports 360 degrees of movement. It also supports fast charging and has an LED light.
Bottom line
While the Oculus Quest provides an untethered VR experience, longer play sessions might need a cable to keep the device charged. Additionally, it can be easier and more convenient to use a magnetic cable, which can just pop on and off while protecting the port and your gameplay experience (you don't want to accidentally yank it out while you're playing). The Knaive USB C Magnetic Adapter is an excellent adapter because it works with USB-C cables you already have, including the one that ships with the Oculus Quest. Even better, it supports fast data transfer speeds so that you can get the best of all worlds.
If you're on a budget, the NetDot Gen12 Micro USB and USB-C Magnetic Fast Charging Data Transfer Cable includes three cables that work well with the Oculus Quest and other devices. Because they're cables and not just adapters, you won't need to take a cable from somewhere else in your house to keep your Quest charged.

I had the chance to do a Roborock S6 MaxV review earlier this year and I've loved it so much that I continue to use it every day.
So what makes this robot vacuum so special? To start off, Roborocks are some of my favorite robot vacuums. They all vacuum in a tidy back and forth fashion for those perfect vacuum lines. This particular unit also has a long battery life and offers powerful suction that truly cleans your floors. I'm a pet owner, so I also love how much it cleans up my dog and cat's fur. The Roborock S6 MaxV is a high-end unit that features a dual camera and ReactiveAI technology. It usually sells for $750, but during Prime Day, it's only $600
Robomaid
Roborock S6 MaxV
Object detection and excellent suction
This robot vacuum employs a dual camera so that it can detect and avoid obstacles on your floors better than most other vacuums out there. It's also an intelligent learner, so it will become more accurate as time goes on. When you're away, you can even use the app to check on your home through the robot vacuum's camera.
It can detect obstacles on your floors, like shoes, large cables, and shoeboxes, and then purposely avoids them. That way you don't have to babysit it as you do with some other robot vacuums out there. You'll still want to pick up before a cleaning session starts, but it's less likely to suck up things it shouldn't.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Additionally, the app allows you to control the robot and view the camera feed from anywhere as long as you're connected to the internet. That way, you can use the Roborock S6 MaxV to check on your home when you're away. It's a remarkable device that will help keep your home nice and clean. It really is one of the best robot vacuums for a variety of homes.

The Oculus Quest 2 is lighter, more comfortable, and more powerful than the original Oculus Quest. Facebook refined its design to be more comfortable on your head and in your hands, but that doesn't mean you can't improve it even further with some accessories. From headphones built specifically for the Quest 2 to a device to let you cast your Quest 2 to a TV, these are the best Oculus Quest 2 accessories. You can preorder the Oculus Quest 2 now, so you can jump straight into things on Oct. 13.

The Quest 2 Elite Strap replaces the standard strap that ships with the headset. The Elite Strap is more ergonomic and has a fit wheel that lets you twist the headset to a nice, snug fit.
In ear for the next gen: Logitech G333 VR gaming earphones
Logitech and Facebook worked together to create these in-ear headphones. The cables are just the right length to work with the headset, and they have dedicated audio drivers for highs, mids, and bass to immerse you into your apps and games.
Over ear for the next gen: Logitech G PRO Gaming Headset
Facebook and Logitech also worked together to make these over-ear headphones. They also have a cable that's just the right length to work with the Oculus Quest 2, and they have a memory foam headband and earpads for all-day comfort.
Keep it protected: Oculus Quest 2 Carrying Case
This case will cradle the Oculus Quest 2 headset and its Touch Controllers, making it easy to carry around without it being exposed to the world while on the go.
Go for the combo: Quest 2 Elite Strap with Battery and Carrying Case
This combo pack is the only way to get an Elite Strap that has a battery pack built right in. It also comes with a case to keep your headset and Touch Controllers protected.

Play PCVR: Oculus Link Cable
With this cable, you can play PCVR games on your Oculus Quest. It's 16 feet long, making it easy to connect to your gaming PC.
Share with friends: Google Chromecast Ultra
The Oculus Quest 2 is the latest and greatest way to jump into virtual reality, so you'll want to share it with your friends. You can cast your Oculus Quest 2 gameplay to a Google Chromecast Ultra to show off your VR fun on your TV.
Play all day: Energizer Rechargeable batteries
Both Touch Controllers for the Oculus Quest 2 need a AA battery. It's an awful feeling when you want to play on your VR headset and have to fiddle around to find batteries with juice. These rechargeable batteries make it easy to play all day long.
Keep it clean: Microfiber cloths
The Oculus Quest 2 has an impressive 90Hz display, but that doesn't mean much if it's covered in sweat and grime. These microfiber cloths make it easy to keep your Oculus Quest 2 clean and can also tidy up your smartphone and other devices.
Stay connected: Anker USB-C to USB 3.0 cable
The Oculus Quest 2's USB-C port can be used for charging the headset from a wall outlet, but it can also work with a battery pack. This cable from Anker makes it easy to connect your Oculus Quest 2 to power bricks and banks that use USB-A. It's also handy for connecting your headset to a computer to transfer files.
If we're making some suggestions
The Oculus Quest 2 provides an excellent experience on its own, but the best Oculus Quest 2 accessories in this collection help make it even better. The Quest 2 Elite Strap will make your headset more comfortable. It has a wheel that lets you easily adjust the strap, and it has a more ergonomic design than the one that ships with the Quest 2.
If you have a gaming PC, an Oculus Link Cable is a must-have accessory for the Oculus Quest 2. It allows you to play PCVR on your Oculus Quest 2 and its 90Hz display.
The Oculus Quest 2 often lets a little bit of light in around the nose gap. You can close that up with the Quest 2 Fit Pack, which comes with light blockers as well as different facial interfaces to get your Quest 2 to fit your face well.

The Oculus Quest supports two Touch Controllers, and each requires a single AA battery. The Touch Controllers are the only part of the Oculus Quest that requires you to swap anything out (the headset itself charges through USB-C, and there's no need for external sensors). The Touch Controllers don't drain a charge nearly as quickly as the headset, but you need to have a way to keep them charged, like some spare batteries.
- Best rechargable: Panasonic eneloop rechargeable
- Charging Panasonic batteries: Panasonic eneloop charger
- Rechargeable and budget friendly: AmazonBasics AA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries
- Recharging AmazonBasics batteries: AmazonBasics battery charger
- Best Lithium: Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA Batteries
- Best Alkaline: EnergizerMax Alkaline Battery
- Great bargain: Rayovac AA batteries
Best rechargable: Panasonic eneloop rechargeable
These rechargeable batteries store up to 2,000 mAh of power and can be recharged up to 2,100 times. They can be charged completely from dead or partially charged without damaging the energy storage memory. You can purchase just the batteries or add a quick charger, standard charger, or USB charger.
Charging Panasonic batteries: Panasonic eneloop charger
This charger will take your Panasonic Eneloop batteries from dead to charged in up to two hours. It has an LED indicator to help you know when your batteries are done charging and automatically shuts off to protect your batteries.
Rechargeable and budget friendly: AmazonBasics AA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries
These rechargeable batteries are budget-friendly but have a large 2,400 mAh capacity. They'll maintain 65% of their original capacity while stored, so after you're finished with the two in the Touch Controllers, you'll still be able to use the other two from the pack.
Recharging AmazonBasics batteries: AmazonBasics battery charger
This charger allows you to charge up to four AmazonBasics batteries at once. It protects your batteries from overcharging and attempts at charging them the wrong way. It also can change how many volts it uses depending on what type of plug you're using. It also has a retractable plug, which is handy when you're traveling.
Best Lithium: Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA Batteries
These batteries have a massive 3,000 mAh capacity and can last up to 20 years in storage. They are also able to perform in extreme temperatures ranging from 40 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. You probably aren't using your headset in extreme temperatures, but you can take a couple from the four-pack for your Oculus Quest and two others for more extreme conditions.
Best Alkaline: EnergizerMax Alkaline Battery
These batteries last up to 10 years in storage so you can grab a pair out of the drawer and keep your Touch Controllers powered and ready to go. They're leak-resistant, which helps protect your hardware, and the 48-pack is available for a budget-friendly price.
Great bargain: Rayovac AA batteries
These batteries come in a 72-pack that costs around the same price or less than name-brand battery 48-packs. They're leak protected to protect your device and can hold power for up to 10 years in storage.
Keep playing
Because the Oculus Quest doesn't require any wires and can be used almost anywhere, you may drain your Touch Controller's batteries faster than you would on other headsets. The Touch Controllers will last for a while with just one battery, but you'll want to keep more around. The only thing worse than having to cut off a VR session to switch your controller's batteries is to have to take your headset off and head to the store to grab more of them. The batteries on this list will make sure you're always good to go.
The Panasonic Eneloop rechargeable batteries can be recharged up to 2,100 times and will enable you to use your headset for a long time without having to purchase new batteries.
The Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries have a massive 3,000 mAh capacity and can last up to 20 years in storage. They're an excellent set of batteries to keep in a drawer, so you always have fresh batteries for your devices.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!There is no shortage of great VPN providers out there, and NordVPN happens to be among the best. Normally when something is at the top of its class that means it costs more, but that doesn't have to be the case here. You can actually get some pretty great coupons, deals, and discounts on NordVPNs service without trying too hard.
With nearly 5,900 servers spread across 59 different countries, there's a lot to like about NordVPN. It's one of the best options out there for unblocking Netflix in various regions and has great security features.
Today's best NordVPN coupons and deals
|Plan Length||Discount||Monthly Cost||Total Price|
|1 Month||0%||$11.95||$11.95 at NordVPN|
|1 Year||58%||$4.92||$59 at NordVPN|
|2 Years||68%||$3.71||$89 at NordVPN|
When looking at VPNs, security is always at the front of our focus as we test them. We have a full NordVPN review that breaks down all of the key parts but, as a whole, the service offers fast speeds, reliable connections, and works on almost every device out there.
The best NordVPN deal available today
With NordVPN, the longer you prepay for the service, the better the deal becomes. Right now, the smartest option is the company's 2-year plan which costs a total of $89 as a one-time payment upfront, which ends up being just $3.71 per month.
NordVPN
NordVPN is a feature-rich VPN service that's great for Netflix unblocking, double-layer security, and plenty of app support. Sign up today and see for yourself!
How much does NordVPN cost?
Pricing varies depending on how long you commit to using NordVPN. For a month-to-month option, you'll pay $11.95 but if you prepay for two years that cost drops to just $3.71 per month.
For a single year of NordVPN you pay $59, but you can add a second year for under $40 more, and upgrade to three years for about $50 more than the one-year plan.
- 1 Month NordVPN price: $11.95
- 1 Year NordVPN price: $59
- 2 Year NordVPN price: $89
When you consider the major savings with the top-end plans, it becomes very obvious that the longer 1-year and 2-year plans are absolutely the best ones to go with. Some other services like ExpressVPN are priced at $6.67 per month for a one-year commitment, so it's easy to see the value that NordVPN is offering here.
NordVPN free trial: 30-day money-back guarantee
NordVPN doesn't technically offer a 'free trial', but the VPN provider does offer a 30-day money-back guarantee when you opt for its 1- or 2-year package. If you sign up for the longer-term commitment and happen to not enjoy the experience it provides, you can contact NordVPN for a full refund of your money.
Be sure you keep track of when you sign up so that you'll know how long you have to take advantage of the 30-day guarantee because after that NordVPN won't refund the money.
Is NordVPN a good provider?
Everyone will have a different opinion when it comes to top VPN providers, but NordVPN is one of our favorites. We concluded our review by giving it a 4.5 out of 5 star rating, which is one of the best we've dished out. The company offers great customer support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Should you run into any issues with getting things started or set up, you can easily reach out and get things squared away.
Feature-wise NordVPN falls pretty much directly in line with most of the competition, but it does excel in some areas that others aren't as great in. Through our testing, we've found that NordVPN offers faster connection speeds for locations that are further away from you, but local connections may not be as fast on NordVPN as some others like ExpressVPN.
NordVPN makes it easy to unblock Netflix geo-restrictions, so if you're looking to stream stuff that may not be available locally this is a great VPN to pick. There are apps for nearly every major platform out there, and you can get set up on them all quite easily. You can use it on up to six devices at the same time.
How does NordVPN pricing compare to the competition?
NordVPN pricing actually falls pretty much in the center when you compare it to the competition. If you sign up for just a single month, the pricing is actually more than many other providers, but if you sign up for the three-year term it drops down to just $3.49 per month. At this cost, it's much lower than some others like ExpressVPN but not quite as affordable as Surfshark which comes in at $2.49 per month.
As long as you are willing to sign up for a longer commitment, NordVPN is a very affordable option that you should give some serious consideration to.

Work from Home Office Essentials
If you've been trying to work at home with a shoddy internet connection, it's time to make a change. Lowe's is home to way more than tools; you can find plenty of home office essentials there too from routers and cable ties to desks and more.
Prices Vary
The model of router you own can significantly improve your internet connection at home. Your current router could be fine to use casually, but for business purposes, ensuring your internet connection remains fast and reliable at all times is crucial. You might not even be making proper use of the current upload/download speeds that you pay monthly for if your router isn't able to properly send an internet signal to your computer or mobile phone wherever you are in your home. Mesh networking systems like the Google Nest WiFi ensure you'll receive a fast, solid wireless connection in any room of your home, and now that it's more than 25% off, it's seriously worth considering. Currently the two-piece set is down to $199, saving you $70, through August 30.

Your internet connection is easily one of the most important pieces of the puzzle when trying to set up your home office, but another concern has to be organization.

Plus, you'll probably find quite a few uses for them around your home even outside of your office.

I make the three-hour drive from my Indianapolis home to the Windy City something like thirty times a year for various concerts and events, and it's where I got to attend my very first press event for the launch of the Moto X back in 2013. So I love that it's one of the two test areas (alongside Minneapolis) for Verizon's budding 5G network.
I stopped by Motorola's headquarters at the Merchandise Mart early last month to try it out, following the launch of the Moto Z3's long-awaited 5G Moto Mod. The speeds I saw while walking around the city were impressive, averaging around 500 Mbps, but the network was clearly not cut out for prime time just yet. Holding a solid connection for more than a few minutes was seemingly impossible, and the slightest obstacle blocking your view of a 5G node yielded dramatically lower results.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
With that in mind, I was pretty skeptical when I was offered another opportunity to test Verizon's 5G network just five weeks later, aligning with the release of yet another compatible device, Samsung's Galaxy S10 5G. Thankfully, it turns out five weeks is enough time to completely turn an underwhelming network around.
It's far easier to find and maintain a 5G connection than during my previous visit.
I spent about two hours walking around the River North area of Chicago on an uncharacteristically warm and sunny evening. Before I even started running speed tests, I noticed something different from my last visit; the Galaxy S10 5G wasn't frantically popping in and out of a 5G connection, it was maintaining it whenever I was in range of a node.
That's a huge improvement on its own, aided by the fact that there were quite a few more nodes around the city than before. Moving southwest of the Verizon flagship store on Michigan Avenue, where I was lent an S10 5G for the evening, there were several nodes within walking distance.
Just five minutes down the road, there's a 5G node by the Chick-Fil-A on Pearson and Wabash. Continuing down Grand Avenue, there was a node next to the Binny's by Franklin Street, and another just a block over on Orleans Street.
Once I started running speed tests, all bets were off. Starting with the node off of Pearson and Wabash, my very first Ookla run yielded a whopping 650 Mbps down — that's better than any test I ran during my last visit with the Moto Z3 just last month, and it was only the beginning. It only took two more tests moving a bit closer to the node to exceed gigabit speeds with a result of 1134 Mbps. That wasn't just a fluke, either; moving to another node on Wells Street between Ohio and Grand, I hit 1498 Mbps down. Wirelessly. On a cell phone.
As remarkable as those speeds are, they're largely dependent on your proximity to the 5G node. Verizon says you'll see the best results standing about 100-300 feet away from a node, and that standing directly underneath it can be just as bad as standing too far away. Sure enough, running a speed test from about 30 feet away gave me much slower results, with one test yielding about 394 Mbps down — what a world where those sorts of speeds can be mentioned as the "slower results."
If you're wondering about the mere double-digit upload speeds, don't worry. Verizon representatives stated that uploads still aren't enabled over 5G just yet, so those results are from Verizon's LTE network instead.
Now speed tests are impressive, but they don't mean much if real world usage doesn't live up to the high expectations they set. Of course, it's not as simple as "fast speeds = fast everything," and you'll be bottlenecked by the platforms and services you're using.
Netflix and Amazon have both optimized their streaming platforms for Verizon's 5G network, meaning you can download TV shows and movies at blisteringly fast speeds — I downloaded Wine Country, a 105-minute movie, from Netflix in just 20 seconds over 5G, and I saw colleagues download the same movie in even shorter times.
On the other hand, the Google Play Store isn't optimized for 5G at the moment, meaning you won't get to reap the full benefits of a gigabit connection when downloading apps. PUBG took closer to three minutes to install — which to be clear, is still impressively fast, but nowhere near as instantaneous as my Netflix test. I'm told that Samsung's Galaxy Store is 5G-ready, though I didn't get the chance to try it out for myself.
There are still some other questions to answer in the coming weeks and months. We haven't seen how 5G speeds will hold up with thousands of people connected as more compatible devices roll out and the network becomes more ubiquitous in the coming years. It's also unclear when uploads over 5G will be enabled, or when 5G will spread beyond Chicago and Minneapolis (beyond the vague "end of the year" promise).
Just like last time, I have a hard time recommending you go out and buy a 5G-capable phone right away — though if you're so inclined, the S10 5G is available now for a staggering $1300. Even now that Verizon is putting a hold on the premium charge for its new network, jumping the gun this early on is simply limiting your options and shelling out a ton of money for a service you'll only be able to use in busy areas of two cities nationwide for the time being.
But damn, if this isn't the most promising example of 5G we've seen yet. The improvements made in just the last five weeks are staggering, and I can't wait to see how Verizon's network performs in another few months. If you're still not excited for 5G, you're not paying enough attention.
Gateway to 5G
Samsung Galaxy S10 5G
A phone as blisteringly fast as Verizon's 5G network.
Verizon's 5G network is finally worth using, so long as you live in metropolitan Chicago or Minneapolis. The Galaxy S10 5G is the first phone to market that supports 5G natively, and includes some of the most powerful hardware around, as well as a whopping six cameras.

Trusted brand: Spigen Rugged Armor
Everyone has heard about Spigen in some capacity, and for good reason as the company offers some of the best cases and accessories around. The trend continues with the Spigen Rugged Armor, thanks to the company's Air Cushion technology for improved shock absorption, along with spider-web interior pattern and raised edges.
Soft and hard: Otterbox Commuter LITE
When it comes to protection, Otterbox makes some of the best Galaxy A20 cases available. The case comes in either black or Ocean Way Blue, and provides dual-layered system with a soft TPU inner shell and hard polycarbonate outer shell. With perfect cutouts and a raised lip around the display, it's going to be tough for your Galaxy A20 to get damaged.
Miltary-grade: ZIZO Bolt
The ZIZO BOLT series of cases has slowly started to become a fan favorite for those who don't want to add bulk but need protection. The BOLT includes a holster with a 360-degree rotatable click, and even a hidden card slot. Plus, you'll get a tempered glass screen protetor and even a lanyard for fun.
360-degrees of protection: Poetic Guardian
Instead of trying to find a case and then a screen protector, the Poetic Guardian solves this issue by giving you both. Plus, it's already pre-installed on the front portion of the case. With the clear back, you'll still be able to show off your new phone while making sure it doesn't get damaged.
Coverage everywhere: TJS Full Coverage Armor Cover
You might not work in the service industry, but that doesn't mean that you don't need extra protection for your Galaxy A20. The TJS Armor Cover solves this problem with its ultra-rugged design and included tempered glass screen protector. Plus, there's a built-in ring holder that doubles as a kickstand, removing the need for something like a PopSocket.
A little kick: PUSHIMEI Dual Layer Case with Kickstand
Cases that have two different layers usually offer more protection than the standard TPU case and that's where PUSHIMEI comes into play. This Dual-layer Case offers a soft TPU inner sleeve, along with a rugged hard plastic back that is sure to keep your A20 safe from harm. PUSHIMEI has also built-in a kickstand so you can rest it on your desk and catch up on your favorite tv show.
Unique gradients: Starhemei Gradient Silicone Case
Some phone manufacturers have been pushing the envelope when it comes to the color gradients. Others have been playing it safe, but thankfully there are case options that give us more colorful options such as the Starhemei Shockproof Case. This option is made of TPU while having a color gradient going from purple on one corner to dark blue on the opposite corner.
Leather and functional: Ykooe Leather Wallet Flip Case
Leather cases are absolutely fantastic, and leather wallet cases, such as the Ykooe Wallet Flip Case, are even better. Not only do you get the great build quality and professional look, but this wallet case includes three slots for your ID or credit cards, along with a money pocket. Plus, there is a magnetic clasp which will ensure that the flap never accidentally opens when you don't want it to.
Slim and tough: IDEA LINE Hybrid Shockproof Cover
Sometimes it's nice to have a basic, no-nonsense case that just protects your phone from accidental drops or scratches. The IDEA LINE Hybrid Case does just that as it offers a soft coating to make it easier to grip, along with providing reinforced corners for protection. Speaking of protection, IDEA LINE includes a tempered glass screen protector so that you won't have to worry about your display scratching.
Show it off: LeYi Crystal Clear Case
What's the point in having a smartphone that looks fantastic if you can't show it off? That's not a problem with the LeYi Crystal Clear Case, as you can show off your Galaxy A20 in all of its glory. On the protection side, there are "air pockets" on each of the four corners that aim to "maximize protection" in the event that your phone lands on those corners. Plus, LeYi includes two tempered glass screen protectors, because nobody wants the display to all scratched up.
Hybrid bumper: LUCKYCAT Acrylic Bumper Case
Hybrid cases are pretty neat and the LUCKYCAT Bumper case is the perfect example with its clear backplate and TPU bumper. What's even better is that the backplate is scratch-resistant so your case likely won't show the scratches that similar cases may show from day-to-day use.
Bling bling y'all: LeYi Glitter Bling Case
Show off your style and flair with the LeYi Glitter Bling case. This dual-hybrid case comes with a soft TPU inner shell and a hard polycarbonate outer shell, which makes for a great one-two combo against drops. If Rose Gold isn't your color, the Glitter Bling Case also comes in Violet and Mint color options.
Matte is BAE: GOBUKEE Matte Bumper Case
We live in a world where some phone makers are stuck on the glossy back, and that's where the Galaxy A20 falls. But with the GOBUKEE Matte Bumper Case, you won't have to worry about fingerprints while keeping your phone protected from drops. There are four different colors to choose from, but the awesome part of this case is the buttons, which are a different color than the reset of the bumper.
Clear but rugged: Otterbox Symmetry Clear Case
The Symmetry Clear Case is another perfect example of a great Otterbox case. Most clear cases make it easy to show off your phone, but they end up suffering from "yellowing" over time. That won't be a problem with the Otterbox Symmetry, plus you'll get the added benefit of added drop protection.
Extra grippy: GESMA Slim Grippy Case
With the GESMA Slim Grippy Case, you won't have to worry about your phone falling out of your hands anymore. Thanks to the TPU material and the ridges on the back, the GESMA Case adds enough grip to keep your Galaxy A20 where it's supposed to be.

Linksys has been making routers for years and has made a name for itself providing reliable hardware with solid features. It has continued to innovate with its Velop series and has begun to move into Wi-Fi 6 for modern devices. The MAX-STREAM MR7350 is one of the best routers for most people with sufficient speed and mesh capabilities baked in, but there are other options as well.
- Best Overall: MAX-STREAM MR7350
- Best Value: MAX-STREAM EA7300
- Best for Gaming: WRT3200ACM
- Best Wi-Fi 6 Mesh: Velop MX10
- Best Security Features: Velop Tri-band
Best Overall: MAX-STREAM MR7350
The Linksys MAX-STREAM MR7350 router is an affordable Wi-Fi 6 router that also comes with mesh capabilities. The dual-band connection is capable of delivering wireless speeds of AX1800 with 1,201Mbps at 5GHz and 574 at 2.4GHz. Like all Wi-Fi 6 routers, it is backward compatible with 802.11ac/n/g/b/a and has four gigabit Ethernet ports so you can get your entire network connected.
The MR7350 is mesh capable and works with more MR7350 routers as well as the higher-end MR9600 and the Linksys Velop lines of products. If you need to add more coverage to your home, you don't need to replace your router.
This router has an understated design with a matte black housing with venting on the top. Dual swiveling antennas are attached at the back next to the Ethernet ports and a USB 3.0 port for storage devices. This isn't the cheapest router but with Wi-Fi 6 and mesh capabilities, it should last for quite a while/

MAX-STREAM MR7350
Traditional design with mesh capabilities
The MR7350 has an excellent balance of features for most people with wired connections as well as Wi-Fi 6 compatibility.
Best Value: MAX-STREAM EA7300
The MAX-STREAM EA7300 has all of the standard features you would expect in an inexpensive router plus some that you wouldn't, such as MU-MIMO (which allows it to better communicate with more devices simulatenously) and setup with an app. This Wi-Fi 5 router delivers AC1750 speeds with a dual-band setup with 1404Mbps at 5GHz and 300Mbps at 2.4GHz. There are four Ethernet ports around the back for wired devices alongside three adjustable antennas.
This design of the router does feel a little dated now but it's subtle enough not to stand out if you want to leave it out in the open. Linksys recommends this router for small households so if you need to cover a lot of space, consider a larger router or a mesh system. You may also run into issues if you have brick walls or multiple stories.
If you're looking for something basic that can get you online and you aren't too worried about top speeds, this should be a fine option. You should even be able to stream 4K video with no issue as long as your internet connection can support it.

MAX-STREAM EA7300
A balance of speed and features for a small home
The EA7300 has the basics, with four Ethernet ports and AC1750 dual-band speeds. It's nough for light streaming and browsing.
Best for Gaming: WRT3200ACM
In a nostalgic blue and black housing, the angular and slightly angry looking WRT3200ACM is a nicely balanced Wi-Fi 5 gaming router. With two antennas and on the rear and two more on the flanks, this router delivers AC3200 speeds with a dual-band setup. 600Mbps on the 2.4GHz band plus 2600Mbps on 5GHz is possible thanks to a wide 160MHz wide 5GHz channel. You also get four Ethernet ports for the best ping possible.
A powerful 1.8 GHz dual-core CPU and MU-MIMO support keep speeds high and pings consistent even with several devices connected. If you like to tinker, this is a great router with support for open source software like OpenWrt and DD-WRT. This software has been designed to let you customize your network as much as possible. Still, the built-in option isn't bad for most people and you can set it up with the Linksys Smart WiDi App.

The WRT3200ACM is a strong platform for great software to keep games running well. Support for open source software is a bonus.
Best Wi-Fi 6 Mesh: Velop MX10
The Linksys Velop MX10 system is a mesh consisting of two MX5 routers. The MX5 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 6 device capable of speeds up to AX5300. This speed breaks down into 1,147Mbps, 2,402Mbps, and 1,733Mbps delivered with Wi-Fi 6. This is more than enough speed for anyone but it does come with a hefty price tag. Still, if you want one of the best mesh systems available, this is it.
Each unit comes with four Ethernet ports around back arranged vertically with a USB 3.0 port at the top. This isn't an ideal setup for Ethernet since heavy cables could put the system off balance, but it is nice to have so many wired options on a mesh system. That being said, these routers are a portly 4.5 inches across and 9.6 inches tall so they're not exactly small.
The mesh is easily set up with the Linksys Smart Wi-Fi app and these routers even support the WPA3 standard. The Velop MX10 should be able to deliver plenty of speed and coverage for years to come.

Velop MX10
Superfast Wi-Fi 6 mesh networking
The Velop MX5 is one of the fastest Wi-Fi 6 routers Linksys makes and is part of one of the strongest Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems around.
Best Security Features: Velop Tri-band
The Linksys Velop Tri-band is one of the best-balanced mesh systems available thanks to its modest size and strong Wi-Fi abilities. With two 5GHz bands and a 2.4GHz band, this router is able to deliver two 867Mbps streams plus a 400Mbps stream. The major benefit of tri-band in a mesh system is that one band can be used for device connections while another can be used for the mesh connection. This keeps the speed from being cut in half when transferring a lot of data.
There are two Ethernet ports on the bottom of the device, which allow for a clean look, but doesn't offer much expansion for wired devices. If you need to connect a lot of wired devices, you'll need to add a wired switch to your network. This isn't very expensive or difficult but does increase the complexity of the setup.
One of the most interesting features included with the Velop Tri-Band is the ability to use wireless signal fluctuations to detect motion inside your home. Called Linksys Aware, this feature is a good way to be able to keep an idea on the level of activity at home without having to install motion sensors or cameras.

Velop Tri-band
Velop with an extra communication band
The Velop Tri-Band system is able to deliver a faster mesh connection than a dual-band system and can even detect motion.
Bottom line
No matter what your networking needs are, chances are good that Linksys has a router that will work for you even when compared to the best wireless routers available. When I install a piece of networking equipment, I want it to just work so I can forget about it. Linksys has a good reputation for reliability and its routers generally have good feature sets. The Velop line has also been good for maintaining compatibility across the whole line making it easy to build the perfect mesh.
The best router needs to be flexible enough to fit your needs now and next year without breaking the bank. The MAX-STREAM MR7350 does a good job with this balance by building a router with fairly standard features and sufficient speed with mesh capabilities. With full Velop compatibility, this will be an easy router to expand down the road if you find you need more coverage.

- A new type of Glass could spell a big change for consumer electronics.
- Corning has today announced Corning Gorilla Glass Victus.
- It can reportedly withstand drops from up to 2 meters.
Corning has just debuted Gorila Glass Victus, what it calls a significant improvement for the drop and scratch resistance for the Gorilla Glass family.
Succeeding Gorilla Glass 6 (and switching branding tactics), Victus's primary claim to fame is its improved drop performance, reportedly surviving falls of up to 2 meters on hard rough surfaces. It also features improved scratch resistance, being twice as good as its predecessor in resisting nicks and cuts. The company focused on both of these attributes rather than choosing one or the other as it did in the past.
John Bayne, senior vice president and general manager of Corning's Mobile Consumer Electronics said:
Dropped phones can result in broken phones, but as we developed better glasses, phones survived more drops but also showed more visible scratches, which can impact the usability of devices. Instead of our historic approach of asking our technologists to focus on a single goal – making the glass better for either drop or scratch – we asked them to focus on improving both drop and scratch, and they delivered with Gorilla Glass Victus."
Corning says that Samsung will adopt its Gorilla Glass Victus in the near future, which means it may be set to debut on the Galaxy Note 20 when that launches on August 5th.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Gorilla Glass is typically used by most flagships and upper-midrange models, including the iPhone (spurring an investment from Apple) and Galaxy. While competitors using alkali-aluminosilicate like Dragontrail exist, Corning says that this new Victus performs more than twice as well in drop tests and four times as well in scratch tests.

And it's once again more expensive than its predecessor. The Galaxy S20 Ultra is taking that formula to an even higher level for 2020, with an absolutely massive screen and an all-new camera system that's a step above Samsung's other Galaxy S20 models. And the price? A big one: $1400.
But following up on a Galaxy S10 series that was pretty conservative, it's good to see Samsung really going for it with a super-high-end "Ultra" model this year. This is supposed to be the one for the enthusiasts, the fans, the nerds who all want the biggest and best Samsung can offer, no matter the cost. Honestly, it's pretty much the playbook the Galaxy Note series has followed.
Let's break down how well Samsung executes on the promise of an ultra flagship phone.

Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
Bottom line: Samsung went all-out with the Galaxy S20 Ultra, skipping concerns over size and price to just give you the biggest and best in all aspects. You get absolutely everything in this phone, with a glorious display and the highest-end specs. The new camera system is easily Samsung's best, and battery life is exceptional so long as you don't turn on the 120Hz display mode.
The Good
- Huge high-quality display
- Classic Samsung design and build quality
- Incredible specs and performance
- Extremely crisp main camera shots
- Zoom camera has real use up to 15X
The Bad
- In-display fingerprint sensor is slow and often finicky
- Will be too big and heavy for some
- Battery suffers badly with 120Hz enabled
- Extremely expensive, but still has shortcomings
- No headphone jack
Galaxy S20 Ultra Price and availability
Samsung released the Galaxy S20 Ultra earlier this year on March 6, 2020. It remains one of the most powerful Samsung phones on the market, and that's perfectly evident by its $1,400 retail price. While it's certainly one of the more costly phones available right now, there are ways you can pick it up without going completely broke.
As we've seen with release after release, Samsung is known to offer steep discounts on its devices all throughout the year. Right now, you can pick up the S20 Ultra on Samsung's website for just $950 with an eligible trade-in. And, if you can make us of Samsung's student discount program, you can save another $100 on top of that.
If you don't need to buy the phone this very second, we'd recommend waiting to see what kind of offers we get from Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday. Samsung usually has a big presence during both events, meaning it's very likely that we'll get some really appealing S20 Ultra deals. Prime Day kicks off on October 13, so we don't have too much longer to wait!
Galaxy S20 Ultra Hardware and design
Let's get to it from the start: yes, the Galaxy S20 Ultra is massive. I spent several paragraphs discussing its size in my initial hands-on writeup. But this isn't at all to complain about the size of the phone, because there's no need to — if it's too big for you, you can simply buy a Galaxy S20 or S20+. This is more of a word of caution: don't just buy the S20 Ultra for its larger battery and improved cameras thinking that it's roughly the same size as the S20+, because it isn't.
The S20 Ultra is massive, by all measures. You need to be ready for that.
The S20 Ultra is the biggest and heaviest phone you'll find this side of the ASUS ROG Phone II, and that's not good company when it comes to ergonomics. It's about 18% heavier than the S20+, and the weight combined with its considerable height and width can make it unwieldy. I mostly managed it fine, but I also have large hands — many people may have to two-hand this one or use some sort of a PopSocket or phone ring. Moving on.
I would say that Samsung's design is a bit old and lacking new ideas, but the fact that the Galaxy Fold and Galaxy Z Flip exist to fight that notion. Samsung can do new and interesting things with hardware, but it doesn't have to deploy it in its Galaxy S lineup — it's far better off making iterative improvements and refining what's already been incredibly successful for several years.
There's almost nothing about this design that stands out. But it is executed perfectly.
And that's what we have here. Viewed from the front or sides, there's nothing new or visually interesting. If it weren't for the massive camera protrusion on the back you wouldn't be able to tell which of the last five generations of Galaxy S this phone belongs to. It's the typical big panes of glass — now Corning's latest Gorilla Glass 6 — with a solid metal frame between. The glass has Samsung's usual tight curves on both sides, though it's more pronounced on the back.
The front glass doesn't actually curve as dramatically as with previous devices, though the effect of providing an "infinity" edge is the same because it has shrunk the screen bezels even further. And I appreciate it, because it makes Android 10's side gestures easier to use. Add to that the new single front-facing camera cutout that's centered, and there are even fewer visual interruptions to enjoying this screen.
The size of the camera bump is an annoyance physically, and in what it does to the vibration sounds.
Just because this isn't particularly exciting design doesn't mean the execution isn't great. Samsung's fit and finish is top-notch, the materials all come together perfectly and it feels solid — more so in the S20 Ultra than the other models considering its size. Assuming the phone isn't too heavy for you, the heft translates well to a feeling of quality.
The only blind spot in the design is a practical one — in two senses of the word. The rear camera housing is huge, because it has to be for four distinct camera sensors and one extremely large zoom lens that uses a prism to even fit in this size. But even in this thicker-than-most phone, the camera bump sticks up a couple of millimeters further and is wide and tall even in the proportion of this wide and tall phone.
It's so big that it makes the phone rattle horribly loud on any flat surface when it vibrates, even when I turn the vibration way down. It also sticks out enough to actually get hung up on the edge of my pants pockets. This phone deserves a case, if for no other reason than to minimize how much that camera bump sticks out.
Galaxy S20 Ultra Display
Samsung's last top-end display, in the Galaxy Note 10+, was already a pristine example of everything we wanted from a phone screen. And then, Samsung one-upped itself with the Galaxy S20 Ultra. I couldn't find a single negative mark on this screen. It's exceptional in brightness, colors, viewing angles, reflectivity and every other part of the display experience that matters.
This is an exceptional display, and you get more of it than on any other Samsung phone.
The Ultra's display is ever-so-slightly larger than the Note 10+, at 6.9 inches, making it Samsung's largest ever smartphone display. But this isn't all about marginal improvements in qualities and size, it has one massive advantage in that it doubled the refresh rate to 120Hz, which is the latest frontier of display smoothness. By doubling the refresh, every single bit of motion on the display is impressively smooth.
You obviously notice it the most when scrolling through feeds and lists, but it applies subconsciously to every bit of movement and every animation — opening apps, pulling down the notification shade, sliding in side drawers and everything else. It's just pleasing to the eye, and you're quickly spoiled by it in a way you don't realize until you go back to a 60Hz screen. Obviously your eyes re-adjust to 60Hz in a similar way, but I just love the look of 120Hz anytime I have it on.
The 120Hz mode is only available at the default FHD+ resolution — if you want to max out to the full capabilities of the display at QHD+, you drop all the way back down to 60Hz. But that in itself is a fine trade-off; even if you're sticking to 60Hz, I don't see a reason to up the resolution. I know my eyes aren't what they used to be, but I cannot tell that this phone is running at "only" FHD+ resolution out of the box.
Galaxy S20 Ultra Software and performance
When it comes to high-end phones, it's just a given that software performance is going to be exceptional. With a Snapdragon 865 and 12GB of RAM, there wasn't a single moment of hesitation or even a suggestion of a slowdown in anything I did with the phone. Samsung now lets you "lock" three apps into memory so they won't be closed, but I didn't even find this necessary considering how much memory is on tap and how quickly apps re-open. You're going to be able to throw anything you want at this phone for the next two years without issue — it's incredibly over-built.
Complete Galaxy S20 series specifications
Performance will never be an issue on this phone, no matter what you need to do.
The One UI 2 software, built on Android 10, will be familiar to anyone who's used a Samsung phone in the last few months. Outside of a few small tweaks, this is the same software that's been sent out in an update to the last two generations of Samsung flagships, and that's generally a good thing. Samsung's software still suffers from feature bloat and duplicate apps, but it's fully manageable if you're willing to get in there and turn off or tweak everything you don't want. And at the same time, it's done a really great job of integrating Android 10's new features.
Samsung has also integrated Google Duo video calls directly into the dialer, meaning you get a seamless video call button right next to the regular call button when dialing someone who has the app. Better yet, video calls are 1080p, which look great. I'm constantly surprised by Duo's ability to keep video quality high even on mobile data, and having it integrated into the dialer rather than in a separate app is a huge improvement — this sort of thing is just a feature, not worthy of a separate app.
With all of the focus elsewhere, we can't forget that the headphone jack is now gone.
The Galaxy S20 series may have lost the headphone jack, following in the footsteps of the Note 10+, but it still retains solid speaker quality. Like its previous phones these aren't equally-sized stereo speakers, but the combination of the down-firing loudspeaker and over-driven earpiece provide good enough separation and plenty of volume — though at the higher levels you feel a fine rattle in the back of the phone that's jarring. On the other hand, you get no rattling from the haptics engine, which is solid for force-feedback in all interface actions. I just turned down the intensity a few clicks from default, and was very happy with the haptics.
The only part of the daily experience that's a major issue is the fingerprint sensor. This is the same sensor as the Galaxy S10, which is to say it's not good. I gave the Galaxy S10 a break for its slow and inconsistent fingerprint sensor given it was early in the life of in-display sensors — but in the last year things have gotten a lot better and Samsung has to be called on using inferior technology here. The sensor is slow to respond, whether it's accepting or rejecting a print, and the recognition area is really small. Thankfully it's been moved up slightly to be easier to reach naturally, but it's still a weak point of this hardware and a baffling decision when there are much better components out there.
Galaxy S20 Ultra Battery life
With a super-efficient Snapdragon 865 platform and huge 5000mAh battery, the S20 Ultra should have exceptional longevity compared to the Galaxy S10+. But there isn't a single answer to "how's the battery life on the Galaxy S20 Ultra?" — because it heavily depends on whether you're using the display in 60Hz or 120Hz mode.
As I made abundantly clear, I love the look of the 120Hz mode. But now I know why it isn't turned on by default: it wrecks the battery life on this phone.
120Hz mode looks amazing, but absolutely destroys your battery life. It's a shame.
With 120Hz turned on, I saw a 20-30% reduction in total battery life over the course of the day, and makes your battery life dramatically more dependent on how much your screen is on. With just 3 hours of "screen on" time in a day, 120Hz doesn't have an outsized effect on battery life and you can make it through a day fine. But if you step up to 4 or 5 hours ... you're not going to finish the day without charging. With 120Hz enabled, and 5+ hours of screen time while shooting our review video, I hit 10% battery in just 12 hours multiple days in a row. That's downright bad for a battery this large.
Testing from Tom's Guide shows just how much the switch hurts battery life, with their browsing test (which keeps the screen on the entire time) taking a 3-hour, or 25%, hit when switching to 120Hz. And for what it's worth, in their testing the S20 Ultra, even at 60Hz, performed weaker than the S10+ with its 18% smaller 4100mAh battery.
After days using the 120Hz mode, and loving the screen but hating the battery life, I reluctantly switched back to 60Hz and saw an immediate change. All of a sudden it started performing just like my Galaxy S10+ did: battery life was predictable, and long. 4 or 5 hours of screen time was no problem, and still left me with 20% battery at the end of a long day. It's an unfortunate trade-off to have to make, but I'll be using my S20 Ultra in 60Hz mode so that I can use it without thinking about battery life whatsoever.
If I give up and use 60Hz, my battery life is spectacular.
I seriously hope Samsung has an update in the works to include some sort of a "dynamic" refresh rate mode that can let the phone ramp up and down the refresh rate as needed to fit the content on screen. With this dramatic of a power drain from switching to 120Hz, it's clear the phone is constantly running at that refresh rate — which is wholly unnecessary, you don't need to be running at 120Hz when viewing a static image, or watching video that's only in 30 or 60 fps anyway. I hope Samsung can figure it out, because if it can't, I'm stuck on 60Hz.
Charging back up is a quick endeavor, though, even with this big battery. The in-box charger gets the phone from 1% to 60% in just 30 minutes, and takes only another 35 minutes to get the rest of the way to 100%. That's great considering this isn't even the maximum charge speed the phone can take — you can speed it up further with a 45W charger. And of course you can charge slower on a wireless pad, which in itself is still pretty quick if you go with one of Samsung's own chargers.
Galaxy S20 Ultra Cameras
The sheer size of the S20 Ultra goes hand-in-hand with its camera capabilities — Samsung had a ton of room to work with, and even still it had to introduce a huge camera bump. That's because the S20 Ultra's camera set is even an upgrade over the standard S20 and S20+, with a 108MP main camera, 48MP telephoto camera with up to 100X hybrid zoom, and a 12MP ultra-wide camera (same as the S20) to complete the set.
Main camera
This is clearly a massive leap forward in sensor technology for Samsung, dropping a system it was using for years in favor of a dramatically larger sensor that's able to use 9-to-1 pixel binning for a huge effective pixel size to output 12MP shots. It's capturing substantially better low-level data and dramatically more light, which translates into better photos than the last generation.
This camera has excellent fundamentals, but also a bunch of Samsung's historical camera quirks.
But there's a problem: it still feels like it's passing that data through very similar processing. These still very much look like "Samsung" photos, with all of the typical Samsung quirks and features — the effects of which are simply reduced by the fact that it's starting with a great big sensor.
Samsung still loves to aggressively sharpen photos, which often makes things look great but sometimes goes overboard and crushes details into a blotchy and rough mess — and the problem is made worse in low-light photos. In indoor scenes it still over-smooths faces to an unnatural state, though I found it to be great with skin in good natural lighting. I have particular distaste for Samsung's approach to HDR, which feels stuck in the past. There's little subtlety to the way HDR processes photos; it's either off or fully on. You so often get over-saturated colors, blown-out highlights, over-brightened shadows, and bright halos in any shot with a sky.
Night mode goes overboard with processing, but thankfully auto handles low-light shots well.
In low light, Samsung's Night mode can produce real winners, but that's the exception and not the rule. For the most part it takes so long to capture — between 5 and 20 seconds in my experience — that it's impossible to hold your hand steady enough to get a crisp shot. And it typically results in a photo that has blown-out brightness and an overly-warm white balance. Thankfully auto mode does surprisingly well in low light, taking balanced shots with just the right amount of brightness and good colors while retaining super-sharp lines and details.
But just like daylight shots, you can get the occasional swing-and-a-miss with a super-blurry or over-sharpened subject that isn't worth saving. Low light photos are hard, and even though the specs of the camera sensor should let Samsung take best-in-class low light photos it still isn't up to the consistent levels of performance Google has set. Some early Galaxy S20 Ultra users have had issues with auto focus constantly searching and not being able to lock on a subject, and though I haven't seen the issue beyond a few isolated cases Samsung has already said it plans to release an update to address the problem.
I want to love this camera, because it takes amazing photos, but its inconsistency is frustrating.
The camera is ultimately very frustrating, and I'm being hard on it here because I want to love it. Because I can both take amazing photos that easily match, or even beat, the Pixel 4 XL ... and then also take complete stinkers that I wouldn't even save in my gallery, let alone share. Look at that gallery of photos above. Every single one is a great photo that I'm incredibly proud of and don't hesitate to share. Colors, detail and dynamic range are all excellent, and this camera generates incredible natural bokeh.
But you don't see all of the photos I took before and after that were lackluster or downright trash. For all of Samsung's camera issues in the last couple generations of the Galaxy S series, they were incredibly consistent: I knew what I was going to get, and knew where its shortcomings were. With the S20 Ultra the shortcomings are a moving target, and I don't have as much confidence that I know what I'm going to get when I hit that shutter button. The ceiling is incredibly high, but the floor is also incredibly low for an expensive top-end phone.
Telephoto (zoom) camera
You can get great 5-10X zoom shots that have the same characteristics as the main camera.
The S20 Ultra's massive "Space Zoom" lens offers optical 4X zooming in front of a 48MP sensor, offering "lossless" 10X zoom and an aggressive digital crop thereafter. That tells you most of what you need to know here: this camera can take really good shots at up to 10X, and then things drop off precipitously when you go beyond that.
After getting over the initially jarring effect of the "telephoto" button taking you straight to 5X, I really enjoyed shooting zoomed shots with this camera. The quality doesn't match the main sensor, but the new perspective offered from the tighter field of view is worth the trade-off. Anywhere between 5-10X I took really solid shots that I enjoyed, and even though they have the same mixed bag of issues I mention above, there's no other major shortcoming of the zoom shots. Even low-light and indoor shots were good at 5X, and the zoom lens still produces fantastic bokeh if you set it up right — though the one wrinkle in both of those situations is a long minimum focal distance, about three feet.
I was able to take a few shots at 20X and even 30X in perfect lighting conditions with subjects a good distance away that I liked, but there's a clear drop-off in quality that shows you took a highly cropped photo. The full extension to 100X has zero use, as it looks like you've recreated the scene using LEGO blocks, so don't let Samsung's branding or marketing sway you there. But if you ignore all of that high zoom stuff, and just focus on the quality at lower levels, Samsung's absolutely doing things right here.
Ultra-wide camera
I'm very happy to see Samsung keep the ultra-wide camera around while it focused so heavily on zoom this year. The camera has improved from last year, too, in a notable way. In good lighting, ultra-wide shots don't look far off the quality of the main camera, which is high praise for a sensor playing second fiddle. In low light you're let down by the smaller sensor and f/2.2 aperture, which is to be expected, but at least the shots in good-to-mixed lighting don't fall flat.
Having the freedom to shoot everywhere from this ultra-wide all the way up to 10X zoom makes the S20 Ultra an incredibly versatile camera system.
Front-facing camera (selfies)
The new 40MP front-facing camera lets you take full-res 40MP shots if you really want them, provided you're shooting in perfect lighting, but otherwise you're best off sticking with the 4-to-1 pixel binning to 10MP shots. Selfies are good anytime there's enough light, so you'll always do well outdoors and during the day.
The only issue comes in low light, where the camera still falls flat as you'd expect for a tiny front-facing sensor. In dark indoor environments or at night outside, selfies turn into a grainy and blotchy mess. Nothing can match the Pixel 4's use of Night Sight on the front-facing camera, it seems.
No matter the scenario, there are a few things you can do to really take the best S20 Ultra selfies. Turn off the beauty mode, which way over-softens facial features. Turn on the 2-second timer, so you can press the shutter button and then steady your hand before the shot is taken. And turn on the screen flash when taking a low-light shot — it's annoying, but it really helps this little sensor.
Video (8K, 4K, and stabilized)
Short section here, because Samsung hasn't made as big of leaps in these areas as it has in the others. On the video front, the big move is to 8K 24 fps video, which is great for marketing but completely unnecessary for anyone to use in the real world. The number of people with a TV that can play back 8K is so tiny, this is no more than a tech demo. Thankfully you can also get really good 4K 30 or 60 fps video, as well as 1080p 30 or 60.
The "Super Steady" video stabilization has been improved to add roll stabilization, and while it's incredibly smooth for situations where you're walking, riding a bike, in a car (passengers only!) or tracking an object moving in one direction, I actually saw it regularly drop frames and stutter when trying to pan around or move back and forth in multiple directions. Funny enough, the regular stabilization shooting at 1080p 30 or 60 was nearly as smooth, with zero dropped frames. (I've contacted Samsung regarding this issue.) And when you turn Super Steady off, you get back the ability to use the ultra-wide camera and zoom up to 20X. So I'd rather stick with basic 4K or 1080p for video here.
Using 5G can be frustrating
This review is applicable to anyone using the Galaxy S20 Ultra on any carrier in the world. But with expanding 5G networks, the combination of which carrier you're on and where you live can make a big difference in your phone experience. That's why I found it fitting to provide my latest observations of 5G in a section separate from the rest of the review.
I've been using Verizon in New York City, and it's been incredibly frustrating. Verizon's mmWave 5G network, despite the intense spending on billboards, online ads and commercials, is tiny. On one hand it's impressive that Verizon is being so transparent about its coverage that it can give you down-to-the-street coverage maps. But the reality is that when your coverage map has to be that granular, that's not "coverage."
Verizon has 5G you can measure in patches of a few hundred feet long certain blocks in the city. Disparate streets, intersections, parks, and plazas. The situation is better in some other cities with fewer obstacles and infrastructure issues than NYC, but it's still not particularly rosy. The coverage is ultimately limited to outdoor areas, and hyper-localized to where Verizon can pepper the area with several mmWave antennas. And even when you are in a 5G coverage area, simply which way you're facing, even standing in the exact same spot, can make a difference of 30% in your download speeds.
I shouldn't have to go stand on a street corner to 'find' 5G — and that's what's required on Verizon right now.
After a couple days regularly seeking out 5G, I just stopped caring. I never had a 5G connection surreptitiously when I wasn't expecting it — the only time I ever had it was when I went looking for it. I checked the coverage map, walked to that specific street corner (remember, always outdoors) and stood there as I saw the network indicator switch from LTE to UWB ... and ran a speed test to make sure it's working. There's nothing I want to be doing standing on a sidewalk in NYC that requires 5G speeds — even if they are anywhere from 500Mbps to 1.5Gbps in my testing.
Obviously the situation will be slightly different based on where you live. And could be entirely different if you're on T-Mobile's wide-reaching (but much slower) Sub-6 5G network. But the hit-or-miss nature of Verizon's 5G network at this point has been a reminder that I need to think of this phone as an LTE device for now, with a 5G radio that's ultimately dormant and set to be utilized perhaps 18 months from now. That's a nice bit of knowledge to have, as it's an expensive phone you may hold onto for 2-3 years, but right now it's not a factor one way or the other in my recommending the phone.

Galaxy S20 Ultra Should you buy it?
Samsung went all-out on the Galaxy S20 Ultra, and set itself an extremely high bar by pricing the S20 Ultra at $1400. And for the most part, it delivered on its promises.
Samsung went all-out on the Galaxy S20 Ultra, and delivered in so many ways.
The hardware feels every bit worth the money, and there's no doubt that the specs have what it takes to handle anything and everything you want to do on a phone — both today and two years down the road. It has all of the hardware features you want, an incredible display, and no-concern all-day battery life. The cameras are also a big step forward for Samsung, with the ability to match Google's quality in a variety of lighting conditions, plus a good wide-angle camera and high-quality zoom shots. And the only thing you gave up from last year was a 3.5 mm headphone jack.
But there are shortcomings here, and it's hard to be forgiving at this price. The S20 Ultra is absolutely huge, and that's going to immediately rule it out for many people. Its 120Hz display mode is wonderful, but turning it on erases that great battery life I just praised. And the cameras, while capable of amazing photos, are less consistent and still stumble more often than I'd like. And for this advanced and expensive of a phone, I shouldn't have to deal with last year's bad fingerprint sensor technology or just 128GB of storage.
This is a phone for the biggest phone enthusiasts, who care about having more no matter the cost.
The question of "value" is always a funny one, because each of us has a different idea of what an appropriate price is for a phone. But no matter what, if we just look in real terms of how much phones have cost up to this point and compare it to the S20 Ultra's $1400 starting price, this thing is expensive. Purchased on a typical carrier financing plan, it'll be nearly $60 per month. If price is a factor for your phone purchase, you should be looking at the standard Galaxy S20 or S20+ instead.
But for some, price doesn't mean as much as what you can do with a phone. And the Galaxy S20 Ultra enables you to do a whole lot. It's Samsung's don't-hold-back top-end phone, and what it's capable of is impressive. Like many Galaxy Notes before it, the S20 Ultra isn't going to be the phone that appeals to everyone; it's the phone that appeals to the enthusiasts who want more and are willing to handle the trade-offs.

The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has a curved AMOLED display covered with Gorilla Glass 6, but that doesn't mean it doesn't need a great screen protector. Curved glass is inherently more vulnerable than flat, and the Note 20 Ultra's massive screen leaves many opportunities for scratches and potential cracks. That's why you should buy one of the best Note 20 Ultra screen protectors for your new, expensive phone.
- The glass way: Venoro Tempered Glass Screen Protector
- Combo: BAZO Soft Screen Protector (2-Pack)
- Premium protector: Whitestone Dome Glass
- Three for cheap: OEAGO Screen Protector (3-Pack)
- All the features: QITAYO Screen Protector (3-Pack)
- Lifetime protection: AloMit Screen Protector (3-Pack)
The glass way: Venoro Tempered Glass Screen Protector
Venoro is a name we often rely on for quality screen protectors for all major phone releases, and with the Note 20 Ultra, it's showing up to the plate yet again. This single-screen protector is of the tempered glass variety, offering incredibly scratch resistance, a 99.99% transparency rating, and a super slim design at just 0.2mm thick.
Combo: BAZO Soft Screen Protector (2-Pack)
If you're looking to stretch your dollars a bit more, you can't ignore this package from BAZO. It all starts with two TPU film protectors, which are easy to install and compatible with all cases. The protectors on their own are perfectly fine, but BAZO also includes two tempered glass protectors for the rear camera hump.
Premium protector: Whitestone Dome Glass
Whitestone Dome Glass has proven to be a reliable, well-fitted protector for all of Samsung's latest devices. It provides improved responsiveness with the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. The liquid optically clear adhesive ensures a tight bond when paired with the included UV light curing treatment.
Three for cheap: OEAGO Screen Protector (3-Pack)
Looking at another TPU film protector, OEAGO sells a bundle of three protectors at an outstanding price. Not only is this a lot of bang-for-your-buck, but OEAGO's protectors are also super high-quality. They fit the Note 20 Ultra like a glove, are fully transparent, and offer great protection.
All the features: QITAYO Screen Protector (3-Pack)
Speaking of good options, another bundle worth checking out is this one from QITAYO. Once again, you can buy three film protectors for the same price that some single ones cost. With these QITAYO ones, you can expect full coverage for the entire display, a reliable adhesive solution, and compatibility with the in-screen fingerprint sensor.
Lifetime protection: AloMit Screen Protector (3-Pack)
AloMit's offering for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is one that's hard to argue with — three film screen protectors for a super low price. The usual features are here, including fingerprint sensor support, a case-friendly design, and an easy install process.
Be smart and protect that screen
We're rather smitten with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, with one of its best assets being its screen. As such, protecting it is a must. There are a lot of screen protectors you can get for the phone. Still, out of everything, we think one of the best options is the Venoro Tempered Glass Screen Protector. The glass construction offers the best scratch resistance you'll find, and when you combine that with easy installation, excellent clarity, and fair price, you end up with a winner. This is one of the best Android phones, after all.
Another option that's hard to ignore is the OEAGO Screen Protector (3-Pack). If you're a fan of film protectors, this bundle gives you a few of them at a price that's impossible to argue with.
Finally, if money isn't an object and you want to splurge for one of the most durable screen protectors on the planet, you need to get the Whitestone Dome Glass. Yes, it's expensive, and the installation process is a chore, but once everything is applied, you're in for something magical.

- Star Wars: Tales From the Galaxy's Edge debuts on the Oculus Quest family on November 19.
- More gameplay and story elements have been revealed in this full-length trailer, including new Force-wielding abilities we've not yet seen.
- The trailer also showcases some impressive visuals that transport players to several different worlds through different characters.
Star Wars: Tales From the Galaxy's Edge is coming exclusively to the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 on November 19. This, according to the first full-length trailer we've yet seen of the game, which you can find below. Tales from the Galaxy's Edge takes place on the planet Batuu and centers around Blackspire Outpost — a smuggler's haven where you'll take refuge after crash-landing on the planet. While exploring the outpost, you'll find bartender Seezelslak inside the cantina; an Azumel who is all too willing to share every harrowing story he's ever heard.
Gameplay-wise, it starts out running through a few details we've already heard about but not yet seen. Throwing darts and playing music at the cantina are a few distractions to take part in between adventures and story-telling, while the meat of the trailer focuses on living out Seezelslak's stories. Through these stories, you'll play as various characters wielding different abilities. Some characters might be better with a blaster, while the encounters with Yoda and subsequent Lightsaber action suggest that you'll be playing as at least one Force user throughout the campaign.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
We've learned that the story will be told in parts, similar to how Vader Immortal was. Part one focuses on the main player character; a droid repair technician who will be piecing droids together to make ends meet. Further story elements are a bit more secluded at this point, but the trailer certainly gives us hints at what's to be expected. Oculus Studios says to expect Part II some time in early 2021.
The trailer also showcases visuals that are quite impressive for an Oculus Quest title, and the developers said that the game would run enhanced visuals on an Oculus Quest 2. It's likely what we're seeing in this trailer is running on a Quest 2, though. Animations, particularly Seezelslak's jaunting from one end of the bar to the other, are quite realistic looking.
Star Wars: Tales From the Galaxy's Edge is developed by the same team that put last year's excellent Vader Immortal trilogy together and aims to cover an even wider scope than that game, both in terms of gameplay variety and story depth. While players will have access to Blackspire Outpost and some of the wilds of Batuu, Seezelslak's stories will transport them to faraway lands to experience other settings, including meetings with C-3PO and Yoda. Both C-3PO and Yoda are voiced by the original actors and are sure to lend significant authenticity to the experience.

The Traveler Twins in Genshin Impact
When you first start up Genshin Impact, you will be treated to a cut scene featuring a pair of twins facing off against a goddess of some sort. The twins in Genshin Impact, Lumine and Aether traveled the universe together before arriving on Teyvat. Teyvat is a world ruled by several deities, each of which is aligned to a specific element, but one of the goddesses, in particular, is none too pleased with your visit to her world. This unknown god challenges the twins who unleash wings of light and magic swords, but try as they might, the pair are unable to fend her off.

You are then given the choice between which you wish to play as. Whichever you select, the opposing twin will be stolen away by the unknown god. She will then seal away your powers and cast you towards the ground. Some undisclosed time later, you will awaken, ready to set off in search of your twin.
The choice between twins in Genshin Impact
But which to choose? Lumine, also known as Ying or Hotaru, means light, while Aether means sky. Lumine is distinctly female, while Aether is male. Otherwise, they look very, very similar and you are given no real indication of either's abilities, strengths, or weaknesses.
There's a good reason for that: aesthetics aside, there is zero difference between Lumine and Aether. They have identical stats, abilities, and potential. While most of the choices in RPGs make a difference, this one choice doesn't. So, pick the twin that visually appeals most to you. You can keep their default name or pick a new one, and play with confidence that you won't regret your decision later on.
Which twin in Genshin Impact did you pick?

Existing Oculus accounts can be merged with a Facebook account for an easy transition.
Facebook is right in the name
Once upon a time, Facebook and Oculus accounts were separate. As of Oct. 1, 2020, that's no longer the case if you're joining the Oculus family for the first time. After October 1, all new players will be required to sign into their Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2 with their Facebook account. Facebook says that current Oculus account holders should merge their Oculus accounts with their Facebook account before Jan. 1, 2023 in order to avoid complications.
Since it's launching on October 13, the Oculus Quest 2 can only be used with a Facebook account.
Facebook says that it's merging Oculus accounts with Facebook accounts in order to provide better transparency with how it handles user data. Facebook also wants to make finding and communicating with friends in VR a simpler affair. Given that most people have a Facebook account, it seems logical for the company to merge its services instead of forcing players to make lots of separate accounts.
What if I don't want to merge my Oculus account with my Facebook account?
Existing Oculus accounts will not be required to merge with a Facebook account, however, not merging will create several limitations. Facebook says that it cannot guarantee that all games, apps, and services will work with Oculus accounts after January 2023 because Facebook accounts will be used for authentication, payment, and communication exclusively after that time. If you don't have a Facebook account on your Oculus device, it likely won't be possible to authenticate with the store, make payments, or even communicate with other players.
How to log into an Oculus Quest with your Facebook account
Logging into Facebook on your Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2 is simple. Before you power up the headset, follow these instructions.
- Download the Oculus app on your smartphone. Go here for the Android version, and here if you have an iPhone.
- Once the app is downloaded, log in with your Facebook account.
- Power up your Oculus Quest headset.
- On the Oculus app, select the Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2 to pair the headset with your Facebook account and smartphone.
And that's all you need to do. With a Facebook account, players will be able to easily find and chat with their friends without ever having to take the headset off their heads. You'll also be able to easily share screenshots, videos, and even livestream your gameplay to Facebook through the Universal Home Menu on the Oculus Quest.
A Facebook account also unlocks exclusive events like concerts, movie screenings, and more through the Events section. The upcoming Facebook Horizon even promises to help you join your friends in a virtual environment where you can hang out, play games, and more, all without having to navigate a web page.

Ecovacs Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI
Another great option
Roborock S6 MaxV
Both Roborock and Ecovacs are reputable companies that make some of the best robot vacuums, so it comes as no surprise that these are both quality robot vacuums. Unlike most other robot maids out there, these two include cameras, along with software that helps them detect and avoid obstacles. Both offer mopping, mapping, no-go zones, room cleaning, and they both leave perfect back and forth lines on your carpet. If that wasn't enough, they both do an excellent job of picking up after my messy cat and dog.
While both devices really are amazing cleaners, I've found that the Ecovacs Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI just barely beats out the Roborock S6 MaxV when it comes to performance and total functions.

ECOVACS T8 AIVI vs Roborock S6 MaxV The differences
While the Ecovacs costs $50 more than the Roborock, they're both over $700, so the price difference is negligible. Truth be told, these two vacuums operated very similarly when it came to object detection and avoidance. However, there are a few stark differences in regard to how well the devices cleaned and how many features they offered. Here are the biggest differences between the two units.
Side brushes, dustbins, and water tanks
The Ecovacs Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI has two wire sides brushes, one on either side of the main brush, which helps it guide debris and dust to the main brush. The Roborock S6 MaxV, on the other hand, only has one rubber side brush on the unit's right side. After cleaning sessions, the Ecovacs would come back with more debris in the dustbin than the Roborock regardless of whether I ran the Roborock before or after the Ecovacs. I'm pretty sure that the dual side brushes had something to do with that.
The Roborock S6 MaxV, meanwhile, has both a larger water tank and a slightly larger dustbin, which means it can go a little further cleaning your home before it needs you to interact with it. However, the Ecovacs Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI still has a very respectably-sized dustbin and water tank, so this isn't a dealbreaker by any stretch. As mentioned before, the Ecovacs usually came back with more junk in the bin after cleaning sessions, which is really what matters in this situation.
Object detection and avoidance
Neither device is perfect at object avoidance, but they are equally better at it than many other vacuums out there.
The Roborock S6 MaxV uses a dual camera, with the idea that this helps the unit better understand depth perception, while the Ecovacs Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI employs a single camera. Despite this difference, the two operated relatively the same when detecting and avoiding objects in their path. I will say that neither unit was perfect.
Sometimes they bulldozed into my corgi's dog toys or got caught on cables or some other object in my house. However, when it came to larger things like shoes, tissue boxes, and furniture, the units both did a wonderful job of detecting the object and then finding an alternate route around it, although they sometimes nudged the object slightly and repositioned it in the process. Since they both adapt and learn over time, they both became better at recognizing obstacles as the days passed.
Roborock states that its vacuum can see and avoid any obstacles that are larger than 5 centimeters (2 inches) wide and 3 centimeters (1.1 inches) tall. While that covers most objects found in a home, it doesn't cover small toys like LEGO or smaller action figures. Ecovacs doesn't specify the size of objects that the OZMO T8 AIVI can identify, but the performance between the two was similar enough that we can say this difference is fairly irrelevant. In both cases, very small objects can still get run over.
Camera functions
One of the biggest differences between the two units is that the Deebot allows you to use the app to control the vacuum while viewing the camera feed. The MaxV didn't have this feature at first, but Roborock has since rolled out an app update that does allow users to access remote viewing. This basically turns the Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI and the Roborock MaxV into a home monitoring device. In the Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI's case, it can even work as a pet camera thanks to the microphone feature. Press down on the microphone button and anything you say will get repeated by the vacuum's speakers. That way you can use the Deebot to tell your dog just how good of a boy he is or check up on your mischievous cat even when you're away from home.
In addition to using the Deebot as a pet cam, you can use it to check around your house when you're on vacation just to make sure that everything is OK while you're away. That microphone we mentioned before might just help you scare off any would-be thieves that are in your home. This makes the Deebot's app abilities stand out quite a bit from the Roborock's.
Privacy concerns & camera covers
I honestly felt uncomfortable at times during cleaning sessions when either unit would come into my room and point the camera at me. Roborock addresses this concern by explaining that "images captured by ReactiveAI cameras are processed onboard and immediately deleted." Still, I'm not entirely sure how hard it would be for someone to hack into the vacuum and route the camera feed to the internet.
As mentioned before, Ecovacs embraces the camera and makes it possible for app users to view the camera feed. However, this also means that if someone were to hack into your account they could easily view that same feed or control the vacuum and spy around your home. Definitely an unsettling thought.
To address this issue, Ecovacs includes a permanent camera cover adhesive that completely blocks the camera. However, this seems like a strange afterthought rather than a solution to the problem. You'd purchase one of the less expensive vacuums if you didn't want to use the camera.
Both Roborock and Ecovacs should have included a slideable camera cover of some kind that you could manually put in place whenever the unit wasn't supposed to be running. Since this isn't the case, both devices are equally lacking.
Maintenance & brush cleaning
These pictures show what the S6 MaxV and the Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI looked like after they'd been running every weekday straight for three weeks. As you can see, something about the S6 MaxV's casing attracts a whole lot more dirt and pet fur than the Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI. On top of that, the S6 MaxV's glossy casing makes it easy to leave smudges and markings on the unit. This made me feel like I needed to regularly clean the top of the S6 MaxV. In comparison, I never felt compelled to clean the Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI's casing since it never looked as bad.
The main brushes and side brushes on both units are very easy to clean. Since both units provide a brush-cleaning tool that's part razor and part brush, it's very easy to cut away any hair or wipe away any fuzzies that get stuck to either of the vacuums' brushes.
Additionally, the Roborock app and the Ecovacs app both help you know when you need to clean or replace various parts of the vacuum. For instance, they both let you know about how much time you have left before needing to wash the filter or attach replacement side brushes. One difference here is that the Roborock also lets you know when you need to clean the sensors, which the Ecovacs doesn't tell you to do. As far as the apps go, both companies offer very intuitive interfaces with plenty of controls that can help you set up the perfect cleaning settings and schedule for your home.
ECOVACS T8 AIVI vs Roborock S6 MaxV Bottom line
These are both really impressive vacuums that can learn to detect familiar objects like shoes, large power strips, bathroom scales, and even pet droppings. I was able to trust these units much more than I can with many other robot vacuums I've tested. This, in turn, allowed me to relax more whenever my house was being cleaned. What's more, they're both magnificent cleaners that will help keep your floors clean of pet fur, dirt, and small debris. However, since the Ecovac Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI was designed to also function as a pet camera, the Ecovac comes out ahead. You can use the vacuum to check on your home while on vacation or to chat with your pets while at work.
The Deebot offers powerful suction and mopping to truly leave your floors clean after each session. You will still need to clean up a bit before starting the unit to prevent it from sucking up things it shouldn't, but you won't have to babysit it like you have to with some other devices out there. This really is a great robot vacuum for any home.
Even though it didn't win this showdown, the Roborock S6 MaxV is still a great option, especially if you want the newest on the market.

- Low-band 5G is launching on U.S. Cellular in the first quarter of 2020
- 4G equipment upgrades add support for 5G on 600Mhz spectrum.
- Parts of Iowa and Wisconsin will be upgraded first with 5G phones and service launching as it's ready.
In the first phase of a multi-year plan, U.S. Cellular is upgrading its 4G towers to new equipment that supports improvements in 4G as well as low-band 5G. Similar to the deployment we've seen from companies like Sprint, U.S. Cellular's upgraded network equipment will not only support improvements for 4G LTE, but it will also support for 5G running on 600Mhz spectrum.
This 600Mhz network, along with other enhancements like moving radio equipment higher on the towers, can lead to better coverage in rural communities. Software-upgradeable base stations can further enhance the network by adding support for new 5G features without adding new equipment.

While U.S. Cellular is sticking to its low-band spectrum for 5G, it will improve coverage. Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Michael S. Irizarry said:
We are rapidly moving across our footprint to bring 5G to as many of our customers as possible over the coming years. We expect to augment the network with mid- and high-band spectrum over time as the technology and use cases continue to evolve.
Explaining 5G: Millimeter wave, sub-6, low-band and other terms you need to knowA VPN is super important for anyone. Yup, that's the full sentence – it's that important. But specifically, why? For a start, online security. At the moment, without a Virtual Private Network, aka VPN, you're going online naked where anyone can access your data and even your location.
Alright that was a bit of a scare to start with but it's the reality of online browsing these days be it from apps, browsers on computers or even through smart speaker requests. A VPN is there to help you hide your details, including where you are. This means that your data can't simply be taken and sold, nor can you be hacked as easily. It keeps your online anonymity just that, anonymous.
But a VPN is also great for accessing geo-restricted content, like U.S. Netflix when out of the country where you would otherwise be denied access. So why should you get a VPN?
Why use a VPN for security?
When you go online your internet connection is assigned an IP address which is a number that corresponds to your connection. This can allow websites and other third parties to see where you're logging on from and in some cases even access personal information about you.
By using a VPN your IP is masked. You are logging into another server, somewhere else in the world, which effectively acts as a buffer between you and the content you're accessing. So if you log onto a website from the U.S., but use a VPN server in the UK, that website will think you're based in the UK. It won't be able to access your information, keeping you anonymous.
If nothing else this is a great way to avoid adverts popping up all the time after you've bought a gift for someone, having searched online, and don't want ads for that thing always jumping out at you in future.
How secure is a VPN?
Nearly all VPN services use encryption security. That means that any information about you — which is only location, usually — is kept in code form. There is a key used to write it in code and a key at the other end used to unravel the code. So even if that data were to be intercepted in between, it would be useless without the code key. Encryption is so strong that it's used by the military, banks and government organizations to keep data secure. So it's definitely something you can trust.
How can a VPN help me watch geo-restricted shows?
If you're abroad on a work trip or vacation, but you still want to watch your latest Hulu or Netflix shows, say, then you might struggle. The Netflix servers will see you're in another country and only give you access to content in that location – meaning you might not be allowed to watch US content.
By using a VPN you're able to appear as though you're based back in the U.S., allowing you to access all your favorite U.S. videos again. Of course this could also allow you to watch things like BBC iPlayer, which is restricted to the UK, when you're in the US. But this isn't something we're condoning, just clarifying it is something that can be done.
A great example is watching Studio Ghibli's collection on Netflix in the U.S., Canada, and Japan by accessing a server in a different country.
Is a VPN good for open Wi-Fi?
A VPN is a very good idea whenever you log on with a new Wi-Fi network. Unless you know it's secure — which is difficult to judge, even at a friend's house for example — a VPN is a good idea.
For airport and hotel Wi-Fi, that can potentially be breached, a VPN is a good way to keep yourself secure. That way your data and devices can't be compromised and any data on them, especially things like banking details, can't be accessed or intercepted like they could be if you were to log on without the layer of security a VPN offers.
Which is the best VPN for me?
The best VPN, in our tests, comes out as ExpressVPN which offers international server coverage, great 24/7 live chat support, fast connection speeds and lots of device connections.
ExpressVPN
ExpressVPN is our top-rated pick for several reasons including speed, reliability, and customer service. Sign up for a plan today and get yourself protected!
If you want a free option then Hotspot Shield is a great way to try the service, although you're limited to 500MB of data per day. For the most secure option then Surfshark is a top choice as it offers a double hop VPN which helps mask your traffic even further by routing your requests through any two different locations that you pick.
How much does a VPN cost?
The average VPN cost is about $10 per month. But this drops drastically if you go for a 12 month commitment with prices around $5 but with some as little as $3.33 for longer commitment times.
Lots of VPNs offer free trials and money-back guarantees so it's worth giving one a try before you buy to see if it's the right fit for you.

New heroes have joined the fray!
Beginning April 29, four new Fire Emblem heroes will find their way into the Kingdom of Alberia to face off against the Dyrenell Empire!
Sharena
"If being bright and cheerful all the time lifts everyone's spirits, then that's just what I'll do!"
Much like her elder brother, Princess Sharena has now found her way into the kingdom of Alberia. A new hero introduced in Kindred Ties, Sharena will join your team as a temporary adventurer, By battling alongside her, you can forge a bond that will outlast this event.
Peony
"You can do whatever you want in a dream! Aaaanything is possible!"

Tiki
"I'll do my best!"
Tiki, princess of the Divine Dragon Tribe, is the first Fire Emblem dragon to cross over into Dragalia Lost.

Tiki can be summoned through the new Fire Emblem summon showcase. Tiki can also be faced in an epic boss battle in her dragon form.
Co-op defensive battles
The Co-op Defensive Battles have been updated for the Kindred Ties event. Players will be able to work together to face hoardes of Dyrenell troops while defending castles spread across the map. Players will also be able to use the new Artillary Barrage quest skill, only available for these defensive battles, to wipe out many soldiers at once. These quests will require strategy and teamwork from all involved.
Coliseum
A new type of battle is being added during the second half of the Kindred Ties event. Coliseum battles will present five waves of powerful heroes featuring many popular adventurers you may already have on your team!
The first wave will feature the Alberian Knight Lea. The second wave will feature the fortune teller, Verica and the lithomancer, Naveed. The third wave will feature blacksmiths Ramona and Rena. The fourth wave will feature Android Commander Laxi and her fellow Combat Androids. The final wave will pit you against Luca's little sister, Sarisse and the fire wyrm herself, Brunhilda. The more waves you survive, the greater your rewards. Players looking for an even greater challenge can really test their limits with the greater difficulty settings.
Familiar faces have returned!
In addition to all the new features and characters coming with Kindred Ties, the Fire Emblem: Lost Heroes revival event is also running. During this revival event, you can play through the storyline of the last Fire Emblem event, gain the trust of Prince Alfonse, and earn tons of rewards. If Prince Alfonse didn't join your team during the Fire Emblem: Lost Heroes event, you have another chance at earning this hero for free. In addition, all the previous heroes available for summoning have returned.
Alfonse
The Prince of Askr, Alfonse has returned to the world of Dragalia Lost through the Uncanny Gate. He's one of four members of royalty pulled from their own world and dropped into Alberia. You came across the light aligned sword wielder, Alfonse at the beginning of Fire Emblem: Lost Heroes. By battling alongside Alfonse, a bond can be forged that will last beyond the event.
Even better, Alfonse has been given a serious upgrade through the addition of a Mana Spiral. Using the Mana Spiral, Alfonse can be upgraded even further with the following skills and abilities:
- Blue Radiance (lv 4): Increases the user's strength by 20% for 12 seconds, deals light damage to enemies directly ahead, and inflicts paralysis.
- Sol (lv 3): Deals light damage to surrounding enemies, and restores 5% of the damage inflicted as HP to the user. This recovery caps at 20% of their maximum HP. Damage will be increased as the user's HP decreases.
- Last Burst III: Increases strength by 40% for 10 seconds and increases strength by 10% for the remainder of the quest when the user's HP drops to 30% (once per quest).
- Potent Curse Resistance +100%: Reduces susceptibility to curses by 100%. When the user is hit by an attack that would have cursed them, their strength is increased by 15% for 10 seconds. After activating, this buff will not activate again for 15 seconds.
- Skill Haste +10%: Increases skill gauge fill rate by 10%.
Marth
Another hero from the world of Fire Emblem, Prince Marth of the Altean Kingdowm also found his way into the kingdom of Alberia through the Uncanny Gate. A fire attuned sword user, Marth can be summoned in the Fire Emblem: Lost Heroes summon showcase. Along with the revival event, Marth can now also be upgraded through a Mana Spiral. Using the Mana Spiral, Marth's new skills and abilities include:
- Flickering Flames (lv 4): Deals flame damage to enemies directly ahead, inflicts burn, and gradually recovers the user's HP for 15 seconds.
- Fire Emblem (lv 3): Deals flame damage to enemies in a line. Burning foes take extra damage. Also activates "Skill Shift" if the attack connects. Phase I increases the user's strength by 10% for 10 seconds. Phase II increases the entire team's strength by 10% for 10 seconds. Phase III increases the entire team's strength by 10% and their attack rate by 30% for 10 seconds.
- Last Boost III: Fills 100% of the entire team's skill gauges when the user's HP drops to 30% (twice per quest). This does not fill the skill gauges of dragons. After activating, this ability will not activate again for 15 seconds.
- Potent Stun Resistance +100%: Reduces susceptibility to stun by 100%. When the user is hit by an attack that would have stunned them, their strength is increased by 15% for 10 seconds. After activating, this buff will not activate again for 15 seconds.
- Whirlwind Devastation +13%: Increases critical rate by 13% when the combo count is 10 or higher.
Fjorm
The princess of the ice kingdom Nifl, Fjorm fell through the Uncanny Gate into the Kingdom of Alberia along with her fellow members of the Order of Heroes. She is a water attuned lance user who can be summoned in the Fire Emblem: Lost Heroes summon showcase. She has remained one of the top water aligned heroes in Dragalia Lost even before the addition of her Mana Spiral. With the Mana Spiral, Fjorm's skills and abilities can be upgraded to the following:
- Frigid Smash (lv 4): Deals water damage to enemies directly ahead, and inflicts freeze and frostbite.
- Ice Mirror (lv 3): Summons "Ice Mirror," then deals water damage to the target and nearby enemies. Additional bonus damage will be dealt relative to the damage taken while "Ice Mirror" is active. Also restores 8% of the damage inflicted as HP to the user. This recovery caps at 30% of their maximum HP.
- Last Bravery III: Increases the entire team's strength by 30% and defense by 40% for 15 seconds when the user's HP drops to 30% (twice per quest). After activating, this ability will not activate again for 15 seconds.

- Skill Prep +100% & Skill Charge:Fills 100% of skill gauges at the start of quests. Using a skill fills skill gauges by 5%.
Veronica
Although Veronica serves as the primary antagonist of Fire Emblem Heroes, her role in Dragalia Lost is far less clear. Initially brought through the Uncanny Gate by Loki, Veronica grew weary of Loki's attempts to manipulate her. She joined forces with you to fight back against the Dyrenell Empire and eventually return to her own world. A dark attuned wand user, Veronica can be summoned in the Fire Emblem: Lost Heroes summon showcase and has also seen the addition of a Mana Spiral during the revival event. Using the Mana Spiral, Veronica's skills and abilities can be upgraded to the following:
- Gespenst (lv 4):Deals shadow damage to the target and nearby enemies. Poisoned foes take extra damage. Damage will be increased as the user's HP decreases. If the user's HP is above or equal to 50% of max HP, consumes 10% of max HP to fill this skill's skill gauge by 20%.
- Nosferatu (lv 3): Deals shadow damage to surrounding enemies, and restores 8% of the damage inflicted as HP to the user. This recovery caps at 23% of their maximum HP.
- Last Destruction III: Increases the damage of the next attack skill used by each team member by 10% and the user's attack skills by 30% for the remainder of the quest when the user's HP drops to 30% (once per quest).
- Potent Paralysis Resistance +100%: Reduces susceptibility to paralysis by 100%. When the user is hit by an attack that would have paralyzed them, their strength is increased by 15% for 10 seconds. After activating, this buff will not activate again for 15 seconds.

It's optimized for Samsung phones but runs well on all Android devices and has all the smartwatch and fitness features you'd expect. It's compact and lightweight but still offers good battery life. But if you're not into that one, the good news is that there are so many other amazing options from Fossil to Garmin to Fitbit and more.
The best smartwatches at a glance
- Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 — The Galaxy Watch Active 2 is great for all Android users, not just Samsung phone owners, with an incredible balance of features, battery life, and aesthetics.
- Samsung Galaxy Watch Active — If you want something a bit cheaper and need the extra sensors, this is your best option.
- Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 — The Galaxy Watch 3 is a solid upgrade pick that offers LTE connectivity, a beautiful design, and improved health/fitness tracking.
- Skagen Falster 3 There's no better option if you want to wear Google's Wear OS on your wrist.
- Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 — The TicWatch Pro 3 offers the best performance yet along with key improvements to battery life and health/fitness tracking features.
- Garmin Forerunner 245 Music — Garmin is a name pros know, and the Forerunner 245 Music has impeccable GPS accuracy, long battery life, and support for notifications and music services.
What are the best smartwatches?
If you're in the market for the best Android smartwatch, your choices should include our two best overall picks, the Galaxy Watch Active 2 and the slightly older and cheaper Galaxy Watch Active. The differences are minor — the Active 2 has a couple more sensors and comes in two size options — but together with the new Galaxy Watch 3, they make up Samsung's most impressive wearables lineup to date.
What makes them great is the fluid Tizen OS mixed with beautiful hardware. Unlike the original Galaxy Watch, which has a physical rotating bezel, the Watch Active line uses a "virtual" bezel that lets you move around the software by rotating around the edge of the vivid AMOLED display. Samsung Health has also improved immensely over the last couple of years and features a well-rounded selection of workout tracking options as well as a built-in GPS for monitoring outdoor runs or bike rides. Battery life on both watches is measured in days, not hours, and the included sports bands are comfortable enough that you'll forget you're wearing anything on your wrist at all — until a notification comes in, which is easy to activate or dismiss.
Galaxy wearables are optimized for Samsung phones but can be worn with any Android or iOS device (yes, they work great with iPhones, too). Samsung has done a fantastic job keeping older models updated with new features years after their release.
If you're not interested in a Samsung smartwatch or prefer how Google does things, we recommend the Skagen Falster 3, an absolute knockout of a Wear OS watch. Its exposed metal lugs are very Skagen, but the included side-mounted digital crown lets you navigate around the software without covering up what's on the screen. Plus, it runs the latest Qualcomm chip paired with 1GB of RAM for fluid performance.

You don't have to use a Samsung phone to enjoy the benefits of owning a Samsung smartwatch, and the Galaxy Watch Active 2 provides the most well-rounded wearables experience for Android users right now. It's compact and lightweight but features an extremely sharp and vivid touch display that's easy to navigate and fun to use thanks to the new capacitive bezel. The Tizen OS is smooth and battery-friendly, unlike Google's own Wear OS, and while the app selection isn't massive, the core tenets are there, like Spotify, Strava, and more.
The Galaxy Watch Active 2 contains its primary purpose in its name: exercise tracking. The watch comes with GPS built-in and features automatic workout-tracking, along with sleep tracking, water, food and caffeine consumption tracking, and more. The Running Coach feature is improved, which now gives you real-time pace metrics and a rundown of what to expect from your workout before you start. You'll receive audio cues that can be heard through the watch speaker or Bluetooth headphones.
If you mainly wear a smartwatch for notifications, the Galaxy Watch Active 2 delivers there, too, with excellent support for Android's notification system, letting you reply using your voice, the built-in keyboard, or with one of the many quick answers.
Finally, we have to consider battery life. While not quite as good as some of the other larger watches on the list, it is still pretty impressive, and the watch can be topped up with select Qi wireless pads or with the Galaxy's Wireless PowerShare feature.

The Galaxy Watch Active has already been replaced by the Watch Active 2. However, the original came out in early 2019 and is still a great choice for anyone who wants a compact Android smartwatch with amazing capabilities at a reduced price tag.
The main draw here is the beautiful AMOLED display, which is readable in all lighting conditions, including bright sunshine. The watch is light and comfortable to wear all day — which is good because the battery lasts that and then some. While it lacks the capacitive "rotating" bezel of its more expensive counterpart, the original Watch Active has everything you'd need to stay, well, active: GPS, NFC, storage for music, and wireless Qi charging through Samsung's Wireless PowerShare feature.
Best of all, it's been heavily discounted since the sequel was released so that you can get it for much less than its original price.

3. Samsung Galaxy Watch 3

- 5 ATM water resistance
- MIL-STD-810G durability
- Music Storage & Samsung Pay
Cons:
One of Samsung's latest releases, the Galaxy Watch 3, is more than just a lifestyle wearable. The predecessor wasn't the best pick for fitness fans since it was more of a fashionable smartwatch with some bonus features sprinkled in. Now, the Galaxy Watch 3 is back and better than ever. It's an excellent upgrade pick for those who want a premium smartwatch with advanced health and fitness tracking. It comes in two sizes and offers optional LTE connectivity, built-in GPS, heart-rate monitoring, 5 ATM water resistance, and military-grade durability.
Two of the new health features include SpO2 and VO2 max readings. A SpO2 reading measures your blood oxygen saturation levels while the VO2 max tells you how much oxygen your body consumes during a workout. These two new features are also accompanied by an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor and blood pressure monitoring, which will soon be available in the U.S. Other new features include built-in run coaching and recovery tools, along with access to over 120 home workout videos on the Samsung Health app.
If you're new to the scene, you might experience some sticker shock when you notice the price tag on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3. Sure, it's got some impressive features, but this price point may be out of the question for some people. If you're an experienced smartwatch user with confidence in Samsung wearables, this upgrade might be worth considering.

4. Skagen Falster 3
Best Wear OS Smartwatch
Bottom line: The Skagen Falster 3 is one of the best-looking smartwatches on the market and is one of the best Wear OS watches out there. If you're looking for something a bit more stylish or want to experience Google's version of a smartwatch OS (which has its pros and cons), the Falster 3 should be near the top of your list.

Pros:
- Attractive, classic design
- Digital crown is fantastic
- Speaker lets you take calls
- Excellent quality display
- Built-in Google Pay support
Cons:
Sometimes you just want a smartwatch that actually looks like a watch. You want a simple design, excellent quality strap, and a finish that doesn't scream, "this is a piece of technology!" Well, the Falster 3 from well-known Danish watch brand Skagen is precisely that.
One of the Skagen Falster 3's main benefits is its three-button layout, which includes a rotating crown that helps to scroll through Wear OS without having to touch the screen — an enormous benefit once you start using it. You also get a beautiful stainless steel body, well-constructed straps in either leather, metal, or silicone in a variety of colors, and all the essential features you'd expect, like water resistance, GPS, a heart rate monitor, NFC, and more.
The Falster 3 is the 2020 update to Skagen's smartwatch line and is improved in every way — you get more RAM for smoother performance, a speaker for making and taking calls, and much-improved battery life, thanks to Skagen's new Extended Battery modes.

Bottom line: As we've come to expect from Mobvoi, the new TicWatch Pro 3 is large and in charge. This device offers smoother performance, longer battery life, and some new health features. The company's signature two-in-one display lets you see it in direct sunlight.

454x454 Retina AMOLED + FSTN
Pros:
- Built-in GPS
- Improved performance
- Lightweight design
- Dual-layer display
- Better battery life
- Google Pay
Cons:
If you prefer big things in big packages, you'll appreciate what the TicWatch Pro 3 is bringing to the table. This smartwatch comes with a dual-layer display, which you may recall from previous models. This time, the Dual Display 2.0 has received some helpful style improvements, including a live seconds counter and a handy backlight. The battery is expected to last for 3 days in Smart Mode, depending on your usage. You'll also enjoy built-in GPS, activity tracking, heart-rate monitoring, a new blood oxygen (SpO2) sensor, and Google Pay.
While there's no denying that 47mm is a pretty big smartwatch, Mobvoi notes that it has redesigned the TicWatch Pro to be around 30% lighter. As you can imagine, this makes it much more comfortable to wear despite its huge case size. While the improved performance is the star of the show (here's to you, Snapdragon Wear 4100), other upgrades deserve attention. The TicWatch Pros 3 has refreshed its existing apps, including TicExercise and TicPulse. Now, you'll also have TicOxygen for SpO2 tracking, TicHearing for noise detection and alert, TicZen to monitor stress levels using heart-rate data, and TicBreathe for breath training.
If you don't mind just how gigantic this wearable is, the TicWatch Pro 3 is an excellent upgrade with tons of improvements. Some people may feel that the 47mm case size is overkill. However, if you want snappy performance thanks to the new Snapdragon Wear 4100 processor, it just might be worth it. As of now, the TicWatch Pro 3 is still working on the old version of Wear OS. Hopefully, the performance will only continue to improve when the operating system is updated later this year.

6. Garmin Forerunner 245 Music

Pros:
- Advanced workout tracking and guidance
- Incredible battery life
- Sunlight-friendly transflective display
- Music streaming
- Extremely comfortable strap
Cons:
There's a smartwatch for every Android user type, and the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music is an outstanding choice for anyone who runs bikes or swims. It's not the best smartwatch, but it does receive notifications from your phone. If you don't need much more than that — and who does these days? — the Forerunner 245 makes up for it with incredible 7+ day battery life, or six hours with GPS enabled, which is more than enough for a marathon (or two if you're really good).
Better yet, the transflective screen means that the Forerunner 245 is easily visible in direct sunlight, making it perfect for extended outdoor excursions. There's also music storage and the option to stream from Spotify or Deezer, which is seriously great if you're trying to hit those personal bests. Add in 24/7 heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, advanced workout capture, and advanced features like VO2 max estimation, a recovery advisor, and more, which becomes a wonderful option.

7. Fitbit Versa 3

Bottom line: As one of the most popular names in the wearable world, Fitbit is always a good option. The new Versa 3 is centered around health and fitness tracking, so it's ideal for workout enthusiasts. You have built-in GPS, activity/sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, and Fitbit Pay.
|Category||Fitbit Versa 3|

Pros:
- Built-in GPS
- Sleek, attractive design
- Excellent battery life
- Solid smartwatch features
- Built-in Alexa and Google Assistant
Cons:
Everyone knows that Fitbit makes some of the best wearables in the industry. Right now, the all-new Versa 3 is one of the best Fitbit smartwatches you can buy. It cleverly provides the perfect amount of smartwatch features and fitness-tracking perks into one handy device. It's slim and lightweight with an attractive design. You'll get at least 6 days of battery life, which is pretty impressive. That's especially true when you realize that it has a stunning AMOLED display that's crisp and bright. One of the most important upgrades is the addition of onboard GPS.
You'll be happy to know that all of the Fitbit features you've familiarized yourself with over the years are here as well. You have24/7 heart-rate monitoring, all-day activity/sleep tracking, and automatic workout detection. You'll also receive reminders to move throughout the course of your day. It also offers on-screen workouts that you can follow along with. Previously, the proprietary bands were a hassle to change. The new infinity bands offer an easy-to-use quick-release system. The bad news is that any old Versa bands you purchased won't work on this new watch.
It's not uncommon for some Fitbit products to lack the smartwatch features that users crave. However, the Versa 3 is one of the company's most capable fitness smartwatches yet. You'll have smartphone notifications that are easy to navigate and an app store with popular names such as Spotify and Starbucks, and you can talk directly to the voice assistant and hear responses. If your ears perked about Spotify, the good news is that there is storage for 300+ songs on the Versa 3. Let's not forget that Fitbit Pay is a standard feature as well.
It may not be overflowing with higher-end features, but the Fitbit Versa 3 is easily the best smartwatch for casual trackers who don't want to spend a fortune on a wearable.

Bottom line: When you want to take your health tracking to the next level, look no further than the Fitbit Sense. You'll have all of the company's standard activity tracking perks plus some important newbies, including electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and a skin temperature sensor.

Pros:

- Automatic workout tracking
- 6+ days of battery life
- Fitbit Pay
Cons:
If you were starting to think that Fitbit falls into the "ordinary" smartwatch category, guess again. One of the company's newest releases, the Fitbit Sense, is here to disprove that theory. This advanced health smartwatch is one of the most intelligent devices on the market right now. If you're wondering why it's so much more expensive than other wearables from the company, you can thank the handful of new sensors.
The electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor is becoming more and more common on smartwatches these days. This feature lets you check your heart's rhythm, which can be instrumental in detecting atrial fibrillation (commonly referred to as AFib). You'll also have the EDA sensor, which analyzes your body's electrodermal activity. This is helpful in understanding how your body responds to stress. The skin temperature sensor is also present, offering minute-by-minute readings that tell you how your body temperature changes while you're sleeping.
Is the Fitbit Sense worth the hefty price tag? That will largely depend on what type of wearable user you are. If you're an experienced user and you're seeking a top-notch device that can help you get a much better look at your health, then it might be worth the extra money.

9. Fossil Hybrid HR

Bottom line: The Fossil Hybrid HR provides you with a perfect balance of style and features. You get a taste of certain smartwatch perks and the look of a traditional timepiece. It will track your activity and sleep, monitor your heart rate, and give you over two weeks of battery life.
|Category||Fossil Hybrid HR|

Pros:
- Lovely design
- Customizable display
- Activity/sleep tracking
- Heart-rate monitoring
- 2+ weeks of battery
Cons:
Hybrid smartwatches are unique in many ways. Most importantly, you often can't tell it's a smartwatch at all. The Fossil Hybrid HR comes with just enough features to claim the 'smart' title, but it's not identical to some of the other picks on this list. For instance, you won't have a touchscreen, so all of your navigating will be done with the three side buttons. It also doesn't have a colorful display, but at least you get a solid two weeks of battery life in return.
You can customize the display to your liking, which will include at-a-glance info of your choosing, such as weather, steps, and notifications. Other than basic activity/sleep tracking and heart-rate monitoring, don't expect a well-rounded smartwatch experience from the Fossil Hybrid HR. It's only a hybrid, after all. You'll miss out on GPS, NFC payments, music storage, and other premium features.

10. Suunto 7

Bottom line: Wear OS users who want a fitness smartwatch designed for serious athletes will love the Suunto 7. It's also the best pick if you want a giant piece of tech on your wrist. It offers built-in GPS with offline outdoor maps, superior activity tracking, Google Pay, and an array of vibrant color options.

- Excellent activity tracking
- Water-resistant up to 5ATM
- Google Pay
Cons:
If you're partial to Wear OS and looking for the perfect Android smartwatch to handle your activity tracking, you can't go wrong with the Suunto 7. This wearable is fairly new to the market, but it's got the potential to be great — especially if you're a serious athlete focused on detailed tracking. In addition to built-in GPS and full-color accurate mapping software, it also boasts over 70 sport modes. Thanks to Suunto's apps, you'll have access to helpful metrics that go above and beyond what's available on Google Fit, including training load, training recovery, and more.
When you combine all that Suunto 7 has to offer with Wear OS, it should be a match made in heaven, right? That depends on what type of experience you want. If you can live with a mere 2 days of battery life in smartwatch mode and the likelihood of laggy performance due to the work-in-progress nature of Wear OS, then it's a solid choice for serious athletes who need all the tracking perks they can get.
As you might've noticed, this thing is ginormous. This is a bonus for some users, but dainty wrists may shy away from this 50 mm juggernaut. If you're on a budget, this pricey smartwatch might not be the best choice.

Bottom line: If you're seeking a smartwatch with a feminine touch, look no further than the Fossil Gen 5 Julianna. It's both fashionable and functional.

- Supports any 22mm watch band
- Outstanding battery life for a Wear OS watch
Cons:
Fossil has always been about fashion watches, which makes the Julianna, its latest smartwatch aimed at women, one of the most fashionable yet. Fortunately, the Julianna stands out for more than looks. It's built on the same modern platform as the Fossil Sport but has even more features. In addition to being waterproof and supporting 24/7 heart-rate monitoring, there's also GPS for tracking runs and a versatile digital crown for easy scrolling.
Then there are the features you'll barely see anywhere else in the Wear OS ecosystem: a built-in speaker for taking phone calls when connected to an Android device or iPhone, as well as an improved battery that provides up to three days of moderate usage. Finally, the 1GB of RAM ensures the fastest performance in the Wear OS ecosystem. (Fossil also has a Gen 5 smartwatch aimed at men called the Carlyle.)
It's not cheap, but the Julianna is one of the best Android smartwatch options out there.

Michael Kors continues to be one of the leaders when it comes to fashion smartwatches. The new Access Bradshaw 2 is no exception. It comes in a generous 44mm case and is available in silver, gold, gunmetal, and rose gold variants. It might be hard to believe that a watch this beautiful does more than look pretty, but it does. This Wear OS smartwatch is running the new Snapdragon Wear 3100. When you combine that with 8GB of storage and 1GB of RAM, you can expect ultra-smooth performance.
There are many features to love here, including music storage and controls, Google Fit, voice-activated Google Assistant, Google Pay, onboard GPS, heart-rate tracking, and more. It has both a microphone and speaker, enabling you to take calls from your wrist. While the battery will last for a day at best, it comes with rapid charging that'll reach 80% battery in under an hour.
Given all of these updates, the Michael Kors Access Bradshaw 2 certainly isn't cheap. The price tag makes sense given the superior performance, new features, and premium design.

How to pick the best Android smartwatch
The good news about wearing a smartwatch in 2020 is that while there are plenty of options on the Wear OS side of things. You also have some fantastic options from companies like Samsung, Fitbit, and Garmin.
The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 is an outstanding choice for most people and has received our most coveted Best Overall recommendation. You can even enjoy it if you don't own a Samsung device. You'll have built-in GPS, activity, sleep, and heart-rate tracking, music storage, smartphone notifications, Samsung Pay, and more. It doesn't get much better than this.
Of course, everyone has their preferences. If you're not a fan of Tizen OS or Samsung Health, your choices certainly don't stop there. You'll have your pick of many other wearables, whether it be from Fitbit, Garmin, Fossil, or any other brand that has captured your attention.
There are plenty of factors to consider when you're shopping for a smartwatch. Whether this is your first wearable or you've been around the block a time or two, you'll want to narrow down some key aspects before making a decision. Here are the main factors you should focus on:
1. Size and design preferences
First and perhaps most importantly, you'll need to figure out what size of watch you're after. Smaller watches are often a bit cheaper than their larger counterparts, and some watches may be too large or small for your wrist, which will quickly thin out the herd. The not-so-cheap Suunto 7 is a good example.
And of course, we can't forget about aesthetics. You're still shopping for a watch, after all, and it should be compatible with your style! You can always opt for one of the fashionable watches on this list, like the Fossil Gen 5 Julianna or the Michael Kors Access Bradshaw 2.
If you're more worried about having a comfortable fit than a stylish design, some other options might catch your eye. Runners will love the simplistic look and feel of the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music, for example. If you're intrigued by the idea of a minimalistic design but you'd like something a bit more appealing, the Skagen Falster 3 is subtle and elegant enough for daily wear.
2. Consider your must-have features
You'll also need to weigh the importance of features like GPS, fitness and sleep tracking, cellular connectivity, heart-rate monitoring, and mobile payments. Fortunately, it's not hard to find a watch that has a bit of everything these days. With that said, your list of options will be much shorter if you're set on having a watch with cellular connectivity. You'll only find two models on this list with that feature, so the pickings are rather slim. Not everyone is buying a smartwatch for LTE connectivity, so this won't be a deal-breaker for most users.
Some of the more common features you'll find on most smartwatches these days include GPS, fitness tracking, and heart-rate monitoring. There are still some models that still have yet to jump on the built-in GPS wagon, so you'll have to decide how much this means to you. Granted, you can still use connected GPS via your smartphone, but it's not nearly as convenient. This is a more common issue on fitness trackers. Fortunately, most of the Android smartwatches on this list have onboard GPS.
Another feature we see more and more of is NFC for mobile payments. In fact, more than half of the wearables on this list have it. You won't find it on the more niche watches, like the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music or the Fossil Hybrid HR, but that's mostly because those models are geared toward a different user type.
3. Which OS do you prefer?
Choosing an operating system can be tricky for several reasons. If you're new to the smartwatch world, you might be indifferent on the matter, but it can affect your overall experience, so it's worth mulling over. One of the most common concerns is how well your smartphone will work with your smartwatch.
Is it easier and more fluid to have an Android smartwatch paired with an Android smartphone? Absolutely. Should that be the deciding factor? Not quite. You can use an iPhone with an Android smartwatch but be prepared for some hiccups along the way. There can also certain limitations, like not being able to use the quick reply feature to respond to a text message from your watch.
A recurring complaint from Samsung users is that Tizen OS doesn't always do a great job of displaying notifications on its watches. It's not that they fail to appear but that the options for how they appear are somewhat limited. You might have an easier time scrolling through notifications on a Wear OS smartwatch.
Other smartwatch companies such as Garmin and Fitbit use their own operating systems. This can involve a bit of a learning curve in some cases, but it just might be worth it. If you're a passionate runner who is frequently tracking your workouts and other stats, Garmin is an excellent choice. On the other hand, casual athletes might find the simple nature of FitbitOS to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.
4. How smart is a hybrid smartwatch?
If you're learning about hybrid smartwatches for the first time, you might be wondering just how smart they are. You get a nice blend of a traditional timepiece with some smartwatch perks sprinkled in. However, don't buy one of these wearables expecting premium features.
The Fossil Hybrid HR, for example, offers heart-rate monitoring, basic activity tracking, music controls, and smartphone notifications. You won't have a bright AMOLED display, Google Assistant, mobile payments, or any GPS options. Those who want a taste of the smartwatch world without going all-in might find this to be a good place to start.
5. What about battery life?
Some users can't stand the thought of having to take their watch off every 24 hours to charge it. Luckily, there is a decent amount of multi-day battery life picks on this list. You can also go for a model with advanced technology that helps extend battery life, like the dual-layer display on the TicWatch Pro 3.
Other models offer battery-saving modes that turn off certain features to prolong battery life, but this isn't always ideal. Alternatively, when you choose a watch such as the Skagen Falster 3 that offers rapid charging, it might not be as much of a hassle. Simply set your watch to charge in the morning as you get ready for the day, and it will be juiced up before you know it.
If you're still determined to find a watch with superior battery life, Garmin and Fitbit offer some of the best options that offer almost a week's worth of battery life.

When you're playing Beat Saber on the Oculus Quest, have you ever wanted your controllers to feel a bit more like actual lightsabers? Thankfully, there are grips that can do just that, transforming your ordinary Oculus Touch controllers into the lightsabers you've always wanted. These grips elongate the handle of the controller and attach via a hook inside the battery compartment where the Oculus wrist straps normally would be attached. While they won't be ideal for every VR game, you may even find that these grips enhance gameplay for certain other titles, especially if lightsabers or swords are involved.
- Truly custom sword grips: VBlades Sword Grips
- Absorb the sweat: AMVR Dual Handles
- Channel your inner Darth Maul: VBlades - Dual Edition
- Grip of the Sith: AMVR Long Lightsaber Grip
- Let go of your stress: KIWI Design Grip Cover
- New and improved: Mamut Grips DX
Truly custom sword grips: VBlades Sword Grips
These Custom-made VBlades Sword Grips from Freestyle3D on Etsy are the absolute best Beat Saber grips you're going to find. They've not only got an attractive design, but they're incredibly well built too, with well over one thousand reviews on Etsy alone, most of which are five out of five stars. On top of a great build and size, VBlades Sword Grips come in several colors that you can choose from to customize the experience further. The only downside is that you can't custom mix-and-match colors, as the only dual-color option available is red & blue. Thankfully, though, those are the right colors for Beat Saber!
Absorb the sweat: AMVR Dual Handles
AMVR has the original and best pre-made Beat Saber grips for the Oculus Quest. These wands are sturdy and have a solid foam grip all around, helping to absorb the sweat your palms are sure to exude while playing long Beat Saber sessions. They even include a strong wrist tether to keep them from flying across the room in case you accidentally let go. These are preconfigured with authentic red and blue Beat Saber colors, making it easier to tell which wand goes in which hand right off the bat.
Channel your inner Darth Maul: VBlades - Dual Edition
While these grips won't work with "vanilla" Beat Saber very well, there are plenty of ways to mod Beat Saber to support what's known as Darth Maul grips. Just like the regular VBlades, VBlades Dual Edition can be shipped in around one dozen different colors. There's even a red & blue option to fit the Beat Saber color theme best. These are the sturdiest dual grips you'll find and will have you feeling like a Sith Lord in no time. Just be sure to get Beat Saber modded on your Oculus Quest by sideloading SideQuest before diving into this purchase.
Grip of the Sith: AMVR Long Lightsaber Grip
AMVR also offers connected dual saber grips for the Oculus Quest that'll have you feeling like Darth Maul while slicing to the beat. Just like the separate wands, this dual saber grip features ultra-grippy foam padding all around the hilt. Since this won't work with "vanilla" Beat Saber, be sure to get Beat Saber modded on your Oculus Quest by sideloading SideQuest before diving into this purchase.
Let go of your stress: KIWI Design Grip Cover
If you've been playing Beat Saber and the controllers keep slipping out of your hand, but you don't want a giant hilt extension on your controllers, the KIWI Design Grip Cover is what you've been looking for. A solid silicone cover slips over the grip portions of your Oculus Touch controllers and helps keep your sweaty hands from slipping. There's even a handy wrist strap that'll let you ease up on the grip without fear of letting the controllers go. It's a great way to get a grip during a fast-paced session of Beat Saber without having to white-knuckle the controllers the entire time.
New and improved: Mamut Grips DX
Mamut VR designed some of the best original grips for the Oculus Quest and has come out with a redesigned version 2.0, simply called the Mamut Grips DX. Our review of the original grips was mostly positive, and it seems Mamut took the critiques of the strap design to heart with the Mamut Grips DX. What's left is a solid product that'll make your Oculus Touch controllers feel amazing, adding in grip and an extra padded hand strap so you can let go of the controller and rest those tired hands.
Get your groove on
Few things in VR feel as satisfying as slicing through colored blocks to the heavy beat of a song. That's certainly part of why Beat Saber is so popular, and these grips will take that experience to the next level. Grips like Freestyle3D's VBlades aren't just great feeling though; they're super cool looking and totally customizable, as well.
Have you been surfing through those Beat Saber mods on SideQuest and been dying to try out the Darth Maul mode? The VBlades Dual Edition are exactly what you need to get to get slicing like a Sith Lord.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!I still remember when the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trailer debuted on Sony's stage at E3 2015. I remember the disbelief at its existence; the utter awe of its cinematics; the complete euphoria of the crowd when the word "remake" appeared at the end of the trailer, squashing all thoughts that what they had just watched was for a movie or half-hearted remaster. It's a complete remake, and Final Fantasy 7 deserves nothing less. (Hello Final Fantasy 7 PS4 port! At a time when the remake was kept under wraps, you were the last thing that people wanted.)
Whether you're a new fan to the legendary JRPG franchise or returning to Midgar, here's everything you need to know about the remake.

Complete remake
Final Fantasy 7
Midgar never looked so good
One of the greatest games of all time is finally getting the treatment it deserves. Join Cloud on his quest to stop the evil Shinra corporation and save the planet. Also try not to cry at that one scene. You know the one.
What is Final Fantasy 7?
I'm sure for many that this title needs little introduction. Final Fantasy is one of the most iconic series in gaming, and Final Fantasy 7 is arguably its crown jewel, defining the childhoods of fans around the world when it first released over twenty years ago in 1997. The attention surrounding it is probably why it was such a notable absence at E3 2018. The FF7 Remake is very much an evolution. In fact, it looks similar to what Capcom is doing with Resident Evil 2.
The story so far
Seeing the number 7 in its name may be intimidating, especially in a series that just released its 15th main installment, but don't let that deter you. Final Fantasy 7 is very much its own independent, standalone story. Following mercenary Cloud Strife, Final Fantasy 7 features a battle of epic proportions between the rebel eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE and the corrupt Shinra corporation, hell-bent on destroying the planet for its own gain.
The developers have hinted at slight story alterations or just adding more depth to its narrative in certain spots, but the main story beats will stay the same.
I don't want the remake to end as something solely nostalgic. I want to get the fans of the original version excited. We'll be making adjustments to the story with this thought in mind.
Though these weren't explained thoroughly, I'd imagine these adjustments may be some added dialogue or filler cutscenes to flesh out the world and characters more. They want it to surprise players while still retaining what made it so special to begin with. So yes, you'll still get one of the most shocking deaths in gaming history at the hands of Sephiroth.
Visuals: Midgar never looked so good
The graphics are being completely remade from the ground up using Unreal Engine 4. You won't just be getting a slight bump in resolution or better texture quality. The Final Fantasy 7 Remake will look and feel like it was originally designed in the present, not over two decades ago. A far cry from its pixelated 1997 counterpart. This is a high-definition remake, meaning the visuals will be more realistic than ever. Still, Square Enix is working hard not to sacrifice some of its stylized nature. If you need a comparison, think closer to what Final Fantasy 15 looks like.
Every location and character will look just how you'd imagine them to be. No more polygonal messes. When you think of what Midgar would look like today if Square Enix had designed it in 2018, that's what you're getting.
A lot of us tend to remember our favorite childhood games through rose-colored glasses, conveniently forgetting how rough they looked and how janky they played. Our imagination is clouded by our nostalgia, but it soon it'll be crystal clear.
Gameplay: A controversial evolution
Final Fantasy 7 originally featured an evolution of the turn-based combat system called Active Time Battle (ATB), which was similar to turn-based but with a few tweaks accounting for the timing of your actions. While turn-based combat was a staple of JRPGs, this is controversially changing in Final Fantasy 7's remake. It will feature real-time action, though the "ATB gauge and Limit Breaks will appear with new ways to be used," according to Producer Yoshinori Kitase.
Save for cutscenes and battles, the original gameplay was a mix of top-down/isometric viewpoints. Gameplay of the remake shows it will be more modern with a 3rd-person over-the-shoulder camera angle that is used in many action-adventure games today.
Wait, the game's being split up?
As it turns out, the Final Fantasy 7 Remake won't release all at once. In an interview with Dengeki Online, Producer Yoshinori Kitase said "The idea that a remake of Final Fantasy VII would not fit into a single release was there from the very beginning. We still can't share more information about its multiple parts, but please look forward to future announcements."
The interview is originally in Japanese, but Gematsu has provided the proper translations.
Series creator Tetsuya Nomura further went on to explain that fitting everything into a single release and dedicating the appropriate time to do that would mean condensing certain aspects of the game and cutting out parts entirely. To mitigate this as much as possible, the decision was made to release in multiple parts. Nomura even refers to these sections as "episodes."
Nomura confirmed that work has already begun on the next installment of the game.
Demo now available
A demo for the Final Fantasy 7 Remake is now available on the PlayStation Store free for everyone. It only includes the iconic Mako Reactor 1 bombing mission, so it's a tad on the short side, but it gives us a good feel for the game's new combat system and graphics.
When can you play it?
Its reveal trailer interestingly noted that people would be able to "play it first on PlayStation 4," with this specific wording calling into question whether it was merely a timed exclusive on Sony's platform. Right now it's only been confirmed for PlayStation 4, but a potential Xbox One release has not been ruled out.
You can pre-order the Final Fantasy 7 Remake for $59.99. It releases on April 10, 2020.

While the Galaxy S20+ is a more reasonable phone, as a busy woman with small hands, it's too big to use one-handed, too big for my pockets, and too big my shoulder holster.
Thankfully, the "baby" Galaxy S20 is just a few hairs bigger than last year's Galaxy S10, and between a power-user's godsend of a battery, a Lindt Chocolate-smooth 120Hz screen, and the most significant camera upgrade in Galaxy history, the Galaxy S20 is without a doubt the best Android phone for non-Pixel-purists —and especially the best Android phone for women (and men who prefer smaller phones) available today.
I've had my Galaxy S20 for a week now, and while I have some very, very tiny hang-ups with the phone, none take away from the great experience I've had with the S20. If you're in the market for a new phone, I think the Galaxy S20 will win you over, too.
At a glance
Samsung Galaxy S20
Bottom line: With the richest 120Hz screen around, battery for days, and top-of-the-line performance, Samsung makes a flagship that actually justifies its premium price without being too full of itself or too overstuffed to hold comfortably.
The Good
- Usable one-handed
- Truly impressive battery life
- Vivid daytime and outdoor photos
- Blissfully smooth performance
- Beautiful design with cute colors
The Bad
- Slow fingerprint sensor fails too often
- Only supports sub-6 5G, not mmWave
- PD charging is still slower on most chargers
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Price & release date
Six months on, the Galaxy S20 is still priced at $950-$1000 at most retailers. Luckily, we can expect to see the Galaxy S20 on sale during Amazon Prime Day 2020 on October 13-14, possibly all models down to $800 or maybe going as low as $650. If you miss Prime Day, you can be assured that the S20 will see plenty of Black Friday 2020 sales.
If you can't wait any longer for your new S20, you can knock off a few hundred through trade-in credits either at Samsung or from your carrier. Now that the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra line is out and available for purchase, that's where the biggest of Samsung's trade-in credits are available, but you can still get up to $450 off your S20 purchase with an eligible trade-in.
Samsung Galaxy S20 Best in the hand and the pocket
This blue baby might be the smallest of the S20 line, but it's just a hair bigger than last year's Galaxy S10 and Note 10. It's the same width of the Pixel 4, but it's taller. We have a handy size chart that helps demonstrate how the profile of the phone stacks up, but what it doesn't show is how the curved sides of the front and back glass help the phone feel so thin in the hand despite it holding a 4,000mAh battery.
This is the only S20 that I can comfortably use one-handed — though for more than one-word SMS replies, you'll still want to use two hands. I also highly recommend a case, because glass back + sweaty palms = shattered phones and hearts. I'm also a big believer in the power of the PopSocket, especially if you intend to use your phone one-handed most of the time like I do.
Samsung has consolidated buttons this year, putting all the buttons on the right side of the screen and combining the Bixby and power buttons. This is great news on all fronts, mainly because it means that taking a screenshot doesn't need you to press-and-hold anymore; just single press the power and volume down buttons.
Around back, Samsung wised up and shoved the camera module to the left corner while also reconfiguring from a row of cameras to a grid for a smaller footprint. While the device may look more symmetrical if they were still dead center, the corner placement means you're less likely to get a finger in the way when you're lining up a shot — especially if you use a phone grip to steady your shooting hand like me. It also means that if you go in for cute cases like Skinit's licensed cases, there's far less chance the camera module will block out a crucial part of the design.
Of course, I'm not sure you'll want to cover up the S20's natural beauty. While the bigger models are mostly confined to grey and black, the regular S20 got two insanely cute colors this year: Cloud Blue and Cloud Pink. The Cloud Blue on my S20 is very pale, bordering on silver at times (which is why I've lovingly nicknamed it Cinderella Blue), but the color shows through enough to give the S20 personality and a soft glow. Cloud Pink is a little more vibrant, but it's definitely not overpowering. Both are cute enough that I strongly advise getting a clear case, since glass backs are grime magnets and get slippery when sweaty.

While it doesn't show up as much in the renders, these two colors still get those refractive rainbows we saw from the Note series last year, though they've been tastefully toned down from the psychedelic Aura Glow. If you're playing with the S20 in sunlight, the rainbows are easy to find, but they're not always there every time when you're inside in more artificial light.
Samsung Galaxy S20 Prepare to be spoiled by 120Hz
The S20 has the smallest screen of the three models, which means that it has the highest pixels per inch, and — at least to my mind — looks the best. Colors are vivid, the screen is easy to read in direct sunlight, as I did for several hours this last week, and 120Hz is smooth as silk when you're flipping through menus and scrolling through your Twitter feed.
Once you turn on 120Hz, you'll never want to go back to a 60Hz screen.
120Hz doubles the rate your phone refreshes what's on the screen, and because it redraws the screen twice as often, that allows motion to look more natural and more fluid. While not turned on by default for a small battery boost — and honestly, the screen still looks better than the Pixel 4 at 60Hz — it's something you'll notice almost immediately the moment you turn it on and never want to turn it off again.
That butter-smooth experience is a much bigger addiction than using the phone at full 1440p resolution, and you have to pick one or the other because when you go to WQHD, it'll kick you back to 60Hz. The difference between 1080p and 1440p isn't one you'll notice at all times, but you'll see 120Hz far more often.
The screen still has a hole punch, but I like it much more centered on the screen rather than stuck to the right corner. The centered cutout blends in with more apps and with more wallpapers this way, and it doesn't jack up the spacing of the status bar at the top as much since the hole punch itself is smaller than last year.
Samsung Galaxy S20 Battery for literal days
The S20 comes with a 4,000mAh battery, which seems small next to the Ultra's 5,000mAh cell, but it also has a smaller screen to illuminate and refresh. In other words, that capacity is more than enough to get you through the average day. In fact, on the default settings — 1080p 60Hz screen, auto-brightness, mostly indoors with Wi-Fi and LTE — I got 11 hours of screen time on a single charge, including 3.5 hours of reading and three hours of Disney Emoji Blitz gameplay.
Even with 120Hz on, you can expect at least four hours of screen time at max brightness outdoors — the screen was easily readable in full sunlight while waiting for the Magic Kingdom's parade and Epcot's Garden Rocks concert — and a battery that should last you all day on anything less than a park-open-to-close, camera-happy vacation day.
No 9V/2A PD charging is a disservice for a $1000 phone.
When using the in-box 25W charger, the S20 will recharge from dead to full in about 75 minutes, but when you're on the go with a power bank or more generic Power Delivery charging, it seems to top out at 15W (9V/1.65A). Granted, the regular S20 doesn't have 45W charging like the Ultra, but it does still have the same strict requirements for fast-charging at 25W, despite the USB Fast Charger certification which should allow it to quick charge with a wider array of Power Delivery chargers.
Now, I'd understand having stricter requirements in place for charging at 30-45W because you can generate a fair bit of heat depending on your setup. Not supporting standard 18W (9V/2A) PD fast charging is a disservice to your customer, especially for a $1000 phone. After all, even $200 Android phones support 9V/2A charging, and so do iPhones. At least this year Samsung is offering two 25W power banks that can fast-charge the S20 on-the-go.
Samsung Galaxy S20 Android 10 goodness with Samsung's secret sauce
With 12GB of memory and the Snapdragon 865, the Galaxy S20 zips along through any app I throw at it, and especially combined with that 120Hz screen, everything is smooth as silk. If you're wary of the S20 because you've been burned by Samsung's software in the past, One UI 2 is adaptable, reliable, and only minimally bloated.
Samsung's software is refined and closer to Pixel than ever.
The software on the S20 is mostly the same as One UI 2 on the Note 10 and S10 — the menus and Samsung apps are mostly designed to avoid making you reach to the top of its extra-tall displays, we finally have a system-wide dark mode that impacts regular apps as well as system apps, and Android 10 brought more granular permission controls to us so that we can try to curtail the amount of location and tracking data an app collects about us. For the Galaxy S20, we do have a small smattering of pre-installed apps — Facebook, a quartet of apps from Microsoft, a few carrier apps, and a dozen non-essential Samsung apps.
Among some of the more notable improvements made this year, one is something that is needed far more on Samsung's less powerful phones: the ability to pin three apps to memory and prevent the phone from ever killing them. I instantly did this with YouTube Music, just to ensure nothing would throw off my groove. The S20 is the first non-Pixel phone to ship with Live Transcribe and Live Caption, which is excellent news from an accessibility standpoint, but will be rarely used by the average user.
Dual Bluetooth returns from the S10 series, allowing you to play music to two different Bluetooth devices at once. I find this more useful than the new Music Share feature that allows your S20 to essentially act as the DJ, building a playlist of music from your and your friends' phones.
If there's any hangup to be had in the S20's performance, it's that the S20 kept the same finicky, almost useless fingerprint sensor as last year's models. There have been some updates here and there, but nothing changes just how little you can rely on it; I use Smart Lock to avoid that sting of disappointment every time I open my phone, but it's still hiding underneath. There are enough other security options that it's not a dealbreaker, but it is a definite annoyance.
About 5G on the Galaxy S20
The smaller S20 is the only of the three models to not support mmWave 5G, only sub-6, which is only in wide use right now on T-Mobile. I don't mind the lack of mmWave because, as Andrew pointed out in our S20 Ultra review, mmWave covers a ridiculously small area — a few hundred feet per antenna. While sub-6 isn't as widely used, it covers a greater area where it is supported and is more reliable, as mmWave can be notoriously finicky to find and maintain a connection on (especially indoors).
There is no sub-6 5G around Orlando, so I did not get to test 5G on my S20. I don't really mind that because, for a large majority of users here in the U.S. and around the world, you won't see 5G this year anyway. Most networks still count 5G coverage in city-blocks and neighborhoods, and some carriers like my long-time provider AT&T require new, expensive plans to get access to it.
If you are on T-Mobile, you can expect 5G to eat up a little bit more battery, but the phone should still get you through the day. For most of us, the 5G radios will be dormant for the next 12-18 months while carriers keep building out the network.
The frustrations of 5G in 2020 on the Galaxy S20 Ultra
Samsung Galaxy S20 Big camera improvements, even on the little one
For anyone that needs a tl;dr for the S20 cameras, here's the lowdown: It's much better than the S10 and it's more vivid than the Pixel 4, but Pixel gets the edge at night and on focus. Faces can get a little too smoothed out, night shots are better than ever before but still get blurry if you're not steady, 1080p video is damn smooth, 4K video is great, and 8K is overkill.
Galaxy S20 (left) | Pixel 4 (right): You can see how the Pixel's shots seem dimmer and duller compared to the S20.
The cameras on the Galaxy S20 are a big improvement over last year's S10, and for most daytime and outdoor photography, the S20 looks more vibrant and vivid than the Pixel 4. It's still slower than Pixel on auto-focus, but the S20 doesn't have a time-of-flight sensor like the S20+/Ultra and doesn't suffer from the wonk in its focus as the Ultra does.
As my colleagues saw in our reviews of the Ultra and Galaxy S20+, the Galaxy S20 can over-smooth facial details and make photos of your friends and kids seem soft or blurry at times. However, it seemed to do just fine on performer's faces during parades and performances. I'm honestly okay with the brightening and smoothing it does on faces most of the time, but I do wish it would be a little faster on shutter speeds so that I wouldn't have quite so many shots lost to motion blur with my shaky hands.
This is especially true at night. The S20 is magnitudes better than the S10 for dimmer indoor scenes and nighttime outdoor shots, but I'll tell you right now that just like Night Sight on the Pixel 4, you're not going to want to use Samsung's night mode without a tripod. It just takes too long to avoid moving your hand and blurring the shot. The S20 lets in a lot more light, but its tendency to try and over brighten at night leads to overprocessing and blur from too long of a shutter speed, so plan your shots carefully and consider shooting on Pro mode instead of Auto.
I did get one good shot while on the newest dark ride at Hollywood Studios, but that happened while the ride vehicle was stopped. Otherwise, I got decent videos (no stabilizer/tripod grip), but individual photos were almost always blurred while the ride was in motion. The ultra-wide is handy for selfies and vacation photos in crowded quarters and limited timeframes, though, especially around Galaxy's Edge and the Millenium Falcon.
One area where the S20 has a clear edge over the Pixel is the GIFs, which is a weird thing to say, but I like to take them during fireworks and the like. While Google Photos, you can't use more than about 40 images to create an animation, but Samsung's Gallery app will let you turn a 100-frame burst shot into a 640x480 GIF. You can even control the speed and add stickers, text, and emoji to the gif as you create it. Is this a totally niche function? Yes, but it's a really nice niche function.
Samsung Galaxy S20 Oddities and observations
No matter how great a phone is, there are always some minor quirks and annoyances. Some of them are bad, some of them are hidden gems, and most are just little things to be aware of:
- This is the first Samsung phone I've ever come across that uses Absolute Volume by default. Most of you probably won't even notice, especially if you come to the S20 from a Pixel or an iPhone, but if you're upgrading from another Samsung, it'll be weird. You can disable it, but you'll have to unlock the Developer options menu to do so.
- In order to use the Android 10 gesture navigation on the S20, you have to use Samsung's launcher. This is a holdover from Google not having its act together when it published Android 10 — only the Pixel 4 lets you use third-party launchers with 10's gesture nav right now — but it's frustrating that after six months, Google still hasn't shared the fix with other manufacturers. Sharing is caring, Google.
- If you have to be stuck with Samsung's "One UI Home" launcher for gesture nav, do yourself a favor and turn on "Swipe down for notification panel" in the launcher's limited settings menu. I don't know why this isn't on by default, but at least it's an option this year.
- There are a couple of quirks to the camera app this year, but the biggest one is that holding down the shutter no longer triggers burst mode: it starts shooting a video. To take a burst shot or a gif, you drag the shutter button to the edge of the screen. It's also really easy to swap between modes when you're adjusting the exposure of a shot, so make sure you tap directly on the slider.
Samsung Galaxy S20 Should you buy it?
Speaking purely from a value standpoint, the Galaxy S20 is the clear winner of the series. For at least $200 less than the other models, you get just as good a camera experience, the same excellent performance, distinct Samsung software, a more pixel-dense screen, and a reasonably-sized phone that will actually fit in a ladies' hand and in some jean pockets. Oh, and you get actual colors instead of boring black and grey.
Even against the latest from Google and Apple, the Samsung Galaxy S20 holds its own and then some. Its battery runs rings around the Pixel, it has the best screen in the industry, and unlike the iPhone 11, it's got sub-6 5G for you to take advantage of in one-two years when networks have actually been built out enough to take advantage of it.
The Galaxy S20 is going to be the phone to beat in 2020, especially for sexy smooth screens and unkillable battery life. I legitimately have to try in order to kill the battery before sundown, which is probably the biggest praise I can give a phone. The Galaxy S20 is the perfect size for my life, but it's also a powerhouse just like the big boys.

With the Mi 10T Pro, Xiaomi is redefining the value segment. The phone features an outstanding 108MP camera, Snapdragon 865 chipset, and a 144Hz display backed by a massive 5000mAh battery.

Power banks are a dime a dozen, well good ones aren't — but you get what I'm saying. The ability to charge your device while not being tethered to an outlet is wonderful. What if you need to power more than just a USB device or you need to power a bunch of things at once? Well, that's where a power station like the Anker Powerhouse II 400 comes in. This kind of power and convenience isn't cheap, but it may just be worth it to you.
Google's best-ever phone fixes a lot of problems, and makes improvements, but still has inexplicably bad battery life and questionable value for the money considering its specs.

5G connectivity is now available to millions of people in the United States thanks to improved support from phone makers and sub-6 5G networks. T-Mobile and AT&T have used low-band 5G to offer similar coverage to LTE with improved capacity while continuing to build a high-capacity millimeter-wave (mmWave) network. T-Mobile has the best overall 5G network thanks to its wide sub-6 coverage alongside its mmWave network.
Best overall: T-Mobile
According to T-Mobile, its 5G network now covers more than 200 million people. This is mostly thanks to T-Mobile's low-band 600Mhz spectrum that offers excellent coverage and speeds comparable to fast LTE. T-Mobile is also continuing to improve its 5G network with Sprint's mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum in addition to its own high-band mmWave spectrum.
With this setup, T-Mobile can achieve greater capacity to dense urban areas while offering strong coverage in suburban and rural areas. You can check out T-Mobile's 5G coverage, and if you have a phone compatible with its sub-6 5G, you'll be covered by the majority of the network. In a few cities, T-Mobile customers can already take advantage it's low-band and mid-band 5G, and in New York City, customers can access the entire low-band, mid-band, and high-band network
On T-Mobile, there are no plan requirements for 5G connectivity, so if you have a compatible phone, you can get connected. Many T-Mobile based MVNOs can also access 5G such as Google Fi or Metro by T-Mobile. Sprint customers with the Galaxy S20 series of phones will also get access to T-Mobile's network with an update.
Pros:
- Low-band, mid-band, and high-band
- No special plans
- Great coverage
- MVNO access
Cons:
- Speeds comparable to LTE in most areas
- Confusing phone compatibility
Best overall
T-Mobile
Tons of spectrum potential
T-Mobile is building 5G with coverage and room to grow in speed and capacity thanks to a wide range of spectrum available.
Best speeds: Verizon Wireless
One of Verizon's most significant strengths for years has been its massive LTE network, and even with 5G hype growing, that's the network most Verizon customers will be using for quite a while. This is because Verizon has opted to build its 5G network exclusively with mmWave, which it calls Ultra Wideband. Verizon has coverage in 35 cities and has continued to add more coverage consistently though progress is slow.
Verizon's network can deliver impressive speeds over 1Gbps with a good signal but quickly drops back to 4G LTE if you're on the move. Verizon also has limited access to 5G to customers willing to pay for its pricier unlimited data options. Most other carriers around the world have committed to sub-6 networks for 5G while Verizon has kept to mmWave, leading to some phones like the Galaxy S20 requiring a special UWB edition for Verizon.
It's worth noting that 5G on Verizon isn't subject to many limitations such a data caps, hotspot data caps. Or streaming resolution limits.
Verizon has capitalized on its speed advantage by offering high-speed internet based on its 5G network. This kind of internet is known as fixed wireless internet and requires a stationary antenna in your home and can deliver speeds similar to fiber without needing to run any lines.
Pros:
- Fast speeds
- Detailed coverage maps
- Home service
- True unlimited on 5G
Cons:
- Tiny coverage area
- Expensive plans
Best Speeds
Verizon Wireless
Speed is the top priority
Verizon focuses on Speed with its Ultra Wideband 5G network but has kept up with consistent expansion with great coverage maps.
Great Technology: AT&T
AT&T started out by building one of the largest mmWave 5G networks around, but at the end of 2019, AT&T began rolling out its sub-6 850MHz sub-6 network to make some real headway on coverage. Now AT&T 5G covers more than 120 million people with expansion continuing to plow ahead. AT&T even recently began using DSS or Dynamic Spectrum Sharing to beef up its 5G network by sharing spectrum with its LTE network. DSS is still in its infancy but is promising for a smooth transition to a 5G network.
AT&T's mmWave network is live in 35 markets with its low-band network quickly filling in the gaps. Customers with compatible phones and a plan that supports 5G can access both networks for improved speeds. 5G plans are currently limited to business plans and AT&T's two most expensive consumer unlimited plans.
It's worth keeping in mind that AT&T has taken to calling its advanced LTE network 5GE on some older phones. This does not mean you are connected to 5G in any way and simply means you are connected to the best of 4G LTE.
Pros:
- Great coverage
- Sub-6 and mmWave network
- Fast speeds on mmWave
Cons:
- Most speeds comparable to LTE
- 5GE icon confuses customers
Great Technology
AT&T
Sub-6 and mmWave working together
AT&T's network has some of the best 5G coverage with a fast mmWave network in 35 markets for better speed and capacity.
What about Sprint?
On April 1, 2020, Sprint was purchased by T-Mobile. By the end of April, T-Mobile had already begun to integrate Sprint's spectrum into its own network and started updating Galaxy S20 phones from Sprint to work with its 5G network. Older Sprint 5G phones will more than likely see no more major network updates, and it isn't clear if there will be any more network upgrades available to those phones, though it's not technically impossible.
While it is still possible to purchase a Sprint phone plan and you can buy a Galaxy S20 phone from Sprint, any further network development will be as T-Mobile. If you want one of Sprint's plans and 5G access on a Galaxy S20 series phone, there still is some value to signing up with Sprint, but most people should be looking towards T-Mobile in 2020.
Bottom Line
Over the past few months, Verizon has continued to expand its Ultra Wideband 5G network, but as AT&T and T-Mobile work to back up mmWave with sub-6, Verizon's 5G is much less impressive than it once was. The fact of the matter is that while mmWave speeds are very impressive, their utility and fun factor wears off after a few downloads and speed tests. While it's true that Verizon's LTE network provides enough speed for most people, 5G on Verizon is still out of reach for most people.
T-Mobile bet the farm on 5G, and it seems to be paying off. While AT&T is making rapid progress trying to catch up, T-Mobile's great low-band spectrum gave it a significant lead, and T-Mobile has kept up its lead thanks to its own high-band mmWave spectrum and the mid-band spectrum it got from its purchase of Sprint. With all of these elements, T-Mobile is poised to hold onto its 5G lead, and it has the spectrum to keep up expansion.

- Fi users will soon lose the ability to route text conversations through Hangouts as Google readies to discontinue the service.
- With Google Chat going free in the first half of 2021, Google recommends that Fi users who want to sync their text conversations across multiple devices instead use Messages for Web.
- Messages for Web now allows Fi users to send and receive texts even without a direct connection to their phone, though RCS will need to be disabled first.
Hangouts holdouts haven't had it easy. Google has been warning users of the messaging service's impending doom for years, and it's finally taking action as it gears up to replace the service with Google Chat in early 2021.
While the company says it will automatically migrate Hangouts conversations to Google Chat to make the transition easier, one feature that won't be carried over is the ability for Google Fi users to direct their SMS threads through Hangouts.
Messages for Web now allows you to sync your texts using your Google account, even without your phone nearby.
For years, this has been a convenient way for Fi users to enjoy a sort of "unified inbox" for their conversations, and even send text messages from their computer, but Google now recommends its users switch to the Messages app on their phones.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Naturally, to replicate the experience on the desktop, users will be expected to use Messages for Web. This service has existed for years, but it's recently gained support for more Fi-specific features.
As always, users can scan a QR code on the Messages for Web site to establish a connection between their phone and computer. As long as the phone is connected, you can send and receive messages on your computer, including RCS-enabled chat features like high-res images and read receipts.
You can also now associate your Google account to Messages for Web, allowing you to send and receive texts without a direct connection to your phone — though due to the encrypted nature of RCS, you'll need to disable chat features to enable offline syncing.It can be difficult finding the time to vacuum on a consistent basis.

Guardian tracking requires light, so if it's running you can't use your headset in the dark. It also doesn't work well when people are lying down or in finite spaces such as cars or airplanes. Oculus added the ability for the Oculus Quest to detect objects) in the way in Oculus Software version 17, but there are still times it's better to just turn it off. Luckily, users can turn Oculus Guardian tracking off if their headset is running version 9.0 or later.
What is Guardian tracking?
Oculus Guardian is what allows you to move around in VR. It's especially important for games like SUPERHOT VR and Robo Recall: Unplugged. It gives you six degrees of freedom in VR, allowing games and apps to track you moving forward, backward, left, right, up, and down. It's an incredible feat of engineering and makes the Oculus Quest a wonderful headset.
However, Guardian tracking isn't helpful when you're just using your headset to watch media. Disabling Guardain tracking allows you to use media apps like Netflix while in the dark or lying down. Additionally, watching apps in a small space like a plane would be nice.
This used to be something you could only do with developer capabilities, but thanks to a recent update, it's now available to everybody.
How to disable tracking on the Oculus Quest
If you need to update your Oculus Quest, make sure to check our our guide on how to update the headset. Here's how to disable Guardian tracking.
- Go to the Oculus Quest Home screen on your headset.
- Select Settings.
- Select See All.
Select Device.
- Toggle Tracking off.
Guardian tracking is now off. This will allow you to use the Oculus Quest while lying down or in the dark. It's also a great way to use the Oculus Quest while in an airplane or car.
Getting the right view
Turning off tracking changes the view of the Oculus Quest. Since you're likely turning off tracking so that you can enjoy media, you'll want to reset the view.
- Hold down the Menu Button on either of your Touch Controllers.
- You'll see a circle fill up and the view reset.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!It's no secret that phone pricing has gone up significantly in recent years. Back in 2017 when Apple announced the iPhone X, the starting price of $1000 was shocking, but when Samsung followed suit with the Galaxy Note 8 shortly afterwards, it quickly became clear that four-figure phones would be the new norm.
Of course, at the time, each company still offered cheaper alternatives for those who simply needed something functional. The iPhone 8 launched alongside the iPhone X for a much more reasonable starting price of $699, while the Galaxy S8 started at $720. These days, though, the market has shifted.
Even OnePlus can't kill flagship pricing anymore.
The Galaxy S20 starts at $1000, with the upgraded version of the S20 Ultra reaching all the way up to $1600. The LG V60 comparatively feels like a value pick at "only" $900, and even the OnePlus 8 starts at $700 — up $100 from the launch price of last year's 7T, from a company whose mantra has always been about offering the best features at the lowest price. It's gotten a bit out of hand.

There's an argument to be made that prices are being driven up by dozens of factors, from increasing battery capacities to bigger, high-refresh rate displays, larger camera sensors, and so on. That's certainly true to some extent, and most people in the market for a flagship-tier phone seem to be okay paying more for those features. But there's one factor driving up costs without adding much to the user experience: the Snapdragon 865.
Qualcomm's latest chip is, as you might expect, its most powerful yet, and brings with it improvements like better power efficiency and image processing, resulting in longer battery life and better-looking photos. Unlike Qualcomm's other chipsets before it, though, the Snapdragon 865 doesn't have a built-in modem, and requires that manufactures install the 5G-compatible X55 modem in their phones separately.
This means that whether or not you even live in a 5G market, you're going to be paying for it if you buy an 865-equipped phone. In fact, even in cities where 5G has been rolled out in some capacity, it's still not ready for the vast majority of consumers.
No, I'm not talking about the ridiculous conspiracy theories being tossed around lately. The millimeter wave technologies being used by carriers like Verizon offer incredibly fast speeds, but only work within sightline of a 5G node, while the alternative sub-6 networks work inversely, with far better range but speeds roughly comparable to those of LTE. 5G in its current implementation is fundamentally flawed, and simply isn't worth paying extra for right now — that goes both for the hardware and the monthly surcharges on your rate plan.
The Snapdragon 865 is an expensive component to add to a phone, and I can't help but wonder how much manufacturers could have cut back on the retail prices of some phones, had they opted for a different processor. We've speculated on this before, calling the Snapdragon 765 a perfect solution for the OnePlus 8; those after the latest processor could have still gone with the OnePlus 8 Pro, but this would have potentially allowed for a more affordable entry model.
The same could be said for a 765-powered variant of the Galaxy S20, LG V60, or Motorola Edge+. It's a bit hard to accept the fact that $1000 is the least you're expected to pay for a top-tier phone these days, especially when we're seeing such a boom of value offerings on the lower end.
We're expecting Google to announce the Pixel 4a any day now, and if it's anything like the 3a, it'll offer a remarkably similar experience to that of the Pixel 4 for somewhere in the ballpark of $400, with the same incredible camera. On the Apple side, the new iPhone SE paints a similar story with the same A13 Bionic chip used in the top-end iPhone 11 Pro Max, and an impressive singular camera.
The iPhone SE and Pixel 4a are shifting our perspective on how good a $400 phone can be.
Similarly, there are a ton of great options being sold overseas lately, with companies like Xiaomi, Realme, Oppo, and Honor pushing phones with incredible build quality and performance for around the same $400 price range.
That's all bad news for the four-figure market, and great news for consumers. With more and more affordable options offering all of the basics the majority of people need, and not just meeting but exceeding our expectations in previously weak points like performance and cameras, there's not much reason for anyone but the most die-hard, bleeding-edge tech enthusiast to spend anywhere near a thousand dollars on a phone anymore.
Admittedly, it feels a bit hypocritical to write this with most of 2020's flagship phones sitting on my desk, and a OnePlus 8 currently in my pocket. But well, it's my job to review these devices; the only reason any of them are here is because the companies sent them to me for review, and if I had to buy a phone right now, most of these phones wouldn't even be on my radar. I'd be keeping a close eye on the Pixel 4a, or maybe even considering the iPhone SE. At the very most, I might pick up the OnePlus 7T now that it's just $500.
The Snapdragon 865 is a great processor, but I'm willing to bet most of you don't need 5G, or most of its other benefits for that matter. If you're unhappy with the rising prices of phones these days, vote with your wallet. The Pixel 4a is right around the corner.
Incredible value

You won't find a better camera at this price
The Pixel 4a may be right around the corner, but until it's out, the Pixel 3a is still one of the best deals around. You get the same incredible camera found on the Pixel 3, plus priority updates to the latest builds of Android. It doesn't get much better at this price.

As popular models sell out left and right, new models can fill the void and help buyers get a great Chromebook with a much better long-term value. Take the Acer Chromebook Spin 311.
Previous generations of the Spin 311 like the CP311-2H are still regularly going for $370 or more on Amazon, so the new CP311-3H launching at $300 with eight years of support ahead of it mean you're getting a sweet deal on a brand new model, so long as the Chromebook holds up in everyday use.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
And after a month, I can say that the new Acer Chromebook Spin 311 definitely holds up.

Acer Chromebook Spin 311 (CP311-3H)
Bottom line: As a budget-minded Chromebook, the newest version of the Spin 311 may be light on ports, but the MediaTek processor gives it truly all-day battery life while still having enough power for schoolwork, light work, and casual computing. Since it lacks a microSD slot, I highly recommend buying the 64GB model.
Pros
- Exemplary battery life
- Lightweight yet durable
- Comfortable keyboard
Cons
- Light on ports / no microSD
- No 8GB RAM option
Acer Chromebook Spin 311 (CP311-3H) Design and specs
Acer's previous generation of the Spin 311 was a bit stockier in its design, in order to accommodate the extra ports, while the new 3H generation instead tapers down the edges around the sides in order to help the 311 feel slimmer in the hand while you're carrying it around. Instead, all the buttons and ports are relegated to a compact area near the back of the laptop on each side, with USB-A and the audio jack on the left with the power button while the right side houses the Kensington lock, USB-A, and volume rocker.

This is a plastic computer, but not the kind you need to complain about.
We've still got a 11.6-inch 1366 x 768 pixel touchscreen here — because hey, they've worked for the last five years, why change now? — but Acer has covered it in Antimicrobial Gorilla Glass this year.
While I'm all for cutting down on the grime that can accumulate on our screens, this coating isn't strong enough to kill all disease-causing bacteria; it's designed to kill odor and stain-causing bacteria instead.
The shell here may be all-plastic, but it still looks good for a $300 Chromebook, even if I miss the aluminum lid of the Lenovo Chromebook C340-11. This plastic isn't slippery, but it's also not a dirt and dust magnet the way rubberized education models tend to be. In short, the Spin 311 feels great in the hand and in the lap; I used it on the couch more than half of the time. Tablet and Stand modes are just as comfy as the regular Laptop mode, and it was easy to thumb through a few dozen chapters of manga in both modes.
It was easy to reposition between modes, but you'll definitely need two hands to open the Acer Chromebook Spin 311. Believe it or not, this is a good thing, as it means that the hinge is firm enough that the laptop won't fall flat the second you set it down on a desk or un-recline from the couch to grab a drink from the fridge.
Don't mistake a firm hinge for being too stiff for younger kids to get it open, though, as that's definitely not the case, and I'm happy to see a firm hinge because that means it should age better than the softer hinges on other 2-in-1s.
While the screen isn't as bright or sharp as the Lenovo Duet, it's still easy to read text and I have used the Spin 311 outside with no real issues so long as I'm either in shade or it's not the very peak of the afternoon. Similarly, the keyboard here is on-par with the ones I've used on most other 11.6-inch Chromebooks. While it's not a super-quiet keyboard, it's still nowhere near as rowdy as a mechanical keyboard, nor as mushy as many you'll find on cheaper Windows laptops. No backlighting here — no surprise at this price point — and no problems with sticky keys or missed strokes, just a consistent, average experience.
Acer Chromebook Spin 311 (CP311-3H) Performance and battery
MediaTek-powered Chromebooks aren't anything new, and while they're not that powerful, they get the job done. The MT8183C inside the Spin 311 is an iterative improvement from the MT8173C we saw inside over a dozen budget Chromebooks — including my run-and-gun darling, the Lenovo Chromebook C330 — but it can keep up with full-time work and a dozen open tabs plus a Google Meet call without crashing out on me.
Bouncing between a half-dozen tabs of reference while I write an article is smooth sailing, and while I'll confess an 11.6-inch screen is a bit cramped for split-screening, the Spin 311 still does well enough while I'm reformatting spec tables or referencing press releases while drafting something up. Photo editing through Google Photos or Pixlr E is easy enough, even if I have to zoom in a little closer to make out if I got focus right on a picture or not.
In short, working full-time on the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 is a breeze and should be perfectly fine for working adults and distance-learning kids. Sure, I wish there was an 8GB RAM option so that we'd have a little more breathing room while on video conferences — especially since the Spin 311 will get Chrome OS updates until June 2028 — but it does fine with the 4GB of RAM included.
I didn't fill up the 64GB of storage on my review unit, but considering 18GB of that storage is taken up by the Chrome OS system, I very, very highly recommend getting the 64GB over the base 32GB version. No microSD slot means you can't expand without plugging in a flash drive, so starting with the most storage you can is imperative, especially if you intend to use a lot of Android apps or download offline video — holiday trips need entertainment, after all.
The announcement for the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 turned heads by saying you could get up to 15 hours of battery life, and while I haven't quite gotten to that number on a single charge, I do consistently get 12 hours (or more) after over a month of on-again, off-again use. I'll go a full work day and not need to go looking for a charger until lunch on the following day. Chromebooks have been getting better and better each year when it comes to battery, and Acer proudly continues the tradition.
I've been working on the Spin 311 all day today (minus an hour for my lunch break) and the battery projection tells me I have another 7 hours left before it'll run dead. And with 45W Power Delivery charging, you can recharge the 311 from dead to full in less than two hours.
Acer Chromebook Spin 311 (CP311-3H) Competition
If the new Acer Chromebook Spin 311 had launched six months ago, it would've seen stiff competition from the Lenovo Chromebook C340-11 and the extra-durable ASUS Chromebook Flip C214, which are of a similar power level but sport double the ports. The C340-11, in particular, would offer stiff competition with its aluminum lid and spiffier look, as well as the same $280-$330 price tag, but the C340-11 has been next to impossible to find since the pandemic started, so Acer can take advantage so long as it can keep up with demand.
Another great competitor with a slightly different set of priorities is the Lenovo Chromebook Duet, which also lacks a microSD slot and only has one USB-C port and a $300 price point. The Duet has a smaller screen, but it's brighter and 1080p as opposed to the Spin 311's 1366 x 768px, but the Duet is a tablet with an included kickstand and detachable keyboard, so it's more fitting as a companion device rather than as a daily driver computer.
Acer Chromebook Spin 311 (CP311-3H) Should you buy it?
You should buy this if ...
You want a lightweight laptop
In both specs and size, the Spin 311 is definitely a lightweight laptop. I've worked from one full-time for weeks, but I'll confess to seeing tab reloads once I get too tab-crazy or am trying to do too much during a video call. (Google Meet can eat RAM like candy once you get into a call with 20+ users.)
You have a rigid budget
2020 has left many of us tightening our fiscal belts, especially when it comes to electronics' purchases. While you might think you're better off getting an older model for $150-$200, the Acer Spin 311 will get Chrome OS updates until June 2028, meaning this laptop could last almost a decade so long as you treat it with respect!
You need a small Chromebook
While big screens are great for split-screening and watching movies in bed on lazy Saturdays — not that I'd know anything about that — 11.6-inch Chromebooks are easier to travel with and they're also a great size for kids. The Spin 311 is one of the best compact Chromebooks of 2020, and while it's not been covered in impact-resistant rubberized bumpers and scratch-resistant coatings, it's still plenty durable for the chaos of everyday life with kids.
You should not buy this if ...
You hoard tabs and apps
The Spin 311 is fine with casual computing and lighter workloads, but it can slow down once you get over 15 tabs. I also wouldn't recommend it for more intensive Linux applications, if you need a relatively compact Chromebook that can handle more rigorous work, try the $410 Lenovo Flex 5 instead.
You hate low-resolution screens
As a budget-minded 11.6-inch Chromebook, this is a 1366 x 768px screen. If you're buying a $300 Chromebook, you're just going to have to make peace with that. When this budget moves over to 12-inch 1080p screens instead, I'll sob with joy, but until then, at least the screen here is antimicrobial and easy to clean.
You need tons of space
MicroSD cards are a mainstay of Chromebooks, especially in this budget-minded portion of the market. There's no microSD slot on the Spin 311, so if you realize after purchase that 32GB of storage wasn't big enough, you're outta luck. This is a big reason why I highly, highly recommend getting the 64GB version of the Spin 311.
Compact Chromebooks have been in short supply these last several months, so Acer picked the perfect time to debut a new model that's both widely available and an excellent value. With an Auto Update Expiration date of June 2028 and a price for the 64GB model of $330, the Acer Chromebook Spin 311's cost of ownership works out to $43/year or $3.59/month. So, for the cost of one pumpkin latte a month, you can have a durable, lightweight Chromebook that's perfect for travel and a great size for kids.
It's not exactly a powerhouse, but we've already had plenty of those this year. What the world needs more right now are more modest Chromebooks that can satisfy cash-strapped budgets and lighter workloads. I wish it had a second USB-C port just so you could charge the laptop from either side, but the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 is a great little laptop that will fit well in a lot of situations.
If you've been debating getting another Chromebook for your family — or wanted to get one but couldn't find one at a reasonable price — look no further! This is a great Chromebook at a great price, so long as you don't need a beefy processor or 8GB of RAM.

Use a satisfying mechanical keyboard on your Chromebook instead!
Typing for hours on end on a slim Chromebook keyboard is OK, but why settle for that when you could be gliding across satisfyingly smooth mechanical keys instead? When you're at home or at the office, mechanical keyboards are what you and your Chromebook deserve!The Galaxy Note 20 is one of Samsung's most perplexing devices in years. It has most of the modern appointments of a 2020 flagship, including 5G support, a top-of-the-line processor, and a trio of high-quality cameras, but it also ditches the luxe glass backing of its Ultra counterpart in favor of a plastic one, and features a relatively dated 60Hz 1080p display.
On paper, these compromises can make the Note 20 seem like a hard sell compared to the Ultra, especially given the abundance of comparably high-end options like the OnePlus 8 Pro at lower price points. But in my time with the Galaxy Note 20, I've come to appreciate it as a more practical device than even the pricier Note 20 Ultra that I used just before it. As it turns out, those hardware tradeoffs aren't so bad.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20
Bottom line: Despite a number of hardware compromises compared to the Note 20 Ultra, the Galaxy Note 20 is a surprisingly great phone with versatile cameras and all-day battery life.
The Good
- No accidental touch input on the flat display
- Excellent battery life
- Impressive camera performance
- Promised three years of software updates
- One UI 2.5 introduces useful features like Wireless DeX
The Bad
- No Super Resolution Zoom
- No expandable storage
- Display is limited to 1080p and 60Hz
Samsung Galaxy Note 20: Price and release date
The Galaxy Note 20 launched on August 21 for $999.99, with a single configuration featuring 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Since then, the Note 20 has already seen discounts bringing it to around $800 through most retailers. If you already have a relatively recent device to trade in, Samsung is offering massive trade-in credits through its site, knocking up to $650 off of the Note 20's total cost.
You can pick up a Note 20 in Mystic Gray, Mystic Green, or Mystic Bronze. I personally don't think you can go wrong with any of the color options, but I'm a fan of the Mystic Green and Mystic Bronze finishes in particular — though it's easy to appreciate the understated look of the Mystic Gray review unit I was sent.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20: What I like
It's easy to get caught up in the debate around Samsung's decision to use a plastic backing on the Note 20, but I was surprised by how solid the phone still feels in the hand. There's the slightest bit of give in the plastic if you apply enough pressure, but the Note 20 doesn't creak or feel at all cheap, and the matte finish feels reminiscent of the frosted glass on the Mystic Bronze Note 20 Ultra. In case you're worried about long-term durability, the Galaxy Note 20 also has an aluminum midframe.
The flat display is a fantastic change of pace for Samsung's high-end lineup.
The plastic design also helps the Note 20 feel a bit lighter than the Note 20 Ultra, and while the rounded corners are a bit odd to see on a Galaxy Note device (most of which feature a more squared-off look), they keep the phone from poking uncomfortably into your hand.
By far the thing I was most excited to try on the Galaxy Note 20 was its completely flat display — something that's otherwise been phased out of Samsung's high-end lineup. After encountering far too many accidental touches on the Note 20 Ultra's curved glass, I was curious to see how this screen would fare by comparison.
To my delight, accidental touch input hasn't been an issue whatsoever on the Note 20. It's really made me think about how unnecessary curved displays still feel at times; they certainly feel look and feel nice, but I'm still not convinced they bring much functional benefit to the table. I'd be happy to see more flat displays on future Galaxy S and Note devices.
Of course, in typical Samsung fashion, the quality of the display is excellent, as well. The Galaxy Note 20 uses a Super AMOLED Plus panel with rich colors, great daylight visibility, and a low enough minimum setting to use comfortably at night. It isn't perfect — more on that in a little bit — but there's still plenty to love here.
I've also been impressed with the Note 20's battery life. The 4300mAh battery is only marginally smaller than the Note 20 Ultra's 4500mAh cell, but between the display's smaller size, lower resolution, and lower refresh rate, I've been able to hit all the way up to 7 hours of screen-on time with ease, ending most days with around 30% battery life remaining.
Samsung recently committed to offering three years of software updates to many of its phones, including the Galaxy Note 20. That means it should be running the latest version of Android through at least 2022 — in the meantime, that's Android 10 with One UI 2.5, which comes with some fantastic new features like Wireless DeX and the ability to control the direction of your microphones while shooting video.
On the camera side, you don't get the Note 20 Ultra's enormous 108MP camera or periscope-style telephoto lens, but the Note 20's imaging is nothing to scoff at. The main camera uses a 12MP sensor that's larger than the one on last year's Galaxy Note 10 at 1.8 microns, which helps it take in more light and perform better in dark situations.
Elsewhere, you get a 12MP 1.4-micron ultra-wide sensor, and a 64MP 0.8-micron telephoto sensor with 3X Hybrid Optic Zoom that can be pushed up to 30X through digital zoom. Of course, that pales in comparison to the Note 20 Ultra's 50X zoom, or the S20 Ultra's 100X, and in my experience the Note 20's telephoto sensor only retains a useful amount of detail up to about 10X. Still, I've been overall impressed with the Note 20's cameras, a marked improvement over the Note 10's.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20: What's not so great
Let's talk about some of the more polarizing traits of the Galaxy Note 20, most of which center around the hardware. Its display, while terrific in most other ways, is limited to just 1080p at 60Hz. That's not necessarily a huge deal at first glance; I loved the Note 10's display last year, which featured the same specs, and even Samsung's 120Hz-capable devices force you down to 1080p to take advantage of that higher refresh rate.
But during Samsung's Unpacked event last month, the company made a huge deal about how beneficial the Note 20 Ultra's 120Hz refresh rate is when it comes to reducing latency on the S Pen, making writing and drawing on the screen feel closer to a real pen-and-paper experience than ever.
Of course, it makes perfect sense that the Ultra would have higher-end features than the standard Note 20 — it's more expensive, after all — but when even the similarly priced Galaxy S20 released back in March can reach 120Hz, it feels like the Note 20 got the short end of the stick.
The spec sheet is also a bit thinner than on the Note 20 Ultra. There's a single configuration available, with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. I think both specs are perfectly fine for most users, but this continues last year's trend of bisecting a brand name that was once synonymous with the ultimate smartphone experience. The Galaxy Note 20 is a more accessible Note meant to reach a broader audience — and that's okay.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20: The competition
Without a doubt, the Galaxy Note 20's biggest competition is its pricier sibling, the Note 20 Ultra. For an extra $300, you get more RAM, a larger Quad HD+ display with a 120Hz variable refresh rate, more powerful cameras, a slightly larger battery, expandable storage, and the same great One UI 2.5 software based around Android 10. I like the Galaxy Note 20 a lot more than I had originally expected, but if you're a traditional Note fan that wants the very best of the best, the Note 20 Ultra is likely a better fit.
Outside of Samsung's own catalog, the OnePlus 8 Pro is one of my favorite handsets of the last year, with a Snapdragon 865 processor, a gorgeous 120Hz display capable of running at 1440p, a matte frosted glass back, and the company's OxygenOS software, which continues to be my favorite implementation of Android — all for around the same price as the Note 20.
When it initially launched, the Note 20 retailed for $1,000, which made it an even harder sell against these alternatives. But in just the short weeks since it launched, the Note 20 is already on sale for just $800, and that makes it a far more compelling option — even compared to the newly announced Galaxy S20 Fan Edition.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20: Should you buy it?
You should buy this if ...
You want the S Pen without the Ultra price tag
The Galaxy Note 20's obvious advantage over alternatives like the OnePlus 8 Pro and Galaxy S20 is its S Pen, which can be used for everything from quick sketches to notetaking, signing legal documents, and even acting as a remote shutter for the phone's cameras. 120Hz aside, this is the exact same S Pen experience you'd get on the Note 20 Ultra, without the eye-watering $1300 price tag.
You want all-day battery life
While it's a bit of a bummer that the Note 20 is limited to just 1080p and 60Hz, those limitations also cut down on battery drain. The Galaxy Note 20 is able to last even longer than the Note 20 Ultra, despite a slightly smaller battery, and I've easily managed days with over 7 hours of screen-on time. The Note 20 is an absolute battery champ.
You're not a fan of curved displays
Curved displays look and feel nice, but they're functionally little more than eye candy. After running into a frustrating amount of accidental touches on the Note 20 Ultra, it was a relief to move to the Note 20's flat display — which comes with the added bonus of being a bit less fragile in the event of a drop.
You should not buy this if ...
You want Samsung's very best phone
The Galaxy Note 20 is great, but you'll still get more out of the Note 20 Ultra if you're willing to spend the extra money. The Ultra's extra 4GB of RAM can definitely come in handy if you're a frequent multitasker, and the 120Hz variable refresh rate makes for a smoother-looking experience that doesn't take too much of a toll on battery life.
You want to take pictures from across the town
The Galaxy Note 20 manages to push its 3X Hybrid Optic Zoom telephoto sensor to an impressive 30X, but the image quality starts to quickly deteriorate beyond 10X. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra can reach all the way up to 50X, and the S20 Ultra goes even further with a maximum 100X zoom. You won't necessarily want to post those shots to Instagram, but that sort of range can be useful for reading distant signs and even taking photos from an airplane window.
The Galaxy Note 20 really surprised me. Going into it, I wasn't sure how to feel about the plastic design and 60Hz display on a 2020 flagship release. But as it turns out, the phone still feels extremely well-made, and that lower refresh rate brings with it some superb battery life. It may actually be one of the best Android phones available today. None of the Note 20's compromises are deal-breakers for anyone but the most discerning of buyers, who should, of course, get the Note 20 Ultra instead.
If the price still scares you off, though, Samsung is offering high trade-in values for quite a few older devices, which could bring the Note 20 down to as low as $350 — at which point it's an absolute steal. No matter what price you pay, I think you'll be happy with the Note 20 for the next few years, especially if Samsung holds true on its promise to keep the phone up to date along the way.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20
Bottom line: The Galaxy Note 20 brings the S Pen, 5G support, and a flat display to a relatively accessible price point. It offers great battery life and versatile cameras, and features Samsung's excellent One UI 2.5 software.

The Google Pixel 5 and the iPhone 12 are two of the best phones you can get for their respective operating systems. The Pixel 5 doesn't have the highest-end specs we've ever seen, but its mission to deliver the best user experience possible at a reasonable price paid off tremendously. You'll spend a bit more for the iPhone 12, but it comes with a few notable upgrades that could be worth it for some people. If we're being perfectly honest, though, this all comes down to whether you prefer Android or iOS.
Google Pixel 5 vs. iPhone 12 Price and availability
As of right now, the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 are both available for purchase.
The Pixel 5 costs $700, and for that price, you're getting 128GB of storage. There aren't any other configurations available for the phone, meaning 128GB is all you get. As for the iPhone, you have three models:
- 64GB — $799
- 128GB — $849
- 256GB — $949

There are plenty of smaller differences here and there, but overall, both phones provide a top-notch experience for their respective operating systems.
Starting first with the phones' designs, we have two very different approaches. The Pixel 5 is made out of aluminum and features a unique paint job that gives it a soft-touch finish. You could say it's not as "premium" as other handsets, but it's very comfortable to hold and feels great in the hand. By comparison, the iPhone 12 has an aluminum frame with a glossy glass back. The front of the phone is also covered by Apple's Ceramic Shield design, which is said to be 4x more drop-resistant compared to regular glass. Both the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 are water-resistant, have NFC for contactless payments, and support Qi wireless charging.
In addition to Qi, the iPhone 12 introduces MagSafe charging. The new MagSafe wireless charger attaches on the back of the iPhone 12 with magnets and provides faster charge speeds. Apple's also using the MagSafe system for things like cases, wallets, car mounts, and more. It's shaping up to be the next big standard for iPhone accessories, and the potential it has is pretty cool.

The Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 feature OLED displays with Full HD+ resolutions, and while they both look great, the Pixel 5 takes the lead with its 90Hz refresh rate. It's also ever-so-slightly smaller than the iPhone 12, but either phone is compact enough for easy one-handed use.
The Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 have capable specs in every department.
When it comes to cameras, we're met with two capable setups. The Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 tout primary and ultra-wide sensors, and for the most part, both phones take excellent shots. Google still has the advantage in low-light situations, but when shooting in broad daylight, it's a toss-up between which one is the best.
Google's made big strides with the Pixel 5's video recording, and while that's great to see, the iPhone 12 continues Apple's legacy of being the best in the business when it comes to shooting video on a smartphone. The iPhone 12 adds HDR and Dolby Vision recording, in addition to 27% better low-light performance.
Looking at the rest of the specs, there's not much to complain about with either phone. The Pixel 5's Snapdragon 765G isn't as powerful as the A14 Bionic chip in the iPhone 12, but both phones deliver fast performance for just about any task. You're also getting reliable battery life across the board, good selfie cameras, and biometric authentication (a fingerprint sensor for the Pixel 5 and Face ID on the iPhone 12).
Google Pixel 5 vs. iPhone 12 The software situation
Here's the thing about this comparison. We could keep going back and forth about what each phone does better than the other one, but at the end of the day, your final decision likely comes down to the software each handset is running.
This is a question of which OS you prefer.
The Google Pixel 5 ships with Android 11, and for people that like Android, it's a phenomenal purchase. You can customize it with third-party launchers, new features like chat bubbles are here, and you can look forward to major OS updates and monthly security patches through October 2023. As far as Android goes, it's one of the best ways to experience the platform.
Should you prefer iOS, it just makes sense to go with the iPhone 12. There are probably things about the Pixel 5 you would like, but there's no shame at all in sticking with what works for you. With features like AirDrop and iMessage, there's a legit argument to be made that iPhones just work better for certain groups of people.
We aren't saying you should never try out a new operating system if you have the urge to switch, but if you're happy with how Android or iOS is working for you and you want to stick with it, there's no reason you shouldn't.
Google Pixel 5 vs. iPhone 12 Can't go wrong with either one
No matter if you decide to buy the Pixel 5 or iPhone 12, you can rest easy knowing you're getting one of the best phones of the year.
It may not have the most powerful Snapdragon processor or the most RAM we've ever seen, but the Google Pixel 5 is one of the most enjoyable Android phones we've used in a while. Everything about the phone works as intended, it's pleasantly affordable, and those aren't things we've been able to say about a Pixel flagship for the past couple of years.
Some may argue that the iPhone 12 isn't as good of a deal as the Pixel 5, but for anyone that wants to use iOS, it's a hard phone to ignore. It's incredibly fast, has excellent cameras, and the new design is one of the best we've ever seen from Apple. When you consider you're getting all of this for $200 less than the iPhone 12 Pro, the value proposition becomes easier to see.
Pixel 5 or iPhone 12, buy the phone that works best for you. Regardless of which one you pick, we think you're going to love it.
The Android choice
Google Pixel 5
The first Pixel everyone should buy
Unlike previous Pixels, the Pixel 5 has no deal-breaking battery, memory, or display issues. Instead, it's one of the best Android phones you can buy in 2020. It may not have the most bleeding-edge specs we've ever seen. but the day-to-day experience of using the phone is fantastic. We're especially fond of the new low pricing, which feels very appropriate given the current economic climate.
Apple greatness
iPhone 12
iOS fans can't go wrong with this one
If iOS is your operating system of choice, the iPhone 12 is an easy recommendation. It costs a bit more than the Pixel 5, but Apple delivers a ton of important upgrades while still keeping it relatively affordable. The OLED display looks excellent, the A14 Bionic is ridiculously fast, and the new design sure is something. You're also getting all of the iPhone-exclusive features you know and love.

Oculus Quest 2
An aging headset
Oculus Quest
The original Oculus Quest was a great headset for its time, and Facebook improved it across the board when designing the Oculus Quest 2. The Oculus Quest 2 is lighter, more powerful, and more refined than its predecessor. While the Oculus Quest 2 won't have an exclusive library of games, at least for now, it is overall better than the original Oculus Quest in just about every way. On top of all the hardware improvements on the Oculus Quest 2, the new headset is also more affordable than the original Oculus Quest. The Oculus Quest 2 starts shipping on October 13, so now's the time to decide which VR headset is right for you.
Oculus Quest 2 vs. Oculus Quest Specs
Facebook improved the Oculus Quest 2 across the board compared to its predecessor. The Snapdragon XR2 processor is several generations newer than the Snapdragon 835 of the original Oculus Quest, and the 6GB of RAM of the Oculus Quest 2 helps the headset run smoothly.
All of those internal improvements add up. In our Oculus Quest 2 vs. Oculus Quest graphics comparison games were significantly better on the Oculus Quest 2. The Oculus Quest 2 yields better performance, sharper images, and all-around better-looking games. As more developers take advantage of the Oculus Quest 2's hardware, games will perform and look even better on the new headset.
|Category||Oculus Quest 2||Oculus Quest 2|
|Processor||Snapdragon XR2||Snapdragon 835|
|RAM||6GB||4GB|
|Display refresh rate||90Hz (72Hz at launch)||72Hz|

|Color||White||Black|
|Starting Price||$299||$399|
256GB
128GB
In addition to improving the major hardware internals, Facebook also refined the design when making the Oculus Quest 2. The Oculus Quest 2 is lighter, has more ergonomic Touch Controllers, and supports accessories like the Quest 2 Elite strap.
Oculus Quest 2 vs. Oculus Quest Price
The Oculus Quest 2's price is one of the biggest surprises about the new headset. Rather than lining up with the launch price of the Oculus Quest, the Oculus Quest 2 starts at $299.
Widening the gap even further, if you're willing to pay an extra $100 for an Oculus Quest 2 with more storage, you get a model with 256GB. The original Oculus Quest maxes out at 128GB but still costs $100 more than its 64GB variant. If you're debating on if the extra cost is worth it, we have a full breakdown comparing the 64GB and 256GB versions of the Oculus Quest 2 to help you out.
With a starting price that's $100 lower and a bigger bang for your buck if you opt for a model with more storage, the Oculus Quest 2 is the clear winner when it comes to pricing.
*Oculus Quest 2 vs. Oculus Quest8 Display
The display of the Oculus Quest 2 is also significantly improved. While it only supports 72Hz at launch, the Oculus Quest 2 will support a 90Hz refresh rate in the future. The display of the Oculus Quest 2 also has significantly more pixels than that of the original Oculus Quest.
The display of the Oculus Quest 2 utilizes RGB stripe, which is the same technology that the Oculus Rift S uses. The end result is a sharper looking display when compared to PenTile OLED displays. Even if the Oculus Quest 2 and Oculus Quest had the same pixel count, which they don't, an RGB stripe display would still look sharper. The only drawback of the Oculus Quest 2's display is that it is LCD rather than OLED. As a result, blacks aren't as dark on the Oculus Quest 2.
Oculus Quest 2 vs. Oculus Quest What about Facebook accounts?
The Oculus Quest 2 is the first headset from Facebook to require people to use a Facebook account. That's considered a downside for some, but the original Oculus Quest will also require a Facebook account in the future to maintain full functionality.
Facebook is ending support for Oculus accounts on January 1, 2023. People will have an option to merge their Oculus and Facebook accounts before that date. If a person chooses not to merge their accounts, they can still use an older headset, "but full functionality will require a Facebook account," according to Facebook. Facebook doesn't fully explain what will happen if people don't merge their accounts, but states that "some games and apps may no longer work."
Oculus Quest 2 vs. Oculus Quest Games
The Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 share the same growing library of games. At least for the foreseeable future, every game for the Oculus Quest will also work on the Oculus Quest 2. While the same games will be available on both the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2, the games will look and perform better on the Oculus Quest 2.
Since the Oculus Quest 2 has better internals and a better display, games will run smoother and appear better on the newer headset.
Both headsets also support Oculus Link, allowing you to play PCVR games by connecting your VR headset to a gaming PC. Like native games, any title should look better on the Oculus Quest 2. While PCVR games through Oculus Link are powered by your gaming PC, the improved display on the Oculus Quest 2 will still result in better-looking gameplay.
If you prefer to play PCVR games on your VR headset without having to use any wires, you can use Virtual Desktop. Since the Oculus Quest 2 supports Wi-Fi 6 and has a better display, it also wins on this front over its predecessor. In
Oculus Quest 2 vs. Oculus Quest Which should you buy?
It's not surprising that the Oculus Quest 2 is better than the Oculus Quest in just about every way. If the Oculus Quest 2 wasn't better, that would be a reason for concern akin to the PS4 being better than the PS5 (it's not, by the way). That being said, it's nice that the Oculus Quest 2 is so much better in so many different ways.
The jump from the original Oculus Quest to the Oculus Quest 2 isn't just about improving internal specs. Yes, the Oculus Quest 2 has a much faster processor, a better display, and more RAM, but it also has an improved design, better Touch Controllers, and support for more accessories.
Unlike laptops and phones, where buying an older model might save you some money and be worth it in terms of bang for your buck, the Oculus Quest 2 is better when it comes to price as well. The Oculus Quest 2 starts at $299, which is $100 cheaper than the original Oculus Quest. Even if you opt for the Oculus Quest 2 with 256GB of storage, it's still $399, which is the starting price of the original Oculus Quest.
The Oculus Quest 2 is better across the board than the original Oculus Quest, and those improvements come with few drawbacks. The Oculus Quest 2 is more powerful, lighter, more refined, and cheaper than the original Oculus Quest. If you're picking up a new VR headset, the Oculus Quest 2 is the one to buy.

If you are ready to upgrade your wireless network there are a ton of options to choose from. Wi-Fi 6 is pushing speeds higher than every before while mesh expansion is making it easy to add coverage where you need it.The early days of 5G networks are confusing, with the biggest annoyance being the explanation of what kind of 5G network a given carrier is using. There's mmWave, which Verizon is incredibly bullish on, and then there's Sub-6, which has been deployed by far more carriers around the world and is easier to launch quickly and comprehensively. (And then, there are differences in implementation with mid-band and low-band Sub-6 networks.) T-Mobile launched its Sub-6 5G network "nationwide" this week on its low-band spectrum, and I've been using it for a week on a OnePlus 7T Pro.
The best part of Sub-6 5G is that carriers are able to (relatively) simply upgrade existing LTE towers, and use existing low-band spectrum. Performing to towers you already have, rather than deploying thousands of small cells necessary for mmWave, dramatically increases the rate you can launch the network. And running on very low-band 600MHz spectrum means you don't need as many towers upgraded to give areas substantial coverage.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
That's how T-Mobile was able to flip the switch and announce it has "nationwide" 5G coverage so quickly. Its 5G network immediately covers 200 million people, which isn't a complete match of its LTE footprint but is substantial — and will be available in the largest and densest cities. This low-band spectrum is also generally beneficial for having a signal inside buildings, which has historically been an issue for T-Mobile.
It's all, theoretically, a big win for T-Mobile. In actuality, the real-world benefits of using this OnePlus 7T Pro on a 5G network are smaller than you'd think given the big promises around 5G as a whole.
T-Mobile's 5G coverage is great, and the few times you have to drop to 4G it does so seamlessly.
To start on the positives, T-Mobile's 5G network is great in terms of coverage. I was on 5G most of the time, which is miles ahead from Verizon's tiny 5G coverage map. And T-Mobile's 5G also doesn't have the massive inconsistency and trade-offs of Verizon's: the phone holds onto a 5G connection consistently as you move around (either walking or in a car), seamlessly transitions from 5G to 4G, and doesn't seem to drain battery appreciably faster than 4G phones. We've come to expect with 3G and 4G that new networks have to come with slow rollouts, but that isn't the case here — T-Mobile's starting strong in terms of 5G availability.
On the other hand, speeds you get on T-Mobile 5G are far lower than the mind-blowing numbers we see from Verizon. For the most part, I was getting downloads in the range of 50-100 mbps, with uploads in the 5-50 mbps range. On rare occasion my download speeds would go as high as 250 mbps, but those instances were few and far between. Those 200+ mbps tests aside, download and upload speeds were typically about 25% higher than T-Mobile 4G speeds. That's nothing to sneeze at, but it's hard to say you can actually notice the difference between 75 and 60 mbps with anything but a synthetic speed test — and those speeds are what we already regularly see from well-developed 4G networks around the world.
And then you hit instances where the 4G network is actually faster than 5G. T-Mobile didn't need to upgrade all of its towers to reach this 200 million population coverage, so there are times when you're connected to 5G that's weaker than a T-Mobile 4G phone right next to it — presumably because it's holding onto a less-than-optimal tower just to stay on 5G. I had many instances where my Pixel 4 XL matched or beat my OnePlus 7T Pro's speeds.
You can expect about a 25% speed bump over T-Mo 4G, though it isn't as consistent as I'd like.
And that's only an in-network comparison. Verizon's 4G network regularly beat T-Mobile's 5G network in my side-by-side testing, with consistent 50-100 mbps speeds where T-Mobile 5G was around 50 (or in some cases indoors, more like 15). The reality is that T-Mobile's 5G network suffers from the same quirks as its 4G one: speeds can be fantastic, but they're often less consistent than Verizon and AT&T, and there are many instances inside buildings and in rural areas where the service is just downright disappointing. These issues can be fixed, and T-Mobile would love you to believe that its acquisition of Sprint will accelerate those changes, but right now this is 5G done through the same exact playbook as what we've come to expect from T-Mobile's 4G; for better and worse.
This isn't a game-changing experience yet, but it's a network you can experience just about anywhere.
The biggest win for T-Mobile is that there's really no downside to this 5G network. Sure it's often the same speed as, or only marginally faster than, its 4G network. But in some cases it's considerably faster, and you never have to hunt around to find it. Your phone's going to be on 5G most of the time; and when it isn't, you're falling back to a solid 4G network. So even though it isn't a complete game-changing experience, it's a noticeable improvement that you get to experience in far more places than the other U.S. 5G networks right now. For many people, that's a fine trade-off when they may be months or years away from having access to another carrier's 5G network where they live.
T-Mobile isn't charging more for 5G plans, so the only part of this whole situation that's a truly tough sell is its device selection. The OnePlus 7T Pro I'm using is a whopping $900, $200 more than the standard OnePlus 7 Pro and $300 more than the OnePlus 7T; and your only other choice is the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G for $1300. The OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren Edition has been a joy to use, but so is the regular OnePlus 7 Pro — and I don't think I can really value access to this 5G network at $200.
T-Mobile's 5G pitch will be dramatically easier when it has a complete portfolio of 5G phones, and the price premium for getting one isn't so dramatic. Because as far as the network goes, it's off to a great start.
Into the 5G future
OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren Edition
A great phone, but one that has questionable value at this price.
The OnePlus 7T Pro (or 7 Pro) is a great phone. OnePlus software continues to be excellent, and the hardware and specs you get are top-notch. But adding 5G sure doesn't feel like it's worth this extra money over the 4G version.

These are the best accessories to improve your Oculus Quest
The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!The long-running LG G series retires this year, and in its place comes a new mid-level flagship built around design and aesthetic beauty. The LG Velvet mixes up the stale design language seen in some of the company's recent phones, and also boasts 5G connectivity thanks to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G platform. In fact, it'll be among the first 765-powered phones to arrive in the West.
LG's Dual Screen is back too, with a new, slimmer, and more stylish version of the accessory shipping for the Velvet. The Dual Screen was pretty goofy a year ago when it first debuted alongside the V50. In the past year, however, LG has refined the hardware and software to the point where it's genuinely useful, improving gaming and multitasking similarly to a phone with a true foldable screen.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
But even though this might be LG's best-looking and most useful phone yet, it's let down by weaknesses that belie its status as a veteran Android phone maker. The Velvet's camera, on current firmware, is not great. And a 60Hz display combined with some strange touch scrolling issues can, at times, make for a frustrating experience.
At a glance
LG Velvet
Bottom line: With expected pricing around the US $750 mark, you could certainly do a lot worse than the LG Velvet. The Dual Screen accessory, in particular, might be its greatest asset — giving many folding-phone benefits at a much lower price. Direct rivals like the OnePlus 8 offer a better balance of specs and features at a similar price point, and fans of the Dual Screen concept would be better off bagging a discounted V60.
Pros
- Beautiful design
- Dual Screen add-on is genuinely useful
- Dependable all-day battery life
- Solid specs for the price, including 5G
Cons
- Weak camera, with oversharpening in photos
- Slow fingerprint + no face unlock option
- Scrolling physics issues in some apps
LG Velvet Design and display
The Velvet is probably the best-looking phone LG has ever produced. While there's not a whole lot of room left to make a glass and metal rectangle stand out from the crowd, LG's new phone is pleasing to the eyes, comfortable to hold, and significantly less slippery than some of the company's other models.
LG emphasizes symmetry in the Velvet's chassis design, with the gentle curve of the back panel mirroring the horizontal corners of the display. Add in slightly squared-off corners and symmetrical display borders, and you've got a pretty attractive handset.
Even the "water droplet" effect created by the rear camera placement is an improvement on the large visor-style camera module of the LG V series.
We're reviewing the LG Velvet in its fairly subdued "aurora green" hue, however, you'll find more ostentatious offerings in the form of the "aurora white" and "illusion sunset" variants. The latter would probably be my first choice, with an eye-catching iridescent finish.
LG's best-looking phone ever.
While the metal contact points around the edges of the phone are extremely thin, I've found it easy enough to hold on to. Unlike many of the matte-textured phones from LG's back catalog, the glossy finish helps with grip. And the curved edges, which are more pronounced than I've seen in an LG phone before, also help disguise the Velvet's relatively large size.
Those side edges are also home to the standard loadout of buttons — power and volume — in addition to the dedicated Google Assistant key. Meanwhile, the bottom bezel houses that rarest of things, a 3.5mm headphone jack, alongside the USB-C port and bottom-firing speaker. (Note, however, that this is a plain old headphone jack, and doesn't feature the vaunted Quad DAC of more expensive LG phones.)
The Velvet's audio is pretty middle-of-the-road, with little to praise or complain about. The main loudspeaker, paired with the slimline earpiece tweeter, provides ample volume for casual YouTube sessions but sounds a little thin at higher volume levels.
The display itself is a 6.8-inch P-OLED panel at Full HD+ resolution, with a tiny dimpled notch up top. LG continues to resist the move towards hole-punch OLEDs, and the Velvet's teardrop cutout is inoffensive enough. On the whole, I found the display to be pleasing and vibrant, though the default white balance level was noticeably cooler than most other OLEDs I've used (fortunately, this can be easily changed in the display settings menu). Otherwise, daylight visibility even under bright sunlight was passable, and the manual brightness slider can get it dark enough for comfortable night-time viewing.
This is a 60Hz panel, though. That's not a surprise — after all, LG's flagship V60 also eschews the higher refresh rates seen in rival brands' phones. But 90 and 120Hz screens are becoming more common, even at the Velvet's price point. (In particular, the vanilla OnePlus 8 manages a 90Hz display and beefier silicon for around the same price as LG's offering.) Aside from the refresh rate, I've also noticed some weirdness with scrolling acceleration in some situations, like quickly swiping between apps using gesture controls. It's hard to describe, but the physics of certain scrolling mechanics just seem slightly sluggish, even compared to other 60Hz handsets.
LG Velvet Performance and battery life
The LG Velvet runs Qualcomm's new mid-tier Snapdragon 765 platform, aimed at less expensive flagship phones with 5G connectivity. Benchmarks have pegged the chip around the level of a Snapdragon 845, though with efficiency benefits thanks to its 7nm manufacturing process. Bottom line: in terms of raw horsepower, you're getting the power of a flagship phone from around 18 months ago, with better battery life and 5G connectivity.
Rounding out the specs sheet is an ample 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage (expandable via microSD), and a 4,300mAh battery — an appropriate loadout for a mid-to-high-end device like this.

Qi wireless charging
I've already touched on some of the touchscreen wonk I experienced; aside from scrolling sometimes feeling a little off, the LG Velvet has been a quick and reliable performer. I didn't run into any noticeable memory management issues or slowdowns, either in everyday apps like Twitter and Chrome, or games such as Mario Kart Tour or Asphalt 9.
What's less ideal, however, is the Velvet's relatively sluggish in-screen fingerprint scanner, which is noticeably slower than Android flagships from the past couple of years. It's reasonably reliable, but definitely takes a few extra fractions of a second to unlock compared to contemporary in-screen scanners I've used. And that's all the more problematic considering the face unlock feature seen in previous LG phones has been removed in this model, so there's no biometric backup option.
Decent battery life and everyday performance, but a frustratingly slow fingerprint scanner.
The perception of speed compared to a 120Hz or even 90Hz smartphone is something entirely separate, though. There's no denying that the Velvet just feels less responsive to the touch than other phones that pack more hertz.
Super-fast screens are power-hungry, though, and one benefit of the Velvet's more ordinary refresh rate is improved longevity. The built-in 4,300mAh battery easily lasted me a full day, even with heavier use on LTE (although my unit was a 5G-equipped version, I wasn't able to test the device on a 5G network, so your mileage may vary there). With my usage patterns, I was looking at around 18 hours off the charger with between five and six hours of screen-on time.
Predictable battery-intensive uses included photography, gaming, and anything involving extended use of the LG Dual Screen attachment since the phone's main battery powers the Dual Screen.
As for refills, you're looking at Qualcomm Quick Charge 4+ support over a cable, as well as Qi charging — though be aware the latter option is fairly slow. LG's using standard Qi as opposed to anything quicker and more exotic; the phone reported around four hours remaining to charge from 30% to full on my Google Pixel Stand. For wired charging, Quick Charge 4+ isn't the fastest around, but that's forgivable in light of the phone's solid longevity.
LG Velvet Software and Dual Screen
The LG Velvet runs Android 10 out of the box, layered with LG UX 9.1. For the uninitiated, LG's Android software has taken on a Samsung lookalike aesthetic over the past year, with design elements from the company's first-party apps clearly aping its local rival's look and feel. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though — it's feature-rich, as you'd expect, and the design language is consistent throughout the phone's software. If you're a fan of bright colors, rounded rectangles, and a lot of whites and light greys, you'll be happy with what LG's brought to the table. (The new "circular" wallpapers, spanning the lock screen, home screen, and always-on display are sure to be a hit if you're a fan of primary colors.)
The LG UX is a Samsung copycat, but I don't necessarily mind that.
Android 10's gesture navigation is present and works well on the Velvet, and there's now an additional option for a swipe and hold gesture from the outer edge to activate a helpful one-handed reachability mode. And LG has spun out its own pop-up view mode for most apps, letting you shrink them down into a floating window for easier multitasking.
The LG UX is also a very Google-centric smartphone experience. The Google Feed has been plugged into LG's home screen — and, of course, the dedicated Google Assistant button lets you summon the AI at any time, with a single press or in walkie-talkie mode. The software has also been kitted out with Google's Live Transcription service, which uses Google's AI smarts to give you instant subtitles for any audio on your device.
For the LG Velvet, though, the biggest potential issue with its software isn't what it does or doesn't do right now, but how well it'll be supported in the future. The company has a dreadful track record when it comes to platform updates, trailing the pack with slow-paced Android 10 OTAs. While monthly security updates have been regularly rolled out on the LG phones I've used over the past year, I wouldn't hold my breath for a speedy Android 11 update on any of LG's current devices.
The Dual Screen attachment is the biggest thing the LG Velvet has going for it.
The most exciting feature of the LG Velvet, and perhaps its greatest selling point, is its Dual Screen attachment. Like previous versions for the V50, V60, and G8X, the Dual Screen encloses the Velvet in a plastic shell and gives it a second display of the same dimensions as its regular screen. (Although in this case, the second screen is flat, not curved.)
When it's closed, a small OLED panel on the outside can show you the time and notification icons. When opened out, you get an expansive new viewport.
The Dual Screen has grown quite a few new features since I last used it on the G8X. More apps — including Google Photos, YouTube, Gmail, Chrome, and others — are supported in "wide view," which spans the app over the entire combined width of the two displays. Game support has been expanded too, with more titles now able to use LG's Game Pad mini-app, which repurposes the main screen as a virtual game controller.
Juggling what effectively amounts to two full-sized smartphones might sound cumbersome at first, but it's surprisingly intuitive once you get the hang of it. Both screens have their own launcher layout, and apps will launch on whichever screen you tap their icon. Most of the Dual Screen's controls — for features like swapping screens or activating wide mode — live behind a floating menu bar on the primary screen. Apps can also be easily juggled between screens with a three-finger swipe.
The LG Dual Screen isn't as futuristic or impressive as a real foldable like the Samsung Galaxy Fold or Huawei Mate Xs, but it does deliver most of the multitasking benefits of those devices, at a much lower price point, and in a much more durable form factor.
My only complaint with LG's dual-screen accessory has to do with the docking and undocking process. Because of the off-center camera cutout, wiggling the LG Velvet free from the Dual Screen can be a challenge. The first few times undocking the phone can be an anxious experience, as you try to avoid snapping either it or the Dual Screen in half.
LG Velvet Cameras
For me, the Velvet's biggest letdown is its camera setup. LG has done a great job making the camera module itself look appealing, but the photos themselves leave a lot to be desired.
Curiously, it's LG's software post-processing that seems to be most at fault here. On paper, the Velvet has decent camera specs — a 48-megapixel primary shooter behind an f/1.8 lens and f/2.2 ultrawide at 8 megapixels aAn additional 5MP camera handles depth-sensing duties). In terms of colors, low-light performance, and responsiveness, there's not much to complain about. There's even the obligatory AI scene detection mode that does a decent job of detecting what you're shooting, and subtly adjusting the camera's settings accordingly.
But LG's camera app insists on an obnoxious level of sharpening, especially in photos taken with the primary camera. This leads to leaves, branches, or any area with a lot of grain or fine detail being given an ugly mosaic effect. Even clouds can be seen to exhibit weird, unnatural levels of sharpness and definition, while clean blue skies take on an unusual level of grain even in perfectly lit landscape scenes. And the same effect seems to be responsible for chroma noise creeping into 2X zoom shots, even in well-lit conditions.
The same effects are visible in video taken from the Velvet's main camera (aside from the oversharpening issue, I was impressed by the camera's video stabilization in 1080p mode). Shooting with the ultrawide, the oversharpening is present but less noticeable. The front-facer too comes away unscathed, shooting crisply defined selfies at 16 megapixels with a run-of-the-mill 29mm focal length.
All too often, the Velvet's main camera produces gross-looking, overcooked, oversharpened images.
Indoors and in scenes with less granular detail, the camera's excessive processing is less problematic. In fact, the Velvet's main camera performs competently in darker conditions using its night mode feature. But that can't make up for what seems to be an incomplete and limiting camera experience.
You'll also miss out on a true telephoto camera, though that's acceptable considering the Velvet's Korean price of just over US $700. You're dealing with a 48-megapixel sensor that spits out 12MP pics by default, so there's just about enough resolution to go to 2X before you start to lose detail. At 3X or beyond, though, photos quickly become blotchy, with an unpleasant oil painting effect.
The Velvet's photo processing woes — mainly the oversharpening of shots from the main camera — can absolutely be addressed in software, should LG choose to. But at present, there are plenty of other handsets around this price point that'll get you a better photographic experience.
LG Velvet The competition
The sub-flagship category is one of the most competitive segments of the Android phone space right now. LG hasn't confirmed exact U.S. or European pricing for the phone, but it's indicated that it'll be cheaper for Americans than a direct currency conversion of the Korean price.
LG announced last week that LG Velvet market availability in North America is coming in the weeks ahead. While LG has not announced US-specific pricing and availability, when Velvet arrives in the US it will cost less than the current KRW-to-USD conversion of $750. Pricing and availability in the US will vary by carrier, but depending on the US SKU it could cost more than $100 less.
Depending on where in that range the eventual U.S. pricing falls, that puts it up against the OnePlus 8 and a handful of older 2019 flagships, like the Samsung Galaxy S10.
OnePlus offers a smoother screen at a similar price point.
OnePlus's offering has a similar camera setup — wide, ultrawide, and depth-sensing — though it doesn't suffer from any of the processing issues mentioned earlier. Its 90Hz display is also significantly quicker and more responsive than the LG Velvet's, too. If you're in the U.S., though, your 5G options may be limited by this model. The OnePlus 8 also can't do wireless charging and lacks the Velvet's IP68 rating for water and dust resistance.
The S10 is more than a year old and also packs a 60Hz screen, as well as IP68 protection and wireless charging. And it's still likely to be updated more reliably than the LG Velvet, while also packing a superior triple-camera setup with true telephoto zoom.
Neither, of course, boast the Velvet's main attraction, the Dual Screen attachment. But if your heart is set on that feature, the somewhat more expensive LG V60 ThinQ provides Dual Screen capabilities in a more competent all-round smartphone.
LG Velvet Should you buy it?
Who it's for
- If you want a Dual Screen experience for less
- If 5G connectivity is important, but you don't want to pay a lot
- If all-day battery life matters more than a smooth display
- If you really really want a 3.5mm headphone jack
Who it isn't for
- If you're a big photographer
- If you want the latest Android platform updates quickly
- If you want the smoothest Android experience
The LG Velvet is a mixed bag. It's a phone with striking good looks, a modern chipset, and 5G connectivity at a reasonable price. (At least in Korea.) Some of its compromises are understandable: You don't necessarily expect the fastest screen or super-quick charging around the $700 mark. (Although some of its competitors can absolutely deliver those things at a similar price point.)
And it's a great way to get in on LG's most promising feature in years. The Dual Screen attachment is fun, useful, and something the company should keep pursuing.
But other flaws, like the camera processing issues we encountered, are tough to justify in any modern smartphone. Photography is such a core feature in any smartphone at any price point, and the Velvet's current image processing issues make it hard to recommend to anyone serious about phone photography.
That leaves a pretty narrow audience for the Velvet, which emerges as a decent mid-range offering with only one real standout feature and a handful of compromises. Maybe it's for you, but you should take a long, hard look at the competition before committing.
Mixed bag
LG Velvet
LG's sub-flagship offering isn't without its compromises
The LG Velvet is an attractive smartphone, boasting a unique Dual Screen attachment and 5G connectivity at a price significantly less than the top-tier Android flagships. But it isn't the speediest handset in its price category, and photo quality isn't the best we've seen.

Final Fantasy 16 for PlayStation 5 brings players a brand new story and characters set amidst familiar spirits, creatures, and monsters. Not much is known yet about Final Fantasy 16, but we here at Android Central have gathered everything you need to know before diving into this gorgeous action RPG.
Coming this November
PlayStation 5
Get your hands on it before it sells out
The next gen console from Sony, the PlayStation 5 is coming Nov. 12, 2020. Preorders have gone fast, but more may become available at select retailers prior to launch. Final Fantasy 16 is console exclusive for at least a year, so if you want to dive into the latest title in this epic series, you'll need the PS5.
What is Final Fantasy 16 for PS5?
The latest in the epic sci-fi fantasy series, Final Fantasy 16 (XVI) is a single player action RPG coming soon from Square Enix. Announced as a PS5 console exclusive on Sept. 17, 2020, Final Fantasy XVI promises to be the most stunning Final Fantasy yet. As with most Final Fantasy games, this one will feature entirely new characters in a new world with many familiar faces in the form of summoned spirits and monstrous foes.
What we know about Final Fantasy 16 for PS5
Produced by Naoki Yoshida, the director and producer of Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn, as well as chief planner of Dragon Quest X and directed by Hiroshi Takai, assistant director of Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn, the Final Fantasy 16 project has expanded to include a full team.
During the reveal, a trailer titled Awakening was released. The trailer revealed hints of a plot centered around the bodyguard of a special child, Joshua, who's the son of an Archduke and seems to carry the spirit of a familiar summon or Eikon within his body. After some pretty significant trauma, Joshua loses control of the Eikon within him, leading to a battle of epic proportions between Phoenix and Ifrit.
Also depicted in the trailer were two other summons, Titan and Shiva, as well as a number of other familiar creatures, including a Malboro, a Coeurl, and several Chocobo. You can check out the trailer above.
What we want from Final Fantasy 16 for PS5
Seeing as Final Fantasy 16 is being produced by the same Naoki Yoshida who directed and produced Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn, players have a lot to hope for from this project. Unlike many Final Fantasy games, A Realm Reborn has persisted in both maintaining and growing its player base well after the release of new Final Fantasy games. Although this is due in part to it being an MMORPG, the design and polish on A Realm Reborn has been widely praised by critics and fans alike.
With each addition made to Final Fantasy 14, it has earned more praise, inspiring confidence that Final Fantasy 16 will share the solid gameplay, stunning artwork, and engaging story Yoshida is known for.
Release date for Final Fantasy 16 for PS5
Square Enix has not yet provided a release date. Yoshida stated on the PlayStation Blog that more will be revealed in 2021 Although it was originally announced to include a PC version, currently Square Enix has no official plans for a release outside of the PS5.
According to Piers Harding-Rolls on Twitter, Final Fantasy 16 will be exclusive to PlayStation 5 for at least six months, after which it could potentially be launched on PC. Additionally, it would remain console exclusive for at least six more months. There are no current confirmed plans to release on PC or Xbox Series X.

These are the very best Android TVs you can buy in 2020
Remembering Google Play Music: A mixtape for my favorite streaming service
How are you liking the Pixel 5 so far?
Replace your PlayStation Blu-ray player with these 4K UHD Blu-ray players
While the specs and price of the PlayStation 5 Digitel Edition make it tempting, what can you do with all your 4K UHD Blurays? Buy a player, that's what.With the Galaxy S series being so utterly dominant in the high-end Android phone market, it takes a lot of pressure off of the Galaxy Note. Just about anyone's smartphone needs can be addressed by the Galaxy S10 or S10+; they're the "do everything" phones, available in two sizes at two palatable price points with otherwise identical features and capabilities.
So what can the Galaxy Note 10+ bring to the table when the Galaxy S10+ is still excellent and has only gotten more appealing with price cuts six months after its launch? Naturally, you have the S Pen, a larger screen, even better specs, and a few new productivity features to lean on.
But is that going to be enough to justify its price jump from the Galaxy S10+? After all, the Note is supposed to be the power-user phone of choice. It's for the most discerning of smartphone buyers, the biggest Samsung fans and the stylus faithful. Here's how it all comes together to justify an $1100 price tag.
Big stylus power
Samsung Galaxy Note 10+
The best Samsung has to offer, all in one phone.
It's like a Galaxy S10+, but slightly better in several ways. With a bigger screen, more battery, higher-end specs and the truly unique S Pen. You just have to be willing to pay a considerable amount extra for those marginal improvements — and lose the headphone jack in the process.
The Good
- Incredible display
- Hardware looks and feels expensive
- Outstanding performance
- Great battery life and fast charging
- Consistent camera performance
- Best stylus experience on any phone
The Bad
- Low-light camera quality is weak
- Software requires lots of tweaking
- No headphone jack
Galaxy Note 10+ Price & release date
The Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ was officially launched on August 7, 2019, with a retail price of $1,100. For its time, the Note 10+ was one of the most powerful and capable smartphones you could buy. It's now 2020, and while the Note 10+ isn't the latest Note in Samsung's lineup (that title goes to the Note 20 Ultra), it's still a fantastic purchase. Its specs and features hold up really well, and while it lacks 5G connectivity, you can still use it just fine on any major carrier in the United States.
If you're looking to purchase the Galaxy Note 10+ for yourself, there are a few shopping tips you should know — the first of which is that you shouldn't pay full price for the phone. Samsung is known to offer regular discounts for its devices, especially if they've been available for a few months. With Amazon Prime Day 2020 and Black Friday quickly approaching, it's more than likely the phone will go on sale during those savings events.
It's also worth keeping an eye on what Samsung's offering on its online storefront. As of right now, you can get a $250 instant credit when trading in your old device.
Galaxy Note 10+ Hardware, design, and display
Samsung's hardware design and quality is worthy of applause, but it already was on the Galaxy S10, Note 9, S9 ... well, ever since the Galaxy S6, really. But whether you've held every Samsung phone ever made or this is somehow your first time picking one up, the Note 10+ exudes quality.
The Note 10+ just exudes quality in every possible way.
There's just enough metal (which is an aluminum alloy, not stainless steel) to give you that feeling of solidity between the panes of curved glass. The fit-and-finish is superb, and the 196 gram weight is nicely distributed; albeit heavy compared to the average high-end phone. And while having the power button on the left side now feels awkward at first, its dramatically lower placement, coupled with the removal of a dedicated Bixby button, is a big improvement in overall usability.
That's not to say that the Note 10+ will be easily usable for everyone; it's still quite massive no matter where the buttons are. For the most part you can get around its size, but certain actions like typing with one hand, reaching across the screen for a slide-in drawer and going to the top of the screen for buttons are chores. When you get a Note 10+, you're resigning yourself to have to wait and use two hands for many things — but in return you get a huge screen to look at all the time. Add in its slippery back and smooth edges, and it can instill doubt as to whether you can keep the Note 10+ securely in your hand at all times. (A thin case helped my usage a ton.)
With the metal and glass taken to their logical — and most efficient — conclusion of a rectangular slab, there isn't much Samsung could add in terms of flair. That is, unless you buy the Aura Glow color, which I have in for review. This reflective, shimmering, color-changing exterior is brilliant and completely unique. It looks like a different color from every angle and in every kind of light, which is just downright fun. You'll turn heads.
Complete Galaxy Note 10+ specs
The fact that Samsung continues to lead in display technology should come as no surprise. The Dynamic AMOLED panel, in all its 6.8-inch glory, is once again setting the bar. It's bright, clear, visible in direct sunlight, has great viewing angles and is just as colorful or neutral as you want depending on which display setting you choose.
The fact that Samsung is continuing to lead in display technology should come as no surprise.
The only thing I'm really missing here is the buttery smoothness of the 90Hz display on the OnePlus 7 Pro, but considering that's nowhere near an industry-standard feature I can forgive Samsung for not having it. Especially when every other aspect of the display is excellent.
Samsung didn't stop at the display panel itself: you'll find dramatically smaller bezels and a less-intrusive camera cutout too. The bezels are so tiny at this point that when you pair them with the curved display edges the hardware really does just disappear in your hand and let you focus purely on the screen. Even the small cutout for the front-facing camera fades away thanks to its unobtrusive size and central placement — a huge improvement over the Galaxy S10+.
The tiny bezels are a welcomed change; the trade-off of an odd-sounding top speaker is not.
In order to make that tiny top bezel work, the top speaker had to go deeper inside the phone, which leads to a notable change in the way it sounds. There is a tiny slit at the top of the glass to let the sound out, but it doesn't seem to do much for direction — instead, the sound seems to just bounce around the top half of the phone and come out everywhere. It's great for phone calls because you don't have to position the phone on your ear any specific way, but creates an odd vibration in the phone when listening to anything at higher volumes. It's also not a balanced sound with the single bottom speaker, which is noticeable when holding the phone in landscape.
The Note 10+ follows in the footsteps of the S10 with the same ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, saving from further hardware design complexity. This is the one piece of the hardware equation that goes past "personal preference" to "objectively not good," because this sensor has not aged well in the last six months. It's too slow to recognize or reject a fingerprint, which makes you hesitate every single time you unlock the phone. Pair that with a relatively small recognition area and an always-on display that doesn't show the sensor area prominently, and this is a negative mark on an otherwise exceptional piece of hardware.
RIP, headphone jack
And I suppose I can't close out the hardware segment without mentioning the headphone jack. After years of holding it up as a core tenet, Samsung has finally decided it was time to let it go. You can argue all day whether this should be a standard feature on phones, but only you know whether it's a dealbreaker for your purchase decision.
The headphone jack is gone, and I'm long done complaining about it.
Samsung (somewhat) eases the transition by including USB-C headphones in the box, which unsurprisingly are the same as the 3.5 mm AKG buds from previous phones and sound just as good. A USB-C to 3.5 mm adapter would've been a nice addition, but Samsung charges you $15(!) for one of those.
I've been using phones without a headphone jack for a long time now and it doesn't really bother me, so I was on my merry way using the Note 10+ with Bluetooth headphones just like I do my Pixel 3 XL. Ultimately, your choice now is to either buy a Note 10+ and keep the S Pen but lose the headphone jack, or buy a Galaxy S10+ and get the opposite. The headphone jack is gone, and I'm long done complaining about it.
Galaxy Note 10+ Photo and video
I made it clear from the start that Samsung's insistence on keeping the same cameras — a 12MP main, 16MP ultra-wide and 12MP telephoto — from the Galaxy S10 was prone to be a shortcoming of the phone. It's not that the S10's cameras are bad — they're actually very good — but that they're already not the best in every respect today, and when there's clear room for improvement Samsung didn't make any.
Daylight photos are excellent from all three cameras, and each is incredibly consistent.
I can't levy a single complaint at the daylight photo quality, which is frankly superb and stands up to any other phone. Photos are crisp with great detail, filled with color, and exhibit strong dynamic range. Samsung still tends to over-saturate and over-expose a little, but I'd happily take erring on that side of things than the opposite. Photography nerds can apply tweaks and edits to get it just right, but the way Samsung does things is best for the average person who wants to share the photo straight out of camera.
The main camera is obviously the best of the three, but in good lighting the ultra-wide camera is fantastic and the telephoto strikes a fine balance between providing you with a unique perspective and losing a little quality. I would prefer if the telephoto was a more aggressive 3X zoom considering a digital 2X zoom on the main sensor is comparable in quality, but that's a small complaint.
All of my disappointment with the Note 10+'s cameras lies in low-light quality, which frankly hasn't kept up.
All of my disappointment with the Note 10+'s cameras lies in low-light quality, as has been the case with Samsung's cameras for years. As soon as the light goes down, you can rule out the wide-angle and telephoto cameras; though that's par for the course for most phones. What's problematic is that the main camera starts to fall apart sooner than I'd like with mixed or low light.
Frustratingly, the photos are bad in different ways depending on the low-light scenario. Sometimes you get a too-high ISO with lots of grain, other times a too-slow shutter with hand motion blur, and sometimes it's over-sharpened chroma noise; or you get some combination of the three. In any case, the excellent shot-to-shot confidence the camera gives you in good lighting is erased in low light scenes — it usually takes a couple tries, and in many cases I'm still not satisfied with what I get.
Now and then you can get lucky with Night Mode, which takes an excruciatingly long time to capture and sometimes produces a photo with more balanced colors and less noise. But most of the time all Night Mode can offer up is a brighter, but still subpar, shot. It's no competition for the Pixel's Night Sight in any way.
Low-light quality is passable, but that isn't good enough when Google and Huawei are doing substantially better.
The low-light quality is passable, but passable isn't good enough for an $1100 phone that exists in a world where Google and Huawei (and heck, even Sony) are doing great with nighttime photography. For cameras that are so good in so many ways, and didn't need any changes in daylight capture, it's disappointing to not see any noticeable low-light improvements.
On the other side, the front-facing camera is great, with good colors and auto focus to make sure your selfies are always sharp. I sure wish Samsung would've gone with a little wider field-of-view lens, because when you shoot front-facing video the crop gets a little too tight; this probably won't be a vlogger's go-to smartphone unless they want to use a short selfie stick.
Samsung did make changes in the video department, continuing the pitch of the Note 10 as being for video creators. There's enhanced video stabilization, Live Focus (bokeh) effects in video, and audio recording that tracks with the focus of your framing.
The new video stabilization is a substantial improvement, and it all happens automatically.
The new video stabilization is spectacular, now rivaling Google's excellent stabilization. Whether you're just walking down the street, in a car on a bumpy road or whatever, the Note 10+ will smooth out the video incredibly well. And it does so without introducing blurriness or a "jelly" effect, which is impressive in its own right. The microphone focus happens just as seamlessly, giving you better directed audio just like you'd expect.
The Live Focus effects are roughly as hit-or-miss as they are with photos, though small issues with edge detection are easier to ignore with a moving subject. They provide a little something that can spice up your videos, but you'll probably be more likely to just take nice clean (and steady) video without the effects unless you have a specific shot in mind.
Galaxy Note 10+ Software, features and battery life
The Note 10+ may be running One UI 1.5, ostensibly an update from the S10's software, but the changes come in the form of the handful of new Note features rather than any dramatic movements in the interface or user experience. This is still the familiar One UI everyone on a Galaxy S8 and newer has been using.
The software takes a considerable amount of work to get just right, but once you're done you'll be happy.
The inclusion of more Microsoft apps and services isn't intrusive whatsoever, as you can choose which apps to install during the initial setup process — or uninstall the ones you don't want later on. Samsung's insistence on having all of its own apps alongside the Google and Microsoft (if you install them) apps is more of an annoyance. I hope that the self-realization of shifting away from its own services to Microsoft's can also kickstart a re-evaluation of its overall app strategy going forward. The launcher lets you hide the apps you can't disable or uninstall, which is a good route to go if you're annoyed by the clutter.
And that's the name of the game for making Samsung's software work well: configure, disable and tweak. There are fewer features to be found, and fewer enabled by default, but there's still a lot to wade through on first startup. It can be overwhelming, and it takes several days to get everything set up just how you like it, which is a poor user experience. But once you go through the trouble, you can make the Note 10+ look and act exactly how you want.
The Note 10+ offers amazing performance no matter what you need to get done; it just won't quit.
Once I have everything set up to my liking, Samsung's software works just fine. I actually like the default launcher, I don't feel the need to apply any sort of theme to change the styling, and I'm used to the way it works at this point. I realize I don't use every feature that's available, but that's not really the intent — you should be able to find and use just what you want and leave the rest disabled.
No matter what you do, you're going to find amazing performance on the Note 10+. That shouldn't come as any surprise with a Snapdragon 855 and staggering 12GB of RAM, but I couldn't do a single thing that made the Note 10+ so much as hesitate — let alone stutter or actually have a problem. That's precisely what we all expect from this level of phone, but it's still worth noting. You're spending top dollar and getting top performance no matter what you throw at the Note 10+.
Battery life and charging
One of the benefits of having a huge phone is its correspondingly huge battery. 4300mAh is a whole lot to work with, and Samsung makes good on the Note's reputation for great battery life.
This is everything you want: incredible battery longevity and daily consistency.
I use my phone with as few power-saving measures as possible. I don't rely on Power Saving Mode, I use automatic brightness, I leave Always-on Display turned on, and I leave the whole host of apps and accounts syncing and pushing notifications. I stream a lot of podcasts and YouTube Music over Bluetooth, take a lot of photos, and keep up with plenty of email and social media updates. With a typical 16-17 hour day, I was heading to bed with about 20-25% battery remaining on a consistent basis. (These days usually have 3-5 hours of "screen on" time, for those who like that sort of stat.)
Samsung continues to have great battery life consistency, both throughout the day and from day to day. Nothing seems to dramatically drain the Note 10+'s battery, and I could always count on the same general percentage drop throughout each day no matter how I used it. Predictability in battery life is just as much of a feature as actual longevity in my book. The Note 10+ isn't going to be a two-day phone by any means, but in my entire review period I wasn't once worried about it dying prematurely.
We finally get charging speeds to match the Note's big battery.
The Note 10+ finally pairs that big battery with appropriate charging speeds, including a 25W charger in the box and support for 45W charging if you have the right adapter and cable. That 25W brick can get the phone from 0-100% in about 70 minutes, which is excellent for such a huge capacity. The 10-70% run, which is arguably more important, only takes roughly 30 minutes.
The Note 10+ won't take 45W from just any charger, unfortunately — you need both a USB-C power adapter that supports Programmable Power Supply (PPS) and an "e-marked" USB-C cable. Finding both is a struggle right now. But knowing the phone will take that charge using the in-box charger, Samsung's official 45W charger, and some other chargers (with more to come) is great now and going to get better over time.
Making use of the S Pen
I'll freely admit that I have never been a diehard S Pen fan. It could be that my handwriting is that bad. Or that I'm not much of an artist. Or that text input via typing or speech-to-text is simply much faster than writing with a stylus. Whatever the reason, the utility of the S Pen is mostly lost on me.
You can't deny the S Pen's capabilities — the only question is whether the features appeal to you.
But even still, I can't downplay the importance of the S Pen. Note users come to me regularly with a description of how the stylus fits into their workflow, and each and every one is valid. Taking quick notes on the lock screen throughout the day, signing and returning PDFs, and marking up documents for review are all great uses for the S Pen, and they may be the sorts of things you could see yourself doing on a regular basis. The S Pen has incredible accuracy and pressure sensitivity, is easy to write with, and has software support to back it up — you don't have to install anything to make full use of the S Pen for all of the aforementioned use-cases.
Whether you see value in the S Pen for these functions is purely a personal decision — not relying on them myself, I clearly won't be able to convince you — but it's undeniable that the technology is phenomenal and unique. You can't get this quality of stylus control on a phone anywhere else; so if those uses sound appealing, the Note 10+ is where it's at.
The chance you'll find something to use air actions for regularly is low.
The S Pen feature that's far more dubious is "air actions," which let you control apps from a distance with the S Pen. Building on what debuted with the Note 9, you can now hold the S Pen's button and make gestures — up, down, left, right and circular — to do even more. Just like before the functions are limited to just a few apps (basics like camera, gallery, internet, etc.), and just like before it's a neat novelty but not something I came to rely on.
There are specific use-cases like controlling the camera while it's propped up or in a tripod, or controlling the Gallery while the phone's facing another direction or plugged into a TV … but outside of that it's just not very compelling. Getting the gestures to work right takes a little time, but they're generally reliable once you do so — the bigger issue is there just aren't many interesting things you can do with them. My phone spends its time in my hand, and when it isn't in my hand I'm never going to be holding just the S Pen.
Making sense of DeX for PC
The DeX environment itself doesn't seem to have appreciably changed with the Note 10+, but Samsung has changed up the way it works so that you can now plug directly into a Windows or Mac computer and run the DeX desktop in a window. "DeX for PC," as it's called, makes way more sense than the original vision of plugging your phone into a dedicated dock with its own keyboard, monitor and mouse.
DeX for PC makes dramatically more sense than buying a dock just to use your phone like a computer.
Everyone has a PC or Mac and a USB-C cable handy to run DeX, whereas just about nobody was going to spend $100+ on a DeX dock and keep it connected to a standalone monitor and peripherals. I tested DeX for PC on my MacBook Pro, installing DeX and also Smart Switch (which is required for file transfers). Just plug in your phone, and it works! You get a window with the DeX desktop environment, which you can resize or run full-screen if you wish.
If you used DeX before and found use for running your phone's apps on a larger screen, you'll love this. If you haven't … you may be disappointed. Most apps don't resize or go into landscape mode, and generally don't translate well to a laptop-sized screen — something we've learned from a couple years using Android apps on Chromebooks. Browsers and productivity apps like email clients and word processors work well though, and if you're someone who has sensitive data locked up via an enterprise security system, this may be the easiest way to access and edit files on a larger screen.
The biggest feature that was appealing for me (and many others) was the ability to drag-and-drop files between the computer and DeX, but this only worked in one direction for me: from the computer to the phone. This could be a macOS limitation, or some odd incompatibility, but I went through all of the required steps and even uninstalled and reinstalled both DeX and Smart Switch to try to get it to work — but no dice. I hope it works better for Windows users, because the seamless transfer of files between the phone and computer could be the killer feature for people who want to seamlessly work between their phone and laptop.
Galaxy Note 10+ Bottom line
The historical goal of the Galaxy Note is, at least, twofold: to make a single device that represents a culmination of everything Samsung is capable of at a given point, and to continue to offer the industry's only high-end phone with a stylus. The latter is just a given — it's a Note, it has the S Pen, and nothing else comes anywhere close to competing with it.
Nowadays, "Note" just means "has an S Pen" — and that's really it.
The former is, for the first time now, in question. Samsung isn't so much failing to achieve as it is changing what the "Note" means. Nowadays, "Note" just means "has an S Pen" — and that's really it. With the removal of the headphone jack, generally iterative improvements or stagnant features, and the introduction of the smaller Note 10 that's out-classed in some ways by the S10+, the Galaxy Note no longer represents the biggest and best Samsung can do. It's simply a great phone — one that's great in all of the same ways Samsung's other phones are, but with an S Pen.
Is that a problem? Not really. Samsung's phones are excellent, and I've stood behind my decision to, on multiple occasions, list the latest Galaxy S as my favorite phone of the year and the one that I recommend to the most people. The Galaxy Note 10+ is excellent in all of the same ways. Giving people the choice to have a slightly larger (or smaller) phone with an S Pen and a few notched-up specs only expands Samsung's addressable market.
The lens through which this represents a problem is from the point of view of the bigtime Note fans. Slowly but steadily, from the launch of the Note 5 onward, the Galaxy Note has become less special, less cutting-edge, less interesting and less groundbreaking compared to Samsung's other phones. Samsung can say all day and night that the Note is still the biggest and best phone made for its most passionate and serious users, but the product available on the shelf simply doesn't follow that ethos. The Galaxy Note 10+ is still fantastic, but it's an easy argument to say that Samsung isn't doing right by those diehard Note fans anymore. It's still winning, but it's coasting to victory rather than accellerating.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10+
The Note 10+ is undeniably better than the Galaxy S10+ in several ways. But its improvements are, for the most part, marginal. It's the best phone Samsung makes, but it may not be worthy of the price jump over the S10+.

These are the best Galaxy Note 10 cases on the market!
The Galaxy Note 10 is a stunning, powerful, and shatter-prone smartphone. Keep it safe with one of these excellent cases!Personalize your new OnePlus 8T with some of the best accessories
For all that the OnePlus 8T is, it can always be more. From keeping your phone safe with a case or screen protector to beating your favorite mobile game on expert mode with a gaming controller, there's a way to make your phone suit your lifestyle better. Check out some of the best accessories for the OnePlus 8T.Okay, but seriously, Chadley is a stupid name. If you started up Final Fantasy 7 Remake, you probably have some questions about this Chadley character, his Intel Reports, and why you should bother with what are essentially pretty dull side quests. Or maybe you don't, and you blew off this kid and his achievement list. Why do you want to help this weird robot Shinra clone kid? Oh, right, Materia.
Who is Chadley? I don't remember him.
Chadley is a brand new character introduced in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, whose purpose seems to be to introduce certain Materia earlier in the game. Chadley begins his odd, mechanical introduction explaining that he works as an intern for Shinra Research and Development. This, of course, is a huge red flag for Cloud, the ex-SOLDIER who really would rather Shinra just stopped existing.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
However, with a quick promise that he plans on undermining Shinra from the inside, some oddly specific comments about how Cloud "of all people" would understand his mission, and a promise that Cloud can basically kill him later, Cloud is ready to work hand-in-hand with this odd, robot child. Well, we never said Cloud was the brightest crayon in the box. Still, it's pretty difficult to get through this game without completing at least some of Chadley's Intel Reports, and once you see the rewards, you'll probably aim to complete them all.
What are Chadley's Battle Intel Reports?
Starting in Chapter 3: Home Sweet Slum, you can start on Chadely's Battle Intel Reports. You see, Chadley needs data on various battle mechanics. It's just that simple. He'll give you an assignment involving materia, or the elements, or some other aspect of battle and, once you've completed his task, he'll offer you a reward. Some of these are easier to complete than others. Some you'll complete without even thinking about, while others will take a lot more effort, but they all lead up to Combat Simulations with some of the most iconic faces of the Final Fantasy franchise.
Why should I give this kid intel?
While common sense says Cloud probably shouldn't trust the weird robot kid who works for Shinra and just so happens to know that Cloud has a bone to pick with them, you're going to want to complete most, if not all of these quests for one reason: Materia. There are several Materia that can only be obtained from Chadley, including most of the Summons. Keep in mind, in the original Final Fantasy 7, you didn't get to summoning until much later in the game. Because Final Fantasy 7 Remake only covers the Midgar portion of the storyline, Chadley serves as a way to introduce those Summons much earlier. There are 20 Intel Reports in total, four of which grant you most of your Summon Materia:
|Report Number||Title||Task||Reward|
|Battle Intel Report 01||Monster Bio Pt. 1||Assess two enemy types||Auto-Cure Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 02||Magic Elements Pt. 1||Use Fire, Lightning, and Ice on vulnerable enemies||Wind Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 03||The Stagger Effect Pt. 1||Use unique abilities on staggered enemies||First Strike Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 04||The Stagger Effect Pt. 2||Stagger 15 enemy types||ATB Boost Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 05||Combat Simulation: Shiva||Defeat Shiva||Shiva Summon Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 06||Monster Bio Pt. 2||Assess 10 enemy types||Steadfast Block Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 07||Magic Elements Pt. 2||Exploit weaknesses of 15 enemy types||Steal Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 08||The Manipulation Technique||Defeat 2+ enemies with a single attack||Provoke Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 09||Monster variants Pt. 1||Defeat monsters of 3 unique varieties||Synergy Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 10||Combat Simulation: Fat Chocobo||Defeat a Fat Chocobo||Fat Chocobo Summon Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 11||Monster Bio Pt. 3||Assess 20 enemy types||Item Master Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 12||The Stagger Effect Pt. 3||Increase Stagger damage bonus to 200%||Parry Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 13||Refocus Analysis||Trigger Refocus twice||ATB Assist Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 14||The Stagger Effect Pt. 4||Stagger 40 enemy types||ATB Stagger Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 15||Combat Simulation: Leviathan||Defeat Leviathan||Leviathan Summon Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 16||Monster Bio Pt. 4||Assess 30 enemy types||Enemy Skill Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 17||Weapon Abilities||Acquire all 16 Weapon Abilities||Skill Master Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 18||MP Consumption||Master all 12 types of Magic Materia||MP Absorption Materia|
|Battle Intel Report 19||Monster Variants Pt. 2||Defeat monsters of 10 unique varieties||HP Absorption|
|Battle Intel Report 20||Combat Simulation: Bahamut||Defeat Bahamut||Bahamut Summon Materia|
And then what?
Upon completing each task, return to Chadley, and present him with your findings. He'll reward you by unlocking the next Intel Reports, and giving you access to those otherwise difficult (and in some cases, impossible) to find Materia. And, if he is secretly reporting those findings back to Shinra, at least you'll have Bahamut by your side when they come for you, right?

Get spooked with these great horror games for the PS4
Enjoy getting the pants scared clean off you? You might want to check out these horror games.Most people don't put enough thought into their wireless router. Things like the layout of your house, the materials, and how many stories it is all matter when you want good Wi-Fi from one end to the other. Or maybe you need to plug something into a router with a network cable in one room but still want great Wi-Fi everywhere else. Finding a networking solution that's flexible enough to meet your current and future needs can be a challenge, and it can be a huge pain to change your router every time you need some more coverage.
This is where wireless mesh networking makes the most sense. Sometimes one central wireless access point that sends out a powerful omnidirectional signal is perfect but often a mesh system delivers a better experience without giving up anything you need. There's a big difference between Wi-Fi in your house that works and Wi-Fi in your house that works well.
If you've decided to go with a mesh system, you're then faced with the question of which you should buy. While many of the best wireless routers have mesh support, these systems are focused on the mesh. We're going to look at four popular models and give you some information so you can make the right choice.
Mesh Wi-Fi Router Face-off Nest Wifi
Google's Nest Wifi is a follow-up to the successful Google Wifi system which provided a simple mesh system that was easy to expand and offered enough speed for most people. Nest Wi-Fi continues that trend and as such, Google has elected to only support Wi-Fi 5 with it since most people have yet to upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 devices. Still, it delivers enough speed for standard usage and should keep up with anything short of a gigabit connection.
The Wi-Fi 5 option Nest Wifi
Google has a vested interest in everyone being on the internet, and it's made a great wireless mesh system to help make it happen no matter where in your house you happen to be sitting. Nest Wifi is fast, easy to set up, and even easier to get into the settings thanks to its robust smartphone app for first time setup and adding more mesh points.
Pros
- It looks good — this matters because ideally, you'll have the satellites out in the open where everyone can see them.
- Constant updates
- Setup is so easy it's almost automatic
- Expand with Nest Wifi points, routers or Google Wifi
Cons
- Few advanced features
- Requires a Google account
- If you lose a connection to the internet, settings and options are very limited
Nest Wifi is the newest addition to the Google Wifi family, increasing the number of compatible Wi-Fi devices to three, which all fill different needs. The Nest Wifi router is the fastest with the most coverage, while the Nest Wifi point and Google Wifi routers are slower with less coverage. Even so, the lower cost on these other devices makes them a great option for mesh expansion.
If you use Google products, you'll probably love Nest Wifi. Everything about the product will be familiar, from the way it looks to the way the app works.
Setup is simple. Power up one of the units and connect it to your modem, then download the app. You'll get a notification that starts the process with a single tap, then walks you through setting up the other two and gives performance tips.
Each Nest Wifi router covers about 2,200 square feet with a strong signal and moving through your house switches you from one to the next seamlessly. The Nest Wifi points add 1,600 square feet while Google Wifi routers add 1,500 square feet. The app has some extra features like being able to prioritize one device over the others for a set amount of time (perfect for streaming HD video) or parental controls, It, however, lacks advanced networking features like dedicated port forwarding. The biggest drawback is what happens if you lose your internet connection — you have limited access to the settings as they are hosted on your online Google account.
Perhaps the biggest draw of Nest Wifi is the prompt updates. They're seamless and a proper update schedule means your network is more secure even if they aren't always filled with new features.
Our pick
Nest Wifi router and point
The Nest Wifi router is the newest addition to the Google Wifi family with faster speeds and greater coverage. It's also compatible with Nest Wifi points as well as Google Wifi for easy and cheap expansion.
Nest Wifi vs. Orbi vs. Eero vs. AmpliFi Netgear Orbi
The Wi-Fi 5 option Orbi RBK50
Netgear's Orbi isn't a mesh wireless system, but it acts the same way and extends your network by using satellite units. Those satellites just aren't connected to each other, only the base. It's still a tri-band system that will give you fast network speeds everywhere in your house, which is what really matters.
Pros
- No account required
- No speed loss from mesh forwarding
- The base and satellite are pre-programmed to work together
Cons
- It's big
- It's expensive if you need a second satellite
- Setup can be confusing because there are so many options
First thing's first — if you need advanced settings on your Wi-Fi network and want a mesh(-like) system, Orbi is the one you want to buy, no questions asked. Using your web browser to log into the router brings you to the familiar Netgear setup and admin page that you're probably already familiar with, including options that no other consumer mesh product offers like advanced QoS and forwarding.
With that out of the way, the Orbi system has one other thing going for it that might make a difference — no speed loss because of bi-directional communication. Orbi uses a dedicated band for communication between the units, while some other consumer mesh products use the same band your network data does, which causes a 50% loss in throughput for each "hop." This isn't noticeable for most of us as it's still faster than data can be processed after the loss, but it could make a difference when transferring large files or streaming data inside your network.
Two things aren't great — the sheer size of each unit (easily three times bigger than the others on this list) and the price. It can be more difficult to hide an Orbi satellite and adding more can be more expensive than its competition. Still, the Orbi line has a lot of options, so a cheaper and slower unit can be added to parts of the home where speed isn't a big deal.
Prosumer Choice
Netgear Orbi RBK50
Netgear's Orbi system isn't the smallest or most elegant solution when it comes to mesh Wi-Fi, but it does offer more advanced controls and a long-range. It's the best choice for prosumers and enthusiasts.
The Wi-Fi 6 option Orbi RBK752
The Orbi RBK752 brings Wi-Fi 6 speeds to an Orbi mesh. With AX4200 speeds, this router has a 2.4GHz and 5Ghz band dedicated to devices capable of 600Mbps and 1200Mbps, respectively. A third 5GHz band is dedicated to connecting the Orbi satellite to the base router. This Orbi really isn't designed to be a standalone unit.
Around the back of the main router, there are three vacant Ethernet ports with an additional WAN port to connect to the modem. The satellites have two vacant Ethernet ports as well. If you have a home with poor wireless signal, you can run an Ethernet cable from the main router to the satellite and it will be automatically utilized for a more consistent backhaul.
This system is still overkill for most people, but if you want to have fast Wi-Fi 6 connectivity all over your home, there aren't many other routers that can do better.
Next-gen Orbi
Orbi RBK752
A fast Orbi with support for the newest devices
The Orbi RBK752 brings the newest Wi-Fi tech to the Orbi line with consistent speeds up to 1.2Gbps thanks to a tri-band design.
Let's face it, as cool as gigabit connections are, some people are going ever faster. The Orbi RBK852 system is even faster. 2.4GHz speeds are upgraded to 1200Mbps and the 5GHz band for devices gets an upgrade to 2400Mbps. This AX6000 mesh is one of the fastest I've ever tested and with a 2.5G WAN port on the back, it's ready for the next generation of fiber connections.
Mesh Wi-Fi Router Face-off Eero
The Wi-Fi 5 option Eero
The third-generation Eero is the complete package. It comes equipped with a dual-band AC1300 connection and can cover up to 1,500 sq ft with a single router. A mesh made up of this base Wi-Fi 5 Eero is only recommended for internet connections up to 350Mbps, though our testing showed speed closer to 400Mbps. This speed is a result of splitting the 866.6Mbps 5GHz band between the mesh connection and connected device. Still, this is fast enough for most of what people do on their internet connections.
Pros
- Each beacon looks great
- Easy and secure setup
- Expands with any Eero
Cons
- Requires a smartphone to set up
- Limited settings
This Eero can also be added to an existing Eero mesh made up of any previous Eero or even the newer Eero 6 variants. Eero's intergenerational compatibility is thanks to a great software experience that keeps all Eeros up to data automatically.
The software experience keeps it up during setup and management which is simple and robust with the Eero app. You can change the setting most people care about such as security type and even some port forwarding. Beyond that, Eero is a bit more limited aiming for consistency over flexibility. Still, for the majority of people, this is preferable.
Entry-level mesh
Eero
Enough speed for most
For internet connection up to 350Mbps, Eero is a great choice thanks to its AC1300 Wi-Fi that keeps the mesh coverage strong.
The Wi-Fi 6 option Eero 6
Eero has continued to update its mesh solutions consistently without dropping compatibility in the Eero line. With Wi-Fi 6 onboard, this is one of the cheapest mesh systems you can get that can confidently deliver 500Mbps or more. While it's dual-band, its AX1800 speed should be able to keep up with even heavy usage. Even if you don't have Wi-Fi 6 devices yet, you'll get some advantage thanks to a Wi-Fi 6 backhaul connecting the mesh points.
Pros
- Wi-Fi 6 support improves speed and coverage
- Can use an unlimited amount of extenders
- Easy and secure setup
- Expands with any eero
Cons
- Extenders have no Ethernet ports
Eero 6 comes with a respectable speed upgrade over the base Eero jumping up from AC1300 to AX1800. What that means is up to 1200Mbps on the 5GHz bands and a solid 400Mbps at 2.4GHz. While the Eero 6 will need to share that 5GHz connection between devices, 500Mbps should be consistently possible even for older Wi-Fi 5 devices. If you've got a gigabit connection and want to get those speeds all over your home, you'll need to step up to the tri-band Eero Pro 6.
Unlike previous Eeros, the Eero 6 comes packed with Eero 6 extenders rather than identical routers. This brings the package cost down but does mean giving up an Ethernet connection on the extenders. This rules out a wired backhaul for the extenders. Like the older Eero Beacons, these simply extend the mesh; however, they take up way more room. You can build a system out of individual Eero 6 routers if you really need wired features, though.
Despite its shortfalls, Eero manages to deliver a great networking experience, and it largely comes down to its app. The Eero app works consistently and smoothly, whether you're adding new Eeros to your mesh or monitoring your usage. If you want it, there's a subscription service that brings along antivirus software and more advanced parental controls.
Looking good
Eero 6 with two extenders
Eero brings the cleanest look of any mesh router available with small satellites that don't look too out of place once plugged in. You'll need to spend more if you want LAN ports, though.
If you want to stick with an Eero mesh but need a little more speed, you can upgrade to the Eero Pro 6. This router adds an additional 5GHz band with a bandwidth of 2400Mbps. Since mesh systems need to share their communication resources with devices and communication with the other nodes in the mesh, a dual-band router like Eero or Eero 6 will need to share its speed between the mesh and wireless devices.
If you need to access your gigabit connection all over your home and a wired connection isn't possible, Eero Pro 6 can deliver. Keep in mind that you'll need a Wi-Fi 6 capable device to access this router full speed.
Mesh Wi-Fi Router Face-off AmpliFi
The Wi-Fi 5 option AmpliFi HD
The AmpliFi HD, from Wi-Fi legends Ubiquiti, looks different from the other products on this list. Each satellite plugs directly into a wall outlet but each AmpliFi satellite has a large antenna. This makes it easier to find a place for them or harder, depending on where you need them. It delivers good, strong whole-house Wi-Fi like the other products on this list.
Pros
- Five Gigabit Ethernet ports on the base like a traditional router
- Smartphone app or account not required
- More advanced settings than Eero or Google Wifi
- Connection information displayed on the router
Cons
- Satellites are large and require mounting on a wall outlet
- Satellites have no Ethernet ports
- Satellites aren't as attractive as the competition (but are interesting to some)
The AmpliFi HD boasts a 20,000-square-foot coverage area from a single base and two satellites. Our testing leads us to believe it, as a usable signal extended further down the street than we thought possible. That's enough reason for some of us to buy it — you might also be able to have great Wi-Fi in your workshop or any outbuilding (or share Wi-Fi with your neighbor). Part of this is because of the unique satellite configuration. Rather than a smallish puck designed to sit on a table somewhere, each is a tall, two-piece wand that needs to be plugged directly into an outlet.
There's also a coolness factor missing from the others on our list with AmpliFi's touchscreen display on the base that can monitor network speeds or show the time (it can also be shut off). This can be quite handy if the base is set somewhere like a desk in a home office and can double as a clock, besides having access to some user settings. Speaking of settings, you'll find more advanced ones on the AmpliFi HD than you will on Google Wifi or Eero, but not as many as the Orbi. It's a good balance for the average home user with something like a dedicated media server.
If you're looking for more speed, AmpliFi also makes the Alien, which features Wi-Fi 6 and one of the fastest and most capable Wi-Fi 6 mesh setups. It's quite a bit more expensive, however, and overkill for most people.
One thing to consider here is that the AmpliFi HD isn't exactly childproof. The satellites will be plugged in where a curious little one can reach them and look interesting enough to make sure they notice them. The newest version of the AmpliFi HD ditches the original beacons' swiveling antenna, making them a bit less flexible but more robust.
Long range king
AmpliFi HD WiFi System
Ubiquiti's Amplifi HD system delivers the most coverage of the mesh routers we've tested and delivered a fast and dependable Wi-Fi network without any fuss or a tedious setup. It does have some big satellites, though, so know that before you buy.
AmpliFi also has a slower but much more compact option. AmpliFi Instant comes in a relatively compact puck shape measuring just under four inches wide and 1.3 inches tall. Still, it manages to pack in an Ethernet port on every node and covers up to 2,000 sq ft with each one.
The Wi-Fi 6 option AmpliFi Alien
AmpliFi Alien is Ubiquiti's newest edition to the AmpliFi lineup, and it aims to regain its mesh coverage and speed dominance. With a total wireless capacity of 7685Mbps, this is one of the fastest Wi-Fi 6 routers in a mesh system. This speed is possible thanks to the 16 spatial streams divided into a 2.4GHz and 5GHz set of Wi-Fi 6 bands and another Wi-Fi 5 band at 5GHz.
If you like keeping up to date on the status of your Wi-Fi without opening an app, you'll love the Alien's large color touch screen. Four Ethernet ports on the back of the router allow you to connect your wired devices but all of the ports, including the WAN port, max out at 1Gbps, making that the maximum internet speed you'll ever see.
The Alien does come in at a fairly massive 9.84 inches tall and 2.65 pounds, which isn't that much more than comparable fast routers from other companies, is still considerable. For all that size, you get great coverage. A single Alien router covers up to 3,000 sq ft and adding in a MeshPoint takes that up to 6,000 sq ft.
Out of this world
AmpliFi Alien
Tons of speed in a sleek package
AmpliFi Alien is fast even compared to other Wi-Fi 6 routers thanks to16 spatial streams. It can keep up with any home network.
Nest Wifi vs. Orbi vs. Eero vs. AmpliFi Which should you buy
Which is best depends a lot on what you're looking for. If you want the most plug-and-play model, Nest Wifi is one of those gems that anyone can install. Nest Wifi does require a Google account, and internet access is almost a must (and absolutely required for setup).
Eero 6 has managed a significant speed upgrade over the standard Eero bringing your mesh link speed much closer to your gigabit connection and confidently handling 500Mbps. Eero is also compatible with the older Eero routers and Beacons for plenty of expansion options. You can also confidently upgrade since your older Eeros can expand the mesh further. Orbi is great for someone running a server or has other needs for advanced QoS and forwarding options, but is big, bulky, and expensive. Finally, AmpliFi covers your house, yard, and maybe even your neighbor but isn't perfect for homes with small children.
In the end, I choose Nest Wifi even though the requirement of having a Google account and losing features if you aren't connected to the internet are things I don't care for. I'm OK with the information Google collects and the methods they use to do it (you can read that right here), but I disagree with it in principle. The "good" outweighs the "bad" or me, though.
- Nest Wifi is cheap, and expansion is easy. And also cheap.
- Nest Wifi routers have a network port for a Cat 5/Cat 6 cable.
I was able to extend my network out to an outbuilding area by running a cable underground in some conduit and plugging each end into a Nest Wifi or Google Wifi unit. The two "meshes" work this way seamlessly, and I saved a good bit of money. Most people won't need anything like this, but the same idea applies if you want a wired connection to something like an Xbox or television and still extend the mesh network in the room it's in.
But really, you can't go wrong with any of these choices. Each has one or two drawbacks as well as a few strong points, but they all deliver where it counts: providing a strong, fast network connection.

Staff Pick: Blink Camera Battery Expansion Pack
The new Blink Indoor and Blink Outdoor have a 2-year battery life on two AA batteries, an impressive period. But if you want to double that duration, the Battery Expansion Pack attaches easily to the back of either cam and adds another two battery slots. Once the Expansion Pack goes on sale, you'll hopefully wait four years before having to unmount the cam and add new batteries.
Local video storage: Blink Add-On Sync Module 2
Compatible with the Indoor, Outdoor, and Mini cameras, but only included with the Indoor cam, the new Sync Module 2 syncs up to ten new Blink cameras at once, so you can monitor them all in the Blink app. More importantly, you can attach a 64GB flash drive to the Module, so you can store video clips locally and download them to your computer.
Video storage and transfer: SanDisk 64GB Ultra USB 3.0 Flash Drive
To go with your Sync Module 2, you'll need a fast USB flash drive to store your video footage and transfer them over to your PC. This USB 3.0 flash drive comes with encryption and 130 MB/s transfer speeds, so you'll protect your private footage and access it as quickly as possible, for a reasonable price.
Easy cable management: Corner Camera Shelf Security Wall Mount Holder
Screwing your Blink Mini into the wall can be a challenge. This shelf has a magnetic center that keeps the Mini steady, holes to allow the USB power cord through, and hinges on the bottom to wrap the cord around to hide any excess length. You can easily attach the shelf to the wall with screws, or even pushpins or tapes, giving the cam a sturdy surface for filming.
Immediate Mini installation: Blink Mini Outlet Wall Mount (2-pack)
Rather than worry about long, trippable USB cables and fixing the Blink Mini stand to a convenient surface, this nifty tool lets the Mini sit just above your outlet, using the provided (short) USB cord and not requiring and screwing or drilling. The magnetic mount swivels so you can get the right angle, assuming your plugs are in the right spot for surveillance.
Control older Blink cams: Blink Classic Sync Module
Blink's Classic Sync Module lets you connect up to 10 XT1 and XT2 cameras and create zones among them for schedules and more granular control. This enables you to schedule indoor cameras for when you're at work and outdoor cameras for nightfall or whatever suits your lifestyle and needs.
A firm grip: Sully Hard Case Mount for Blink Cameras (Set of 3)
This indoor/outdoor mount lets you swivel your Blink XT or XT2 cameras around while protecting them from the elements and reducing glare. You have a much wider field of view than if you were to mount your cams, and your XTs or XT2s should last a lot longer sheltered from the weather. This mount also comes in white.
Tell the world!: Blink Security Stickers
Place these stickers in your windows or anywhere on your ground floor that makes sense as a theft deterrent and to let passersby know that you have security cameras.
Never change batteries again: BBTO Power Adapter Weatherproof Cable
This weather-resistant adapter, with a 20-foot cable, keeps your Blink XT or XT2 plugged in and charged 24/7. It has a good quality fire shell to prevent short-circuiting, and it's thin enough (3.5mm) to run out windows or doors while still allowing them to close fairly well.
Value pack: Aotnex wall mount bracket and sync module outlet
This pack comes with three weather-resistant mounts for your XT and XT2 cameras and a power adapter outlet for the Classic Sync Module. These mounts will keep your cameras up and out of danger while increasing your field of view options. The wall outlet will keep the Classic Sync Module powered 24/7.
The best Blink security accessories
Blink home security cameras are excellent on their own, but to create a functioning Blink system of cameras, the Sync Module 2 is a vital purchase if you don't already own it. With it and a USB drive like the Sandisk 64GB USB 3.0, you can store motion-activated clips from up to ten cameras locally to your PC. If you don't pay for this upfront, you'll have to pay a monthly fee for a cloud subscription plan starting in 2021, which will cost you much more than the hardware in the long run.
We also highly recommend you invest in an official Blink Battery Extender for any Blink Indoor or Blink Outdoor you purchase. In theory, the built-in 2-year battery life for these cams works great on its own. Still, most cameras don't live up to the company's lofty promises — especially outdoor cams mounted to observe high-movement areas where they'll detect motion frequently. Double the actual capacity of your cams, and you won't be disappointed.
Any other Blink security accessories you buy will depend on which cams you own and where you need to place them for the best security angle. Out of all the perfectly functional accessories we found, we'd recommend the Hidden Mount Case / Pencil Holder because it makes installing your Mini simple and makes you feel a bit like a spy.

Nest Learning 3rd Generation
Budget buy
Nest E
Nest makes easy-to-install and easy-to-use smart thermostats, and both the 3rd-generation model and the Nest E are current products that work great. They both work for almost every type of HVAC system and can even control a water boiler for steam heat or hot water. The differences are more than just cosmetic, though.
Nest 3rd Generation vs. Nest E Price and availability
The Nest Learning 3rd Generation is the most capable smart thermostat under the Google Nest brand, and as such, it comes with the highest price. You'll spend at least $249 for the Nest Learning (3rd Gen), though given its age, it isn't uncommon to find it on sale for less.
As for the Nest E, it has a substantially lower retail price of $169. It's also been known to get its fair share of sales and discounts, meaning you could scoop it up for an even lower cost.
Both thermostats are readily available at major retailers across the U.S., so finding one to buy shouldn't be difficult at all.
Nest 3rd Generation vs. Nest E Get smart and save money
The major difference you need to know is that the Nest E doesn't support Nest's Farsight tech. It's has a feature that can sense when you walk in the door, will wake up the thermostat, and can override any energy-saving settings you might have programmed for the times you're not home. That way, the thermostat can change the temperature of your home to your preferred settings even if it didn't expect you to be home. The Nest E does have a proximity and occupancy sensor, but it's not quite the same and doesn't work nearly as well.

If you want a simple-to-install and use a smart thermostat that will save you money on your heating and cooling bills, Nest has you covered. Both models are compatible with most HVAC systems, and a combination of the Nest App and your favorite Smart Home Assistant will keep you comfortable while saving potentially hundreds every year.
Three main differences matter between the Nest Learning (3rd Gen) and the Nest E: the look of the unit itself, the number of HVAC systems they are compatible with, and support for Nest's Farsight tech. The first is readily apparent; the Nest E comes in a white polycarbonate shell. It doesn't have any other color options. If you're really particular about your thermostat having a specific look, you might be happier with the Nest Learning (3rd Gen), which has seven color options.
The Nest E's display is also smaller and thus gives less information at a glance than the more expensive Nest Learning (3rd Gen). Though it's worth mentioning that a field-of-view effect makes the Nest E's display look like part of the unit and not a screen, which is a nice touch.
Nest Learning knows when you are home and adjusts the target temperature as needed.
Next, Farsight is a Nest feature that's designed to make text bigger so it's easier for you to read the thermostat from across the room. Most people love it for one reason — when they come home, they can see that the Nest knows they are home, has adjusted the target temperature (if needed), and has an indicator that says everything is working as expected. The Nest E lacks Farsight and doesn't have the sensor required to adjust the temperature like that.
This isn't a dealbreaker, though. The Nest E does have proximity and occupancy sensors that tell it someone is at home, so it too can make adjustments. The thing is, you just don't know it from across the room — you'll have to walk over and check or use the app on your phone.
Farsight is a nifty feature, but it isn't absolutely necessary. The Nest Learning's better display and a broader selection of colors might be, however. Your home is an investment and matching any decor is often worth some added costs.
Lastly, the Nest Learning Thermostat works with 95% of 24V heating and cooling systems, while the Nest E only works with 85% of systems. The compatibility level is high for both units. However, depending on what you have in your home, you might only be able to use the Nest Learning (3rd Gen).
Both units use Wi-Fi and can be controlled with an app. You can even set them up with Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to initiate voice controls. One final thing to know about both models is that they both lack support for Apple Homekit. If you're using Homekit as your smart home platform of choice, you'll need to go with an Ecobee, which is also an excellent choice.
Nest 3rd Generation vs. Nest E In the end
The Nest Learning (3rd Gen) offers more conveniences and works with a larger range of heating and cooling systems. It can sense that you're home from across the room and changes the temperatures to match your preferences. It even has seven different colors to choose from, so you can pick one that matches your home decor. Overall this is the best pick, especially for those that prefer all of the bells and whistles.

Billed up front at $39, the annual plan savings mean you can try out one of the best VPN services for yourself without breaking the bank. On top of the VPN discount, you also get 250GB of cloud storage with SugarSync at no extra cost which is definitely nice to have.

You've probably heard and read a lot about VPNs by now as they are super useful tools for our increasingly internet-connected lives. You no doubt use your tech for all sorts of personal and private tasks like banking, shopping, and browsing, so a VPN will come in handy to help protect your sensitive data. If you ever connect to public Wi-Fi networks, say at the coffee shop or while waiting for a flight, a VPN is for you too. Using one helps to anonymize and protect your online activity, stop ad tracking, and protects you from having your data intercepted.
VPNs are also incredibly useful for accessing content that would otherwise be blocked in your region. If you're on vacation, or more likely stuck at home, you can use IPVanish to bypass geographical restrictions on content so you can easily stream NFL games or watch Studio Ghibli on Netflix from anywhere.
IPVanish's VPN service offers a network of over 1,300 servers in 75+ locations worldwide, unlimited P2P traffic, powerful apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and even Fire TV, as well as a speedy connection. Your subscription also allows for simultaneous use on up to 10 devices, which is more than many other providers. IPVanish uses 256-bit AES encryption and doesn't keep any traffic logs, either.
The added bonus of 250GB of SugarSync cloud storage could be a timely solution if you're now working from home as it provides an easy way to share files remotely with coworkers. Even if you're not getting work done from your home, it never hurts to have an extra backup for your important documents and photos.
It's well worth snagging a subscription at this discounted price while you can. There's a 30-day money-back guarantee if you change your mind, so you can try IPVanish out risk-free. If it's not for you, you can always check out our list of the best VPN deals for some alternative options.

- Oculus Support has been fixing quick to respond to support tickets regarding banned Facebook accounts.
- The Oculus Quest 2 cannot be used without a valid Facebook account, leaving banned users without access.
- Several users who have posted about broken Elite Straps have been contacted by Oculus Support and offered replacement straps.
While the Oculus Quest 2's launch seems to be going incredibly well for both developers and Facebook, alike, it hasn't been without some typical product launch issues. Right out of the gate, some users were getting their Facebook accounts banned, citing that they had violated Facebook's community standards. Many of these bans appear to have been falsely handed out as Facebook looks to quell fake accounts that are responsible for fake news and other social media problems.
Users on Reddit and other forums have been reporting a quick turnaround from Oculus Support, citing that they were able to regain access to their accounts within a matter of an hour or two from when they submitted their support ticket.

Similarly, users who have been posting about broken Elite Straps appear to be receiving messages from Oculus Support offering replacements. Proactive support like this is rather nice to see, especially when users might not be sure they've received a defective or otherwise problematic product. The broken strap problem, in particular, has been widespread enough to where Reddit has created a flair label for posts complaining about the problem.
There's little that's more frustrating than losing access to your entire library of games, or having a brand new purchase break within hours or days of first using it. For the most part, it seems like the launch of the Oculus Quest 2 has been a positive move for much of the industry and is providing the opportunity for huge growth in the VR industry by offering a high-quality experience at a low price.

NordVPN has a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can try it out risk-free. If you don't want to commit to the two-year plan, there is a slight saving on the six-month plan, though you're not benefiting from the current special pricing by going for that option.

- Facebook is working on an improved experience that makes it easier to access games through Oculus Link.
Facebook is all in on Oculus Link. The feature that allows you to play PCVR games on Oculus Quest headsets exits beta in October of this year. In addition to coming out of beta, Oculus Link is getting several significant improvements in the future, including support for 90 FPS in the "near future." Facebook outlines the upcoming improvements to Oculus Link and shares several other major announcements in a blog post.
During the Facebook Connect stream, the company explained that in its view, the Oculus Quest 2 with Oculus Link delivers a better PCVR experience than the Oculus Rift or Oculus Rift S. Facebook will stop making Oculus Rift devices in 2021, effectively replacing the Rift line with the Oculus Quest 2 with Oculus Link.
In addition to improving framerate for Oculus Link in the future, Facebook is working streamlining how players access their library of PC games with Oculus Link. The company is working on a "unified system experience that will let Oculus Link users see all their Rift and Quest apps alongside each other—and access native Quest features like casting." The new experience should come out this year.

The top surface also has a built-in mouse pad for accurate tracking for your mouse.
Handy dandy: LapGear Cup Holder Lap Desk
One of the biggest questions associated with using a lap desk: Where do you put your drink? Well, LapGear has solved that by building a cup holder right into the top to keep your drink nearby safely.

A cushioned bottom aids in comfort and stability, and when it's time to go, Mind Reader included a handle.
Desk on the go: Tangkula Laptop Desk
If you want a stable workspace without having it sit on your lap, then the Tangkula Laptop Desk is going to be perfect for you. With a good set of locking casters, you'll be able to quickly move the adjustable height desk away when you need to. Not only does the height adjust, but the desktop angle is customizable too. You even get a small side table that can be used for a mouse or for holding your drink.

This lap desk from TaoTronics works as more than just a lap desk. With its folding and height adjustable leg, you can use it as a standing desk, too.

The solid legs will work great whether you want to place it on the bed while you work, or on a table to get a comfy angle to work from while standing.

If you've ever tried to use a laptop while sitting on a couch, bed, or chair, you know how uncomfortable it can be. In some cases, it is downright difficult.

Consumers have come to expect more luxurious materials like metal and glass which, despite being more fragile than plastic, typically have a more "premium" feel.
I'm definitely guilty of shying away from devices whose spec sheets feature the word polycarbonate. I was reluctant to try the Galaxy Note 20 for exactly that reason. But once my review unit came in, my concerns surrounding creakiness and a cheap in-hand feel disappeared. Build quality in general has, of course, massively improved since the days when plastic flagships were commonplace, and the Note 20 felt just as solid as any other phone I'd tested in recent memory.
The story is the same with the Galaxy S20 Fan Edition — better known as the S20 FE. This phone is the latest in Samsung's crusade to dominate every pricing tier with a well-rounded device that makes the appropriate sacrifices while maintaining the company's standards for quality and performance. In short, it's like any other phone in the S20 lineup, save for a plastic back and a flat display that bring it to a significantly lower price.
That means trouble for other affordable flagship manufacturers like Google and OnePlus, but for the rest of us, it's great news. The S20 FE isn't just a great phone, it's the best Android phone that we recommend to just about anyone, thanks to its unbeatable value.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE
Bottom line: The Galaxy S20 FE offers nearly everything you'd find on the more expensive S20 variants, with high-end specs and impressive cameras. The screen is totally flat, which means fewer accidental touches, and the back of the phone is made of a sturdy plastic.
The Good
- Flat 120Hz display is terrific
- All-day battery life
- Promised three years of software updates
- Impressive cameras with 3x optical zoom
- Sturdy design with fun color options
The Bad
- Not every color option is available everywhere
- Camera can be slow to load
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE Pricing & availability
The Galaxy S20 FE launched on October 2, with a single configuration in the U.S. offering 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM for $699.99. It's already been discounted by a hundred dollars through most major retailers, however, and while Samsung still sells the S20 FE at full price on its site, the company is offering high trade-in values that can bring the price down to as low as $249.99.
There are six color options available, including Cloud Navy, Cloud Lavender, Cloud Mint, Cloud Orange, Cloud Red, and Cloud White. At the moment, Cloud Orange is being offered as an online exclusive through Samsung.com, while Cloud Red is reserved for Verizon and U.S. Cellular customers. It appears that Cloud White isn't currently available to U.S. buyers.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE What I like
Anyone who's used an S20 series device before will feel right at home on the S20 FE. It's a bit larger than the baseline S20, but it's still a reasonable size with roughly the same footprint as the S20+, and a nearly identical design language. Of course, the main difference is the polycarbonate (read: plastic) backing, which features a matte texture and comes in a variety of vibrant, almost pastel colors.
This signals trouble for Google and OnePlus.
This isn't the same flimsy plastic we saw on the Galaxy S5 years back. The S20 FE doesn't creak or give under pressure; it feels just as solid as the rest of the S20 lineup, thanks in no small part to the aluminum frame, and likely won't crack if dropped. With how many matte devices Samsung has released as of late, it's also easy to forget that the S20 series was entirely glossy — this is a very welcome change.
I really love the color options on the S20 FE, too. In lieu of a physical briefing, Samsung sent over one of every color for photo purposes, which gave me a chance to really appreciate each shade without the guesswork of relying on heavily touched up photos. The Cloud Mint is by far my favorite — it matches my guitar! — but they're all gorgeous, muted colors that add a fun element to the phone.
Just like the on the Note 20, Samsung also ditched the curved glass on the front of the S20 FE, instead opting for a totally flat display that, while a bit less flashy, is a massive functional improvement if you ask me. This means slightly larger bezels around the perimeter of the screen, but in exchange, you'll experience zero accidental touches. Like the rest of the S20 series, the FE features a 120Hz refresh rate that makes every action on-screen feel buttery smooth.

There's only one specs configuration of the S20 FE, at least in the States, with 128GB of expandable storage and 6GB of RAM, though Verizon sells its own variant (with the totally consumer-friendly name of Galaxy S20 FE 5G UW) that's optimized for its Ultra Wideband network. I think 128GB is totally fine for most people, especially since you can expand it with microSD, though it's worth noting that the 6GB of RAM is a slight step down from the 8GB and up on the rest of the S20 series.
It's really quite remarkable how much Samsung was able to make the Fan Edition fit in with the rest of the S20 lineup, despite a starting price that's $300 below the retail value of its peers. You get the same Snapdragon 865 processor, the same Android 10 software with One UI 2.5 (though it's unclear whether the FE will be included in the initial S20 series Android 11 rollout), and the same gorgeous Super AMOLED display tech.
I've spent a lot of time with Samsung devices this year, and this one feels no different from the rest; performance is top-notch, and there are plenty of software perks like Edge Panels and even Wireless DeX — a relatively new feature that first debuted on the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra.
Battery life has been great on the S20 FE, as well. In the 10 days I've been testing the phone, the 4500mAh cell has been more than enough to last through each day without a problem, averaging around 5 to 7 hours of screen-on time. The S20 FE supports 25W Fast Charging, though Samsung only includes a 15W brick in the box.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE Cameras
The S20 FE features three rear cameras in the de facto standard grouping of wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses. The main sensor is the same one found on the standard S20: a 12MP ƒ/1.8 camera with all of the typical Samsung qualities you'd expect, both good and bad. Deeply saturated colors, a strong tendency to lift shadows, and a preference for warm tones.
Unsurprisingly, that means that it's great for the most part, and the vast majority of users will love the photos it takes. If you're a pickier photographer, you might take issue with the often very harsh haloing effect in bright outdoor lighting, or the strong HDR effect that overly flattens daytime shots, but of course, you can take a bit of control over these problems by switching over to a manual shooting mode if you prefer.
Samsung seems to have changed up its telephoto lens choice with every new release this year, and on the S20 FE, that means a true 3X sensor that can reach up to 30X through Space Zoom, Samsung's coined term for its combination of optical and digital zoom.
Of course, the telephoto sensor isn't quite as sharp as the main one, but I've still been very happy with it overall. It's great for snapping a closer shot without a second thought, and of course, digital zoom on the main sensor helps fill out the 2X gap between cameras.
The ultra-wide seems to be nearly identical in performance to that of nearly every other high-end phone Samsung has released this year — which isn't a bad thing by any stretch. The S20 FE does a great job at minimalizing barrel distortion, though haloing is even worse on the ultra-wide.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE What I don't like
It's impressive just how much the S20 FE feels like any other S20 model, but it isn't without its faults. The reduced 6GB of RAM is plenty for most tasks, but it can hang up at times when you're running multiple heavy apps in split-screen view. I've also found that the S20 FE is fairly slow to launch the camera, and always seems to lag a bit for the first second or two. That may not sound like much, but a second is all it takes sometimes to miss your shot.
It's a bit odd that the S20 FE only includes a 15W charger in the box, as well. Even the maximum supported 25W is a bit slim by today's standards (though it's in line with the rest of Samsung's selection), but I'm doubtful that there was truly a massive cost savings in reducing the in-box charging speeds.
Of course, if you're a fan of glass backs and curved screens, the S20 FE will feel like a downgrade in that regard from even the baseline S20. I think most people will be perfectly happy with the build quality of the S20 FE, though. Switching over from devices like the Galaxy Z Flip and Galaxy Z Fold 2, I never once found myself wishing the S20 FE had used different materials.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE The competition
The S20 FE's aggressive pricing puts it in direct competition with devices like the OnePlus 8 and the upcoming Pixel 5. Especially with its $100 discount through most retailers, the S20 FE has a distinct advantage over the OnePlus 8 with its overall better cameras and wider availability in the U.S., though the OnePlus 8 offers the option for a higher storage tier, along with the more widely accepted curved glass and metal design and OnePlus's popular OxygenOS software.
The situation is similar for the S20 FE against the Pixel 5, but it faces even stronger competition from the Pixel 4a, which comes in at half the retail price of the S20 FE and features the same incredible camera found on the Pixel 4. If imaging is your number one priority, the Pixel 4a is extremely tempting — especially since both phones are guaranteed to receive years of software updates.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE Should you buy it?
You should buy this if ...
You don't need fancy build materials
The Galaxy S20 FE is a fantastic phone at a great price, but if you're after a curved glass design like Samsung's higher-end models, you won't find it here. The S20 FE instead uses polycarbonate for its back panel, though it still relies on an aluminum frame for durability.
You want the S20 experience without spending four figures
Samsung designed the S20 FE as a flagship-tier device for a slightly tighter budget. You'll still get all of the same great features you'd expect on an S20, including great cameras, 5G support, and a gorgeous 120Hz display, without having to spend an arm and a leg to get there.
You want all-day battery life
The S20 FE comes equipped with a 4500mAh battery, which is more than enough to provide all-day longevity, even with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. You'll need to provide your own charger to reach the full 25W charging speeds, but the 15W brick included in the box will keep you topped up without a problem.
You should not buy this if ...
You want the best of the best
There are few compromises with the S20 FE, but at nearly half the price of the Note 20 Ultra and S20 Ultra, it's still missing some premium features like S Pen support, Samsung's massive new cameras, and even foldable display tech.
All in all, the Galaxy S20 FE makes few concessions to reach its lower price point, offering the same level of quality and performance you'd expect from a modern Samsung device. It's a fantastic value priced hundreds below Samsung's other flagship devices, and if you have a fairly recent device already, you can get it for pennies to the dollar through Samsung's trade-in programs.
I think people who want a simple phone that takes great photos and lasts all day can still save money by opting for the Pixel 4a instead, but consumers that want the extra power and display prowess of a flagship have a great new option to consider.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE
Bottom line: The Galaxy S20 FE offers nearly everything you'd find on the more expensive S20 variants, with a more affordable plastic design. It features three great cameras, excellent battery life, and years of guaranteed software updates.

We have 5G-ready phones like the Galaxy S20, and we already can see the results of testing using phones and broadband routers and wireless hotspots. 5G is here, and it's not going to be the typical slow rollout we've seen with 3G and 4G LTE.
There is one way that the 5G networks in the U.S. will resemble its 3G and 4G counterparts, though: each carrier is doing things differently and it's very unlikely that you'll be able to buy a single device that works with everything. This will probably change as the tech inside the devices and the tech that powers the networks mature, but any goals of buying an unlocked 5G-ready device today and using it across multiple carriers will need to be tempered.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Here's what we know so far about how each carrier is building a 5G network.
Note: This article was updated in March 2020 with all of the latest information about 5G network deployments in the U.S.
AT&T
AT&T expects to offer nationwide 5G service by the end of 2020 and has begun offering mobile 5G service in over 65 cities. AT&T actually has two 5G networks, and each uses a different technology that isn't compatible with each other.
The larger rollout uses AT&T's 850MHz low-band 5G and is what consumers will be able to use throughout 2020. But AT&T is also rolling out millimeter-wave coverage for business users, with plans to convert consumers over to the faster network once it's fully deployed.
AT&T already has its 5G Fiber backbone in place across the country and is rapidly expanding it.
AT&T also offers what it calls "5G Evolution" service, which isn't 5G at all. The company expanded and enhanced its 4G LTE service and has offered it in 400 markets. Don't be confused if you suddenly see a "5Ge" icon on your phone; it's just proper carrier aggregation of the company's 4G LTE service.
More: AT&T's '5G Evolution' network isn't a brand (new) problem
AT&T's 5G service will rely on the company's fiber network as a backbone, which is expected to cover 14 million people by mid-2019. The network will use what's known as "millimeter-wave" which uses high-frequency spectrum to broadcast signals across relatively short distances. With 39GHz holdings that cover more than 30% of subscribers in the top 50 markets, the company has a solid base to build on, and AT&T also plans to use "additional spectrum bands" in the future to bolster its 39GHz spectrum.
In the end, expect a mixed high and low spectrum 5G network from AT&T that uses Fiber as a backbone with many small-cell sites to allow wireless access to the service once the network is fully deployed.
Verizon
Verizon, Qualcomm, Motorola, and Samsung demonstrated the first mobile 5G radio test in late 2018 and released its first mobile 5G device — the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G — in 2019.
More: Verizon 5G Home is 5G home internet that costs $50/month
Verizon has also enrolled 5G to power its "5G Home" broadband service starting in September 2018. The service has no data cap and offers speeds ranging from 300Mbps to 1Gbps depending on location.
As we saw with LTE, Verizon is sitting on plenty of the right spectrum for its 5G network plans.
Verizon's 5G service will run on the company's millimeter-wave 28Ghz and 39Ghz bands. Verizon holds the largest amount of millimeter-wave licenses among the Big Four (and possibly of any company worldwide) with 76% of the available 28Ghz spectrum in the top 50 markets and 46% of the available 39Ghz band.
Verizon is confident in its ability to deliver 5G service to fixed locations using specialized equipment. In early 2019, the company offered 5G Home service using off-the-shelf equipment and 5G mobile broadband. Using its millimeter-wave spectrum to build out a solid 5G network means Verizon will have to deploy a huge number of small cell sites across the country, but as we saw with 4G LTE service, expect Verizon to be both first and best while 5G is new.
In March 2019, Verizon unveiled its mobile 5G plans with the launch of the 5G Moto Mod for the Moto Z3. The network is now live in 31 markets and is impressively fast.
Sprint
Sprint and T-Mobile may be trying to merge, but even if that doesn't happen the company is in a strong position when it comes to delivering 5G service.
While AT&T and Verizon plan to use millimeter-wave spectrum to deliver 5G service, Sprint has another trick up its sleeve. Using excess 2.5Ghz spectrum, of which the company holds plenty, Sprint's 5G service will run on mid-band frequencies instead of the upper bands that constitute millimeter-wave. Because this mid-band spectrum is also used for the company's 4G LTE service, cell sites will need to have new equipment deployed to cover the 50/50 split.
Sprint has everything it needs to deploy its 5G network except for the most important part: money.
While using its existing sites to deploy 5G means Sprint will be quick to roll out 5G service, it also means that Sprint's 5G network won't have the low latency and high-bandwidth that millimeter-wave spectrum can deliver. Sprint plans to address this in the future by employing additional spectrum to bolster the 5G network. Right now, Sprint's 5G network is live in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Kansas City.
Sprint also plans to make its 5G service available to Google Fi users. Fi currently uses Sprint LTE along with T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular to deliver internet and phone service to its customers.

T-Mobile
Like Sprint, T-Mobile isn't depending on a merger to begin its 5G rollout. Starting its rollout of 5G in late 2019 according to CTO Neville Ray, T-Mobile now claims to provide coverage to over 60% of Americans.
This is because of how T-Mobile plans to deliver a 5G network using its 600MHz spectrum. It already holds this spectrum and was in the process of putting it to use when 5G standards were finalized. With workers and equipment at the ready, it was easy to get started.
T-Mobile will wait for phones that can use it before it rolls out a 5G network.
While AT&T and Verizon are using a high-band millimeter-wave spectrum for 5G and Sprint is using 2.5GHz mid-band, T-Mobile is using the 600MHz spectrum it already owns. There are some benefits here — the signal can travel long distances and through solid objects much better than higher bands can and that means fewer new towers are needed. There are also some serious drawbacks, namely, the network will have higher latency and lower throughput speeds than both millimeter-wave networks and a mid-band network.
To offset this, the company is also building on 28Ghz millimeter wave spectrum and an existing mid-band 2.1GHz spectrum. A network of this type will prove to be challenging for device manufacturers who will need to balance the power requirements all these radios will have or find betters ways to switch radios lest devices only work in limited areas.
On paper, 5G in the U.S. can look confusing. Unless you frequently hop between carriers though, the confusion will fall on the shoulders of the companies making phones. Just like the current situation with 4G LTE, don't expect every device to work on every network. You will be able to find a 5G phone you love though, as phone makers will race to get compatible models out the door as the networks roll out.

They're very simple to use and allow for a lot of flexibility. Plus the right VPN won't keep traffic logs either, so even the VPN itself isn't tracking you. Private Internet Access is that sort of VPN, and right now you can make the most of a limited-time promotion offering 77% off the service.
That means you can get two years of the service for just $69.95 with two additional months thrown in for free. All told, you'll be paying just $2.69 per month compared to its regular monthly price of $11.95 putting it in cheap VPN territory.

Private Internet Access VPN
Browse anonymously, securely, and with no geographic barriers. PIA works great on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows, and you can use it on 10 devices at once. Paying just $70 upfront means your monthly-equivalent cost is just $2.69.
$69.95
$310.70 $241 off
Private Internet Access has more than 3,300 servers available in 48 countries. That means you're covered no matter where you want to travel. In addition to the features mentioned above, like encrypted Wi-Fi and ad blocking, PIA offers a ton of other features, too. You'll be able to use PIA with up to 10 devices at the same time with unlimited bandwidth, and you can protect all your devices from malware and other malicious software.
There are many reasons to run a VPN. You'll be able to protect your identity thanks to an anonymous VPN IP and prevent people from eavesdropping on you even when you're out using public Wi-Fi. You can also use PIA to overcome geographic barriers, giving you complete access to the internet even when those websites would normally be blocked in your country (like Netflix).
This is a limited-time offer, so you really ought to sign up as soon as possible at the lower rate. The best part is that if you sign up at the reduced price, you'll continue to pay at that rate as long as your subscription is active (though the two free extra months is a one-time deal). If PIA is not the provider for you, be sure to take a look at the many other great VPN deals available right now.
We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:
1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).
2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad.
We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services. Consuming pirated content that is paid-for is neither endorsed nor approved by Future Publishing.

Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra vs. Note 20 Major similarities and differences
At their core, the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra offer the same experience. At a glance, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. However, there are a handful of details that differentiate them, and lead to that multi-hundred dollar price difference.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra vs. Note 20 Size, display, and specs
The phones are nearly the same size, with just a couple millimeters here and there separating the two. Their screens are almost the same size, too, at 6.7 for the Note 20 and 6.9 inches for the Ultra. Batteries are correspondingly close, at 4,300 and 4,500mAh. They have the same Snapdragon 865+ chipset, 128GB base storage, and extra features like fast charging, wireless charging, stereo speakers, an in-screen fingerprint sensor, IP68 water resistance, and of course the S Pen. They also run the exact same software, so as far as software features and the day-to-day experience go, things are identical.

Then, when you get into the details, things diverge a bit. The Note 20 oddly comes up short in RAM, with just 8GB to the Note 20 Ultra's 12GB, and if you want more storage you're out of luck as only the Ultra offers an optional 512GB option and an SD card slot. The Note 20 Ultra also has a 120Hz refresh rate, which dramatically smooths out all motion compared to the Note 20's 60Hz, though the latter model's flat panel is a boon for anyone who's run into accidental touch input with curved displays in the past.
There's just an overall cost-cutting theme to the standard Note 20.
Building on the cost-cutting theme, it's also a bit off-putting that the back of the Note 20 is a coated plastic rather than glass. Sure, we see lots of plastic phones out there, but not ones that cost $1,000. The Note 20 Ultra has the classic high-quality Samsung design and materials you expect, and you'll definitely notice the different material on the standard Note 20.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra vs. Note 20 Cameras
The Note 20 Ultra also technically has a more capable camera system. The 108MP camera is shared with the S20 Ultra, but enhanced with the addition of a laser auto focus system, and the zoom camera has a true 5X telephoto lens while the Note 20's "telephoto" is just digitally zooming. The front-facing and ultra-wide rear cameras are shared between the two, and the Note 20's cameras are still capable, but you'll want the Note 20 Ultra if you strive for the best of the best.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra vs. Note 20 Which should you buy?
As always, comparisons like this need to start with a discussion of money. The Note 20 Ultra retails for $1,300, a full $300 more than the standard Note 20. Either you're alright with paying that price, or you're not. If you are, then you can easily justify getting the Note 20 Ultra — it has a nicer design, a much better display, improved camera, and higher-end specs. It's a proper Note.
The Note 20 Ultra is the one to get, if you can afford the high price.
If you really need to have an S Pen, but your budget isn't up to the level of the Note 20 Ultra, I'd encourage you to look at buying the Note 10+ instead. Now that the Note 20 series is on sale, the Note 10+ is bound to drop in price. If it goes on sale down into the $800 range, there's a great argument that it's a better buy than the Note 20, particularly if you don't need 5G support.
However, if your goal is to get an S Pen in a new phone, in order to get the longest runway for software updates and newer (improved) cameras, the Note 20 is a decent buy. It gives you the core Samsung experience, with a huge display and the S Pen with the latest software right out of the box. You'll save money, but you'll also be reminded that you were just a few hundred dollars away from getting the real top-end Note.
The one to get
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
It's more expensive, but you won't regret it
The Note 20 Ultra is the proper Note this year, with all of the latest specs and features you expect. It's also arguably a better buy than the Galaxy S20 Ultra.
S Pen on a budget
Samsung Galaxy Note 20
A new Note at a lower price, with compromises to match
Samsung cut corners on the Note 20 to hit a more enticing price point, but it arguably cut too much. Shortcomings in the specs and display tarnish the Note experience.

- Brand new iRobot Home app update includes automated recommendations and a friendlier interface for all Wi-Fi-enabled iRobot robots.
- Roomba i7/i7+, Roomba s9/s9+, and Braava jet m6 robots get additional smart features thanks to iRobot Genius machine learning.
- This update rollout begins on August 25 through the iRobot Home app on Android and iOS.
Roomba and Braava owners, get ready for a huge update that's about to make your cleaning robot a lot more helpful in the future. The iRobot Home app on your Android or iOS device is getting a massive overhaul, with a friendlier interface, brand new automations, and even more precise cleaning abilities. This new app update works for all Wi-Fi-enabled iRobot robots, including many of the best cheap robot vacuums we love from iRobot. The new iRobot Home app will recommend the best times for cleaning your home, including pre-set schedules like weekday mornings. It'll even recommend extra cleanings during allergy season to help make your home a more pleasant environment.
The new iRobot Home app can even tap into your smart home and clean when events are triggered, such as locking the best smart locks like the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock, or with any other product through IFTTT Connect. Newer iRobot robots, like the Roomba i7/i7+, Roomba s9/s9+, and Braava jet m6, all pack more powerful processors inside and are now able to utilize iRobot Genius AI, which relies on machines learning to better clean your home.
While all robots can take advantage of the new Favorites feature to create custom cleaning times, these newer robots can also utilize Favorites to create custom cleaning spaces. The new Clean Zones feature lets you denote specific spots in your house that might need regular spot cleanings, like under the dining room table or under the kitchen counters. Users can select these zones on their Smart Maps within the iRobot Home app and can include them in regular cleanings and routines. You can even utilize the names of these zones when asking your favorite virtual assistant to vacuum, so now you can ask Google to clean under the dining room table and it'll understand.
On top of extra customization, the Roomba i7/i7+, Roomba s9/s9+, and Braava jet m6 will recommend times and places to clean around your home, based on what they've learned while cleaning. These robots can also recommend new Keep Out Zones based on trouble spots in the home, so if your vacuum regularly gets stuck on the edge of an area rug or under the furniture, it'll automatically recommend a Keep Out Zone on your Smart Map to prevent this from happening in the future. The new iRobot Home app goes live today, August 25, with the feature rolling out to all Wi-Fi-enabled robots at the same time.
Clean your home more intelligently

Let the robot do it for you!
Sick of vacuuming? The iRobot Roomba i7 will do that for you so you can keep up with your favorite things in life instead of your chores.

Verizon's Ultra Wideband network isn't winning any awards for coverage but if you're covered, you can get fantastic speeds and plenty of capacity for nearly any task. While many people are content to use their phone as a hotspot, the simplicity of a standalone hotspot plus the great battery life can make it an easy choice if you need to get a lot of work done away from home. The 5G MiFi M1000 from Inseego can make the most of Verizon's fast Ultra Wideband network with robust LTE support when you move out of coverage.
Best Overall: Inseego 5G MiFi M1000
Inseego brings a compact hotspot to Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network with the 5G MiFi M1000. Verizon's 5G network still has quite a few dead zones but with a strong LTE network backing it up, this hotspot should still provide solid speeds. Dual-band Wi-Fi 5 support should keep up with the network and provide all the speed you need in a laptop or tablet. You also have the option of getting connected with USB-C tethering or Ethernet.
The 4,400mAh battery keeps this device running throughout your workday and comes with up to 24 hours of usage times. If you forget to charge it, you can top up in a hurry thanks to Quick Charge support. If you are covered by Verizon's 5G network, this hotspot should be able to provide great speeds to your Wi-Fi devices.
Pros:
- Long battery life
- Fast 5G and LTE
- Compact
Cons:
- Small display
- No Wi-Fi 6
Best Overall
Inseego 5G MiFi M1000
Fast and compact 5G hotspot.
The Inseego 5G MiFi M1000 supports Verizon's fast 5G network but is small enough to easily fit into a bag or pocket. It also supports fast LTE for extra flexibility.
Bottom line
T-Mobile's network has been growing and changing a lot when it comes to 5G thanks to continued investment as well as the inclusion of 2.5GHz spectrum from Sprint. These changes could be one reason why Sprint's previous hotspot is no longer available. Still, if you need the speed of 5G on your Wi-Fi devices as soon as possible and Verizon isn't an option, you will be able to create a hotspot on a 5G enabled phone right away.
If you've got solid coverage on Verizon's Ultra Wideband 5G network, then you can get connected with a standalone hotspot with support for great speeds and great battery life. The Inseego 5G MiFi M1000 is a great option for anyone with strong Verizon coverage and a plan that supports 5G.
Netgear with AT&T
Currently, AT&T doesn't have any 5G hotspots for sale even though it had an mmWave hotspot from Netgear available last year. While Netgear has announced a follow-up, the Nighthawk M5, it's not available on any carrier yet. It's listed as having a Qualcomm X55, modem which should be more than capable of connecting to all of AT&T's network with the right hardware. It also lists support for sub-6 networks which would make it a great choice for travelers.
Should you buy a 5G hotspot in 2020?
5G is a new wireless technology and has all the drawbacks of any new tech. It's not certain that a hotspot bought today will work with all of the frequencies deployed in the next few years.
Unless you live in an area that can already take advantage of 5G coverage, there is little reason to buy a hotspot right now. Holding on to your older LTE only device should serve you just as well until the signal is available. However if your area will soon get 5G coverage, 5G hotspots can get the best of 4G while you wait for 5G to come online.

The Oculus Quest is an immersive VR device that users can get blissfully lost in due to its lack of wires or external sensors.
Because Oculus has been a leading contender in the VR space for many years, an impressive library of titles was available at the launch of the Oculus Quest. Both the makers of the Oculus Quest and the makers of its games and apps have clearly spent years crafting and refining this virtual reality experience. It's intuitive, easy to learn, and can take over a party in a way we haven't seen since the likes of Dance Dance Revolution and the Wii.

The Oculus Quest has two different variants, the only difference being storage size. The 64GB version costs $399, and the 128GB version costs $499. The 64GB version is ideal for the average user. Unless you're an extremely avid gamer who is going to have a massive library of games or a heavy media user who plans to store loads of large movie files on your Oculus Quest, you shouldn't need the 128GB version.
Whether you're a veteran of VR or a newcomer, the Oculus Quest provides something uniquely different to anything you've tried before.

Oculus Quest How it does VR right
The Oculus Quest features a refined design that builds on the already impressive Oculus Rift and Oculus Go. The details and design of the headset clearly illustrate that Facebook has learned from their experience in VR. From the overall design of the headset to the small details that enhance the fit and level of immersion, the hardware of the Oculus Quest is thoughtful and functional.
The body of the headset has a fabric exterior and a matte black plastic front. This front panel houses the four built-in cameras that are the core of the Oculus Quest's inside-out tracking system. They map out the room you're in and also keep track of a pair of Touch Controllers that you use to interact with games and apps. These cameras make it so you don't have to use any external sensors when using the Oculus Quest. You don't need to set up any towers or dedicate a specific room to VR. As a result, you can take the Quest with you to most rooms or to a party.
Despite not requiring any external hardware or sensors, the Oculus Quest can still track your movements with Six Degrees of Freedom. In essence, it can track you as you walk around a room, moving up, down, left, right, forward, and backward; it opens a whole new world when it comes to mobile virtual reality.
When you enter any environment and put on the Oculus Quest, it will have you draw a boundary for your VR area. This is part of the Guardian tracking system that sets up a virtual grid to make sure you don't bump into anything or punch a TV, both serious risks when dealing with VR. Drawing an area is simple, and the grid disappears if you aren't near a boundary and pops up if you are. If you stick your head outside of the drawn boundaries, the Quest's passthrough cameras will show you the real world without you having to remove the headset.
After you map a room, the Oculus Quest will remember that room in the future, though the Quest can only store a few rooms right now. I also noticed that my Oculus Quest only seems to save the mapping of a room if I walk in and face a certain way. I'd like to see the Oculus Quest improve how it stores and recognizes areas that you've previously mapped.
The Oculus Guardian system is an essential part of the Quest. The headset is so portable that you need to be able to draw boundaries quickly and reliably. SUPERHOT VR requires you to twist, turn, and duck to dodge bullets and fight enemies in slow motion. It's an incredible game that's only made better by the immersion provided by the Oculus Quest. When I'm deep into that game, I often forget where I am in the real world. I've taken the headset off to realize that I'm facing an entirely different way than I thought. The Oculus Quest's Guardian system means I can focus on the games I'm playing and trust that I'm not going to run into a wall. The device can't track who or what walks into the room, though, so be careful who else is nearby when you're playing. I accidentally bumped into my dog while playing Robo Recall: Unplugged. He's fine, albeit confused by the concept of VR.
The Oculus Quest's battery life lasts between two and three hours, depending on what you're doing. I've found that the device is comfortable enough that I could wear it for extended sessions and worry about battery life before dealing with discomfort. The foam padding on the inside of the device cushions the headset against your forehead and cheekbones. The Quest has a cradle of silicone straps with a strap on each side of the headset and one that goes over your head. These meet up around the back in a rounded triangle that balances the headset and distributes weight across your head. The Velcro straps are easy to adjust, and the padding keeps any pressure off of my face. I've seen people online complain about pressure on their cheekbones, with some resorting to using a battery pack to change the balance of the headset and to relieve pressure from their face. While I don't think I need this, it's a common enough complaint that it's worth bringing up.
From the first moment that I booted up the Oculus Quest, I felt like this is how virtual reality was always supposed to be.
Facebook did a great job when focusing on little things to improve the feeling of immersion with the Oculus Quest. The lenses of the Quest can be adjusted with a slider depending on how wide apart your pupils are. When I took the Quest to a family get together, one relative mentioned that everything seemed blurry. We quickly adjusted the slider to his eye width, and he felt completely immersed.
Another smaller detail is that the Oculus Quest has two headphone jacks. This is so you can use headphones like Oculus' official Quest headphones that have each headphone plug in separately to reduce the amount of wire you need to use headphones. The Oculus Quest does not support Bluetooth headphones, so you'll have to use wired ones or the headset's built-in speakers.
I was surprised to see that many reviewers and early adopters of the Oculus Quest were negative on the headset's speakers. I've found them to be quite impressive. They're not going to replace a pair of Bose QC35s, but they support spacial audio which is essential for games like Vader Immortal: Episode I and Robo Recall: Unplugged that have enemies appear around and behind you. Using the Quest's speakers, I'm able to identify where an enemy is and turn before I get hit. They also work well with games like Beat Saber, which relies on music. It's worth noting that a firmware update that came out before the Oculus Quest shipped to the public seems to have improved audio. One of our writers couldn't get the firmware update on his Oculus Quest until a day or two after receiving the headset and noted a significant difference in audio quality before and after the firmware update.
The Oculus Quest supports two Touch Controllers. These will look familiar to anyone who has used the Oculus Rift, though there are some slight design changes for the Quest version. These Touch Controllers have a plethora of buttons that seemed intimidating at first. On the top of each controller, there are two buttons for gameplay, a joystick, and a home button. Each controller also has a grip button and a trigger button on the back. I was initially worried about using a pair of controllers with so many inputs, but they're mapped well and have a minimal learning curve.
In addition to all of the buttons on the Touch Controllers, the Oculus Quest also tracks the controllers' movements and tilt. This is where the Oculus Quest shines. Even though there are no external sensors or cameras, tracking on the Touch Controllers is great. I've been swinging at blocks in Beat Saber, shooting and stabbing enemies in SUPERHOT VR, and jumping in and out of several games and apps every day and have rarely run into any issues. The only time my Touch Controllers have had issues is if I hold them extremely close to my face or I'm in very bright sunlight. The Oculus Quest isn't meant for outdoor use, so bright lights shouldn't be a problem that often. I do lose tracking when I'm next to a bright window, so I occasionally have to shut curtains.
Combined, this hardware adds up to an incredible experience. From the first moment that I booted up the Oculus Quest, I felt like this is how virtual reality was always supposed to be. Even picking up blocks and paper airplanes in the welcome area of the Quest felt natural. As I dive deeper into games, I've been increasingly impressed with the Quest's hardware and software working together to make me feel like I'm in my own world.
This intuitive nature extends into gaming thanks to developers taking advantage of the Quest's various cameras and sensors. In Robo Recall: Unplugged, you can reach down to your hip to grab guns from virtual holsters and grab shotguns by reaching over your shoulder. I felt like there was no learning curve at all for just about every game I tried. Vader Immortal: Episode I is another example of a game that just feels right. Even in the training dojo, you jump right in. Reflecting lasers at robots and droids happens naturally, and after only a few sessions in the game, I caught myself doing maneuvers by reflex.
While the Oculus Quest is best for gaming, at least in my opinion. It can also be used to enjoy media. You can watch 2-D, 3-D, and 360 videos inside of the device. You can also stream content from YouTube, Netflix, and other services. I personally don't use the Oculus Quest for this that often, but it is nice to have the option to view content on a giant virtual screen.
Oculus Quest Impressive but not quite flawless
The Oculus Quest is an incredible combination of hardware and software, but it has some flaws. These are minor in the grand scheme of things, in my opinion, but there are some things I wish were different.
First, the Oculus Quest doesn't support Bluetooth headphones. It's odd that a device so clearly marketed as an untethered VR headset requires wires if you want to use headphones. I understand that this is due to a technical challenge. John Carmack, the CTO of Oculus VR, said that latency issues were still present with the Quest, which is why Bluetooth headphones aren't supported. I'm glad that they've addressed it directly, but I'd be happier if Bluetooth headphones were supported.
Second, The Oculus Quest also has noticeable light leak around the nose of the headset. If you're playing a darker game or focus on it, it's easy to see a lot of light seeping through the bottom of the headset. I'm not sure why there's such a large gap. I don't exactly have a small nose, and there is still a significant gap for me. I can fit a finger around my nose in every direction while wearing the headset. I've heard people say this helps them orient themselves by looking through the bottom of the headset, but I don't use a VR headset that's marketed towards being immersive to be able to orient myself by looking through a nose hole. I often forget that it's there, but there are times that it's more noticeable than others. I hope someone comes out with a facemask or add-on that can close this gap.
Is this virtual reality's iPhone moment?
The buzz on the web around the Oculus Quest often includes people asking if the release of the Oculus Quest is virtual reality's iPhone moment. Meeting that threshold would be quite the feat. While the iPhone was not the first smartphone, it was arguably the first smartphone the masses cared about. It brought smartphones into the mainstream and drastically rewrote the path of mobile computing. In fact, the iPhone was so impactful that it didn't just alter how the world views phones; it affected tablets, wearables, and computing as a whole.
I'm not sure if historians will look back at the release of the Oculus Quest as the iPhone moment for VR. I'm not sure that any single device will ever be as impactful as the iPhone. But that doesn't mean the Oculus Quest isn't an excellent headset. I think it's more comparable to a different device, the Nintendo Wii.
It appeals to gamers, casual users, and people who never saw themselves using a VR headset.
The Nintendo Wii didn't stack up graphically to its competitors. What it did do was create a unique style of gameplay that was infectious. Everyone from kids to retirees in old folks homes played the Wii. Its minimal learning curve and reliance on movement rather than buttons and traditional controllers delivered gaming to generations and audiences that other consoles couldn't.
I view the Oculus Quest in this vein. It's so easy to hand to someone who doesn't know anything about video games or VR and get them playing in moments. It's a blast at parties and family events, and I've already had family members ask how much it costs and joke about me leaving it with them to take care of for a while.
Unlike underpowered devices like the Oculus Go, the Oculus Quest can play popular titles and handle relatively demanding games. There are some titles available on the Oculus Rift that won't make their way to the Quest, but the library of available games is impressive. Sports Scramble is reminiscent of Wii Sports. Vader Immortal: Episode I is what I dreamed of when I swung around a glowing lightsaber while dressed up as Darth Vader for Halloween. Beat Saber is a game that can be played at the most basic skill level or be taken to the extreme for hardcore gamers. The Oculus Quest is an immersive and versatile VR headset. It appeals to gamers, casual users, and people who never saw themselves using a VR headset.
Even if the Oculus Quest isn't comparable to the iPhone, it would still be a success if it ever was viewed in a similar light to the Wii. The Wii is one of the five highest selling consoles of all time and was so unique that it pushed Microsoft and Sony to try to copy it. If the Oculus Quest is remembered for being the first VR device to convert non-VR users, then it will hold a respectable spot in history.
Oculus Quest Should you buy it?
The Oculus Quest is unique in that it delivers high-quality VR gaming without needing any external sensors, cameras, or wires. Its refined design and immersive interface are worth the $399 price tag you'll have to spend for the 64GB version. No device on the market will provide the same level of portability and quality of gaming within the same headset.
The Oculus Quest is also an all-in-one device, meaning you don't have to purchase any other hardware to use it. If you have to purchase a gaming PC or a flagship phone to use VR, you're going to end up spending far more than you would on the Oculus Quest.
If you're looking for a new VR headset, or even if you've just used your friend's Oculus Quest and want to buy one for yourself, the Oculus Quest is an excellent purchase.

The Amazon Fire HD 8 series of tablets are great for the whole family, including the kids. But a tablet isn't inherently kid-friendly on its own, so it's good to grab a durable case, or even one with a handle. These are our favorite cases for all versions of the Fire HD 8 — the 2020 and the 2018 versions. Now you can feel free to hand over your new tablet to the kiddos, or just breathe easier knowing that an accidental drop isn't going to ruin your device.
Cases for Fire HD 8 Tablet (2020) and HD 8 Plus
Amazon has updated the Fire HD 8 for 2020 with a slightly revised form factor, USB-C charging, and wireless charging capabilities (only in the Fire HD 8 Plus). A new design necessitates new cases, and we've rounded up some of the most rugged options below.
- Best Overall: MoKo Smart Shell Stand Cover Case
- Battle-Tested: MoKo Rugged Case for Fire
- Amazon Approved: Amazon Kid-Proof Case
- Kitten Around: Riaour Shock Proof Case
- Honeycomb Heavyweight: Fintie SIlicone Case
- Back to basics: Mission Cables Case
- Best Overall: Fintie Case
- First-Party Favorite: Amazon Kid-Proof Case
- Best Budget Option: Fintie Silicone Case
- Best for Little Kids: AVAWO Case
- Best Folio Design: Famavala Folio Case
Best Overall: MoKo Smart Shell Stand Cover Case
This attractive case as a frosted clear backshell to show off your tablet beneath a rose gold, black, or denim green color. It has a magnetic cover that can wake the device and folds back into a stand.
Battle-Tested: MoKo Rugged Case for Fire
We have back-to-back MoKo cases, but with good reason! This sturdy case will keep your Fire HD 8 safe from just about any drop, and it includes a built-in kickstand and screen protector.
Amazon Approved: Amazon Kid-Proof Case
Yes, this case is one of the more expensive ones on this list, and yes, this is essentially the same case you'd get if you just purchased the Fire HD 8 Kids Edition. You know what? Not everyone wants the Kids Edition. If yours is a tablet for the whole family, you can simply put this on when it's junior's turn to play.
Kitten Around: Riaour Shock Proof Case
If the previous Amazon case appeals to you, but you don't want to shell out that much money, this is a great option. It has a playful kitten ears design on the handle, and two pop-out feet to help it stand up.
Honeycomb Heavyweight: Fintie SIlicone Case
Fintie has been rolling out new versions of this classic design for years, and it works! With raised bumpers and grippable edges, this case is hard to drop; but if you do, you're protected.
Back to basics: Mission Cables Case
This case, made explicitly for Amazon, is about as basic as you can get. It's a transparent polycarbonate case that lets the vibrant new colors in the HD 8 line shine through, and it comes with two screen protectors. Not a bad deal!
Cases for the Fire HD 8 tablet (2018)
These are the best heavy-duty and kid-proof cases for the previous version of the Fire HD 8 tablet (2018). The dimensions of this model are different enough that cases that fit the 2020 HD 8 and HD 8 Plus will not fit this version.
Best Overall: Fintie Case
Fintie's case has a built-in screen protector and a handle/kickstand duo and offers protection from scratches and bumps. It's available in six colors, so you're sure to find something that fits your child's aesthetic preferences.
First-Party Favorite: Amazon Kid-Proof Case
This case comes directly from Amazon itself and is the perfect kiddie complement to your Fire HD 8 tablet. It has a textured, grippable back and raised corners to protect from accidental drops, and it's available in five fresh colors.
Best Budget Option: Fintie Silicone Case
These affordable and vibrant cases feature a distinctive honeycomb design that protects the Fire HD 8 tablet from bumps and drops. However, if you want that extra bit of peace of mind, you might want to spring for a screen protector as well.
Best for Little Kids: AVAWO Case
This case comes in a variety of colors and features a handle that doubles as a kickstand, making it easier to use and carry. It's made from a dense EVA foam, so in addition to protecting your child's Fire HD 8 tablet from drops or bumps, it's also shockproof.
Best Folio Design: Famavala Folio Case
This elegant case provides a built-in kickstand and stylus holder. It comes in 16 designs and is perfect for older kids and teens. It doesn't offer as much protection as some other cases, but in the hands of an older child or teenager, it should be enough.
Best case scenario
A Fire HD 8 tablet can be an educational tool or a great source of entertainment for children. But since it is a somewhat expensive device and children are known to be accident-prone, you'll want something that can protect it from inevitable drops and scratches. Some cases include extra features like handles and kickstands, while others don't. There are plenty of different cases out there, so you'll need to determine what design will work best with your child.
For the Fire HD 8 and HD 8 Plus (2020) tablets, we like the MoKo Smart Shell Stand and Cover Case. It has a refined and elegant look, with a translucent backing to show off the new Fire HD colors, and a magnetic front cover that folds back to become a stand for watching movies or playing games. It's grown-up enough for adults, yet sturdy enough to take the daily abuse that kids can dish out.
For the 2018 edition tablet, we like the Fintie Case since it's made of a durable hard shell while supplying a combination handle and stand. Your child will be able to watch shows hands-free or transport the device around more securely. It's also the only case on our list to provide a built-in screen protector, which will protect further against scratches, dirty fingers, dust, and crumbs. Since it comes in a variety of colors, you can choose your child's favorite look.

What are the best fitness trackers?
You'll be happy to know that there's no shortage of options when it comes to choosing a fitness tracker. One of the most reputable names, as you may know, is Fitbit. The industry leader makes up a good portion of our list, including options such as the Versa 2, Charge 4, and Charge 3. They share some features but each of these trackers is geared toward a slightly different type of user. Whether you want the look and feel of a smartwatch, a dedicated fitness tracker with onboard GPS, or a basic tracker that's ideal for beginners, Fitbit has it all.
Fitbit isn't the only name you'll find here. You'll also find other major players, like Garmin, Samsung, and Xiaomi, to name a few. Once you've decided what type of experience you're looking for, it'll be easier to narrow down your options.
Are you seeking the most robust activity tracking suite possible? Perhaps you're more focused on certain health aspects, like energy, stress, and blood oxygen saturation levels, and so on? If you're on a tight budget, it also won't be difficult to find a fitness tracker at a reasonable price.
1. Fitbit Versa 2: Best Overall Fitness Tracker
Bottom line: As one of the most popular names in the wearable world, Fitbit is always a good option. The Versa 2 is centered around health and fitness tracking, so it's ideal for workout enthusiasts. You have activity/sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, and Fitbit Pay.
Display size: 40mm / 1.34", 300x300 AMOLED | Replaceable bands: ✔️ 22mm | Weight: 38g | Battery life: 5+ days | OS: FitbitOS | Water resistant: ✔️ (5ATM) | GPS: 🚫 | NFC: ✔️ | Heart rate monitor: ✔️ | Automatic workout tracking: ✔️ | Sleep tracking: ✔️ | Colors: Carbon, Mist Grey, Copper Rose
Pros:
- Compact and lightweight
- Highly customizable
- Affordable price tag
- Robust fitness tracking
- Fitbit Pay
- Water-resistant
Cons:
Swapping out the Versa 2 band isn't as easy as some other Fitbit models we've seen. Trying to attach a new band is a bit of a challenge. Not only is the pin finicky, but it's also tricky to get it precisely in the hole. It's next to impossible if you don't have long fingernails.
Aside from the band-swapping issue, the Fitbit Versa 2 is the perfect blend of fitness tracker and smartwatch. You can check texts, calls, and notifications while eyeing the heart rate monitor as you jog down the sidewalk. Fitbit Pay is now standard, which means you no longer have to pay more to get a model with this feature. The Versa 2 is an excellent wearable choice for those who want to take advantage of a subscription to Fitbit Premium. You'll enjoy guided programs, detailed health insights, additional sleep score details, and Fitbit Coach.
There's not much you can't do with the Fitbit Versa 2. You'll be able to track the basics, including steps, distance, calories, and floors climbed. Some other perks include menstrual cycle tracking, sleep tracking, guided breathing sessions, on-screen workouts, and 24/7 heart rate monitoring. It also provides you with 15 exercise modes to choose from, like biking, running, swimming, and even yoga. It's also the option on this list that's closest to a classic smartwatch.
As you might've heard, the Fitbit Versa 3 is now available, and we hope to have a review and recommendation soon. As a result, the Versa 2 is more affordable than ever. Upon comparing the two, it looks like it'll be quite the upgrade.

2. Fitbit Charge 4: Best Value Fitness Tracker
Bottom line: Fitbit Charge 4

Pros:
- Crisp, responsive screen
- Thin, comfortable design
- Improved notifications

Cons:
Before it made smartwatches, Fitbit was known for its excellent fitness bands. The Charge 4 takes everything the company has learned about the form factor over the years and stands out as one of the most polished and refined devices Fitbit's released to-date.
The big draw to the Charge 4 is that it has GPS built right in. This allows you to map outdoor runs, walks, and bike rides without needing to bring your phone with you — something you won't even find on the Versa 2 mentioned above. It also has all of the other fitness features you'd expect, such as all-day activity tracking, sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, and automatic workout detection. There's also 50-meter waterproofing if you want to use the Charge 4 for tracking any swims.
The design is lightweight and comfortable to wear, and thanks to seven-day battery life, you can wear the Charge 4 for a full week without having to stress out over how much gas is left in the tank.
Fitbit offers a few great smart features, too, including Fitbit Pay, notifications from your phone, and a Spotify app to control music playback. It would have been great to see local music storage to give the Charge 4 even more independence from your phone, but even so, this is an incredibly complete package.

3. Fitbit Charge 3: Best Fitness Tracker for Beginners
Bottom line: Those who are just beginning their fitness-tracking journey may want to ease into it. The Fitbit Charge 3 is a great way to go about that. You'll have activity/sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, automatic workout-tracking, smartphone notifications, and more.

Pros:
Cons:
If you're getting ready to start your fitness journey, you need a dependable tracker. The Fitbit Charge 3 will do a good job of meeting your beginner needs. It's older than the Charge 4, but there aren't too many differences as far as the design is concerned. The body is slightly smaller on the Fitbit Charge 3 and is made of metal rather than plastic.
You'll have 15+ exercise modes, automatic activity tracking, 24/7 heart-rate monitoring, female health-tracking, sleep monitoring, smartphone notifications, and guided breathing sessions. It's easy to see why the Fitbit Charge 3 is a favorite entry-level tracker.
As far as what's missing, you have to pay extra for the Special Edition if you want to use Fitbit Pay. Similar to other trackers on this list, you won't have the convenience of built-in GPS. However, you can still map your route by connecting your tracker to your smartphone's GPS.

Pros:

- Activity/sleep tracking
- Heart-rate monitoring
- Female health tracking
- 14-day battery life
- Affordable
Cons:
When you want to be able to cover your bases with your fitness tracker without breaking the bank in the process, you'll love the Xiaomi Mi Band 5. It's a definite improvement from its predecessor, sporting a 20% larger display area that's easier to read and navigate. More importantly, it offers a satisfying list of tracking abilities and other features that are hard to find at this low price point.
You'll be able to choose from up to 11 sport modes, which include outdoor running, treadmill running, indoor cycling, outdoor cycling, pool swimming, yoga, and more.
Other than that, you'll have a solid 14 days of battery life, which can be stretched up to 20 days in power-saving mode. You'll also enjoy sleep tracking, and all-day heart rate monitoring, and female health tracking. It might not be a smartwatch and is missing features like built-in GPS, but at this price point, it's difficult to complain about this powerful little tracker.

Pros:
- Ultra-lightweight design
- Premium health tracking
- Helpful Body Battery Energy Monitor
- All-day stress tracking
- 7-day battery life
Cons:
The Garmin Vivosmart 4 does everything you would expect it to as a fitness tracker. It keeps track of your steps, sleep, calories burned, floors climbed, various exercises, and heart rate. However, where this tracker shines is its health-tracking features.
For starters, you'll have advanced sleep tracking with REM sleep. It can also gauge blood oxygen saturation levels during the night with its wrist-based Pulse Ox sensor. A relaxation breathing timer complements the all-day stress tracking feature. Lastly, the "Body Battery" monitor helps optimize your daily activities based on your energy levels.
A couple of things you'll miss include GPS and replaceable bands. You'll still have access to smartphone notifications on your wrist. If you're an Android user, you can respond with preset quick replies. If you want detailed health tracking data, the Garmin Vivosmart 4 is the way to go.

If you've been searching for the perfect fitness companion that'll go the distance for any activity you have in mind, you'll have met your match with the Samsung Galaxy Fit 2. In addition to being water-resistant to 50 meters and compliant with military-level durability standards, this handy device is built for endless activity tracking.
You'll have the convenience of automatic activity tracking for five workouts, and you can also use the Samsung Health mobile app to manually select from over 90 workouts, 10 of which can be customized and set as preferred activities.
The Galaxy Fit 2 will also monitor your heart rate, sleep patterns, and stress levels. You might notice that GPS is lacking here, but this robust activity tracking suite is hard to pass up. The FreeRTOS on this fitness tracker isn't nearly as sophisticated as Tizen OS found on Samsung smartwatches, but it just takes some getting used to.

The robust activity tracking suite, heart rate sensor, and low price tag are a few reasons why the Galaxy Fit 2 is a great tracker.
7. Fitbit Inspire 2: Best Heart-Rate Monitor
Bottom line: As one of the most popular names in the wearable world, Fitbit is always a good option. The Inspire 2 features an improved 24/7 heart rate monitor, female health and sleep tracking, and an astounding 10+ day battery life.
Display size: 1.4", OLED | Replaceable bands: ✔️ | Weight: ~30g | Battery life: 10+ days | OS: FitbitOS | Water resistant: ✔️ (5ATM) | GPS: 🚫 | NFC: 🚫 | Heart rate monitor: ✔️ | Automatic workout tracking: ✔️ | Sleep tracking: ✔️ | Colors: Black, Rose, White
Pros:
- Attractive design
- Generous battery life
- Lightweight and inconspicuous
- One free year of Fitbit Premium
Cons:
The Fitbit Inspire 2 is so compact and lightweight, you'll likely forget you're wearing it. This tracker also offers a more traditional buckle band as opposed to the peg-and-loop style. The bands are stylish and easy to switch when you feel like changing it up.
You'll need to swipe up to see additional stats and squeeze both sides with the haptic "button" panels to return to the home screen. Swipe down when you're ready to start exercising. With all that said, there are some restrictions to having such a small screen. You'll need to go to the app to set alarms and bring your phone with you to utilize GPS. This is a great option if you want to monitor your heart rate but don't care about other fancy features. It'll help you with the basics, but you'll miss out on features like Fitbit Pay and an altimeter.

How to pick the best fitness tracker
When it comes right down to it, the Fitbit Versa 2 takes the top spot on our list for a variety of reasons. For starters, the number of features you get for the price is simply unmatched. You'll have battery life for days, on-screen workouts with Fitbit Coach, heart-rate monitoring, convenient music storage, Fitbit Pay, sleep tracking, and much more.
While there might be some drawbacks to the lack of onboard GPS and experiencing difficulties when swapping out the band, these concerns don't hold a candle to the slew of features it offers at such an affordable price. You can track every step taken, floor climbed, and lap swam. You can do all this while you listen to music, check notifications, and monitor your heart rate.
If you're looking for the best fitness tracker for your needs, you may find yourself stuck in one of those infamous internet black holes. How do you know which activity tracker has the features you want at a price you can afford—and won't feel like you've strapped a brick to your wrist?
If you're starting your search, here are a few tips to help you decide which fitness tracker is best for you:
1. Start with price
Depending on which features you want, your new fitness tracker could be surprisingly affordable, or it could end up setting you back quite a bit. (Yeah, we eyed a smartwatch that was nearing the quadruple digits for a good 30 seconds before our conscience brought us back to reality.)
Of course, you should still be cautious about buying anything that's dirt cheap. Most cheap fitness trackers are just that: cheap. Even less costly models by well-known brands like Fitbit won't come with a full display, so you'll need to swap to the app to get all the details on your latest workout.
2. Decide on features
Narrow down your search by deciding which features you need. If your primary goal is to track your steps as you stroll around the neighborhood, you probably won't need a heart rate monitor or GPS.
But if you're using your tracker to keep tabs on calories burned, heart rate, and miles traveled while you hit the trail on your mountain bike, you'll want both a heart rate monitor and GPS.
And if you plan on wearing your tracker while you swim laps in the pool, you'll want to pay attention to the waterproof rating. And make sure the model you pick out tracks swimming.
3. Look at the wristband
If you're blessed with average-sized wrists, wristband fit likely isn't an issue for you. But if your wrists are on the slimmer or thicker side, you'll want to pay attention to the bands that come with fitness trackers.
Brands like Fitbit typically offer fitness trackers in different sizes ranging from small/medium to large. Others offer adjustable bands that provide a snug fit for wrists of all sizes.
Another thing to note about the wristbands is the strap style. Is it a traditional watch-style strap with a buckle? Or does it simply "button" together? The button style sometimes feels less secure, especially if we're at the gym tackling three-point rows and deadlifts.
Luckily, most fitness trackers come with band replacements. This lets you upgrade the material, color, and fit if you like. We're all about having choices.
4. Consider style
Are you content with a fitness tracker that looks like a fitness tracker? Or do you prefer something that looks like a traditional watch?
Activity trackers come in all shapes and sizes, so you can go as simple or fancy, modern or traditional, as you like.
If you're looking for a smartwatch that could fool a coworker into thinking it's an actual watch, we're impressed by the design of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active. If you're looking for something simple, the Fitbit Inspire and Fitbit Inspire HR are slim and uncomplicated.
5. Don't forget about the apps
Our favorite fitness tracker app is Fitbit, hands down. It's user-friendly and offers a full range of features. It even has menstrual cycle tracking, which we've never seen on any other fitness tracker apps.
The Fitbit app also integrates well with many popular third-party apps for a more robust tracking system that meets your needs. Here are some of our favorites:

How do fitness trackers work?
Each fitness tracker works slightly differently, but some sensors and technology are relatively common across them all, like altimeters, accelerometers, and optical sensors. Here's some of the technology you may stumble upon if you break into your fitness watch.
- 3-axis accelerometer — This measures your movements in every direction and helps track those steps.
- Gyroscope — This gets a read on your orientation and rotation as you move. Now it's time for some split squats!
- Altimeter — Whether you're tracking your hike up the mountain or climbing stairs on your work break, this keeps track of your altitude.
- Optical sensors — These shine light into your capillaries to measure how quickly or slowly your blood is pumping to give you an idea of your current heart rate.
- Actigraphy — Ever wondered how activity trackers monitor your sleep? Actigraphy identifies your sleep patterns by tracking your activity and rest cycles, then gives you an idea of how much you tossed and turned last night.
- GPS — The GPS receiver collects data from different satellites to calculate your position as a set of coordinates. This lets you track your terrain and distance after a trail run or day on the slopes.
Of course, not all fitness trackers are created equal when it comes to the accuracy of their sensors. For the most part, actigraphy isn't as accurate as measuring your sleep cycle in a lab, and optical sensors aren't as precise as bioimpedance sensors when it comes to monitoring your heart rate.
What are the best fitness watches for large wrists?
When you're shopping for a fitness tracker, it's important to keep size in mind. Luckily, most bands can be adjusted to fit your wrist without an issue. If you have a particularly large wrist circumference, you'll want to keep an eye out for options that'll work for you.
Out of our list of 10 top fitness trackers, here's what we recommend for large wrists:
3 best fitness watches for large wrists
- Fitbit Charge 4 — The large size band will fit comfortably on larger wrists that range from 7.1 to 8.7 inches in circumference.
- Fitbit Versa 2 —While the Versa couldn't look more different than the Charge 4, it can also fit 7.1 to 8.7 inches.
- Xiaomi Mi Band 5 —This may not be the biggest tracker on the market, but it can still accommodate wrists from 6.1 to 8.6 inches.
What are the best fitness trackers for small wrists?
If you've got an especially dainty wrist, it can be even more challenging to find the right fit. The last thing you want is for your tracker to be sliding around as you go about your day.
So what should you do? We think these activity trackers fit like a glove—er, watch:
3 best fitness trackers for small wrists
- Garmin Vivosmart 4 —The small/medium band can fit wrists as small as 4.8 inches and as large as 7.4 inches. Now, that's impressive.
- Fitbit Inspire 2 — This tracker is lightweight and compact. Did we mention it can fit wrists that measure between 5.5 and 8.7 inches?
Now that you've found your fitness tracker match, you're one step closer to running laps around your goals. #YouCanDoIt

And judging by the Pixel's outsized influence in the Android smartphone market relative to its reported sales numbers, I'd say Google can celebrate that success. Its phones are synonymous with great cameras, with innovative and useful software features, and with playful if divisive approaches to smartphone design.
But influence doesn't sell phones, and Google's Sisyphean journey to bring its own Android experience to more people just hasn't really worked. At the high-end, Pixel phones could never compete with Samsung, LG, Huawei and OnePlus (among others) on sheer brute-force specs; and on the value side, Pixels cost too much to attract the value-conscious buyers of Motorola and Nokia products. As the classic Stealers Wheel song goes, they were stuck in the middle with you.

Last year, though, Google seemingly found its footing with the Pixel 3a, a $399 handset that refactored how the company builds phones. Its success, and the Pixel 4 series' subsequent failure, made it clear what needed to happen: as nearly every smartphone maker went higher and higher, exploring new materials, form factors, and technologies, Google wasn't going anywhere.
Today, the middle is exactly where Google wants to be.
Google Pixel 5
Bottom line: Google didn't shoot for the moon, but it landed among the stars anyway. The Pixel 5 is one of the best and most accessible phones of the year, offering most people everything they want and nothing they don't.
Pros
- Still the best camera for stills and now great for video
- Fantastic battery life
- Attractive, well-built aluminum chassis
- Good performance for the price
- Three years of monthly updates guaranteed
Cons
- Stereo speakers are disappointing
- Display is dim, and auto-brightness is unreliable
- Phone lacks Wi-Fi 6 support
- There's a 5G tax in the U.S.
- Only available in one size, one storage config, two colors
Google Pixel 5 review Price & release date
The Pixel 5 costs $699 USD and is available in two colors, Sorta Sage (green) and Just Black, and in one size configuration — there is no Pixel 5 XL this year. It's also limited to a single storage size, 128GB, with no option for expansion through microSD.
It is now available in eight countries, Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and as of October 29, the U.S. and Canada.
This review was written using a Canadian unlocked Sorta Sage Pixel 5 connected to 5G on Telus, a national carrier. It was connected to Wi-Fi most of the time and a mix of LTE and 5G when out of the house. The Pixel 5 is available in Canada for $799 CAD.
This review will be updated as I use the phone with additional commentary, and those changes will be noted where appropriate.

The Pixel 5 is made of aluminum, which I feel like I haven't said about a phone in a very long time (I miss you, HTC). But this aluminum frame is unlike anything I've held before: the back and sides are painted over with a porous, slightly coarse material, which has thankfully so far been resistant to scratches and fingerprints.
Holding the Pixel 5 is one of my favorite things about using it: it's weighted perfectly, with just the right amount of heft to feel substantial without burdening your pocket. Its narrow frame engenders a comfort in the hand, so typing feels natural and consistent, while the flat Corning Gorilla Glass 6 on the front is raised ever-so-slightly away from the frame, ensuring solid taps on the screen.
The phone's dimensions are only fractionally different from the Pixel 3 and Pixel 4, but thanks to improvements to thickness and materials, it feels significantly better in the hand.
We're talking millimeters of difference between the Pixel 5 and its Pixel 4 and Pixel 3 predecessors, but minor changes in material, weight, and dimensions add up to a significant difference. After just a few days, this has quickly become my favorite Pixel ever to just pick up and use.
Some of that praise needs to be heaped at the display, or at least the decision to get rid of the bezels above and below the screen. With very minor breaks between the 6-inch AMOLED display and the frame, the Pixel 5 looks and feels modern in ways its predecessors didn't, and that Google was able to hit such a considerable screen size, even at a tall 19.5:9 aspect ratio, without increasing the overall size of the Pixel 3 and 4, feels like a win.
Of course, those decisions come with three major trade-offs, and I'm not happy with any of them. The first is that the Pixel 5 doesn't have the face unlock and Soli sensors of the Pixel 4.
It's nice to have the fingerprint sensor back, even if it comes at the cost of face unlock.
The latter I can live with — no one will miss Motion Sense, I promise — but I thought Google's implementation of secure 3D face unlock, and the relatively widespread adoption across the developer community, heralded good things for the future of Android biometrics. But here we see Google prevaricate in the name of aesthetics (and, according to spokespeople I talked to, cost) and revert to a rear fingerprint unlock.
That fingerprint sensor is good in a classic way, and works perfectly. Instead of using an in-display fingerprint sensor, which is slower and less secure, Google made the decision to put experience before spec, and in this case I think it was the right move. Still, I will miss how quickly the Pixel 4 unlocked.
The second trade-off is the loss of the wide-angle front-facing camera from the Pixel 3 series. I loved this addition to the Pixel in 2018, and thought it made it the best phone for taking selfies, period. Last year, with all of the sensors crowding the top of the Pixel 4, Google combined the 75-degree and 97-degree fields of view into a single still-wide 87-degree camera. With the Pixel 5, that's been reduced to 80-degrees, so if you're someone like me who prefers taking wider selfies, this change is going to feel like a setback of sorts.
The third trade-off, which is probably going to be more significant for some people, is the reduction in sound quality over previous Pixel phones. Famously, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 featured dual front-facing speakers, and they were loud enough, and even bassy enough, to rival the best in the industry. With the Pixel 5, Google still claims it phone has dual speakers, but the front-facing element is now hidden behind the display, using a transducer projecting through the glass.
The sound is thin and relatively quiet, which forces the downward-facing speaker to work twice as hard. Cover up that bottom port and the phone barely makes a peep, even at the highest volume, and comparing sound output to the Pixel 3 or Pixel 4, or even any modern flagship from Samsung or LG, makes it clear Google took some liberties with the driver itself. There's a boominess to the sound that borders on distortion, veiling the midrange and treble. It's Google's weakest speaker in years, and a total disappointment.
There are only a few nagging problems with the Pixel 5, and none of them are the obvious ones.
I'm getting these gripes out of the way early on because they're relatively minor and they're really among the only ones I have about the phone. Returning to the display, the 6-inch OLED panel is of very high quality, calibrated well with accurate-looking colors and a lack of banding or blue tinge that you get with some panels in this price tier. It doesn't get quite bright enough for my liking in direct sunlight — certainly dimmer than the Pixel 4 series — but it's fine in most situations, and I'll take that compromise in exchange for the expansive screen real estate in a smaller body, especially with the faster 90Hz display.
There's a part of me that's disappointed Google didn't increase the Pixel 5's refresh rate to 120Hz after having luxuriated in that additional silkiness with the OnePlus 8 Pro and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra this year, but given the Pixel 4's awful battery life, I'm not surprised Google didn't push any display metric boundaries.
Let's turn our attention to the other elephant in the room, the decision to step down from a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800-series chip to the Snapdragon 765G the Pixel 5 shares with its Pixel 4a 5G counterpart (as well as the OnePlus Nord, LG Velvet and Wing, and others). Paired with 8GB of RAM, I wouldn't blame you for being skeptical about Google's assertion that this mid-range chip, which has roughly the same compute power as the Snapdragon 845 found in the Pixel 3, is good enough for its top-of-the-line Pixel.
Let me put those fears to rest: the Snapdragon 765G is great. It's great in every other phone we've tried it on this year, and it's even better here. There's so much legroom remaining in today's flagship phone chips that it often feels like that old adage about how humans only use 10% of their brains; unless you're going out of your way to stress your phone all the time, there's no way you're taking full advantage of a chip like the Snapdragon 865 in today's most expensive handsets.
This isn't meant to apologize for Google's decision, either; I stress tested the crap out of this thing. I used it side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, which is a $699 phone that does have a Snapdragon 865, and the Pixel kept up but for a couple of occasions where apps took a beat longer to load. (For what it's worth the Pixel has 8GB of RAM compared to the FE's 6GB.) I even tried it next to the brand new $749 OnePlus 8T, and you know what? It did fine. I'm not saying the Pixel 5 wins by any means, but it keeps up, and that's impressive.
You will notice a few instances where the Snapdragon 765G lags behind even last year's Snapdragon 855: photo processing speeds. While the cameras, as you'll see next, are still as good as ever, Google's putting a lot of pressure on the phone's brain to turn frames into photos, and you'll likely notice that pulling up one of those computationally-heavy photos takes a few more beats right after taking it.
I did play a few games on the phone, and everything from PUBG Mobile to Dead Cells to Oddmar played identically to any other flagship — smoothly. The only potential caveat is that because the bezels around the phone are so slim, you may find yourself, as I did, with accidental touches when cradling the Pixel in both hands.
One final thing before we move on: it's refreshing to acknowledge that the Pixel 5 is the first premium phone from Google without any showstopping issues at launch. After the original Pixel's software bugs, the Pixel 2 XL's display problems, the Pixel 3's memory issues, and the Pixel 4's atrocious battery life, it's a relief to see Google release a product free of drama. This phone works, and it works as it should.
Google Pixel 5 review Cameras
Portions of this section were written by Hayato Huseman
Pixels are cameras first. That's been the adage since the Pixel 2 and it continues to be the case now. But when the company proved that it could port the vast majority of its camera performance to the $399 Pixel 3a in 2019, the question on my mind became, does camera hardware even matter?
That answer with the Pixel 5 is... complicated. The phone has the same 12.2MP primary sensor that Pixel phones have had for four years, but once again Google's tweaked the output pipeline to satisfy what users are craving today: contrasty, warm photos that are easy to share on social media. The adjustments are subtle but welcome, and I still like the photos on the Pixel 5 better than virtually any other device. But it's also clear that Google's hit the software limits of what this relatively small phone sensor can pull off in hardware.
To its credit, Google didn't fix what wasn't broken: in good lighting, the photos taken on the Pixel 5 are mostly identical to that of the Pixel 4. Every-so-slightly warmer, as mentioned, but you won't notice the differences unless you're looking for them. What that means is you're getting among the best, most consistent photo quality in almost any lighting condition and of any subject.
In particular, Google takes care to retain facial detail in portraits; it doesn't eliminate shadow detail to get a brighter image; it doesn't ramp up color saturation when you're taking a photo of your dinner; and despite the name, HDR+ doesn't make landscapes look cartoony or fake. It may not sound like much, but you can take for granted Google's processing will make the right decisions, from exposure to contrast to saturation to highlights to segmentation, in almost every scene.
There are a few improvements to note this year over previous Pixels. Google has added Night Sight to the main camera mode, which means you no longer have to explicitly activate the Pixel's low-light mode to get the most out of your shot. Google told me that it was "incredibly difficult" to do this properly, likely since finding the threshold between "regular" multi-frame photography, as Google does it, and the "extended" multi-frame photography of Night Sight is more challenging than we realize. Either way, it's a relief not having to care about toggling night mode, and the photos themselves look better than ever.
Photo quality isn't much better on the Pixel 5 than earlier Pixels, but they're warmer overall, and low-light photos are less noisy.
That's right: Google once again managed to improve its low-light results using the same sensor and lens combination as last year. The company said it made improvements to the Night Sight algorithms that allow it to reduce noise even further, retain detail in subjects, and ensure colors are more accurate. In my testing, the results were almost identical to the Pixel 4 in areas of low light — outdoors at night with the subject lit by a street lamp or the moon — but much better in ultra-low light, as in a pitch-black room. The Pixel 5 did a better job keeping focus on a subject and keeping noise down. Of course, given that these improvements are mainly due to software, they should come to older Pixels in a future camera update.
The Pixel 5 also benefits from Night Sight portraits, where the phone is able to determine a foreground subject well enough to carve it out and blur the background. I had very mixed results here, and the success was largely determined by how much ambient light was available to the sensor. If you're sitting in a room lit by a few bulbs, Night Sight portraits should turn out well; outdoors, or in rooms with meager lighting, I'd just let regular Night Sight do its thing.
The Pixel 5 also debuts Google's new Portrait Light features, which exist in two places: the camera app itself and, during post-production, in the Google Photos app. It's important to make this distinction, as confusing as it is, because only the Pixel 5 right now benefits from both.
Portrait Light is not a new concept; the iPhone X debuted several pre-canned Portrait Lighting effects, like Stage Light, Contour Light, and others. But Google takes things to a new and very accessible level, since it's possible to achieve the two most popular styles, stage and contour, with little effort.
Taking a photo in Portrait Mode automatically enables Portrait Light and optimizes it to the extent Google thinks is necessary for the scene (Google says it also applies Portrait Light to faces taken in regular mode, but to a lesser extent). The effect can be jarring, largely because lighting faces artificially is tricky (if you've ever had studio photos taken, or watched the behind-the-scenes of a YouTube video, you know how much equipment is involved) and phone sensors are typically too small to capture enough data to make adding light a fool's errand.
But as Google successfully showed with HDR+ in landscapes, and Night Sight in dark scenes, it can use machine learning to figure out just the right amount of light to add to a face without it seeming artificial. Most of the time, it just works. And if you're not happy with it, you can head into the Google Photos app and change the severity of the lighting or where the shadows in the scene sit.
I was consistently impressed with Portrait Light and its flexibility. Given that Pixel phones already take the best portrait photos in the Android ecosystem by dint of their ability to retain facial detail without oversharpening, Portrait Light just reinforces that lead.
Here's the confusing part: as part of an update later this year, the Pixel 4, 4 XL, and 4a will get the ability to apply Portrait Light in-camera. At the same time, Portrait Light editing of existing photos will come to all Pixels starting with the Pixel 3.
I should also mention that, despite my complaints about a narrower field of view, the selfie camera on the Pixel 5 is still one of the best in the business. Every mode that is available to the rear cameras — Night Sight, Portrait, and Portrait Night Sight, and Portrait Light— is also on the front, but video capture is limited to 1080p.
Elsewhere in the camera, there are two other additions and one removal worth talking about. Gone is the 2x telephoto lens of the Pixel 4, replaced by a fan-service ultra-wide lens. Why didn't Google just add an ultra-wide the way Apple did with the iPhone 11 Pro? Who knows — cost was likely the biggest factor — but it's an interesting and welcome change nonetheless.
Google justifies the change by saying the Pixel's Super Res Zoom feature is good enough that, at 2x, you won't be able to tell the difference between the Pixel 5 and the Pixel 4, which isn't true. Images shot at 2x on the Pixel 5 have much less detail and generally look more artificial — more digital — than on the Pixel 4. Makes sense. But would I rather have an ultrawide for dramatic landscape shots over the reduction of telephoto zoom quality? Absolutely.
The ultra-wide lens on the Pixel 5 won't win any awards for quality, sharpness, or reduction in barrel distortion, but it's a truly lovely addition to the Pixel camera arsenal, and long overdue. Google did a great job calibrating the ultra-wide to match the color science of the primary sensor, and overall it's a pleasure to use.
Then there's video. The Pixels have been rightly excoriated for their lackluster video, and like the call for an ultra-wide camera, Google spent some timing improving things here.
There's so much to talk about with regards to the Pixel 5's video capabilities. The Pixel 4 shot pretty mediocre footage, with virtually zero controls or settings to tweak, so any improvement is welcome here.
That all changes with the Pixel 5. Naturally, you can shoot in either 1080p or 4K at 30fps, but now there's a 60fps option, too. Google isn't kidding around here, either: 4K60 footage is buttery smooth, and just as well stabilized as its 1080p60 or 4K30 counterparts.
The Pixel also borrows a feature we've seen in recent phones from Samsung, LG, and the like: audio zoom. With this, the Pixel 5 uses its various mics to focus in and boost the audio when you zoom into a particular subject, reducing the background noise around it. It's a handy feature, if a bit gimmicky, but that's of course not the only new feature.
Far more significant are the new video stabilization modes; in addition to the standard setting, which uses a combination of EIS and OIS to steady your shots, you can now choose from Locked, Active, and Cinematic Pan, each with their own advantages and drawbacks.
There's no telephoto lens on the Pixel 5, but the Locked shooting mode punches in to 2X anyway, and uses the surrounding data along with stabilization to create a "locked off" shot, almost as if you were shooting with a tripod. It works surprisingly well at canceling out any hand jitters, though if you really push it, you can start to notice the perspective correction warping in the corners.
Active mode mostly seems to be a stronger version of the standard stabilization setting. It's specialized for walking shots and any sort of action moments; Google demonstrates shooting from a jet ski in the camera software.
You can shoot anywhere from 1X to 5X in this mode, though oddly, the Pixel 5 actually leans on the ultra-wide lens for this shooting mode. Because of that, the image quality is dramatically softer than in other modes, and you're limited to just 1080p, rather than 4K.
Google says this is because the wider field of view from the ultrawide camera allows a more substantial crop than the primary, giving the company's stabilization algorithms additional breathing room to work their magic.
In practice, because of the severe reduction in video quality, I'd probably stick with the standard mode unless you're really moving quickly, but we'll do additional testing and update this review.
I think my favorite new shooting mode is Cinematic Pan, which automatically shoots in 60fps, then slows down and stabilizes your footage to create an ultra-smooth 30fps clip. It's a trick I used to do all the time when I had a 4K60-capable camera, since it allows you to create longer, steadier footage in a short amount of time. The results look great — just remember that not everything needs to be slow-mo. Use this mode sparingly.
Ultimately, the Pixel 5 still isn't going to top phones like the Xperia 1 II, LG V60, and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra when it comes to video. Each of these phones have far more manual controls than Google offers, including the ability to shoot in various picture profiles and set manual focus. But considering how far behind previous Pixels have been, this is a huge step in giving the Pixel 5 a more well-rounded overall shooting experience, rather than just a great computational camera for photos.
Conversely, the Pixel's still photo lead is no longer assured, either. The Pixel 5 takes incredible photos in almost every lighting condition, but 2020 has proven that throwing pixels at the problem — the microscopic kind — actually works. Phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and OnePlus 8 Pro have comparatively massive primary sensors, with camera bumps to match, and while neither company is as nimble as Google in using software to solve hardware-related problems, they're getting a lot closer. In fact, it feels like every phone maker is improving faster than Google, and in some areas have surpassed it just by using larger, more modern sensors.
After watching Apple's iPhone 12 launch event this week, where the company trotted out yet another larger primary sensor for its iPhone 12 Pro series alongside a host of other camera improvements, it will be interesting to see whether Google's abdication of the flagship space will result in its losing the photography crown.
Google Pixel 5 review Battery life
Last year, I said that the Pixel 4 was "early to bed, early demise." The Pixel 4 XL was "a night vision camera that's dead by sunset." Both were great phones completely undermined by poor battery life, enough that Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh made structural changes within the Pixel hardware team to ensure that didn't happen again.
True to its word, the Pixel 5 fixes those battery woes. There's a 4,080mAh battery inside the phone, which is 46% larger than the 2,800mAh cell in the Pixel 4, and even bigger than the one in the 4 XL. It's a feat of engineering that Google managed to get such a huge battery in this phone, and it worked: I never ended the day with under 10% battery in my five days testing the Pixel 5, and each had over five hours of screen-on-time.
Some of that extra uptime has to be thanks to the inherent efficiency of the Snapdragon 765G; some due to the subtle improvements to Adaptive Battery that were introduced earlier this year in the Pixel 4a. But mostly it's because Google made the right decision to put a big honking cell in a phone with a relatively dim 1080p AMOLED panel.
Google's also got one additional ace up its sleeve, though I'll admit I haven't used it more than a few minutes this week: Extreme Battery Saver. Taking the protocols of the Pixel's regular Battery Saver mode and ratching it to 11, Extreme Battery Saver essentially cuts off apps from doing anything in the background. They're only working when you have them open in front of you.
That means email or chat clients won't push new messages, and important background services like Covid-19 Exposure Notifications won't operate correctly unless whitelisted. It's a severe solution to the problem of battery longevity, and while I doubt it'll get much use in pockets of people who charge every night, it's certainly nice to have.
Also nice to have is wireless charging, an accomplishment Google made through the aluminum frame by literally carving a hole in the backplate. You obviously can't tell the hole is there — it's filled in with a resin and then painted over — but it's an engineering feat all the same. Wireless charging and water-resistance were the two features I really missed from the Pixel 4a, and I'm so glad they're here.
Google Pixel 5 review Software
On the software front, there are only a few important things you need to know: the Pixel 5 comes with three years of updates (though it should be five) with monthly security patches and quarterly(ish) "Feature Drops."
And everything that's currently exclusive to the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G will eventually come to older Pixels, and then likely to other phones later on, too. That's the trajectory of almost every Pixel-exclusive feature and likely won't change with this generation.
Of course, the Pixel 5 ships with Android 11, which is a subtle update over Android 10 that nonetheless fixes a lot of the small hassles associated with doing repetitive tasks on a smartphone.
Conversations now have their own space in the notification tray, and they can be turned into little bubbles that float along the edges of the screen. Single-use permissions mean that you don't have to wonder if apps are taking your privacy for a ride. Gboard in Android 11 integrates with password managers and Smart Reply, making it even better to use. A new power button menu lets you control your smart home or manage credit cards. And an improved screenshot workflow and native screen recorder make Google's version of Android feel a bit more like Samsung's or Huawei's in the best ways possible.
There are a couple of interesting Pixel 5-only features available right now. An updated version of the Recorder app now lets you edit sections of a recording by deleting the generated text. I'm italicizing that because it's so freaking cool. Google is so confident in its transcription accuracy that it's willing to use it to reverse engineer the waveform. Just incredible.
Also neat, though something no one with a Pixel could try at the moment, is Hold for Me, a service that lets Google's Duplex AI spend time waiting for a customer service representative on your behalf.
Google's Pixel software experience is underappreciated. Even as companies like Samsung, OnePlus, OPPO, and others have slowly come to realize that simplicity and fluidity are almost always preferable to a smartphone user than an abundance of choice, Google still stands alone in trying to ship features instead of options.
After a decade of Nexus and Pixels, it may seem trite to say it, but you really don't understand just how enjoyable it is to use Android on a Pixel until you actually use one.
Google Pixel 5 review Do you need to care about 5G?
One of the marquee features of the Pixel 5 is its support for 5G. Here in Canada, our carriers use sub-6Ghz 5G, which gives the phone speeds roughly equivalent to a decent LTE connection. That said, I retained a solid 5G connection the entire time I used the Pixel 5, and the experience was solid throughout. At $799 CAD, this is the best value in 5G phones on the market outside of the Pixel 4a 5G.
In the U.S., things are a bit different: you're essentially paying a premium to buy a phone that includes Verizon's millimeter-wave 5G bands, which undermines some of the value Google is trying to achieve, especially if you don't plan to use the phone on that carrier.
And while Verizon is expanding its 5G network considerably this week, and Google is one of its longtime partners, it's still a little frustrating, especially when you know the phone could go for $100 less (that's what the exchange rate works out to when you factor in the price of the Pixel 5 in countries where mmWave 5G isn't a thing).
Don't buy this phone because it has 5G; buy it in spite of 5G.
Of course, 5G will be consequential in the future even if it isn't today, and its presence is going to be a selling factor for devices through sheer force of marketing will — every phone vendor, carrier, and chipmaker has been hammering its importance to the future of mobility, even if that reality isn't yet realized. At this point, I'd say the addition of 5G in the Pixel 5 is a necessary evil; that Google decided to make a single version of the phone for U.S. and increase the price by $100 because of it, was the wrong move.
Google Pixel 5 review Lightning round FAQ
Would you buy this over the Pixel 4a 5G?
I've been thinking about this question a lot lately, mainly in relation to whether the Pixel 5 provides enough value to justify its $699 price tag, and I've come to the conclusion that it all depends on how much value you assign to some of Google's minor quality-of-life improvements, like the aluminum frame, like the Pixel 5's IP68 water resistance, and perhaps most of all, wireless charging.
I think that potential Pixel 5 owners would be much better served if there were two versions, one with sub-6 5G at $699 and a Verizon-specific model at $699, similar to the breakdown between Pixel 4a 5G models.
That said, as Hayato pointed out in his Pixel 4a 5G review, it's a great phone that's sort of painted into a corner by the Pixel 4a and Pixel 5. At $499 it's actually kind of a bargain, but it doesn't scream at you with value like the 4a or features like the Pixel 5.
How are the haptics?
So I originally wrote that the haptics are unchanged from last year, but I'm wrong about that. There's a slight difference in quality between the Pixel 3 and 4, which had very clean and precise haptics, and the Pixel 5, which is still clean but a little less precise than on previous years. It's not a huge deal — it took me a few days to realize it — but it's definitely not the same motor as on the Pixel 4, which is disappointing.
How does the speaker-behind-the-display work?
There's a transducer behind the OLED panel that vibrates the entire screen, causing it to produce sound. As I wrote above, the sound is thin and influences the balance of the stereo speakers, but the advantage is that you can put your ear anywhere on the glass and hear the caller on the other end of the phone. I'd rather have a proper front-facing speaker/headpiece, but this isn't a bad solution.
Does the reverse wireless charging work as advertised?
Yep, like Samsung's Wireless PowerShare it needs to be explicitly enabled (and I recommend using a quick tile to do that), but once it's on you can turn the phone over and place a pair of earbuds or a Qi-enabled smartwatch (or another phone, if you're fancy like that), and it charges. Up to 5W maximum, though, so don't expect miracles.
How's the Sorta Sage color?
Glad you asked: it's probably my favorite phone color... maybe ever? I love, love, love it. Green is very in this year, between Samsung's Mystic Green on the Galaxy Note 20 to Mint Green on the Galaxy S20 FE to the new Aquamarine Green on the OnePlus 8T.
How's the official Fabric Case?
Like all Pixel cases in recent years, it's not the best Pixel 5 case, but it's pretty nice. It comes in a range of colors, and Google's really nailed the fit and finish; this thing fits like a glove without adding too much bulk. My primary concern is that fabric can pick up stains and smells pretty easily, so you'll want to be vigilant about cleaning it with soapy water when it touches something it's not supposed to.
Google Pixel 5 review The Competition
There's no question that the Pixel 5 is debuting in a very crowded marketplace, likely during the worst time of year to release a phone. Apple's releasing four new iPhones within a few weeks, including a new iPhone 12 mini that starts at the same $699 price as the Pixel. And Samsung just released the superlative Galaxy S20 FE, while the OnePlus 8T offers a lot of value for just $50 more, at $749.
In previous years, we were forced to pit the Pixels against the best phones from Samsung, Apple, Huawei and others, and the consensus tended to split along specification fault lines: if you value power, go for another brand; if you value finesse, get a Pixel. This year, the Pixel 5 fails to advance things on a technology front at all — in fact, it's mostly a regression — so it's leaning far more on finesse than ever. But even that story is slightly undermined by the excellent Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a 5G, phones that cost $350 and $200 less than the Pixel 5, respectively.
At $699, it's pretty difficult to make the case for the Pixel 5, even after I've gushed about it for damn near 6,000 words. It's an easy phone to love but a hard one to recommend in the face of such stiff competition.
Google Pixel 5 review Should you buy it?
Who is the Pixel 5 for?
Someone who loves smartphone photography. The Pixel is truly a camera first, and despite not making huge leaps over previous Pixels, this is still the best photography experience on Android.
Someone who just wants to keep things simple. The Pixel experience is unrivaled, and there's just something about using one that feels fluid and natural.
Someone who values security. Pixel phones are the first to receive new platform updates and security patches, and the Pixel 5 will receive three years of each.
Who isn't the Pixel 5 for?
Someone who wants the latest and greatest specs. The Pixel 5 is just in a different category than previous Pixels and isn't trying to compete with the latest iPhone Pros and Galaxy S models of the world. This is a mid-range phone with a price to match.
It's not difficult to call the Pixel 5 the best Pixel ever. It fixes a number of the issues raised in the flawed-but-ambitious Pixel 4 line while introducing genuinely new, useful camera features, though many of them will trickle down to older Pixels. It may have minor downgrades over the Pixel 4, especially in the processing speed and biometrics department, but the battery improvements alone make up for it.
If you're in the market to upgrade your phone this year and don't want to get into the stinging nettles of $1000+ smartphones, you could do a lot worse than the Pixel 5. But it's no longer a clear winner in any category — not for price, not for software, not for performance, and not even for camera. Instead, it rests near the top of all of them, amalgamating into an experience that I prefer over basically every other Android phone. The difference this year is that there are so many good alternatives at practically every other price point — two of which are made by Google itself.
Earlier this year, we heard a report that Google significantly lowered its Pixel sales targets. It also tamped down the ambition of its new phones, leaving them squarely in the middle of the pack where they have a better chance to compete.
But from my perspective, having a lineup from the $349 Pixel 4a through the $499 Pixel 4a 5G to the $699 Pixel 5 means that you can get a Google phone with incredible cameras and very good batteries, along with all of those software benefits and regular updates, without spending a lot of money.
If you happen to choose the Pixel 5, that's just ensuring you're getting the best Pixel ever.

This is nominally the "Pixel 4" event, and Google's new phones will absolutely take center stage. But we're also expecting a new Pixelbook, new Google Home and Nest devices, the next generation of Pixel Buds, and maybe even some extra surprises.
This is everything we can expect to see from Google on October 15.
Pixel 4 + Pixel 4 XL
You don't have to follow the tech news that closely to see that pretty much everything about the Pixel 4 that can leak, has leaked. Hardware details, capabilities, specs, features, camera samples, and more are all available out there, and they paint a pretty complete picture of what we can expect from the Pixel 4 and 4 XL.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Google looks to be keeping with the minimalist design aesthetic of previous Pixels with a sleek metal-and-glass design that's understated and flat on the back. The design will be dominated by a big squircle camera arrangement on the back, and a big screen on the front. The only real design flair comes in the super-bright orange color option.
The Pixel 4 is expected to have a 5.7-inch screen and the 4 XL a 6.3-inch, but in either case you'll get an array of advanced sensors to support touchless hand gestures and advanced face unlock — all tucked in a top bezel, rather than a display notch. And those displays are purportedly running at a 90Hz refresh rate, like the latest OnePlus phones. The specs inside round out ... underwhelmingly, with 6GB of RAM, a base 64GB of storage, and just 2800 or 3700 mAh batteries.
There's little left to leak, but much left to learn about how the new Pixels actually work.
But of course, there's always a bit more to the story than what can leak. There are parts of the experience that simply can't leak because they're things that Google can announce around the phones or we won't know about until we hold them in our hands for ourselves. We don't know how those displays look, how the hardware actually feels, and how well the specs run the latest and greatest Google implementation of Android 10. And we really don't know how those battery capacities will hold up in the real world.
The Pixels will also debut two big features that we've seen attempted before and never really executed well. An array of advanced sensors above the screen will enable secure face unlock (possibly replacing the fingerprint sensor entirely) as well as touchless gesture control of the phone. Face unlock has potential to be an important feature following its popularity on the iPhone, but the gestures will really need time to figure out what the real use cases are and whether they're truly worth using over the touch screen or voice control.
One of the biggest parts of the Pixel experience — and also one of the biggest unknowns — is the cameras. Google is expected to be using effectively the same main camera sensor as the Pixel 3, with tons of software improvements to take another generational leap in quality. It's also pairing it for the first time with a secondary camera — a 16MP telephoto to provide zoom and even more data for computational photography capabilities. We need to see what Google has up its sleeve in the photography department, and then how it all comes together when we get out and shoot with it.
Pixelbook Go
The Pixel Slate was a bit of a disaster, but the Pixelbook Go is shaping up to be really nice.
To say that the Pixel Slate underperformed expectations would be a dramatic understatement. It was ambitious, for sure, and the hardware was really great. But the execution was weak. Google's expected to be back at it with a new Pixelbook variant that's going to be a spiritual successor, if not a proper replacement: the Pixelbook Go.
Rather than a tablet form factor with a detachable keyboard, the Pixelbook Go will be a traditional clamshell laptop. This isn't going to be a replacement for the last-generation Pixelbook either; the Pixelbook Go is expected to be a more affordable mid-range option that slots underneath the high-end Pixelbook. So call it a bit of a combination of strategies between the Pixelbook and the Pixel Slate.
Leaks show a 13.3-inch 4K display, a metal body, and options for a range of processors from an Intel Core M3 up to a Core i7. The body is simple metal but with an interesting no-slip textured bottom and typical Chromebook keyboard and layout. t isn't clear what sort of Chrome OS features, if any, will be announced alongside the new hardware, or if this will just be a relatively small announcement considering its market position. Either way, it's likely to be compared directly to Microsoft's new Surface Pro 7 that was just announced.
Google Home refreshes and Nest rebrands
We're due for refreshes and improvements to many parts of the Google Home lineup, and a big launch event is a perfect time for Google to announce them. The original Google Home is three years old, and the Home Mini and Home Max, though newer, could probably use some sort of improvement.
The Home Mini is incredibly popular, but could use a refresh — and apparently, a new brand.
These smart speakers don't need to be refreshed as often as a phone or laptop, but considering Amazon just did a hardware upgrade of its Echo Dot and standard Echo, while also introducing the new Echo Show 8, Echo Flex and Echo Studio, there's room to make some improvements and keep up with the competition.
The lineup of screen-based Nest products was recently refreshed alongside the addition of the Nest Hub Max, so those seem to be all set for the time being. But we've seen reports of a refreshed Google Home Mini re-launching as the "Nest Mini" with roughly the same size but with a built-in wall mount and 3.5 mm audio jack. Any change to the standard Google Home, even if it's just new colors or an improvement in audio quality, would be a welcomed addition. And at this point, it seems likely Google is going to start using the Nest brand across its Home products — be it refreshes of current product lines or altogether new ones.
If any new Home device is announced, you can expect it to come with some announcement of new Google Assistant functionality as well. Google likes to use these hardware announcements as a launchpad for new Assistant capabilities, even though they're usually going to work the exact same way on all Assistant products.
Nest Wifi with Google Assistant
A fresh design will also bring Google Assistant speaker functionality to these routers.
The current Google Wifi router, like the first Google Home, is also now three years old — and rumor has it that its successor will launch alongside the new Pixels as the "Nest Wifi" system. The move to Nest branding makes sense to fall in line with Google's other home offerings, which as discussed, are likely to also continue to take on Nest branding.
That Google would refresh its mesh Wi-Fi system isn't all that interesting, but the intriguing part is the new Nest Wifi is expected to also pull double duty as a pseudo-Google Home speaker. There's supposed to be a new design that further encourages you to keep the units out in the open where they can hear and be heard, and because it's a mesh system, you'll be able to buy them in a multi-pack and spread them around the house for both improved Wi-Fi and Assistant functionality.
Pixel Buds 2
It's easy to have forgotten about Google's Pixel Buds headphones, which launched in 2017 and never really caught on given their high price and questionable functionality as live translation devices. They were, perhaps, a little ahead of their time in terms of funcitonality ... and at the same time behind the curve in a world of truly wireless earbuds.
Rumors point to a refreshed Pixel Buds 2 launch alongside the rest of Google's hardware, though details are sparse. We don't know if they'll still be connected by a cord, or if they'll go truly wireless; nor do we have any idea what the latest tentpole feature will be for them. Honestly the best thing Google could do to make the Pixel Buds 2 popular is make them relatively affordable and just make them great headphones — skipping the extra features that are only going to appeal to a small number of people. But that's also not very likely given how ambitious Google has been with the original Pixel Buds and its other accessories.
It all goes down on October 15
We'll be on hand at Google's event in New York City on October 15, where the show kicks off at 10 a.m. ET. You can watch the livestream of the event at the YouTube link above, and then keep up with a mountain of coverage coming from us here on Android Central — you can count on seeing all of the above, and maybe even a few surprises. We're excited to see it all!

How are you liking the Pixel 5 so far?
Ditch the wires with these Pixel 4 charging pads
Wireless charging on the Pixel 4 doesn't have the same caveats as the Pixel 3, and that means you can get a fast wireless charger without breaking the bank!The next Assassin's Creed was revealed by Ubisoft through a livestream where graphic designer BossLogic worked some magic to create artwork for the game. As previous rumors suggested, it does take place during the time of Vikings. If the world premiere trailer is anything to go by, it promises a lot of bloody battles. Assassin's Creed Valhalla is being developed by Ubisoft Montreal, with support from 14 other studios around the world.
Viking raids
Assassin's Creed Valhalla
Conquer new lands for glory and honor
After endless wars ravage Norway and resources are scarce, you'll lead your clan to the shores of England in the hopes of finding a new home. But not everyone is keen on having Vikings around, and King Alfred of Wessex will do all he can to keep you from settling.
Assassin's Creed Valhalla Setting
Assassin's Creed Valhalla takes place during England's Dark Ages in the 9th century. According to Creative Director Ashraf Ismail, players will visit four major English kingdoms during that time period: Wessex, Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia. Specific cities include London, Winchester, and Jórvík (York), along with smaller towns. Norway also plays a major role as role set sale from your homeland after endless wars. Players will be able to go back and forth between both countries.
Though Norway and England make up the core of the map, players will also be able to visit myth worlds like Asgard and Jotumheim, along with parts of America.
Assassin's Creed Valhalla Story and characters
As clan leader, Eivor (male or female) will lead their clan from the war-ravaged Norway to the shores of England and beyond. Their arrival is met with resistance from King Alfred of Wessex (also known as Alfred the Great) and the Saxons, who will do everything in their power to drive you from the land. Eventually Eivor comes in contact with the Assassins during their journey, thus kicking off the age-old Assassin vs. Templar conflict the series is known for.
Ubisoft is taking inspiration from Norse mythology — much like the studio did with Egyptian and Greek mythology in Origins and Odyssey, respectively — but we don't know what role the gods will play just yet. Apparently, the lore will be more grounded than what we saw in Odyssey.
The present day story will again be playable and follow Layla Hassan from the previous two titles. Ubisoft apparently found a way to "blend the present day into a new type of experience for players."
Assassin's Creed Valhalla Gameplay
Like Assassin's Creed Odyssey before it, Valhalla will continue the series' jump into RPG territory. Players in Valhalla will be able to forge political alliances and choose dialogue options that will affect the story. A revamped combat system now allows players to dual-wield any combination of weapons (including two shields) against a "greater variety of enemies than ever before." Whether you want to brutally decapitate them with a war axe or stealthily kill them in the shadows with your hidden blade (it's back!), the choice is yours. This is all about nailing that visceral feeling of being a Viking warrior.
It seems like Ubisoft heard complaints loud and clear, because some penchants from the earlier Assassin's Creed games are returning. Not only is the hidden blade back, but it can also be upgraded so that you can instakill just about anyone, just like the good old days. Social stealth is also making a return, though it's unclear just how our viking warrior will be blending into the crowds. And when a fan asked if there would be any tombs in Valhalla, Lead Writer Darby McDevitt teased that there are "many buried secrets."
Not only is the hidden blade back, but it can also be upgraded so that you can instakill just about anyone.
New features include raids, settlement growing, and the ability expand your power and influence. With raids, you can pillage enemy villages and fortresses across England for valuable resources. Settlement growing appears to be like what Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood offered with Monteriggioni and Rome, but greatly expanded with more depth. Players can construct and upgrade barracks, blacksmiths, tattoo parlors, and more.
One such settlement will serve as a hub for the player. "It's at the center of our quests and the center of the decisions you make. We want players to see the consequences of their actions," Lead Producer Julien Laferrière told Eurogamer.
"It really changed the shape of the game we were making," Laferrière said. "Instead of exploring one territory, then moving on to another and having no real opportunity or reason to return, the settlement changes the structure. So you'll go on an adventure and then be encouraged to come back to your settlement. It changes the way we're playing the game we're making - at least, that's the bet we're making."
In a first for the series, players can create customize a unique Viking raider and share it online with friends who can then use it during their own raids (though there is so co-op or multiplayer in Valhalla). Players will also be able to customize hair, tattoos, war paint and gear of their own character. Gear can be upgraded throughout the game so that a set of weapons or armor you begin the game with will still feel formidable as you progress.
Ravens are largely associated with the Norse god Odin.
Instead of your trusty pet eagle to help guide you along your journey and act as some eyes in the sky, a raven will be filling that role in Assassin's Creed Valhalla. After all, ravens are largely associated with the Norse god Odin.
"We have a bunch of new abilities for the raven," Laferrière said. "We used it as a reason to re-explore the way players can explore the world so it is less reliant on UI. If you notice a distraction somewhere it's probably because there's some content there."
Naval gameplay will be a major element as well, but don't expect to be fighting on the sea often. Vikings are known for being fearsome warriors, and many battles were won because of their skills as sailors, but they didn't partake in naval combat like you'd expect. The Vikings longship will play a crucial role in traversing the map and bringing your raiding party where it needs to go. Ismail teases a lot of surprises in store with the longship, but he did not go into detail.
The company revealed that for the first time ever, players will be able to switch between male and female Eivor whenever they'd like in the menu, meaning both genders are canonical to the story, though the reasoning for why this is possible was not explained. Players will also be able to play as Layla in the open-world of England. Previously, modern day characters could not be played in the historical simulation.
Assassin's Creed Valhalla Release date and platforms
Assassin's Creed Valhalla will release November 17, 2020 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, PS5, PC (Epic Games Store and Uplay), and Stadia. You can pre-order it now.

The Galaxy Watch is a great smartwatch, and it deserves one of the best Samsung Galaxy watch bands. Not only to keep it secured to your wrist but also to help customize it to you. The watch allows you to choose from several watch faces to get the right look for the screen, but you can easily replaceable the strap using a standard 22mm watch band for the 46mm Galaxy Watch to make it even more you.
- Meshes with everyone: Fullmosa stainless steel watch band
- Totally metal: V-MORO 22mm Stainless Steel Strap
- Wooden wonder: LDFAS 22mm Wood Band
- Super stretchy: Speidel Stainless Steel Watch Band
- Timeless leather: Ditou leather watch band
- A bit less expensive: Fullmosa Genuine Leather Watch Band
- Get cuffed out: Coobes leather cuff
- For the fitness gurus: Epoosuo Silicon Replacement Strap
- Buckle up: Ritche NATO nylon watch band
- Mix and match: STYLEOVER NATO Watch Band
- Sporty style: Barton Elite silicone band
- Classic canvas: Beafiry canvas quick release
Meshes with everyone: Fullmosa stainless steel watch band
Sometimes the feel of metal can be calming, being more stable than other material. If you need a band that you know is safe for you to use, then stainless steel is the ticket. This adjustable mesh-style band is super comfortable and looks great too.
Totally metal: V-MORO 22mm Stainless Steel Strap
This strap from V-MORO is made of heavy-duty stainless steel, and it can go on in an instant with the built-in clasp. It's available in black or silver to better match your watch, and it can be installed with the quick-release pins.
Wooden wonder: LDFAS 22mm Wood Band
This band will help you stand out from the crowd, with the red sandalwood between each link. You can get this band in either black or silver steel, and both look great with the redwood. There's a clasp to get the band on and off your wrist, and quick release pins to join the band and watch.
Super stretchy: Speidel Stainless Steel Watch Band
These stretch watch bands are my favorite because they're super easy to slip on and off, and they're the perfect fit. You'll likely need a jeweler's help to get that perfect fit, but it's worth it. This one from Speidel comes in either a straight end for easier installation or with a curved end to better match the contours of your watch.
Timeless leather: Ditou leather watch band
Leather has long been used for watch bands and for good reason. Leather naturally customizes to the wearer as it gets worn, creating the perfect fit. It also enhances the look of the timepiece and fits in with nearly any situation.
A bit less expensive: Fullmosa Genuine Leather Watch Band
If you prefer a thinner leather watch strap — or just want to save a few dollars — this band from Fullmosa is a great option. You can choose from 10 different bands and buckle color combinations to best match your style, and there's an included installation tool to get the band on your watch. The buckle is heavy metal, so it'll be nice and sturdy on your wrist.
Get cuffed out: Coobes leather cuff
This impressive, wide cuff-style band comes in four colors and has a wide section right under your Galaxy Watch itself so that you won't feel the cold metal against your skin — just soft, supple leather.
For the fitness gurus: Epoosuo Silicon Replacement Strap
The Galaxy Watch comes with a silicone band so it can be used when you work out, but this band is going to be a little better. There are more perforations on the band, so your wrist will breathe a bit easier. More perforations also mean a more exact fit, definitely important if you're monitoring your heart rate.
Buckle up: Ritche NATO nylon watch band
The Ritche NATO style watch band is another super durable watch band. This one is made from ballistic nylon and has a bit of tactical style while still being comfortable.
Mix and match: STYLEOVER NATO Watch Band
If you want to swap out different bands to change up your style, this set from CIVO is for you. You get four different colored straps in the pack to best first your style. The kit includes an installation tool and a few replacement pins to keep the bands attached to your watch.
Sporty style: Barton Elite silicone band
Barton Elite's bands come in 16 color styles, many of them two-tone, and made from a firm but flexible silicone. Each band comes with two lengths of the long side of the strap with holes, which allows you to find the perfect fit for your wrist.
Classic canvas: Beafiry canvas quick release
A good canvas watch band is tough to beat. Beafiry makes a solid, durable band that complements your watch while being super comfortable. The material is rugged and durable, while still being comfortable to wear.
Accessorize your favorite wrist accessory
No matter what your style is, it's easy to find a replacement band for your Galaxy Watch. The watch takes standard 22mm straps, so any band that size will also fit your watch. And since watchmakers have used that size for centuries, it shouldn't be hard to find the perfect watch band for you.
A watch band that can mesh with a variety of looks while staying comfortable is key, and the Fullmosa stainless steel mesh band does just that. You get a high-quality band with so many clasp points that you're sure to get the perfect fit.
It's also hard to go wrong with a good ol' leather band. Whether you prefer more of a classic look with something like the Ditou leather band or to stand out a bit more with a cuff-style band from Coobes. Either way, you'll have a strap that will last a long time. I like to keep a perforated silicone band in my rotation for workouts, and the band from Epoosuo is my go-to with its comfort and durability.

- Oculus Link is now available in beta for testing.
- The feature allows you to connect your Oculus Quest to a PC to play PCVR games on the Oculus Quest.
- Oculus released minimum PC requirements and minimum cable requirements for Oculus Link.
Players and VR users can now test out Oculus Link beta on the Oculus Quest. Oculus announced that the beta version of Oculus Link is now available, bringing another option for VR users to play powerful PCVR games. We went hands-on with Oculus Link in September, and our managing editor Russell Holly said, "This really does work as advertised, which is damned impressive." Now, anyone with the required hardware can give Oculus Link a try.
Oculus Link allows you to connect your Oculus Quest to a PC with a USB cable. With this setup, you can play AAA games on your Oculus Quest previously unavailable to Oculus Quest users. When using Oculus Link, your PC handles the heavy processing work, and your Oculus Quest works alongside it to provide an immersive PCVR experience on the Quest.
Because your PC is doing the work, it needs to be powerful enough to handle PCVR games. Oculus released its recommended specs for PCs powering Oculus Link.
|Component||Recommended specs|
|Processor||Intel i5-4590 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500x or greater|
|Memory||8GB+ RAM|
|Operating System||Windows 10|
|USB ports||1x USB 3.0 port|
When it comes to GPUs, only a few types are supported at this time. This chart only includes those that Oculus listed as "supported."
|GPU||Supported|
|NVIDIA Titan X||Yes|
|NVIDIA GeForce 1070 (all)||Yes|
|NVIDIA GeForce 1080 (all)||Yes|
|NVIDIA GeForce GTX 16-series (all)||Yes|
|NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20-series (all)||Yes|
At this time, no AMD GPUs are supported. Oculus states, however, that they're "Currently working directly with AMD to support as many of their cards as possible by the time we exit beta and expect to add support for some cards during the beta." Oculus also adds that they're "Using this beta-period to continue to test, iterate, and validate GPUs." and states that they "plan to move additional GPUs to the supported column by the time the software exits beta."
Oculus Link hands-on and five questions answered
The Oculus Quest has different specifications than the Oculus Rift S, so the experience on the Oculus Quest won't be the same as using the Rift S, even if powered by the same PC. Oculus states that "While Rift S offers the highest fidelity gaming experience available, Oculus Quest is making it easier to get into VR than ever before." In short, at the cost of lower fidelity, Oculus Quest users gain the ability to play PCVR games while connected to a PC while also having the option to play Oculus Quest games when untethered.
In order to use Oculus Link, you'll need to connect your Oculus Quest to a PC using a supported USB cable. Oculus will release a 16-foot+ custom optical fiber cable, but until that's available, players will have to find their own. To help players purchase cables and manufacturers to make cables, Oculus released the specifications for the Oculus Link headset cable.
|Component||Recommended specs|
|USB type||USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C|
|Signal requirements||3.2 Gen 1 Signaling 5 Gbps USB 2 backwards compatible|
|Power supply||3A|
|Bandwidth||5Gbps|
|Infrared Signal Loss Tolerances||<500mV VBUS @ 3000mA ; <250mV GND @ 3000mA|
Until the official Oculus Link Cable is available, Oculus recommends the Anker Powerline USB-C to USB 3.0 cable. That cable is USB-C to USB-A, which may be right for some users. If you have a PC that only has USB-C ports, you should take a look at the GodSpin USB-C to USB-C cable. Because we have not been able to test Oculus Link with this cable, we cannot guarantee that this cable will work. It does, however, support USB 3.1 and 3.2, has data transfer speeds of 20Gbps, and supports 5A/ 20V of power. These specs exceed the recommended specs that Oculus shared, so it should work. Notably, the charging cable that came with the Oculus Quest is not supported.
To use Oculus Link, you'll need to to use the Oculus PC app and make sure that it's up to date. You'll also need to ensure that your Oculus Quest is running the latest version of its software.
How to update your Oculus Quest
In terms of availability, Oculus states, "The Oculus Link Beta is dependent on updates to the software versions listed above. Once the updates are released to all customers, we'll begin rolling out the remote rendering feature enabled by Oculus Link. During this time, you may need to restart your headset in order to gain access to the feature."
Versatile VR
Oculus Quest
Options to enjoy VR
The Oculus Quest is known for its untethered nature, but now it also has the ability to play PCVR games with Oculus Link. The feature is in beta but allows you to play powerful VR games on a headset that you can then detach from your PC and use on the go.
Anker Powerline USB-C to USB 3.0 Cable
Oculus recommends this cable for trying out Oculus Link until the official Oculus Link Cable becomes available.
GodSpin USB-C to USB-C Cable (6.6 feet)
This USB-C to USB-C cable supports 20Gbps transfer speeds, 5A/ 20V power, and USB 3.1 and USB 3.2.

When is Prime Day 2020?
Amazon Prime Day kicked off officially on October 13 and will run through the end of Ocotober 14.
Similar to last year, Prime Day 2020 is a 2-day event spanning a full 48-hour period, giving you plenty of time to shop the best deals. The first deals will kick off just after midnight PT on October 13 and the event will end at midnight PT on October 14.
This is the first time we have seen a Prime Day sale in the fall months, so it remains to be seen exactly how the event will play out with a likely Amazon Black Friday sale following not too far behind.
When do Prime Day deals begin?
Right now! Amazon has already kicked off the first wave of official Prime Day deals with more to follow later in the day on Tuesday and Wednesday. Get to shopping now!
Why was Amazon Prime Day 2020 delayed?
Due to unforeseen circumstances, Amazon Prime Day 2020 is now taking place in the fall months for the first time. Amazon started the annual Prime Day event back in 2015, and since then it has always taken place in mid-July. With the COVID-19 outbreak, Amazon has faced issues with fulfillment, product availability, and workplace health concerns.
Delaying Prime Day until October gives the company a better chance at being able to keep up with orders, keep its workers safe, and give an overall better experience to everyone involved.
What deals do we expect during Prime Day 2020
There's no easy way to tell what will be discounted on Amazon until we receive the official word from Amazon, but after all these years of covering the event, we have a few ideas. It's nearly a guarantee that all of Amazon's own hardware, like the Fire TV sticks, Echo line, Kindles, Ring gear, and more will be on sale. Prime Day tends to bring many of these devices to historic low prices. The best Prime Day deals are generally focused directly around these items.
Beyond the usual suspects, we'd imagine that popular electronics like the TCL Roku TVs and Sonos speakers will be on sale, along with kitchen gadgets from Instant Pot, Keurig, and more.
Should you shop Prime Day 2020 deals or wait for Black Friday 2020?
This year it seems as though Prime Day will be taking place about 12 weeks later than normal, which puts it only about six weeks away from Black Friday. We all know that Black Friday has gone from a one-day event into a month-long marathon of sales, so realistically Prime Day is only about two weeks before the kick off of November, which is pretty close with all things considered.
Odds are Amazon realizes that in order to capture the audience looking to spend money that's potentially worried about this that it will need to bring some irresistible offers to the table. We've always been in support of shopping early instead of waiting, especially since Black Friday's shopping season is a week shorter than normal (like it was in 2019), so product availability could be scarce during the holidays.
We'd imagine that Amazon will be bringing some competitive and enticing prices on hot devices, so you'll likely want to be prepared to do a bunch of your holiday shopping during Prime Day 2020, even though that may not be what you are used to doing.
What were the most popular Prime Day deals in 2019?
Each year, Amazon announces the top-selling Prime Day deals, and in 2019 most of its own hardware topped the list. It's not a huge surprise to see this, as Amazon tends to aggressively lower the prices for the big event. Aside from its hardware, SanDisk microSD cards, Instant Pots, and a few others made the list.
In the U.S. Amazon said the highlights included:
- A record number of Prime members shopped during Prime Day in the U.S.
- Prime members purchased more than 100,000 lunchboxes, 100,000 laptops, 200,000 TVs, one million headphones, 350,000 luxury beauty products, 400,000 pet products, 650,000 household cleaning supplies, and more than one million toys.
- Prime members purchased more than 200,000 LifeStraw Personal Water Filters and 150,000 Crest 3D White Professional Effects Whitestrips Kits.
- This year, Prime members in the U.S. received tens of millions in Prime Day savings when they shopped at Whole Foods Market. The best-selling Prime Day deals were organic strawberries, red cherries, and blueberries.
When will Amazon Prime Day 2020 deals begin?
Amazon kicked off a few early Prime Day deals alongside the announcement of the Prime Day 2020 dates, so you can already shop those. The deals will really start flowing during the actual event, though, which is slated to start at midnight PT on October 13. We'll be sure to keep you updated on the very best Prime Day deals as they appear.
What type of Prime Day deals will there be?
Amazon will have a few different deal styles running on Prime Day. There are a few different types of deals you can expect to see during the event, including Gold Box deals, Lightning deals, Coupon deals, and direct price drops. Each of these is a little different, so here's what you can expect from each type:
- Gold Box Deals of the Day: These are Amazon's daily deals, and generally for these, the company has plenty of stock to fulfill orders on it all day long. We have seen Gold Box deals sell out in the past, but it's far less often that these sell out than the other types of deals.
- Lightning Deals: Like an actual bolt of lightning, these deals will come and go fast. On an average day, Lightning deals tend to last for around six hours, but on Prime Day it's likely that the most popular deals will go in the blink of an eye. You can generally join a waitlist if it sells out, but that won't guarantee that you will actually get the product.
- Coupon Deals: Many sellers will be offering coupon codes as a way to help people save on Prime Day, and these require a little more work. Some will offer landing pages that automatically clip the coupon code for you, and others will require you to manually enter them during the checkout process. The few seconds of extra work can sometimes save you big, though.
- Direct Price Drops: For a vast majority of deals on Prime Day, you'll visit the page and the price will just be reduced.
These price drops span all of the categories that Amazon covers. Whether you're in the market for kitchen appliances or knives, or happen to need a new TV, computer, clothing, or even a new mattress, odds are it will be on sale during Prime Day.
Will USPS shipping delays affect Prime Day?
It's a little too early to tell at this point, but it does indeed seem likely that Prime Day could suffer some delivery delays because of the USPS backlog. As of right now, USPS performs about 30% of Amazon's deliveries, which is quite a large number. Recent changes at the Post Office have led to delayed packages, mail sitting in locations for long durations, and more.
Hopefully, things turn around or Amazon is able to offset the delays with more in-house shipping this year.
What is Amazon Prime Day?
Underneath all the advertising and marketing jargon you'll read about Amazon Prime Day is a rather large shopping event that kicks off on in the middle of July each year. It used to be a one-day event, but Amazon has since expanded that. In 2018 the company ran it for 36 hours, and in 2019 it expanded to 48 hours. Amazon claims that Prime Day is bigger than Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and basing it off of what we saw last year, it is entirely possible that the company can pull that off this year.
The shopping event is exclusive to members of Amazon's Prime service, which offers free 2-day shipping on millions of items, access to Prime Video, photo storage, and much more. An Amazon Prime membership now costs $119 a year, but you can get a free 30-day trial to get all the benefits without shelling out any cash. Yes, that means that you'll be able to shop all the Prime Day deals, get the free 2-day shipping, and all without paying anything for it. Keep in mind that after the 30 days Amazon will charge you for the year in full, so you'll want to set a reminder to cancel if you don't want to keep it.
Prime Day Concert, explained
This is a bit of an odd one, but two years ago Amazon started a new tradition with a Prime Day concert. The first one was headlined by Ariana Grande, and last year Taylor Swift hit the stage to perform. The 2020 Prime Day Concert has yet to be made official, but we can expect that Amazon will indeed offer one with a large headline act.
We will keep you posted as Amazon announces more information on the Prime Day concert for this year's event.
Will other retailers try to participate in Amazon Prime Day?
With certainty we can say yes. Other retailers like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, eBay, Newegg, and plenty of others will be joining in on the fun. Some will launch sales aimed directly at competing with Prime Day offerings, and others will simply match the deals and discounts from Amazon.
We've seen eBay go all-in on its own promotions in years past, and with the state of everything right now we wouldn't be surprised to see more competition do the same.
What is the history of Amazon Prime Day?
To help celebrate its 20th anniversary, Amazon kicked off Prime Day back in 2015. Since then, the company has grown the event, making it a little bigger each year. 2020 will mark the sixth anniversary of Prime Day as we know it. The event started as a one-day thing that had a random mix of things on sale, and has evolved into what was a 48 hour event last year that offered well over 1 million deals.
Beyond just discounting its own hardware, Amazon features discounts on popular products from Bose, Instant Pot, TCL, KitchenAid, and many other big brands. The growth hasn't been flawless for Amazon, though. Last year, the company experienced nearly two hours of downtime at the beginning of the event due to the extra traffic. The site had immense troubles loading listings, showing updated pricing, and getting through the checkout process. Once this was resolved, the rest of it went pretty smoothly.
How does Amazon Prime Day work?
Prime Day is not as straightforward as some other big shopping days, and that's not such a bad thing. There are some things that you'll want to keep in mind, especially if you are looking for deals on specific products. Last year, Amazon released deals in batches every three hours. This year, some of the promotions are based around six-hour blocks, so it's possible the company has extended the times each deal will be available to accommodate for the longer event.
Who is Prime Day for?
Only people who are Amazon Prime members will be able to participate in Prime Day. You don't have to be a long-standing member. Even if you just use the 30-day Prime Day free trial for the event you can shop the sales.
You should also be able to participate if you're part of Amazon Household, Family, or using the student-discounted Prime membership.
Amazon Prime Membership
You can sign up for a free 30-day trial of Amazon's Prime service so you can still take advantage of all the great Prime Day deals without paying anything extra.
So, do I need to be a Prime member to get Prime Day deals?
The short answer: yes. Sign up for a free 30-day trial if you aren't already one so you can still take advantage of the great deals we will see.
Should I sign up for an Amazon Prime trial now?
Amazon offers a free 30-day free trial of its Prime service and, since Amazon Prime Day 2020 is officially set for October 13 and 14, you can snap up that free trial now to ensure you get in on the savings.
Why should I care about Prime Day?
Most people shop all year, not just around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Odds are there is something that you're looking to buy, and who likes to pay full price for the items they want the most? Whether you're heading off to college this year and need some essentials for your dorm room, or you've just been putting off a purchase of new luggage, cell phone accessories, headphones, and more, Prime Day may just offer the deal you need to own that new gear.
On Prime Day, Amazon doesn't have deals in only one or two categories, it's basically across everything that the site sells. This means there is literally a deal out there for everyone. Seriously. From Echo devices to Amazon services like Kindle Unlimited, Instant Pots, DNA test kits, and almost anything else you can think of, you'll probably see a discount or ten on some of the most popular products.
How do I prepare for Amazon Prime Day?
There are lots of little things you can be doing now to prepare yourself for Prime Day. Some may be obvious and others you may not have considered. Let's review some Prime Day tips to ensure that you're ready for maximum savings on the big day.
Begin with your Amazon account. Check to ensure that your Prime membership is in good standing and won't be up for renewal before mid-July. You'll also want to make sure that your billing address is correct and that your credit cards aren't expired. It may seem silly now, but those extra few seconds you save during checkout could be the difference between scoring a sick deal and missing out on it.
Keep an eye on Thrifter's Twitter account to find out exactly when the event will be taking place so that you can begin your 30-day free trial at the right time, and it won't expire before you get to use it.
You're going to want to get yourself an Alexa-enabled device. The Echo Dot is only $50 and often on sale for less than that, including an early Prime Day deal going on right now. This may enable you to get deals exclusive to voice shoppers, deals even other Prime members won't be able to get first like it has in years past.
The Amazon Prime Rewards credit card is for the hardcore people. You need an eligible Prime membership to get the most benefits out of this card. Signing up for it gets you a $70 Amazon gift card you can spend on Prime Day. Plus, you can get 5% back on Amazon from whatever you spend. If you plan to go all-out on Prime Day, this is a no-brainer.
Which countries participate in Amazon Prime Day?
In 2019, Amazon offered Prime Day in 17 countries, and it's likely that more will be added this year. The countries that participated include: Australia, Japan, Singapore, China, India, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico.
How do I stay on top of Prime Day deals?
Amazon Prime Day 2020 is likely to be the biggest one yet, with over a million deals that cycle through the course of it. Luckily, there are a few great ways to stay on top of the deals, and some of them you can do right from your phone. If Amazon continues some of what we've seen in the past few years, you'll be able to look forward to the following.
First up is the Amazon app. You'll want to make sure you have it downloaded and installed on your phone. First-time users will actually even get a $10 credit to use on Prime Day for signing in the first time, so don't miss out. In the Amazon app, you'll be able to set alerts for upcoming Lightning deals, watch deals that you're interested in, and quickly check out when they go live.
If using your phone during the workday isn't permitted, Amazon's Assistant browser extension may be a better bet for you. You can install it for free, and as a Prime member, you'll get $5 off your next $25 order for goods sold and shipped by Amazon. You will need to use the Assistant extension to find the deal, but it's a small trade-off for the additional discount.
Our pals over at Thrifter will also be covering all of the event. When it comes to big events like this that are full of deals, the team just doesn't sleep. From deals that are likely to sell out quickly to coupon codes you may not have uncovered on your own, Thrifter will be the absolute best place to look for a Prime Day deal that you may be interested in. You'll want to make sure that you are following them on Twitter.
Will there be Prime Day exclusive products that launch?
In 2018, we saw something new from Amazon. The company used its Prime Day event as a time to unveil a bunch of new products for different brands, like an Alexa-activated faucet, Bluetooth soundbars, Crayola crayon sets, and much more. These weren't the highlight of the day, but it could be a step towards a bigger vision for Amazon. On Black Friday, we tend to see a lot of companies release specific models that are only sold during that time frame, and if Prime Day continues to grow we could see the same for the mid-summer event.
The same carried true in 2019, and we expect Prime Day 2020 will bring even more new exclusive product launches though that could be dialed back depending on how supply chains recover for companies looking to launch new products.
What else should I know?
So, now that you know the basics about Prime Day, here are a couple of pro tips to help you get the absolute most out of the big event that you can. Our first words of advice are "Buy now, think later." Seriously, some of these deals will sell out in just seconds, and the last thing you'll want is to miss out on a great price because you were thinking too much about it. Amazon allows you to cancel an order before it ships, and on most items, the company even offers free returns. Instead of missing out, buy the deals that you're most interested in, and then do your research on the product and such after you've completed the checkout process.
With such a wide variety of products being on sale during the event, it's often times helpful to have some sort of game plan ahead of time. Think about the things you want to buy and need the most. Jot them down, mark them in the app, and be ready to buy them when you see the deals hit. If you go in blind, you'll either come out having purchased way too much (which is still a win when it's discounted) or with nothing at all. The old saying "If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail" definitely applies here.
As mentioned above, you do 100% need to be an Amazon Prime member in order to get in on the Prime Day action. Get yourself the free 30-day trial to help save you money without costing you anything.
Is everything that's discounted worth buying?
Without knowing the deals ahead of time, it's hard to say which exact models and items will be worth buying or not. Generally, gaming consoles, Alexa devices, TVs, and other miscellaneous items are available at some pretty great prices. Some items, like laptops, are not as smart of a purchase on Prime Day.
Last year we saw some great deals surface on things like the Echo Dot, Instant Pot, DNA testing kits, and more. In 2020, we anticipate that Amazon will up the anty a bit and offer even more knockout deals.
Just remember, not every deal is actually a deal so be sure to keep it locked to Thrifter for all the best deals you should *actually buy** on Prime Day.
Let Thrifter help you
Prime Day just keeps getting bigger and bigger, and it's really hard to maximize your savings during these big events. The team over at Thrifter is full of professional deal hunters who will literally be providing around the clock coverage of everything on Prime Day. From the best savings, as they hit to roundups of what you should be buying, the team will aim to make it as easy as possible to find the best deals that are available from the first to the last minute.

Nest makes great Wi-Fi-connected security cameras, but their high prices push many customers to seek out the best cheap nest cam alternatives. Thankfully, we've found other security cams that hold their own against the Nest Cam Indoor and Cam Indoor IQ, but at more reasonable prices. Whether you're after the absolute cheapest camera you can buy or something with just as many features as Nest for a little less, we've got you covered. Here are some of our favorite Nest alternatives.
- Best overall: Logitech Circle 2
- Best for Alexa: Ring Indoor Cam
- Best free service: Arlo Q
- Most affordable camera: Wyze Cam
- Scan the room: Eufy Indoor Cam 2K Pan & Tilt
- Another affordable option: Canary View
- Close Nest competitor: Ring Stick Up Cam
- A tiny steal: Blink Mini
Best overall: Logitech Circle 2
The Circle 2 is an excellent 1080p security camera with a wide-angle lens and night vision that's rated for visibility up to 15 feet. Like Nest's cameras, you get two-way audio and person detection. There's also a convenient day brief feature that condenses the last 24 hours into a 30-second time-lapse, so you don't have to scrub through hours of footage.
Best for Alexa: Ring Indoor Cam
Ring's Indoor Cam captures 1080p video with customizable motion zones, night vision, and two-way audio. You can stream your video feed directly on an Alexa-powered smart display like the Echo Show, and the Ring Protect service lets you keep a timeline of previous motion-triggered recordings. As a cheap Nest Cam Indoor alternative, it comes close in specs at less than a third of the price.
Best free service: Arlo Q
The Arlo Q is yet another 1080p security camera with motion alerts and night vision. It's compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant and has two-way audio. It has the option to record continuous 24/7 video with a paid subscription, but the real highlight feature is the free Arlo Basic service, which saves a full week's worth of footage for up to five cameras.
Most affordable camera: Wyze Cam
Among the very best cheap Nest Cam alternatives, Wyze doesn't offer fancy features like facial recognition or two-way audio (at least, not without having to toggle the microphone on and off for each participant), but that's easy to look past given the ridiculously low price. The Wyze Cam still offers 1080p video, works with Google Assistant and Alexa, and even gives you 14 days of cloud storage for free.
Scan the room: Eufy Indoor Cam 2K Pan & Tilt
Eufy jam-packed its indoor cams with great features. It has a microSD storage slot, is compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, and HomeKit, allows prerecorded messages triggered in activity zones, can differentiate between humans, pets, and objects, and can film 24/7 in 2K resolution. The pan & tilt model does all this and can spin a full 360º horizontal and 96º vertical.
Another affordable option: Canary View
Canary makes higher-end cameras, but the View is easily affordable and feature-packed enough for most homes. The wide-angle lens covers all but the largest rooms, and you, of course, get 1080p video with night vision. The built-in speaker sounds great for two-way audio (though you'll need a premium subscription to use it), and the Emergency Call button in the app immediately calls the local police.
Close Nest competitor: Ring Stick Up Cam
Ring's Stick Up Cam looks almost identical to the Indoor Cam, but the higher price tag comes with a longer feature list. It can be used indoors or outdoors, thanks to the optional rechargeable battery, but can also run off of an outlet, solar power, or PoE. Of course, it still works with Alexa and streams to Alexa-capable smart displays.
A tiny steal: Blink Mini
Blink's first indoor camera has fairly run-of-the-mill specs: wired power, 1080p video, two-way audio, 110º FOV, night vision, and motion alerts at a bargain price. It stands apart with its native Alexa support, letting you play clips or pull up live views of specific cams or turn Minis on and off through voice commands. Blink is offering free cloud video storage through the end of 2020.
The best cheap Nest Cam alternatives
The market for connected security cameras has become saturated over the years, and that means you have a wide selection of cameras to choose from. Most options these days offer features like night vision, two-way audio, customizable motion zones, and smart alerts for triggers like people or certain sounds.
Nest has become one of the leaders in the space thanks to some of its feature-heavy products, but it tends to be on the pricier side. Luckily there are plenty of cheap Nest Cam alternatives available.
If you already own other products from a certain brand, it might be convenient to stick within that brand's ecosystem and keep things centralized to one app. So if you already have a Ring Doorbell, for example, the Ring Indoor Cam is a great buy. For anyone else, the Logitech Circle 2 is an excellent choice. The ability to condense an entire day down to a 30-second time-lapse is hugely convenient. Plus, its combination of water resistance and compatibility with a wide variety of services like Google Assistant and HomeKit makes it one of the best security cameras around — all for less than the Nest Cam Indoor.
If you're looking to buy more than one device, you can go even cheaper than these without reducing the level of performance. Eufy's Indoor Cam 2K Pan & Tilt is one of the few devices to match up with Nest Cam Indoor, offering similar zoom, person/object recognition, and a spinning base at a fourth of Nest's base price. If you want to build the best home security system for a reasonable price, Ring and Eufy cameras are a great place to start.

Place your Arlo camera wherever you want with one of these mounts
We love that there is a great selection of accessories for the Arlo and third parties that are actually useful! You'll find a slew of mounting options, which makes deciding on which are best a little difficult.Keeping your home clean is a lot of work — especially if you're in need of good help. The Roborock S5 MAX Robot Vacuum and Mop was designed to give you the extra help you need and make it easy to ensure your floors are always clean when you come home from work for the day.
This robotic vacuum regularly sells for up to $600, though you can pick one up today for just $439 thanks to an early Prime Day deal at Amazon. That marks the best price ever reached on this model and 20% off the last lowest price it's reached.
Even more early Prime Day deals are live right now at Amazon with the big two-day sale less than a week away!
$110 off
Roborock S5 MAX Robot Vacuum and Mop
The S5 Max uses smart navigation to map your house and plan its own routes to clean, though you can also control it with an app on your phone or with your voice. This model can run for up to 200 minutes of non-stop cleaning and also features a mop.
$439.00
$549.00 $110 off
In our review of the Roborock S5 MAX, the vacuum scored 4.5 out of 5 stars with one of its main detractors being its cost. Now at more than $100 off the cost we reviewed it at, its price isn't as much of a concern.
The Roborock S5 MAX can be controlled using an app on your smartphone and uses smart navigation to map your house, plan routes, and work on a schedule. As long as there are no barriers higher than two centimeters, it can cross over them, clean, and self-recharge. The device is smart enough to avoid falling down the stairs, scratching up your house, and getting stuck. It features 2000Pa strong suction and can switch between several different modes including Carpet, Quiet, Mopping, Balanced, and Turbo & Max.
The Mi Home app lets you control all of the vacuum's more advanced functions, including setting no-go zones, scheduling, spot cleaning, and more. You can also pair it with Amazon Alexa for voice control using a device like the Echo Dot. The vacuum is backed up with a one-year warranty.
Over 650 reviewers at Amazon have left the Roborock S5 MAX with a rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars collectively. It ships for free, though you could receive your order even faster with an Amazon Prime membership. Now's the perfect time to join with Prime Day happening next week!
Now that you've made the decision to add a few smart home products like the Roborock S5 to your home, this guide to the best smart home products under $100 might come in handy.

Nest Hub Max
Biggest of Show
Amazon Echo Show (2nd Gen)
Before you read this, read this
You're here to read a comparison between the Nest Hub Max and the Amazon Echo Show (2nd Gen), which is great. Welcome! But this is an older comparison, written before the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) comes out in late 2020. We're keeping the content untouched because all the information is still valid, but just in case you were looking for something a bit more relevant, we have a thorough comparison of the Nest Hub Max vs. the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) that may be perfect for you.
Nest Hub Max vs. Amazon Echo Show: What the specs say
If you're in the market for a large smart screen device, then you've probably been comparing the Nest Hub Max vs. the Amazon Echo Show. Assuming that you have the counter space for one of these behemoths, you'll want to think about which ecosystem your existing devices are compatible with, which smart assistant you prefer, and what your aesthetic is. Let's dive into the specs a bit before we weigh the pros and cons of Nest versus Echo.
|Nest Hub Max||Amazon Echo Show (2nd Gen)|
|Price||$230||$230|
|Smart Assistant||Google Assistant||Alexa|
|Screen||10" touchscreen||10.1" touchscreen|
|Speakers||2 x .7" 10W tweeters, 1 x 2.95" 30W woofer||2 x 2.2" at 10W per channel|
|Size||9.85" x 7.19" x 3.99"||9.7" x 6.9" x 4.2"|
|Weight||2.91 lbs||3.89 lbs|
|Smart Home Integration||Works with Google Assistant program||Zigbee hub and Amazon Certified for Humans program|
|Camera||6.5MP||5MP|
|Camera Controls||Physical mic and camera cover switch||Electronic mic and camera button|
|WiFi||802.11 b/g/n/ac||802.11 a/b/g/n/ac|
|Bluetooth||5.0||A2DP support|
Nest Hub Max: The good and bad
Google saw how much its users loved the Nest Hub and the success of Amazon's Echo Show line and decided the natural evolution of the Nest Hub product was to kick it up a notch. As editor Russell Holly said in his review of the Nest Hub Max, it took everything good about the smaller version and just made it bigger.
In addition to a bigger screen and better speakers, Google added some nifty software enhancements and integrations. The Face Match feature allows the device to recognize individual users and display notifications and updates relevant to them. This feature has to be enabled but is great for multi-user households. The Nest Hub was already a great Google Photos live picture frame, and the bigger screen only enhances that use case.
The Nest Hub Max functions as a great smart home controller, but it can also work as a Nest Cam. If you have a Nest Aware subscription, you can enable continuous video recording, familiar face alerts, and other nifty Nest features. Our Modern Dad Phil Nickinson commented in his review that this may not be the killer feature that Google makes it out to be. Still, if you're already a Nest Aware subscriber or are heavily invested in that security ecosystem, it could be a useful addition.
It is great to see that Google has added a physical microphone and camera switch. However, if I may nitpick, I wish you could disable the camera only, rather than both simultaneously. I do this with my Echo Show 5 all the time, so I can still bark orders to Alexa without worrying about the camera being on.
Many already prefer Google Assistant over Alexa because they find more utility from the service. With the ability to plug into all of the great Google apps and services, those people will be much happier with the Nest Hub Max than with a competing smart screen device.
Amazon Echo Show (2nd Gen): The good and bad
As with the original Echo smart speaker, the original Echo Show essentially pioneered a new smart device form factor. Last updated in the fall of 2018, the Echo Show (2nd Gen) continued iterating on this successful model, eventually paving the way to an entire class of screened Echo devices like the Show 5 and Show 8 (and don't forget about the Echo Spot!).
This iteration is a year old now, but it still has a lot going for it. The design still looks modern and fresh and is in keeping with the rest of Amazon's product line, and its speakers and screen are on par with other devices in its class. It has a built-in Zigbee smart home hub, which, when paired with Amazon's new Certified for Humans program means that almost any smart device that you can imagine can easily be paired with the Echo Show (2nd Gen). And the giant 10.1-inch touchscreen makes an excellent portal for viewing Blink smart camera, or Ring doorbell video feeds, or adjusting your Privacy Hub settings.
Where the Echo Show (2nd Gen) starts to fall in this comparison is in the differences a year of spec updates can make. Unlike the Nest Hub Max or the smaller Echo Show devices, this product does not have physical controls to cover/disable the device's microphone or camera. While its speakers sound pretty good, it doesn't have the deeper base sound that the Nest Hub Max has, thanks to its woofer. The camera is not quite as good as Google's, and it also weighs almost a full pound more.
Nest Hub Max vs. Amazon Echo Show: So what's the better bigger screen?
I love what Amazon is doing with the Alexa-enabled speakers in its Echo Show line, notably the Echo Show 5 and Echo Show 8 devices. However, I think that in this head-to-head showdown, the Nest Hub Max is the clear winner. It has a year-long lead in terms of hardware upgrades, and Google has baked in some pretty nifty new software features to make this worthy of your consideration. The Face Match feature is particularly useful for a multi-user household. It allows the device to serve as a portal to view and control your smart home devices and serve as a smart camera itself is cool.
If you are happily ensconced in the Amazon ecosystem, the Echo Show (2nd Gen) is still a great choice. There are so many devices and services that integrate seamlessly with Alexa that controlling your smart home is a breeze. You can also pair multiple Echo devices and smart speakers together for an in-house intercom system or multi-room speaker setup, which is pretty handy! However, there are newer devices on the market.

Amazon Echo accessories to make Alexa even better
No matter which Amazon Echo devices you own, there are plenty of helpful accessories to enhance your Alexa experience.Best Oculus Quest 2, Oculus Quest Battery Pack Android Central 2020
A fully charged Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2 will give you about 2-3 hours of battery life, depending on the VR experience you're using. For some players, that's not nearly long enough for a good gaming session in something like Rec Room or Vader Immortal III, or for an extended media session in an app like Netflix. Battery packs are some of the best Oculus Quest accessories and can double, or even triple, the battery life of your headset.
- Go for the combo: Quest 2 Elite Strap with Battery and Carrying Case
- Big and beefy: Anker PowerCore 10000
- Versatile and powerful: AUKEY Power Delivery Power Bank
- Lightweight: ZMI PowerPack 10k
- Powerhouse: Anker PowerCore 20100mAh
- Budget charging: Omars 5000mAh Power Bank
Go for the combo: Quest 2 Elite Strap with Battery and Carrying Case
This bundle is the only way you can get a Quest 2 Elite Strap that has a battery built in. The extra battery doubles the battery life of the Oculus Quest 2, according to Facebook. Just make sure you only grab one if you have an Oculus Quest 2, since it doesn't work with the original Oculus Quest.
Big and beefy: Anker PowerCore 10000
The Anker PowerCore 10000 offers a lot of reliability and power and is a popular favorite for powering mobile devices. It's high-speed and compact, so it's perfect for charing your Oculus Quest. The Anker PowerCore 10000 comes in cool colors and has an 18-month warranty.
Versatile and powerful: AUKEY Power Delivery Power Bank
The AUKEY Power Delivery Power Bank provides the most versatile charge. It supports both USB-C for input and output, so you can even recharge it with your Quest's standard charging cable. With multiple charging ports, you can also use it to charge other devices, such as your phone, Nintendo Switch, or a tablet, all while charging your Quest.
Lightweight: ZMI PowerPack 10k
The ZMI PowerPack 10k provides all the power you need to keep your VR session going. It's small and lightweight, and the anti-slip design ensures that your pack stays in place while you play. You can also attach the battery to the back part of your Quest using velcro tape.
Powerhouse: Anker PowerCore 20100mAh
The Anker PowerCore 20100mAh is essentially a larger, more powerful version of the PowerCore 10000. It is a bit more expensive and is bulkier, but will last much longer than its little sibling. It comes in great colors and can hold a charge for weeks.
Budget charging: Omars 5000mAh Power Bank
This battery pack may not extend your session as much as the other packs on this list, but the device is basic and portable. This is perfect if you just need to extend your play a little bit and don't want to break the bank. Its slim design makes it perfect for stashing in a pocket while playing VR.
Best Oculus Quest 2 and Oculus Quest battery packs
The most important thing when choosing an external battery pack for the Quest or Oculus Quest 2 is that it must support 5V 2.4amp charging. There are many batteries on the market that have those stats, but there are many other things to consider, such as size and how long they will hold a charge.
Any of these power banks will let you stay in VR longer. Depending on your needs, some banks may be more suitable than others. We recommend the Quest 2 Elite Strap with Battery as the best battery pack for the Quest 2. It adds a comfortable strap to your Oculus Quest 2 and comes with a carrying case.
If you have an original Oculus Quest 2 or prefer to grab a more traditional battery pack, you can grab the Anker PowerCore 10000. It keeps charging simple, provides more than enough power to add several hours to your session, and recharges quickly.

How to get skills like John Wick in time for the Pistol Whip tournamentWhen Google announced the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G, it didn't just launch two phones with impressive cameras; it introduced new Google Photos editing features as well. Improvements to machine learning, artificial intelligence, and user interface mean that users will now be able to do more with light and portrait mode after a photo is taken. They will also have more granular manual controls. We'll show you where to find these features in the Google Photos app, and how you can use them to make your pictures even better.
Products used in this guide
- New flagship: Google Pixel 5 ($699 at Amazon)
- Penultimate Pixel: Google Pixel 4a 5G ($499 at the Google Store)
How to use the new Google Photos editing features: Manual controls
Once you receive the Google Photos app update, editing your photos (whether you just took them or they are already in your archive) is easier than ever. All you need to do is tap on the photo that you want to edit, and you will see quick access to manual editing modes like brightness, contrast, saturation, tint, and warmth. Tapping into each setting presents a slider that allows you to make precisely the kind of granular edits that you want to make your photos just right.
- Open the Google Photos app.
- Tap on any photo.
Tap on the editing tool at the bottom of the screen (looks like three lines with slots in them).
- Scroll sideways through the different editing modes such as Crop, Adjust, and Filters.
- Tap on one of the editing modes like Adjust.
Scroll through the controls above such as Brightness, Contrast, White Point, Highlights, Shadows, Black Point, Saturation, Warmth, Tint, Skin tone, Blue tone, Pop, and Vignette.
- Tap on one of the editing modes like Brightness.
- Move the slider to adjust to your taste and tap Done.
- Choose another mode to adjust and repeat the process.
Tap Save.
Android users should expect to see these updates rolling out right now. There is no word on when the features will land on iOS.
How to use the new Google Photos editing features: Portrait lighting effects
This new editing mode might just be the most exciting one announced by Google. With the help of Google's advanced AI and machine learning, Google Photos users can make remarkable adjustments with lighting and portrait effects after the shot has been captured. As with the other manual controls mentioned above, portrait lighting will be easily accessible in the editing menu, with granular slider controls and gestures that allow you to tap on the photo and apply just the right degree of background blur around your subject. These features will work regardless of whether you first took the photo in portrait mode or not.
As you can see from the first two images of me, as soon as you take a selfie or image capture, Google Photos will ask if you want to try Portrait mode. If you tap that, you will get some quick toggles to enhance your portrait or change it to a black and white image or introduce a pop of color.
However, if you want to adjust portrait lighting effects after a shot has been captured, here's what you do.
- Select a portrait photo.
- Tap on the editing tool at the bottom of the screen (looks like three lines with slots in them).
- Scroll through the ediing modes, and tap on Adjust.
Tap on Portrait light.
- Use the slider at the bottom to select the optimal portrait lighting level, or tap auto.
- Use your finger to slide the circle around your face to see where you want the lighting effect to be.
- Tap Done.
Tap Save Copy.
The portrait lighting feature first debuted with the announcement of the Google Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a XL, but has already started rolling out to older Pixel models, like my Pixel 4a.
Other new Google Photos editing features: AI suggestions
One of the best upgrades to the Google Photos app is something that you don't technically need to search for or implement, and that is Google's improved AI suggestions feature. Google Photos has already offered users tips on fixing lighting or creating animations, but those were inconsistent at best. Now, the app will more consistently surface suggestions that the AI thinks will improve your photos, which you can accept, reject, or accept and tweak further in the manual editing controls.
- Open the Google Photos app.
- Tap on any photo.
- Tap on the editing tool at the bottom of the screen (looks like three lines with slots in them).
You should now see the editing tools slider at the bottom of the screen, with some AI suggestions above it that include Enhance, Warm, and Cool. Tap on one of these options, such as Enchance.
- Google Photos AI will auto-magically apply what it thinks are the right lighting and coloring filters to make your image look better.
- If you like what you see, tap Save. If not, continue experimenting with the Warm and Cool buttons, or try the more granular manual controls that we covered earlier in this article.
Google has said that new AI suggestions will first come to Pixel phones and that it will introduce more kinds of suggestions over the course of the year during quarterly Pixel feature drops.
Our top equipment picks

Virtual Desktop is now testing a new alpha build featuring Oculus Quest 2 compatibility, with upgrades specifically geared towards the Oculus Quest 2's ability to run games at a higher 90Hz refresh rate. That's an 18Hz refresh rate improvement over the original Oculus Quest, and it makes games feel even more buttery smooth than before.
In addition to that, the Oculus Quest 2 supports Wi-Fi 6 routers with higher data transfer rates and lower latency, making your wireless PC VR games higher resolution, crisper, and more responsive than ever. I was able to test out the new version of Virtual Desktop on our Oculus Quest 2 review unit and found the experience to be significantly enhanced when compared to the existing Oculus Quest version. Games like Beat Saber, which require fast response times and on-rhythm beat slices, can now be played wirelessly on Wi-Fi 6 thanks to Virtual Desktop.
Installing Virtual Desktop is mostly straightforward, although you'll have to register for a free Oculus developer account to get started. Virtual Desktop quickly became the method of choice for streaming PC VR games to the Oculus Quest via Wi-Fi connection when it launched the feature last year. Oculus famously forced Virtual Desktop developer Guy Godin to roll back the ability for users to stream PC VR games to their Oculus Quest, so you'll have to sideload the app to your Quest if you want to try it out.
While we've not been given an official release date for the new version of Virtual Desktop, it's expected that it'll be available sometime after the Oculus Quest 2 officially debuts on October 13.

New phones are listing 5G as a major feature, and the carriers love to tell you that they have the best 5G, but what does 5G actually mean to an average customer? For now, 5G means that if you live in just the right area and have just the right phone or hotspot, you can get a faster and more reliable phone connection that won't bog down when the network is congested. Beyond that, it gets a bit more complicated.
More data demand than ever
5G is spreading fast, and for many people, it's not quite what they expected. 5G refers to 5G NR (New Radio), which contains many different technologies with different implementations. What a 5G connection actually means to the consumer varies significantly between carriers, but one thing it has in common across the board is the promise for better speed and capacity.

Technically speaking, 5G is the next generation of mobile broadband connections. For now, 5G mostly compliments the 4G LTE network adding extra capacity in areas that need it most. There are three main categories of 5G, and they are based on the frequency being used. These connections are low-band, mid-band, and mmWave (millimeter wave). Collectively low-band and mid-band 5G is referred to as sub-6, indicating that it is below 6GHz.
With any type of 5G connection, you'll see fast network speeds, but the most noticeable change will come from high-frequency mmWave. These mmWave networks have great speeds, but the coverage is very limited. Sub-6 has much greater coverage, similar to LTE, but speeds are more in line with the best of 4G technology.
All of the major carriers are looking towards a combination of these different 5G categories to build out a complete network depending on the density and geographic challenges in each area.
These are the best 5G plans available
Release 16
3GPP is an organization that establishes telecommunications standards. With 5G Release 16, the 5G standard is opened up a lot more for further development. As noted by Light Reading, there are nine major areas that get addressed starting with 5G in unlicensed spectrum. This is essentially the ability to use additional spectrum that isn't licensed to anyone, and depending on the area can significantly improve bandwidth. Some 4G networks, such as AT&T's LTE network, already use similar tech.
Beyond that, Release 16 has Network Slicing allowing for different parameters to be set for different customers and devices such as a connected car. Positioning information is improved so indoors, a device's position can be determined within 3 meters and within 10 meters outdoors. Additionally, better communication for Vehicles which could be a big step for driverless vehicles.
Better management can improve battery life on connected devices as well. Latency is also improved with eURLLC, or Enhanced ultra-reliable, low-latency communication. There is improved support for private networks for a company or organization that may need it. Integrated Access Backhaul (IAB) will allow 5G cell sites to connect wirelessly, lowering deployment costs. Finally, IoT services can be built into 5G networks if the need grows.
5G SA
5G SA is short for 5G standalone. As the name implies, this type of 5G network can exist and operate on its own without a legacy network supporting it. T-Mobile and Verizon are launching 5G SA in 2020, or at least will start to. In May 2020, T-Mobile took some big steps in testing a 5G SA network with a series of tests including voice and video calls over 5G NR.
Calling over 5G is an important step for 5G, so phones won't need to rely on 3G or 4G towers. This will also be good for saving battery life since phones won't need to keep switching between networks to make and receive calls.
For now, you won't see 5G SA service on any network, but by the end of the year, it should be more common. If everything goes to plan, you shouldn't notice anything.
All about the frequency
T-Mobile deployed a low-band 5G network on its 600Mhz spectrum on many of its towers. Since this frequency is suitable for coverage, T-Mobile was able to leap ahead in 5G coverage without building many new towers. It just had to upgrade the equipment and make sure the towers had a strong fiber backhaul to supply a connection.
That doesn't mean T-Mobile is solely relying on this slower low-band 5G; it also has a limited mmWave network in a few cities. Beyond that, it is adding speed and capacity to its sub-6 network thanks to the 2.5GHz spectrum it got from Sprint. This did mean the end of Sprint's 5G network with only Sprint Galaxy S20 users getting an update to support T-Mobile's 5G network.
5G on T-Mobile & Sprint: Everything you need to know
AT&T's 5G network started on mmWave and got off to a solid start with more than 30 cities getting some amount of coverage. The real gains for AT&T came when it began deploying 5G on its 850MHz sub-6 spectrum. While the speeds weren't too impressive compared to fast LTE results, the rapid growth has been good for early adopters of 5G devices.
AT&T was the first carrier to deploy 5G with DSS or dynamic spectrum sharing. This technology allows the tower equipment to allocate spectrum from 4G to 5G automatically based on load. This technology will likely prove to be key to a smooth transition to 5G.
5G on AT&T: Everything you need to know
Of course, this lower-frequency spectrum isn't available in the vast chunks that higher bands are, so speeds aren't as big of an upgrade over 4G. However, when it comes to building a complete 5G network, this low-band connection is great for filling in the gaps. The FCC is also working on freeing up some 3.5GHz spectrum for 5G deployment.
So far, Verizon has stuck to building 5G with a millimeter-wave spectrum. Verizon calls this network Ultra Wideband thanks to its ability to deliver speeds above 1Gbps. While these speeds are extremely impressive, it doesn't mean much for the vast majority of Americans without coverage. Verizon made solid progress on this network with coverage in parts of 35 markets, and it's no secret that the Ultra Wideband network isn't a good choice for the whole Verizon network.
5G on Verizon: Everything you need to know
Faster connections usually don't have much range.
Your home Wi-Fi router is a great example of how this works. 802.11a/b/g 2.4GHz networks use narrow 20MHz channels to transmit and receive data. 802.11n 5GHz networks use 40MHz wide channels, and 802.11ac 5GHz networks can use 80MHz wide channels. When you're connected to your router with a 2.4GHz connection on a much narrower channel, the speeds are slower than when connecting at 5GHz when you're nearby but stay reasonably consistent as you move further away. 5GHz connections, especially 802.11ac connections, have a much more limited range because the signal strength drops off quickly and is more susceptible to interference.
Which phones support 5G?
A lot of early 5G phones, especially those from Sprint, are nearly useless to most of us right now. While a modern device like the Galaxy S20 5G can connect to both T-Mobile and AT&T's sub-6 networks, earlier phones could only connect to very specific bands. Verizon's is the only carrier that hasn't yet started on a sub-6 5G network preferring to stretch out its LTE a while longer. That means that all Verizon 5G phones work with the current network.
T-Mobile's acquisition of Sprint led to the end of Sprint's 2.5GHz 5G network with T-Mobile moving to include Sprint's assets in its own network. What this means is that only the Galaxy S20 5G phone on Sprint can access 5G. This is a real bummer for early adopters with phones like the Galaxy S10 5G or the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G.
All AT&T 5G phones work with sub-6 5G, excluding the Galaxy S10 5G. It's also worth noting that AT&T has updated some of it's LTE phones to say 5GE in the status bar while connected to 4G LTE. This is purely marketing and isn't real 5G at all.
Best 5G Phones in 2020
When can I get 5G?
Of course, what all that really means is that you will need new devices to see any sort of 5G network for yourself. Besides having a compatible phone, you'll just need to wait for your area to be covered by 5G. You can check to see if your city has coverage to know for sure. Even then, cities with coverage will still have pockets where only 4G LTE is available.
We've also seen a few mobile hotspots that can leverage these new 5G networks by Netgear and others. This drives home one very important 5G feature that doesn't get enough attention — it can compete with wired broadband internet. Verizon actually started offering home internet service with its 5G network and T-Mobile has committed to using its network to expand broadband to rural areas.
Here's every U.S. city with 5G coverage right now
What this all means right now
The sheer amount of data that can be transferred at high speeds means that 5G will be able to do a lot more than bring fast downloads to your phone. Many people will be able to use the currently available sub-6 5G connections like a robust LTE connection, but the future is much brighter with a combined network with multiple bands of 5G available.
5G speeds will stay higher than LTE even with a lot of connections, and it will be easier than ever to deliver high-speed internet to people, even when they are in an older building that hasn't been upgraded for fiber. For now, 5G is like slightly faster LTE, but as the infrastructure gets built, more applications will be able to take advantage of the improved connectivity.

It all started in February with the release of the RAZR, and while there was a lot of excitement for Motorola's first-ever foldable, a myriad of issues held it back from true greatness. April gave us the Edge+, which marked the first traditional flagship from Motorola in far too long. The Edge+ did a lot of things right, but with a $1000 price tag and exclusivity to Verizon in the U.S., its appeal was inherently limited. Fast forward a few more months to July, and we're treated to the regular Motorola Edge.
As the name suggests, the Edge is a stripped-down version of its Edge+ sibling. Its specs aren't quite as impressive from a technical perspective, but Motorola says it still delivers a flagship experience for $300 less with much broader availability. That's a bold claim and one that sounds too good to be true, but as fate would have it, the Motorola Edge pulls it off beautifully — for the most part.
At a glance
Motorola Edge
Bottom line: As a "value flagship," the Motorola Edge strives to deliver a flagship-like experience for considerably less money than its top-of-the-line Edge+ counterpart. For the most part, it succeeds with flying colors. The Motorola Edge has a gorgeous display, super-premium hardware, and performance and battery life that are every bit as good as much more expensive alternatives. Minus some disappointing camera performance and mixed feelings around its curved screen, the Motorola Edge is a stellar phone that's definitely worth your attention.
Pros
- Absolutely gorgeous hardware
- 90Hz AMOLED display
- Long-lasting battery life
- Clean, intuitive software
- Headphone jack + expandable storage
- Compatible with all U.S. carriers
Cons
- Curved display can be annoying
- Mediocre cameras
- No wireless charging
- Only promised one software update
FYI — the Motorola Edge is currently on sale for just $500. It's a limited-time discount and won't be around for long, but it makes the Edge even more compelling than at its $700 retail price. If you're at all interested in the phone, now is definitely the time to buy.
Motorola Edge Design & display
The Motorola Edge gets its name from its display, so let's go ahead and start the review there. We're treated to a 6.7-inch OLED display, featuring a Full HD+ 2340 x 1080 resolution, 90Hz refresh rate, and a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. In most regards, this is a killer screen. It's incredibly crisp, has super vibrant colors, and gets bright enough for easy use outdoors with a lot of sunlight. No matter who you are, I think you'll be hard-pressed to complain about how any of this panel looks.
90Hz refresh rates are quickly becoming more and more common on Android phones, and I'm thrilled that Motorola included it here. As with other 90Hz panels, this allows everything on the Edge to move with more fluidity and smoothness compared to phones with traditional 60Hz displays. Motorola has the refresh rate set to Auto by default, which automatically switches between 90 and 60Hz depending on what you're doing — allowing everything to look great while saving some battery life. You can switch to a forced 90Hz or 60Hz setting if you want, but in my testing, the Auto mode worked perfectly.
All of these aspects of the Motorola Edge's display are excellent, but none of them are the reason it's called the "Edge." As you've seen by now, the Edge's display curves drastically over the sides, giving off the appearance that the screen flows over with no bezel whatsoever. Aesthetically, it's stunning. Holding the Motorola Edge feels like you're just holding a screen and nothing more, and the edges create for a seriously immersive experience whether you're playing games, watching a movie, or just scrolling through Twitter.
Unfortunately, as good as the curved edges look, all they do is create usability issues rather than contribute anything meaningful to the phone.
The curved display is stunning, but it comes with a few usability quirks.
The biggest fault of the curves is that Motorola's palm rejection isn't quite as good as it should be. With a display like this, your fingers and palms are constantly touching the edges of the screen that would otherwise be bezel. Because of this, software is in place to reject these touches so things don't go haywire. It works about 90% of the time, but for the 10% where it doesn't work, it's incredibly annoying. I've had YouTube videos fast forward and close, apps unintentionally scroll, and emails open that I didn't want to — all because the phone got confused by where I was touching the display. Motorola does allow you to disable the edge display for as many or as few apps that you want, but there's no way to disable it when you're on the home screen, app drawer, settings, or multi-tasking menu. So, to some degree, those curved edges are always there.
Along with making your phone more immersive, Motorola also includes an "Edge touch" feature that allows you to perform various gestures with a small action bar that you can position anywhere on the left or right edge. It can be used to bring down your notification panel and Quick Settings, your multi-tasking and app drawer, a side menu for app shortcuts, and to quickly disable/enable the edge screen in whatever app you're currently in.
I really appreciate that Motorola tries giving the curved edges added functionality rather than being nothing but eye-candy, but this whole system is pretty hit-or-miss. Sometimes, Edge touch recognizes my touch and does what I want it to do. Other times, I find myself doing the same gesture over and over and wasting a lot of time in the process. It's a good idea, but similar to the palm rejection, needs a bit more time in the oven.
There's also a small annoyance with viewing the Motorola Edge from different angles. If you look at it from a left or right axis, the edges appear noticeably brighter than the main screen. Even if you're viewing the phone head-on, apps with a white background have noticeable shadows on the left and right where the edges begin. It's not deal-breaking, but it certainly takes some getting used to.
All of this is to say that the curved edges, while beautiful, don't have many purposes outside of that. I appreciate how futuristic they make the phone look, but at the end of the day, I think I'd rather just be able to comfortably hold the Motorola Edge without worrying about it doing something I don't want it to.
Outside of the display, the rest of the Motorola Edge's hardware is outstanding. The plastic construction feels surprisingly great, the physical buttons are clicky, haptic feedback is good, the dual speakers get insanely loud, and there's a 3.5mm headphone jack if you're still a proponent of wired audio gear. Heck, even the in-screen fingerprint sensor works better than I was expecting it to.
The Motorola Edge is only available in a Solar Black color, but it has a very distinct blue hue to it. Also, depending on how light hits it, you'll see rainbow patterns every now and then. It's very good-looking, but boy oh boy does it pick up a lot of fingerprints 😅.
Motorola Edge Performance & battery
Given that the Motorola Edge is a cheaper version of the Edge+, you'd probably expect its performance and battery life to take a hit for the worse. Thankfully, these two areas are some of the Edge's greatest strengths.
Powering the phone is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 processor, which is essentially an underclocked version of the Snapdragon 865 that we see in phones like the Galaxy S20, OnePlus 8, and the Edge+. This is my first time using the 765 in a phone, and to me, it's every bit as fast as those higher-end devices.
Whether I'm opening apps, browsing the web, or playing a graphically intense game like Call of Duty: Mobile, everything flies like butter on the Motorola Edge. Not once have I encountered any noticeable slow-down or hiccups, and while part of this is helped by the Edge's clean software and 90Hz display, it's a testament to just how good the 765 really is. It may not be as technically impressive as the flagship 865, but as far as I'm concerned, this is true flagship performance.
Aiding the Motorola Edge's snappiness is 6GB of RAM for smooth multi-tasking, along with a generous 256GB of storage for all of your digital files. If for some reason that's not enough space, you can further expand it with a microSD card.
Having such smooth performance makes the Motorola Edge extremely enjoyable to use, and thankfully, you can use it for long stretches of time without having to worry about how much battery is left. The phone comes equipped with a large 4,500 mAh battery, which in my testing, proved to be more than enough juice for a full day even with heavy usage.
Depending on your use, the Motorola Edge can be a two-day phone.
The lowest I was able to get the Edge's battery was to 20%, and that was after over 17 hours of being on and more than 5 hours of screen-on-time. That included almost an hour and a half of YouTube, lots of scrolling through Twitter, streaming Spotify through my car's Bluetooth system, and managing some weekend email. That's also while pulling in T-Mobile's 5G network, not using dark mode until late in the night, and having the screen brightness up quite high throughout the day.
On another day with lighter use, I still had 52% remaining after about 14 hours of use and well over 3 hours of screen-on-time. When I was using the phone, I was mostly on Twitter, Chrome, streaming Spotify, and playing a few rounds of Tetris. In other words, if you aren't constantly on your phone, you can easily get through two days on a single charge without it being that big of a stretch.
As much as I love how long the Motorola Edge's battery lasts, I'm not overly thrilled with how it charges. Motorola includes its TurboPower USB-C charger in the box (I guess that's something we have to start saying in reviews), and while that's great, it only offers a max charge speed of 15W. That's fine, but it pales in comparison to the 30W charging on the OnePlus 8 and up to 45W charging you can get with the Galaxy S20. Even more annoying is the lack of any wireless charging, which is something I would have really liked to see considering the Edge's high-ish price.
Motorola Edge Cameras
If there's one area that Motorola has often struggled with, it's camera quality. Up until recently, the company's focus on lower-end devices hasn't allowed it to really grow and evolve in this department. That changed with the Motorola Edge+, which we hailed as having the best camera package of any Motorola phone to-date. I wasn't sure what to expect going into the Motorola Edge, and after my testing, I came away with mixed feelings.
On the technical side of things, the Motorola Edge is packing a 64MP primary camera, 16MP ultra-wide/macro camera, 8MP telephoto camera, and a time-of-flight sensor. That 64MP sensor is what you'll be using the majority of the time, but you're actually shooting 16MP images thanks to Motorola's Quad Pixel pixel binning technology.
Given how good the Edge+'s camera is, I came away pretty disappointed with the Edge's camera performance. Some pictures come out with good detail, colors, and exposure, but as soon as you start introducing challenging shooting conditions, the Motorola Edge struggles to find its footing. The Edge has a tendency of blowing out highlights in the background, images tend to look softer than I'd like, and I've noticed that the Edge does a poor job of handling the edges of a subject you're trying to photograph.
A great example of this is the picture of me holding the Sam Adams bottle. If you look at the edge of my thumb, there's a weird halo effect around it. I took this picture twice, and in both shots, that halo is present. You can also see this in the picture of the black-eyed Susan (the yellow flower with the dark center). If you look at some of the leaves surrounding the flowers, it looks like they're outlined by a weird white light. Combine that with the Edge turning the background of a close-up shot into a water-colored mess, and there's a lot working against you.
The ultra-wide camera is pretty good, and while there's a drop in overall detail, it retains the same color profile and overall look of the primary camera (something I can't say about ultra-wide sensors in Motorola's cheaper phones). The macro images taken with the same sensor are fun to mess around with, but once again, details are a bit soft for my liking. The 2x telephoto camera is also fine, allowing you to get slightly closer to your subjects with decent results.
Lastly, there's the 25MP selfie camera. Pictures look okay at first glance, but along with being softer than I had expected, there's a very noticeable warm hue to every picture taken with it. My wife and I both played around with it, and each time, selfies came out much warmer than they should. Especially in the photo of me, it almost looks like I have red hair (which I most certainly don't).
Here's the thing. If all you're doing is taking pictures to share on Twitter and Instagram, the Motorola Edge is probably fine. This certainly isn't the worst camera Motorola has ever put on a phone, but given how much of an improvement the Edge+ was, I was expecting a bit more. This is clearly an area in which Motorola made some cuts to hit the price that it did, and that's all there is to it.
Motorola Edge Software
Whenever I get to use a Motorola phone, one of my favorite things about it is the software. We talk a lot about OxygenOS and One UI here on Android Central, but personally, I think Motorola's take on Android is among the best.
The Motorola Edge ships with Android 10, and visually, it's nearly identical to what you'd find on a Google Pixel. This means the entire user interface is clean, simple, and easy to navigate. Motorola nails the Pixel look and feel just as good as Google does, but where things get really interesting is with Motorola's custom software goodies.
Take a quick journey into the pre-installed Moto app, and you'll find a plethora of features that take the stock Android experience and elevate it to another level. You can chop the phone to enable the flashlight and twist it to open the camera, there are Moto Gametime settings which help silence notifications when you're in the middle of a game, and the eminent Moto Display — aka the best always-on display the Android landscape has to offer. These are features that have all existed in prior Moto phones, but that doesn't make them any less special. Just about all of them make Android better in some way, and the fact that Motorola keeps everything neatly organized in its app makes their presence feel welcome and not forced.
But, of course, there's a catch to all of this. Motorola has long struggled with supporting its phones beyond their release, typically only offering one major software update and nothing beyond that. This is what the company tried to do with the Edge+, but following instant user backlash, it reverted course and gave a new promise for at least two updates for the phone.
I was hoping Motorola had learned from that whole experience, but it turns out that isn't the case. The Motorola Edge is promised just one software update (taking it from Android 10 to Android 11), and while Motorola will evaluate future updates beyond that, nothing is guaranteed. Given the company's track record in this department, I wouldn't hold my breath.
This continued resilience to long-term update support sticks out as my biggest gripe with Motorola, and I desperately hope the company changes course sooner rather than later. Android updates may not be as critical in 2020 as they were a few short years ago, but the fact remains that one year of support doesn't cut it for a $700 smartphone.
Motorola Edge Competition
Looking at phones that the Motorola Edge is competing with, the most obvious contender is the OnePlus 8. The OnePlus 8 has the exact same retail price as the Edge, yet it offers better cameras, a more capable Snapdragon 865 processor, extra RAM, a larger battery with faster charging speeds, and less intense curves for the edges of the display. It doesn't have a headphone jack, expandable storage, or Motorola's software goodies, though, meaning it ultimately comes down to personal preference.
You may also want to consider the Pixel 4 XL. The phone has come down in price since it first launched back in October 2019, and while battery life isn't nearly as good as what you get on the Motorola Edge, there's still a lot going for it. The cameras are among the best currently available, the 90Hz AMOLED display is a joy to use, and you're promised major software updates + monthly security patches through October 2022.
Ultimately, there aren't a lot of phones that compete directly with the Motorola Edge's price tag. There are your $1000 flagships, and if you don't want any of those, a lot of options start coming in at $400 and below. This middle-ground that phones like the Edge and OnePlus 8 are carving out is still relatively new, but it's certainly going to keep growing.
Motorola Edge Should you buy it?
Who it's for
- If you want a flagship phone for considerably less money.
- If you value having a high-quality display.
- If you need dependable battery life.
- If you like your software to be clean and filled with useful features.
- If you still use a headphone jack.
Who it isn't for
- If you want a top-notch camera system.
- If you rely on wireless charging.
- If you value long-term software updates.
I've reviewed three different Motorola phones in 2020, and they've all ranged in price from $150 to $250 at the high-end. I've been quite pleased with what Motorola can do with its budget handsets, so I was immensely excited to finally spend some quality time with one of its premium options. For the most part, I'm coming away from this Edge review very satisfied.
What's so special about the Motorola Edge is that it shares a tremendous amount of DNA with the top-of-the-line Edge+. It has the same incredible display, performance is every bit as good, the battery lasts forever, and the software experience is among the best available. The fact that you're getting all of that for just $700 with the option to use the phone on any carrier is the cherry on top that seals the deal. Sure, you'll get better cameras and wireless charging with the $1000 Edge+, but it costs a lot more money and is still hampered by that annoying Verizon deal. When you take everything about the phones into consideration, I think it's easy to see that the regular Edge stands out as the best phone Motorola has released this year.
Flaws and all, the Motorola Edge is one of my favorite phones of the year.
There are things about the phone that annoy me, but I keep coming back to something Daniel mentioned in his Edge+ review — simply put, the Motorola Edge is a lot of fun to use. Yes, the curved screen has its faults, but I regularly find myself in awe of how darn good it looks. Motorola's weak update policy grinds my gears, but the out-of-the-box software that's available right now is virtually perfect. I've been a Motorola fan for a long time, and while the Edge is a very different device from the days of the 2013 and 2014 Moto X phones, part of that spirit feels like it's reignited with the Edge.
It recaptures the whole notion of being an Android phone that's enjoyable to use in just about every regard, all while getting a price that undercuts a lot of the competition. There are a couple of cutbacks that come with that process, but it's not enough to take away from all of the things the Motorola Edge does right.
I'll leave you with this. I get sent a lot of phones and other gadgets to review, and the Motorola Edge is the first one in a long time that I've dreaded having to send back. If you can stop number-crunching for a second and give the phone a shot, I think you'll come away rather impressed.
FYI — the Motorola Edge is currently on sale for just $500. It's a limited-time discount and won't be around for long, but it makes the Edge even more compelling than at its $700 retail price. If you're at all interested in the phone, now is definitely the time to buy.
Mesmerizing Moto
Motorola Edge
An excellent entry in the value flagship market
The Motorola Edge may stumble a bit with its cameras and curved design, but overall, the phone gets more right than wrong. It's built incredibly well, has a killer screen, nimble performance, and a battery that always has your back. Combine that with a solid price and compatibility for all carriers, and the Edge proves to be the sleeper hit of 2020.

Because it doesn't require a PC or phone, it's easy to grab the Oculus Quest and play it anywhere. I've found myself using my Oculus Quest frequently since it shipped, and I often find myself lost in games, not realizing how long I've been playing. I've never found the Oculus Quest particularly uncomfortable, but it can cause pressure on your cheeks. Its front-heavy design can gradually add discomfort to your face during longer play sessions. The Studioform Creative Quest Deluxe Strap aims to alleviate that discomfort.
The Quest Deluxe Strap adds a padded horizontal strap over the top of your head. It slots under the top of the Quest's head strap and wraps around the side of the Quest's head strap. You can adjust the Studioform Quest Deluxe Strap with velcro to get the perfect fit. When set up correctly, the Quest Deluxe Strap alleviates pressure from your cheeks, redistributes the weight of the Oculus Quest more evenly across your head, and makes the headset feel lighter on your face.

What you'll love about the Quest Deluxe Head Strap
I've never been upset with my Oculus Quest's comfort level, so I wasn't sure how much the Quest Deluxe Head Strap from Studioform Creative would help. To my surprise, it makes a noticeable difference in the comfort of my headset and also helps me play in VR longer.
The design is simple. It's a long rectangle filled with padding. The outside is a soft, slightly ribbed material that is easy to velcro things to. To attach the head strap, you just wrap it around the sides of the Quest's built-in strap and velcro the Quest Deluxe Head Strap into place. You can attach an optional velcro piece to the top of the Quest Deluxe Head Strap to help ensure it fits on your head correctly in the future.
It doesn't feel like much, but the Quest Deluxe really does make being in VR way more comfortable.
When I tightened the head strap for the first time, it instantly pulled pressure off my face and redistributed it across my head. I have a fairly large head, so there's a lot of area to spread the weight across. The fabric on the outside of the head strap is soft, pliable, and adds some cushioning to the top of the headset's strap. It took some time for me to figure out how to get the right fit, but since I figured it out, I've kept the Quest Deluxe Head Strap on my Oculus Quest and will keep it on the device after wrapping up this review.
The Quest Deluxe Head Strap was a pleasant little surprise for me. It makes longer sessions in games more comfortable, which allows me to enjoy more Robo Recall missions or songs in Beat Saber without having to take a break.
What you may dislike about the Quest Deluxe Head Strap
Once I fit the Quest Deluxe Head Strap correctly, it noticeably increased the comfort of my device, but getting the strap to fit correctly took some time. I had to figure out how to make it fit at the correct angle and how to make sure it was snug without being too tight. If you tighten the Quest Deluxe Head Strap too much, it raises the Oculus Quest too high on your head. In an ideal setting, the bottom of the back of the Oculus Quest's built-in strap should fit below the bump on the back of your skull. The Quest Deluxe Head Strap has a bit of width to it, so you need to loosen your Oculus Quest's built-in head strap to get the right fit.
The head strap doesn't have much elasticity, which is good for when it's in use, but makes it a bit difficult to size correctly each time you put it on. I've found that I need to detach the velcro, put on the Oculus Quest with the Quest Deluxe Headstrap loose, and then tighten and velcro the head strap every time I use it. This adds an extra step to putting on my Oculus Quest, but I feel it's worth it.
Should you buy the Quest Deluxe Head Strap?
One mark of a good device or product is that a reviewer would continue to use it after a review is finished. Another is if a reviewer would spend his or her own money to purchase the device. The Studioform Creative Quest Deluxe Head Strap passes both of these tests. I absolutely plan to use this head strap going forward and would pay the $20 price tag for one.
I'm currently testing a wide range of Oculus Quest accessories, so make sure to check back in to see which accessories are worth adding to your Oculus Quest.

As coverage increases battery life will improve and should become better than LTE with chip improvements.
- A powerful phone for Verizon 5G with a 4,500 mAh battery: Samsung Galaxy S10 5G ($1,300 at Verizon)
- A 4,000 mAh phone for Sprint's 5G network from LG: LG V50 ThinQ 5G ($1,152 at Sprint)
No WiMAX repeats
A carrier offers several ways to connect to its network from 5G all the way back to 3G. Constantly switching between them is the thing that really kills battery since running both the 4G and 5G modems simultaneously is less efficient. For that reason, the current crop of 5G capable phones will connect to LTE first and then bump up to 5G if it's available. As an early adopter of Sprint's WiMAX 4G service, I remember the battery nightmares but 5G shouldn't have nearly as many problems as early 4G had.
The technology itself should not reveal much of a difference in battery usage given a consistent signal. It's also worth considering that as chip makers come out with updated modems, we should continue to see improvements. Real world testing is still hard to rely on at this time since the 5G is still in the early stages of deployment on all carriers. Even so, Qualcomm is still improving battery life on its new products thanks to more efficient layouts.
Even better in the future
For the time being, switching between a 5G and 4G signal may use more of your battery than exclusively connecting to 4G. However, once 5G build outs are more complete, 5G should be more efficient. Even though 5G technology is quite new, Qualcomm is already releasing its second generation X55 5G modem with competitors also jumping in. As the modems and chip packages continue to grow more efficient and smaller, user's experiences with 5G should only improve.
Compared to the transition to 4G that many people remember, there shouldn't be much in the way of a noticeable degradation to battery performance in 5G capable phones. In many ways, the modern chip packages on these phones -along with newer large batteries- could lead to increased battery life once 5G service reaches more people with less gaps in between towers.
Verizon 5G
Galaxy S10 5G
Fast, smooth, and cutting edge
One of the most complete flagship phones gets better with 5G and a massive 4,500 mAh battery. With top-of-the-line specs and Verizon's fastest network speeds, the Galaxy S10 5G is great for anyone that needs very best a phone can offer.
Sprint 5G
LG V50 ThinQ 5G
Top speed in a sleek and fast phone
LG continues the trend of offering top-end specs with a big and sharp display and a 4,000 mAh battery in the V50 ThinQ 5G. This phone will provide the fastest speeds you can get on Sprint plenty of power to get things done.

- Steve Aoki's fourth studio album, Neon Future IV, released in April 2020.
- A free live concert is being held on Oculus Venues on September 30 at 6pm ET, featuring music from the latest album.
- Users can feel like they're actually at a concert by using an Oculus Quest to join in VR with other Oculus players, represented by customizable avatars.
A new Steve Aoki concert is happening on September 30, but it's not at your typical type of venue. While 2020 has put a damper on large gatherings like concerts and live music, we can virtually attend concerts through live streams to help get our live music fix. But watching a stream on a TV just isn't quite the same as being there in person. That's why Steve Aoki has partnered up with Facebook to bring his next live concert to a screen way closer to your face — your Oculus Quest.
Jumping into a live concert in VR makes it feel like you're actually there in many ways. That's because special virtual reality cameras are used to give viewers the ability to look all around them at any time, just as you would if you were at an actual concert. Since this is being hosted in Oculus Venues, you'll be joining potentially thousands of users in watching the same concert, with lobbies that you can socialize in before, during, and after the show.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Players are represented by their own customizable Oculus avatar, and the sense of presense with other folks really feels genuine. Check out the video of it in action below if you want to see what it's like before you join.

- Nest Wifi is here, and there are two devices: a router, and a satellite that has a built-in Google Assistant speaker.
- Google is claiming double the speeds as Google Wifi, with 25% better coverage.
- Pre-orders go live later today, with a two-pack retailing for $269 and a three-pack with two satellites for $349.
Google debuted its first mesh Wi-Fi router back in 2016, and the search giant has revealed that Google Wifi is the best-selling mesh router system in the U.S. and Canada. Google is now rolling out an updated variant dubbed Nest Wifi that brings considerable upgrades.
The Nest Wifi system is made up of two devices: a router that plugs into your modem or fiber optic cable, and a satellite that extends connectivity. The satellite is interesting because it integrates a Google Assistant speaker in the base. Google says it integrated the same speaker as the new Nest Mini, delivering better bass. The design itself ties in very well with the rest of Google's smart home products, so if you already have a Google Home, the Nest Wifi will integrate seamlessly.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
One of the features that differentiates Google Wifi from other routers is the ease of use, and that's thankfully unchanged. You'll be able to set up the Nest Wifi via the Google Home app, and you can also share Wi-Fi password with guests, prioritize devices, set up a guest network, conduct bandwidth tests, or change the password. Oh, and you'll be able to pause Wi-Fi for particular devices on your home network via the Family Wi-Fi feature.
Google is touting double the speeds as Google Wifi, and 25% better coverage. The company says a two-pack will deliver whole home coverage for a 3,800-square-foot home, and you can add more points as needed. The Nest Wifi is compatible with Google Wifi, so if you've already invested in Google's mesh router system, you can add Nest Wifi points for additional coverage. That means the Nest Wifi is based on Wi-Fi ac and not the newer Wi-Fi 6 standard.
Nest Wifi is available in three color options — Snow, Sand, and Mist — and you'll be able to pre-order the mesh Wi-Fi system from later today. Sales kick off from November 4, and you can get a two-pack with a router and satellite for $269. A three-pack with two satellites will set you back $349. The standalone Nest Wifi router will set you back $169, and a satellite is $149.
Nest Wifi
The Nest Wifi brings considerable upgrades to Google's mesh Wi-Fi system, and the fact that it works with Google Wifi makes it even more enticing. The best part though is the built-in Assistant speaker.

- Controlling the left: Oculus Touch Left-hand Controller ($69 at Oculus)
- Controlling the right: Oculus Touch Right-hand Controller ($69 at Oculus)
Staying in touch
The Touch Controllers are some of the most important components of the Oculus Quest. They allow you to interact with games, apps, and the headset's interface. Everything from Beat Saber to the Settings menu requires a Touch Controller. The Touch Controllers that ship with the Oculus Quest are not as robust as previous versions of the Touch Controller that shipped with the CV1. As a result, you can break a Touch Controller more easily.
The most likely part of the controller to break is the tracking ring on the top of it. It's the thinnest point of the controller and the most likely to get hit if you punch a wall while playing SUPERHOT VR. In addition to breaking a controller, you may lose one or both controllers or need a new one for any other reason.
Ordering a replacement
While ordering a replacement Touch Controller isn't cheap, it is very easy. Oculus sells the left and right controllers separately on their website. A single controller costs $69. The website states that they'll be dispatched in around two days, so you probably won't have to wait very long to receive your replacement.

Apparently, Star Shaman has already been nominated for two awards at the Raindance Immersive Awards: "Best Debut" and "Outstanding Achievement in Audio," so it's very possible that Ikimasho has a winner on their hands. Fortunately we won't have to wait long, as the game comes out later this month, and works on practically every popular VR headset you can get your hands on. If you're interested, you can also find more information on the official Star Shaman website.Best Alternatives to Google Wifi Android Central 2020
Google Wifi put a name you know and see every day on the most central part of your home network. If you're looking for a mesh Wi-Fi option there are a lot of options available, whether you just need a little more coverage or want to completely overhaul your network with fast Wi-Fi 6 technology. eero is the best overall alternative to Google Wifi if you like the features but want something with more expansion and a sleek modern design.
- Best Overall: Eero
- Faster Google: Nest Wifi
- Best Value: TP-Link Deco M5
- Great flexibility: Netgear Orbi RBK13
- Compact Wi-Fi 6: Netgear Nighthawk MK62
- Simple Setup: AmpliFi Instant
Best Overall: eero
Eero aims to keep things simple and easy with its main third-generation base router, which offers 802.11ac speeds that aim to be enough for standard usage, though top speed will be lower than many other mesh systems. This Eero version is recommended for connections under 350Mbps and should be more than enough for even 4K video streams. If you want to stick with the Eero line but need more speed, the Eero Pro router will be a better fit.
Even so, with two Ethernet ports per router, you should be able to connect all of your devices. Eero can be used to expand your existing Eero network and will work with older Eero models as well as the faster Eero Pro and the compact Eero Beacon.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Overall
Eero
Simple mesh coverage
Eero keeps things simple with enough speed for most people and a simple and small housing that you can expand.
Faster Google: Nest Wifi
If you like Google's software and features, Nest Wifi improves on that speed and coverage while keeping Google's great support. Compared to Google WiFi's AC1200 speeds, Nest Wifi takes it up to AC2200 with a dual-band connection. Each Nest Wi-Fi router comes with two Ethernet ports on each router model. You also get an impressive 2,200 square feet of coverage with each router.
Your Nest Wifi network can be expanded with a Nest Wifi point or a Google Wifi router, both of which run at AC1200 speed. Unfortunately, if you want to keep the speed high and consistent across the entire network, you can combine only Nest Wifi routers in your mesh. It is nice to have the option to expand in areas that don't require as much speed with the slower and cheaper units.
Pros:
- Fast AC2200 speed
- Two Ethernet per router
- Works with Nest Wifi point and Google Wifi
- Prompt Google security updates
Cons:
Faster Google
Nest Wifi
Expand your Nest home with mesh Wi-Fi
Nest Wifi keeps the great app and features you expect from Google with faster speeds and greater coverage.
Best Value: TP-Link Deco M5
The TP-Link Deco M5 delivers solid speeds and competitive coverage at a great price. It also has a great compact appearance with a circular puck shape in white. Each unit has two Ethernet ports, which make it easy to keep your entire network connected, even wired devices. Wi-Fi speeds are fairly typical with a dual-band setup allowing for 867Mbps on the 5GHz band plus 400Mbps on the 2.4GHz band adding up to AC1300 speeds.
The Deco M5 is compatible with the other Deco devices allowing plenty of options to expand your mesh. Three routers together will cover up to 5,500 square feet depending on your home's design and the amount of interference.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Value
TP-Link Deco M5
Great value mesh coverage
The Deco M5 from TP-Link has fast speeds for a great price with wired ports on each node.
Great Flexibility: Netgear Orbi RBK13
Netgear's Orbi line was one of the first consumer mesh systems released and it has a system that will fit just about any setup no matter how much speed or ports you need. The entry-level RBK13 system offers AC1200 speeds achieved with up to 400Mbps on the 2.4GHz band plus 866Mbps on the 5GHz band. You'll never be able to access either of these maximums but for streaming and normal Wi-Fi usage, this router will be able to deliver more than enough speed. If speed is a major concern for you, consider a faster Orbi such as the tri-band RBK50 system.
If you're after consistent Wi-Fi with easy expansion and routers small enough to blend in, the RBK13 system comes with a base router and two additional satellites. The base router has a single Ethernet port for wired connectivity with no additional Ethernet ports on the mesh satellites. This system really shines for a fully wireless home.
Pros:
Cons:
Great flexibility
Netgear Orbi RBK13
Huge satellite ecosystem
The Orbi line was one of the first consumer mesh systems around and is a great value with plenty of speed and great controls.
Compact Wi-Fi 6: Netgear Nighthawk MK62
Similar to the entry-level Orbi system from Netgear, the Nighthawk MK62 adds Wi-Fi 6 technology and a slick black housing. At AX1800 speeds, it's not as fast as many other Wi-Fi 6 capable routers or even some fast 802.11AC routers, but it does manage to bump up the speed to 600Mbps on the 2.4GHz band and 1,200Mbps on the 5GHz band. You also get some of the other features of Wi-Fi 6 including better support for multiple devices which can help with a well-connected smart home.
This system has only one Ethernet port on the base router so you will need a separate switch if you wish to connect more than one wired device. For a wireless network, this system will be able to deliver solid speeds with improvements ready when more devices support Wi-Fi 6 connectivity.
Pros:
Cons:
Compact Wi-Fi 6
Netgear Nighthawk MK62
Wi-Fi 6 connectivity for the average user
If you want to upgrade to Wi-Fi 6, the Nighthawk MK62 offers plenty of speed in a compact package.
Simple Setup: AmpliFi Instant
AmpliFi Instant is a compact and sleek looking router sporting white plastic housing with no antennas. With only one Ethernet port, this router is much more focused on delivering usable Wi-Fi to your home rather than providing the basis for an entire home network. If you are looking for something simple and don't need to wire up more than one device, this can be a great fit. Speeds come in at 867Mbps on the 5GHz band and 300Mbps at 2.4GHz.
The Instant can work alone and will work well for a small home or apartment with little interference but for most houses, two or more are recommended. AmpliFi estimates that a single router will be able to cover approximately 2,000 square feet, but considering that elements like thick walls can reduce that, most people will have a better experience with two.
If you are looking to expand your AmpliFi network, this router is compatible with the AmpliFi HD router as well as the AmpliFi MeshPoint HDs. The AmpliFi Instant can also be used to expand an existing AmpliFi mesh setup based one either the AmpliFi HD or another AmpliFi Instant.
Pros:
Cons:
Simple Setup
AmpliFi Instant
Status with just a glance
The AmpliFi Instant sets itself apart with a built-in display and it works easily with the AmpliFi HD router and MeshPoints.
Bottom line
The first goal of a mesh network is flexibility. Mesh networks are designed to grow to fit different situations with intelligent node placement, and when needed, the easy addition of new nodes. Speed is supposed to be good enough for anything the average user can throw at the network, and for most people, this rarely exceeds 100Mbps including 4K video streaming.
Eero keeps its eye on the prize offering an easy to understand setup procedure with plenty of options for expansion. Whether you want to simply throw more eeros into the mix or add a more specialized Eero Beacon, it will work together. If you are looking for a great alternative to Google Wifi, the third generation Eero Mesh Wifi System, is one of the best mesh experiences available.

- Oculus Support says that users who use their Facebook account on more than one Oculus device are violating Facebook Terms of Service (ToS).
- Violating the Facebook ToS can result in your Facebook account getting banned, making it impossible to use your Oculus devices.
- Many users have been facing Facebook account bans since the Oculus account merger began in early October.
Update, October 25, 2020 (3:15 pm ET): The Oculus Support Twitter account issued a correction related to this topic on Sunday, October 25. Oculus explains that the Oculus Support shared incorrect information regarding banning accounts and clarified that using the same Facebook account on two or more Oculus headsets simultaneously will not get your account banned and that it is not against the Facebook Terms of Service. We've also created a full post outlining the clarification. The original article follows.
In a shocking move, Facebook's Oculus Support team has confirmed that users with multiple Oculus headsets may not use the same Facebook account on each headset at the same time. This means that folks with an Oculus Rift and an Oculus Quest headset, or even multiple Oculus Quest headsets (or any combination thereof) would not be able to use their legitimate Facebook-linked Oculus account on two or more headsets simultaneously. Doing so, according to an Oculus Support representative, violates Facebook's ToS, which could result in a Facebook account ban.
With the unification of Oculus and Facebook accounts, you most likely would not be able to continue with having two headsets as this would be against the Facebook Terms of Service.
While you can log in to your primary account on both computers, only one headset would be able to be active on the account at a time.
Oculus Support Representative
While a Facebook account ban sounds bad enough in and of itself, it's particularly problematic for Oculus Quest 2 users, who are unable to use their headsets without a valid active Facebook account. At this juncture, it seems that Facebook is suggesting one of two options for users: have someone else in your household login to the other Oculus device with their Facebook account, or only use one headset at a time.
Given that some users have set up "guest accounts" in the past (myself included), not being able to use the alternate account on a secondary Oculus device makes it impossible to play local multiplayer content. Many gamers are now expressing their frustration at being punished for their patronage to Oculus and left with little to no option to continue using their devices as they would like going forward.
Facebook is working on a multi-user solution for Oculus Quest devices, which would allow more than one Facebook account to be logged in to an Oculus Quest at a time. Until then, however, there is no way to use multiple accounts on a single Oculus device and, of course, no way to use a single account on multiple Oculus devices.
We've been in contact with Facebook representatives regarding erroneous account bans and have been assured that Oculus Support has a human available 24/7 to provide users with account support. While that's been panning out just fine for some users, other users are still left with banned accounts after several days, resulting in an Oculus Quest 2 that has often been referred to as a "paperweight". We will update this story with additional info as it develops.
Update: October 25, 3:15pm ET — Oculus won't ban Facebook accounts used on multiple Quest headsets
Oculus Support issued a correction over the weekend regarding the use of one Facebook account across multiple Oculus headsets. An Oculus Support representative incorrectly stated that using a Facebook account simultaneously on two or more Oculus headsets was against the Facebook Terms of Service and would result in a ban. This is not the case, however, as the Oculus Support Twitter account has clarified that doing so is not against the Facebook Terms of Service.
The initial news, which has since been shown to be incorrect, came as quite a surprise and led to frustration among Oculus headset users. With the Oculus Quest 2 being the first Oculus headset to require a Facebook account, many were concerned that using the same Facebook account on two headsets would result in a ban. Thankfully, this is not the case.

- Oculus Support says that users who use their Facebook account on more than one Oculus device are violating Facebook Terms of Service (ToS).
- Violating the Facebook ToS can result in your Facebook account getting banned, making it impossible to use your Oculus devices.
- Many users have been facing Facebook account bans since the Oculus account merger began in early October.
Update, October 25, 2020 (3:15 pm ET): The Oculus Support Twitter account issued a correction related to this topic on Sunday, October 25. Oculus explains that the Oculus Support shared incorrect information regarding banning accounts and clarified that using the same Facebook account on two or more Oculus headsets simultaneously will not get your account banned and that it is not against the Facebook Terms of Service. We've also created a full post outlining the clarification. The original article follows.
In a shocking move, Facebook's Oculus Support team has confirmed that users with multiple Oculus headsets may not use the same Facebook account on each headset at the same time. This means that folks with an Oculus Rift and an Oculus Quest headset, or even multiple Oculus Quest headsets (or any combination thereof) would not be able to use their legitimate Facebook-linked Oculus account on two or more headsets simultaneously. Doing so, according to an Oculus Support representative, violates Facebook's ToS, which could result in a Facebook account ban.
With the unification of Oculus and Facebook accounts, you most likely would not be able to continue with having two headsets as this would be against the Facebook Terms of Service.
While you can log in to your primary account on both computers, only one headset would be able to be active on the account at a time.
Oculus Support Representative
While a Facebook account ban sounds bad enough in and of itself, it's particularly problematic for Oculus Quest 2 users, who are unable to use their headsets without a valid active Facebook account. At this juncture, it seems that Facebook is suggesting one of two options for users: have someone else in your household login to the other Oculus device with their Facebook account, or only use one headset at a time.
Given that some users have set up "guest accounts" in the past (myself included), not being able to use the alternate account on a secondary Oculus device makes it impossible to play local multiplayer content. Many gamers are now expressing their frustration at being punished for their patronage to Oculus and left with little to no option to continue using their devices as they would like going forward.
Facebook is working on a multi-user solution for Oculus Quest devices, which would allow more than one Facebook account to be logged in to an Oculus Quest at a time. Until then, however, there is no way to use multiple accounts on a single Oculus device and, of course, no way to use a single account on multiple Oculus devices.
We've been in contact with Facebook representatives regarding erroneous account bans and have been assured that Oculus Support has a human available 24/7 to provide users with account support. While that's been panning out just fine for some users, other users are still left with banned accounts after several days, resulting in an Oculus Quest 2 that has often been referred to as a "paperweight". We will update this story with additional info as it develops.

If you are ready to upgrade your wireless network there are a ton of options to choose from. Wi-Fi 6 is pushing speeds higher than every before while mesh expansion is making it easy to add coverage where you need it.Best Verizon Phones Android Central 2020
Big Red may charge an arm and a leg for its service, but the best Verizon phones don't all have to be unattainably expensive. Whether you're after the top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra or you'd rather save some money and pick up something like the Pixel 4a, there are plenty of great options for one of the nation's top-rated carriers.
- Best overall: Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
- Best compact phone: Samsung Galaxy S20
- Astrophotography: Google Pixel 4a
- Best foldable: Motorola Razr
- 5G on a budget: Motorola Moto Z4
- Best battery life: Motorola Moto G Power
Best overall: Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is Samsung's ultimate mobile experience, cramming powerful specs and a 6.9-inch 120Hz display into a modern design. It also has an enormously capable camera system that features a 108MP main sensor and up to 50X zoom with the periscope-style telephoto camera. You also get a massive 4500mAh battery and 5G support, along with the multifunctional S Pen stylus.
Best compact phone: Samsung Galaxy S20
The Note 20 Ultra isn't the only great 5G phone in Samsung's lineup. The Galaxy S20 has the same incredible build quality, a triple camera system that gives you options for wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto, and one of the smallest form factors of any phone on the market. It's refreshing to have a phone that fits comfortably in one hand and works great on Verizon's 5G network.
Astrophotography: Google Pixel 4a
If you value clean software and timely updates above all else, there's no better choice than a Pixel. Of course, the Pixel 4a also takes incredible photos, particularly in low light thanks to Night Sight, and the new Astrophotography mode lets you shoot stunning pictures of the stars. It's also incredibly affordable, and while you won't get 5G support, the rest of the fundamentals are all here.
Best foldable: Motorola Razr
The Razr is back, and this time it's packing a 6.2-inch display and a Snapdragon 710 processor. The display folds in half to fit more easily in your pocket, and when it's shut, the outer display shows your notifications and widgets. You can even use that outer display as a viewfinder for the phone's 16MP primary camera. This phone isn't cheap, but its cutting edge design is certainly enticing.
5G on a budget: Motorola Moto Z4
There's no need to invest heavily into 5G while the network is still in its infancy — but if you can get it for cheap, why not give it a shot? The Moto Z4 has a modular design that, when paired with the 5G Moto Mod, allows it to connect to Verizon's fastest network. It's not a bad phone on its own either, with a large display and clean software, and there are plenty of other Moto Mods to expand its capabilities.
Best battery life: Motorola Moto G Power
The Moto G Power is a fairly average phone by most modern standards, with a 6.4-inch 1080p display and a triple camera system that offers ultra-wide and macro secondary lenses, but its namesake comes from the 5,000mAh battery. With that kind of juice, the Moto G Power can easily make it through two or even three days on a single charge, making it the perfect phone for a weekend getaway.
The Note 20 Ultra isn't your only option for the best Verizon phone
There are a lot of great Android phones on Verizon at various price points. If you're looking for the best combination of fast performance, superb cameras, and all-day battery life, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the phone to beat. It packs all of the best specs you can ask for, and includes everything from 5G support to reverse wireless charging, water resistance, an in-display fingerprint sensor, and a 50X telephoto camera. Its 6.9-inch display is surprisingly easy to manage thanks to ultra-tight bezels, and the 108MP main sensor takes stunningly good photos.
Samsung isn't the only manufacturer making great phones for the masses, though. The Pixel 4a isn't quite as flashy in terms of design or features, but its camera takes terrific shots in any lighting situation and the software is updated constantly. Most of the Pixel's photographic prowess comes from machine learning, and it can even handle extremely low light thanks to the wildly popular Night Sight and Astrophotography shooting modes.
If even the Pixel 4a is out of your budget, the Moto G Power is another option that offers a clean software experience and, more importantly, absolutely incredible endurance. The 5,000mAh battery can make it through an entire weekend without needing charged, making it possibly the longest-lasting phone on this list.

Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) has allowed mesh systems to deliver full gigabit speeds with ease throughout a large house by getting even more performance out of the available spectrum. Wi-Fi 6 lets compact routers hit gigabit speeds on their own and over 500Mbps while deployed as a mesh. With more phones than ever, including Wi-Fi 6 support, and families asking more of their internet connections than ever, it's a good time to upgrade to Wi-Fi 6.
What are the best Wi-Fi 6 mesh routers?
The Linksys MX10 Velop is the best Wi-Fi 6 router for people looking to take advantage of a fast connection all over their home. Alexa support and great parental control options, this is a great mesh system for families.
The second best option is the Netgear Nighthawk MK62 which is designed for people that want a compact mesh system with enough speed for most people. A compact router and satellite design allow you to blanket your home in Wi-Fi for great coverage without needing to dedicate a ton of space to each unit.
If you're looking for something in the middle, that's a great fit for an internet connection over 500Mbps, the Netgear Orbi RBK752 is a great choice thanks to a tri-band AX4200 setup. This ORbi system dedicates a fast Wi-Fi band to connecting the mesh keeping speeds high and consistent throughout your home.
1. Linksys MX10 Velop
The best Wi-Fi 6 mesh router overall
Bottom line: The MX10 Velop from Linksys packs in two MX5 routers with fast AX5300 speeds with a tri-band setup. Linksys also allows you to add any other Velop routers to this mesh for expansion.
- Top speeds: Tri-band AX5300, 2402Mbps + 1733Mbps @ 5GHz,n 1147Mbps at 2.4GHz.
- Top features: 6,000 sq ft. coverage, 4 Ethernet ports per node, Easy setup and control with app
Pros:
- Four Ethernet ports to connect all you wired devices
- AX7800 speeds can support tons of devices
- Massive 6,000 sq ft of coverage
Cons:
- Held back by gigabit uplink
- Expensive
The Linksys MX10 Velop is just the name given to the two-pack of Linksys MX5 Velop routers. These routers are capable of delivering AX7800 speeds across three Wi-Fi bands. While these speeds are quite high, your modem's wired connection will max out at 1Gbps, and other wired devices will be limited to the same speed. While this is more than enough for the vast majority of people, it would have been nice to see more wired capability.
If you already have a Velop system, there's no need to get rid of it thanks to compatibility with the entire Velop family of routers. The most powerful routers, in this case, the Wi-Fi 6 Velops, should be connected directly to the modem, with the older routers providing extra coverage in areas that don't need as much speed. The two units included in the MX10 package can deliver up to 6,00 sq ft of coverage.
Four Ethernet ports and a USB 3.0 port on each unit allow for a lot of expansion. The Wi-Fi 6 Velops are quite a bit larger than the Velop dual-band or tri-band AC mesh routers. Compared to a traditional router, however, the internal antennas help keep the appearance understated.
Velop also can be controlled with Alexa allowing for simple access controls for guests or connected devices. Parental controls are also included in the Linksys Smart Wi-Fi app. You can create profiles for different devices to reduce distractions during homework or after a certain time.
Linksys Velop MX10
Add coverage, capacity, and speed to your Velop mesh with the Linksys MX10 Velop. Wi-Fi 6 and Ethernet keep speeds high.

- Top features: 3,000 sq ft. coverage, 1 open Ethernet ports per node, easy app setup, Compact nodes
Pros:
- Small housing
- Modern WPA3 security
- Future expansion with EasyMesh
Cons:
- AX1800 speeds not much faster than Wi-Fi 5
- Only one Ethernet port for a wired device
While you do give up some speed compared to the larger and more expensive mesh systems, the AX1800 speeds of the Netgear Nighthawk MK62 should be more than enough for most homes. These speeds break down to 1200Mbps on the 5GHz band with 600Mbps on the 2.4GHz band. 4K streams should be a breeze, and if you need a few more wired connections, a network switch could be connected to one of the gigabit LAN ports available on each router.
Netgear claims these routers can cover a 3,000-square-foot home, and of course, more satellite units could be added down the line. This is helped by compatibility with Wi-Fi Certified EashMesh. EasyMesh is a Wi-Fi standard developed to help ensure future compatibility with mesh products. This is all brought together with Netgear's robust Nighthawk app.
The Nighthawk Mesh WiFi 6 System from Netgear takes on compact AC-only mesh systems with its compact housing and understated design. Measuring only 4.8 inches wide and 2.5 inches tall, each router has a smaller footprint than a CD case. This compact design makes this mesh system one of the easiest to integrate into a home.
Netgear's Nighthawk app is used for management and setup, making it easy to monitor your network usage and add satellites. You can even manage your network remotely if you find you need to add or remove internet connectivity from devices even when you're away from home. You can also subscribe to Netgear Armor, which adds internet security from Bitdefender and enables more in-depth device controls.
Netgear Nighthawk MK62
Fast enough for most people in a small housing that can blend in anywhere, build your Wi-Fi 6 mesh with the Nighthawk MK62 system.
3. Netgear Orbi WiFi 6 System (RBK752)
The best Wi-Fi 6 mesh router with dedicated tri-band
Bottom line: The RBK752 is a great fit for most people with enough speed for just about any web activity. Orbi's dedicated backhaul band keeps your speeds consistent even when you've got a lot of devices connected to a satellite.
- Top speeds: Tri-band AX4200, 1200Mbps + 2400Mbps @5GHz. 600Mbps @2.4GHz
- Top features: 5,000 sq ft. coverage, 3x + 2x Ethernet ports, dedicated 5GHz backhaul, easy setup
Pros:
- Three Ethernet on base, two on satellite
- Tri-band Wi-Fi keeps speeds consistent
- Approximately 5,000 square feet of coverage
Cons:
- Too large to easily conceal
- Slower than others at this price
- Expensive
The newest addition to Netgear's Wi-Fi 6 enabled Orbi family is the RBK752 system, which includes one base router and a satellite and can cover approximately 5,000 square feet with it's tri-band, six-antenna setup. This Orbi is in line with the older Orbis as far as size and appearance with a two-tone gray and matte white housing. Wi-Fi 6 speeds come in at AX4200, which breaks down to 600Mbps on the 2.4GHz channel and 1200 Mbps on the 5GHz band. The remaining 5GHz channel can operate up to 2,400Mbps. However, it's dedicated to the connection between the Orbi units. This speed should be more than enough for the vast majority of home network use, including multiple 4K video streams.
The base unit has one uplink gigabit Ethernet port and three Ethernet ports for wired devices. You can also combine the uplink with one of the other Ethernet ports for link aggregation, allowing for a faster uplink to your router. The satellite has two Ethernet ports to connect more wired devices. This makes it a good fit for a home office or media center that needs a wired connection.
Netgear Orbi RBK752 is controlled by the robust Orbi app that allows you to control each device individually. The Android version of the app lets you test and record your connection throughout your home to determine the best place for your satellites for top speed. A traffic meter is included so you can keep an eye on your usage if you have a data cap. An optional Netgear Armor subscription adds in great security features for your network with enhanced parental controls.
Netgear Orbi WiFi 6 System (RBK752)
Netgear Orbi Wi-Fi 6 brings the next wave of mesh with fast AX4200 speeds. This is great for broad coverage with a lot of devices.
4. Asus ZenWiFi XT8
The best Wi-Fi 6 mesh router for home network security
Bottom line: Asus has created one of the best fast tri-band mesh systems and takes it to the next level with great compatibility and included software. AiMesh software allows any AiMesh router to expand the mesh, and free AiProtection Pro adds network security and advanced parental controls.

Asus was one of the first networking companies to commit to mesh networking with its robust AiMesh software that can work on most of its routers regardless of whether or not they were explicitly designed for a mesh. Asus has repeatedly proven its abilities with the ZenWiFi XT8, which features a sleek and reasonably compact design with great capabilities. The routers come in white or charcoal colors and have three available ethernet ports on the back of each.
The ZenWiFi XT8 is capable of wireless speeds up to AX6600 with a tri-band setup. That is 574Mbps at 2.4GHz as well as 1201Mbps and 4804Mbps on its two 5GHz bands. While most connections today max out at 1Gbps, the ZenWifi is ready for the future with a 2.5Gbps input for faster internet speeds or, more realistically, a fast wired home network.
If you are looking to expand your mesh, you'll need an Asus router that supports AiMesh and will be best served by a tri-band Wi-Fi 6 capable router. The ZenWiFi XT8 can cover up to 5,500 square feet, so most homes should be covered. Still, it's nice that you can use an older Asus router as an expansion in low priority areas.
AiProtection Pro is an unmatched value in home networking. AiProtection Pro is included for the product's life and comes with network security using Trend Micro's official database. It also includes advanced parental controls that allow you to control all of your kids' devices with schedules and content filters.
Asus ZenWiFi XT8
The Asus ZenWiFi XT8 is one of the fastest Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems available with a fast 2.5Gbps WAN port and easy AiMesh expansion.
5. TP-Link Deco X20
The best value Wi-Fi 6 mesh router with great coverage
Bottom line: TP-Link's Deco series is one of the best values for covering a large area. AX1800 will keep up with most standard usage, and dual Ethernet ports on each node make it easy to get your home connected.
- Top speeds: Dual-band AX1800, 1200Mbps @5GHz, 575Mbps @2.4GHz

Pros:
- Dual Ethernet on each unit
- Up to 5,800 square feet of coverage
- Easy to conceal
- Modern WPA security
Cons:
- AX1800 won't keep up with fiber
The TP-Link Deco X20 is an excellent value for a Wi-Fi 6 mesh system, especially considering you get three nodes in the box to provide coverage up to 5,800 square feet. In a white cylindrical housing, measuring 4.33 inches in diameter and 4.49 inches tall, it should be easy to find space for these in any room. Inside there are four antennas and powering its AX1800 dual-band connection.
It's nice that each one also comes with two gigabit Ethernet ports on the back. This can help get some wired devices online, such as a PC in a home office. Gamers also benefit since consoles could be connected to the node via Ethernet, which can improve connection consistency.
All of this will be configured with TP-Link's app so that you will need a device running at least iOS 9.0 or Android 4.4. This shouldn't be a problem for most people, and the app will help you set the devices up in a strong configuration.
TP-Link Deco routers are compatible with Amazon Alexa and come with TP-Link's HomeCare software. HomeCare comes with antivirus security for your network as well as advanced parental controls. HomeCare also allows for great Quality of Service to keep speeds up even with heavy usage.
TP-Link Deco X20
The Deco X20 has three nodes that cover up to 5,800 sq ft at AX1800 speeds. Two Ethernet ports on each unit make expansion easy.
6. Asus RT-AX92U
The best Wi-Fi 6 mesh router for gamers

- Top speeds: Tri-band AX6100, 4804Mbps + 867Mbps @ 5GHz, 400Mbps @ 2.4GHz
- Top features: Tri-band, 4x + 4x Ethernet ports, Expand with other AiMesh routers, AiProtection Pro
Pros:
- Link Aggregation
- Four Ethernet ports for fast wired devices
- Tri-band keeps connection fast
- Built for gaming
Cons:
- Large and ostentatious
- No multi-gig Ethernet
Asus was one of the first companies to make a Wi-Fi 6 router for consumers and quickly followed that up with the RT-AX92U mesh system. Thanks to fast tri-band speeds, these routers can connect with a fast backhaul of up to 4.8Gbps, and each unit has four gigabit Ethernet ports.
Disappointingly, there is no multi-gig Ethernet, but link aggregation can combine two of the gigabit ports for up to 2Gbps internet support. This will be quite a bit faster than most people have access to. Thanks to Asus' AiMesh software, another Asus router can be added in as a mesh point, but you'll need to make sure it has full tri-band Wi-Fi 6 support to get the most out of your network.
I like the more traditional gaming router appearance. The gamer aesthetic here isn't for nothing since Asus included its gaming software to keep ping times low and prioritize game traffic on your network. Gaming and mesh don't usually mix, but Asus has managed to bring the two together with some of the best technology available.
Asus' software package is one of the most feature-rich around with a lifetime subscription to AiProtection Pro powered by Trend Micro. It also supports gaming features like Adaptive QoS and wtfast, which connects to servers in the most direct route possible.

A 5GHz band utilizing Wi-Fi 5 in addition to a 2.4GHz and 5GHz band using Wi-Fi 6 allows the Alien to hit 7685Mbps of combined wireless capacity. For Wi-Fi 6 clients, this breaks down into 1148Mbps and 4804Mbps available. This is more than enough speed for a gigabit connection and should be sufficient for years to come.
A single Alien Router covers up to 3,000 sq ft, and a pack with a similarly equipped MeshPoint takes that up to 6,000 sq ft. The Alien Router has four Ethernet ports on the back for wired devices while the MeshPoint has none. You can create a mesh with multiple routers if you need the extra Ethernet ports.
AmpliFi Alien comes in a cylindrical housing measuring 9.84 inches tall with a 4.33-inch diameter. The power and WAN port are located on the bottom allowing for an immaculate wireless-only setup. The four Ethernet ports are located on the back vertically oriented. On the front of the router is a 4.7-inch touch screen that can show your network information in real-time.

The best Wi-Fi 6 mesh router for great software
Bottom line: Eero 6 brings great speed at an affordable price for connections up to 500Mbps. The great Eero app allows you to add this router to your existing Eero mesh or start a new one.
- Top speeds: Dual-band AX1800, 1201Mbps @ 5GHz, 574Mbps @ 2.4GHz
- Top features: 1,500 sq ft. coverage, 2x (1 for WAN) Ethernet ports, great software experience
Pros:
- Great Eero app and software
- Compact design
- Works with all other Eeros
Cons:
- Eero 6 Extenders don't have Ethernet
Wi-Fi 6 is taking the already solid performance of the Eero router up a notch with Wi-Fi 6. Eero 6 comes with an AX1800 dual-band connection capable of 1201Mbps on the 5GHz band and another 574Mbps for devices on the 2.4GHz band. Since the mesh will share the 5GHz band with devices, Eero only recommends this router for internet connections up to 500Mbps. If you have a studio apartment or small home, Eero 6 alone can deliver gigabit Wi-Fi speeds.
An Eero 6 alone can cover up to 1,500 sq ft. This router isn't designed to work alone and works best when deployed with other Eeros. For the best possible speed, you should pair it with another Wi-Fi 6 Eero such as the Eero 6 Extender or even the faster Eero 6 Pro. You can add it to a Wi-Fi 5 Eero mesh though your top speeds will be reduced if you're connected to a slower Wi-Fi 5 band. Eero 6 has two Ethernet ports though one will be used for your internet connection if this is the base router for your mesh.
Eero 6 comes in at just 3.91 inches wide and 3.82 inches deep. This router is designed to sit flat on a table or shelf, so expect to dedicate a bit of space to it. Still, compared to many other similar routers, Eero 6 is remarkably compact.
Eero's setup and management app is quite powerful with pretty much any option most people will want, including port forwarding and IPv6 support. Eeros will also automatically update themselves to make sure your network is secure. There is an optional Eero Secure and Eero Secure+ subscription available that can add advanced filtering for inappropriate content as well as antivirus software, a VPN service, and a password manager.

- Works with Orbi RBS750 and RBS850 satellites
- Simplified network setup
Cons:
- Rather large unit
If you have cable internet, your ISP probably tried to get you to pay an additional monthly fee for a router that doesn't deliver great performance. The Netgear Orbi CBK752 is a fast AX4200 Wi-Fi 6 mesh system with a DOCSIS 3.1 modem that can handle the fastest speeds a cable ISP can deliver with a theoretical max download speed of 10Gbps. The router side of things offers a fast mesh connection similar to the Orbi RBK752 and even uses the same satellites. That means 600Mbps at 2.4GHz plus 1400Mbps at 5GHz for connected clients with a dedicated 2400Mbps 5GHz backhaul.
This mesh system with a router and satellite covers up to 5,000 sq ft though additional satellites can be added if more coverage is needed. An additional RBS750 satellite will add 2,500 sq ft. The base router has four open Ethernet ports, and the satellite has two Ethernet ports. You could also use an RBS850 satellite for expansion, which comes with four Ethernet ports.
Orbi routers are a bit tall and awkward though their minimal depth makes them reasonably easy to place. The base router comes in at 9.6 inches tall, 7.7 inches wide, and 3.5 inches deep. The Satellite is a more compact 9.1 inches tall, 7.2 inches wide, and 2.8 inches deep.
Setup is done with the Orbi app, which allows for easy setup and management. You can see all connected devices and restrict internet access. You can also see the quality of each satellite's connection to ensure you're getting as much speed as possible. You can also subscribe to Netgear Armor, which includes security features powered by BitDefender and additional device controls. The modem is compatible with all major US cable service providers, and you will need to contact your ISP to activate the modem for use.
Netgear Orbi WiFi 6 with DOCSIS 3.1 cable modem (CBK752)
Combine your modem and router without giving up fast Wi-Fi 6 mesh support with Orbi CBK752. This mesh system comes with one RBS750 satellite for 5,000 sq ft of coverage.
10. Netgear Nighthawk EAX80
The best Wi-Fi 6 mesh router extender
Bottom line: If you've already got a Netgear Nighthawk router or want to make sure you have all the speed and features of the Nighthawk ecosystem, the Nighthawk EAX80 Wi-Fi 6 mesh extender can add coverage with a single Wi-Fi name.
- Top speeds: Dual-band AX6000, 1.2Gbps @ 2.4GHz, 4.8Gbps @ 5GHz
- Top features: Single Wi-Fi name, 4x Ethernet ports, USB 3.0 port, easy setup
Pros:
- Four Ethernet ports in a traditional router
- Keep your Wi-Fi name
- Fast AX6000 speeds
Cons:
- Only dual-band
- Needs an existing router to work
If you've already bought a Netgear Wi-Fi 6 router, like the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 but find yourself needing more coverage, Netgear has a solution. The Netgear Nighthawk EAX80 is an eight-stream Wi-Fi 6 mesh expansion capable of speeds up to AX6000. It's compatible with any existing router, though I would recommend a Wi-Fi 6 router with at least a matching eight data streams.
You can set this router up with the same Wi-Fi name as your existing wireless network, so there's no need to manually switch between two different networks like older extenders.
Four gigabit Ethernet ports onboard and a USB 3.0 port make this a great way to bring the network to your media setup or a desktop PC that doesn't have Wi-Fi. You can also use it to improve the signal to the rest of your home like any mesh.
There are a lot more if-then considerations due to the extender being reliant on the speeds of the base router, but this is true for any mesh. If you have already invested in Wi-Fi 6 and just need a bit more coverage, this is a great option. Thanks to the robust Netgear Nighthawk app, you don't give up any features you've come to expect with Nighthawk, and setup is a breeze.
Netgear Nighthawk EAX80
Add range and four Ethernet ports to your Wi-Fi 6 network without sacrificing speed or capacity with the fast Nighthawk EAX80.
Bottom line
Most people simply don't need much more than gigabit speeds on their home Wi-Fi networks. Luckily, even Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems are available for people that don't need a ton of speed but still want to take advantage of the other advancements. The Linksys Velop MX10 delivers plenty of speed for years to come without giving up any feature compared to a standard router.
Many of the best wireless routers support Wi-Fi 6 and mesh if you're not sure you need either feature right now. Still, Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems are bringing features like MU-MIMO and better handling of multiple connections to your whole home. Not that many devices sold in the past couple of years support Wi-Fi 6, but many new phones support the protocol. Thankfully, all of these devices support older versions of Wi-Fi to maintain compatibility with the added benefit of better connections between the base router and satellite units.
Can you make your own mesh?
Something to keep in mind about mesh networks is that pretty much any router with a powerful enough CPU and enough RAM can technically act as a mesh router. Asus has taken this further than most other manufacturers by including its AiMesh in nearly all of its routers. It is technically possible to put together your own Wi-Fi 6 mesh with compatible routers, but the setup process will be more complicated than a complete mesh system.
This technology is more promising with Wi-Fi 6 routers thanks to the improved capacity and speeds over previous generations of routers. Some routers such as the Netgear Nighthawk MK62 are even compatible with EasyMesh, which is a standard for connecting future devices.

Read on for some quick details on how to watch the San Francisco 49ers vs New England Patriots, no matter where you're at in the world this weekend.
After a rough first few weeks of the season the 49ers are finally starting to get healthy, and QB Jimmy G looked sharp last Sunday in a comeback win over the L.A. Rams. However, this week won't be any easier going up against a Patriots team that rarely loses back-to-back games, who just lost their second in a row. Not to mention Foxborough is where Jimmy spent the first few years of his career learning under Tom Brady.
Garoppolo will either shine bright against his former team, or struggle to overcome any weaknesses Bill Belichick and the Patriots know about and try to expose.
The Patriots currently have a 2-3 record after only being able to beat Miami and the Las Vegas Raiders so far in 2020 without Tom Brady. They'll look to even their record to .500 in a win against the 49ers.
On the other side of the football, the SF 49ers are 3-3 and have struggled as well after such a strong season just a year ago. As a reminder, they've been without starting QB Jimmy G and star defender Nick Bosa for much of the season, and the Patriots and Cam Newton will be a big test for the current lineup. Not only will the 49ers vs Patriots be a great game to watch, but it'll be a "dogfight" according to Garoppolo.
"It will be cool to get back to the old stomping grounds, see some familiar faces," Jimmy Garoppolo said after a tough victory against the Los Angeles Rams. "But we'll enjoy this one tonight, get on the film for the Patriots and everything tomorrow, and this win will definitely give us a little momentum. But next week is going to be another dogfight."
Nevertheless the most important thing for both of these teams will be to stay healthy and COVID free before kickoff Sunday. Read on to find out how to live stream the San Francisco 49ers vs New England Patriots.

- The Walking Dead Onslaught 'Combat Rebalance Patch' is now available for download on PC and PSVR platforms.
- Combat has been overhauled, including ranged and melee weapons, difficulty, and even walker behavior.
- Additional quality-of-life changes include things like Valve Index grip improvements and options for left-handed players.
The Walking Dead Onslaught 'Combat Rebalance Patch' is exactly what players and critics alike have been asking for since the game launched a few weeks ago. While the game looks great on a powerful PC or a PS4, many players cited the gameplay as a source of disappointment. Following the release of this much-anticipated VR-exclusive zombie-killing action title, developers Survios faced a wave of criticism regarding the game's designs, ranging from the overpowered starting knife to the small number of zombies present on screen.
True to its pedigree, Survios has now released a patch that significantly overhauls the combat and progression systems, as well as walker behavior and difficulty, helping them to fall more in line with player expectations. This free update is now available for all platforms the game is available on, including Oculus, SteamVR, and PlayStation VR. If you already own the game, head on over to your platform of choice and hit that update button. You'll likely enjoy what you see.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
To lightly sum up the changes, Survios has made it so that ranged weapons are a lot more desirable to use. That includes adding one-shot kills for close-range brain shots, less damage when shooting below the brain, and even fall-off damage over distance that can be improved with weapon upgrades throughout the game. Pistol whipping in the game now deals a lot more damage, and heavier guns actually feel like heavy guns thanks to a physics overhaul for two-handed weapons.
Melee weapons now all behave more like you would expect, including blades sticking to the inside of a walker's skull, resisting removal, and no longer instantly releasing when a walker dies. Player movement is now restricted when a weapon is impaled in a walker, making attacking far more realistic, and the starting knife has been brought down to a more realistic level of power, as well.
Walkers are now more difficult to kill, are generally more aggressive, and deal more damage when biting. Higher difficulty levels have been tweaked, the number of walkers has been increased, and spiked and armored walkers are now much harder to kill. There are even tweaks for left-handed players, as movement and turning controller functions can be easily swapped in the settings, and Valve Index players will also find that gripping in the game behaves as they would expect. If you want to see all the changes, head on over to the official Survios blog.

Beat Saber is a ton of fun, but what could make it better? Playing with grips that make your VR controllers feel like actual lightsabers, of course! We'll show you which grips are the best for Beat Saber on the Oculus Quest.A good Wi-Fi signal is a fight against physics, with radio signals attempting to travel through walls and objects without major degradation. While your signal will eventually fade in any scenario, there are some steps you can take to make sure you're getting the most out of your router. Whether you find a better placement or just need to make sure your equipment is running efficiently, these are some steps you can take to improve your signal.

- More consistent coverage with Wi-Fi 6 tech: Asus RT-AX58U ($160 at Best Buy)
Check the software
One of the first things to do is to make sure your software is up to date on both your phone and router. While not directly related to signal, using a VPN, for example, can make your internet feel slower. If you're on your home Wi-Fi, you probably don't need to use a VPN.
Newer routers can connect to a phone app so you can choose and update in the settings. Older routers may require you to connect directly through a web browser with an IP address. Typically this is something simple like 192.168.0.1 but they can all be different so check the back of your router or manual to find out.
Something like an Eero router can find software updates and apply them automatically so you may not even have to think about this step. Still, it's worth making sure your software is up to date before moving on.
Eliminate interference
The first thing to check is your phone case. Some cases that are thick or have metal in them may be blocking your phone's antennas. While it may not be noticeable most of the time, if a signal is already weak, this may be just enough to block the signal from connecting.
Now we'll get into the nitty gritty. Wi-Fi signals use either 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz signals. Simply put, 5GHz signals do not travel as far especially if there is something in the way like a thick wall.
Check your connection
- Make sure you're connected to the right network. Your phone could have connected to a weaker guest network or public Wi-Fi in range.
- Try the 2.4GHz connection if available rather than the 5GHz. 5GHz, while faster, won't travel as far and will often have 5G at the end of the name.
- Delete the connection then reconnect. This could resolve an IP conflict or an outdated configuration.
- Restart the phone. No operating system is perfect and sometimes a simple restart can get things back in order.
If your phone is in order, there may be an issue with how your router is positioned or set up.
- Use an app like Wifi Analyzer to find dead areas or to see if your Wi-Fi signal is using an efficient channel without overlap.
- Unplug your router for a few seconds and then plug it back in. This can allow the router to choose a less crowded channel automatically.
- Make sure the antennas are pointed up. If there are no antennas, have the router sitting upright.
- Elevate the router to be higher than most furniture.
- Ensure the router has optimal cooling. Routers need some breathing room to stay cool.
- If possible, position the router away from electrical equipment to reduce interference.
Select a narrower channel band in the router's settings. This can reduce the top speed but also avoid interference.
Time for an upgrade
The last thing to consider is some new equipment. It may not be necessary to replace the router. If it's a mesh compatible router, you could add another mesh point. If not, a Wi-Fi extender may help as well but since this creates a new network, it's not a perfect solution when moving around a home.
Even if your router was adequate in the past, there may now be more interference with neighboring wireless networks. You could make some big improvements by upgrading to one of the best wireless routers available. If you need to cover a large home or just one with a lot of interference, a mesh network could be a great option since it uses multiple access points to keep the signal strong.
You could also upgrade to a Wi-Fi 6 router if you have new enough devices to support it or are willing to upgrade. These routers can make more efficient use of spectrum to improve coverage and may even be able to select higher 5GHz bands that have less traffic.

Though we're still a little way out from the traditional Black Friday weekend, and we just wrapped up Amazon Prime Day, this year's unusual annual shopping calendar has prompted a whole host of great fall deals to kick off sooner than usual so there's a ton of stuff to shop already.
Black Friday is usually the last chance to score a great deal on tech, kitchen appliances, toys, and more, ahead of the holidays, though some unexpected circumstances this year are likely to affect exactly how the event plays out at various retailers.
Let's dive into everything we know about Black Friday 2020 including some official sale announcements!
When is Black Friday 2020?
With how crazy everything has been in 2020 you may be wondering when Black Friday is taking place this year, especially after Amazon already delayed Prime Day by several months. Black Friday itself is always the Friday after Thanksgiving, making it November 27 this year. Traditionally, retailers would kick off their big sales early on the Friday morning with the discounts, and the hype, running all the way through the weekend.
However, the Black Friday sales are going to look a little different this year with huge amounts of in-store traffic not exactly desirable. A bunch of the biggest retailers in the U.S. are also giving their staff Thanksgiving day off for the first time in recent years suggesting a more low-key take on Black Friday this year, at least in stores.
Due to the current health crisis, we expect to see way more attention shown to online-only deals and since we're breaking out of the usual 'doorbuster' mindset, we're probably going to see many retailers kicking off their Black Friday sales much earlier, too.
Now Prime Day is out of the way, we've now got some official Black Friday plans from retailers which we'll go through below.
Black Friday sales at Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, and more
There's a running theme when it comes to Black Friday plans at all of the major retailers: the deals are starting early!
Amazon's Black Friday sale has already begun in the form of the 'Holiday Dash' promotion. Each day in the run-up to Black Friday itself Amazon will be offering "Black Friday-worthy" deals that last just one day. It also just kicked off a limited-time sale on Amazon devices to celebrate Alexa's birthday. We've already seen deals on tech, fashion, smart home, and much more with some Prime Day prices returning.
This year's Black Friday sale at Best Buy also kicked off early with some standout deals kicking off during Prime Day with the rest of the deals now being revealed in its Black Friday ad. Many deals are available there right now in pre-Black Friday sales with a detailed timeline of events leading up to the big day.
Walmart has also provided a thorough outline of its plans so far with its 'Deal for Days' promotion. Instead of one big Black Friday weekend sale, it is opting to spread out the deals throughout November with three separate events. The first kicks off on November 4 and online shoppers will get first dibs on many, if not all, deals. Walmart has also unveiled its Black Friday ad.
Not to be left behind, Target's Black Friday sale has also been detailed and it too will be launching some early Black Friday sales starting on November 1. Each week, it will be releasing a mini Black Friday ad with limited-time deals to snap up before the big event.
We expect other retailers will probably do something similar to Walmart and space out the deals (and the hype) throughout the next several weeks while prioritizing at-home shoppers.
Other Black Friday sales announced already include those from Dell, Home Depot, and Sam's Club.
Best early Black Friday deals available now
We've seen a few full Black Friday ads now so we know some of the specifics with regards to what products will be discounted during Black Friday. That being said, there are tons of early deals already available so you can actually get started on your holiday shopping now at most of the big retailers.
There are already some nice early Black Friday deals taking place, and we've taken some time to round up all of the best deals you can take advantage of today.

What deals do we expect during Black Friday 2020?
Now that a few ads from the biggest retailers are out in the open, we know the kinds of products we will see on sale and can start to make some educated guesses as to which products will be the most popular over the coming weeks.
At Amazon and most other retailers, there's a strong emphasis on Amazon device deals with Fire TV sticks, the Echo line, Kindles, Ring gear, and more being discounted back down to Prime Day prices in most cases. We'll also see a huge focus on Black Friday 4K TV deals, home appliances, toys, and more ahead of the holidays. Black Friday tends to bring many of these devices to historic low prices and the best Black Friday deals are generally focused directly around these items.
Beyond the usual suspects, we're seeing popular electronics like the TCL Roku TVs, Sonos speakers, Beats products, and more on sale, along with kitchen gadgets from Instant Pot, Keurig, and more.
What are the Black Friday hours in stores?
For most retailers, the emphasis has shifted online this year. In years gone by, retailers closed their stores late on Thanksgiving for a quick turnaround ahead of the opening to huge queues on Black Friday in the early hours of the morning. With a reduced focus on in-store shopping, stores are actually giving their staff members the day off for Thanksgiving and re-opening early on Black Friday.
We know that both Best Buy and Walmart will be opening their doors on November 27 at 5am local time so we expect that will be the standard across other retailers too.
Of course, you can shop online at any time. Since pretty much all of the best Black Friday deals will be available online this year, it's probably going to be safer and more enjoyable to shop from the comfort of your own home this time around.
Are Black Friday deals available online?
Given the current global health crisis, it's very likely that all of the best Black Friday deals will be available online. There are always online-only deals plus many of the same in-store deals being available at the retailer's website, save for a few 'doorbuster' deals.
Retailers are preparing for a very different Black Friday sale this year and those enticing in-store deals are off the cards for 2020. Expect many more online exclusives and incentives to keep shoppers happy at home.
Why should I care about Black Friday?
Whether you are a keen deal hunter or not, you probably prefer not to pay full price for the things you buy. Black Friday is the one time a year where all of the major retailers run sales simultaneously, try to outdo each other, and offer you some of the best deals around making it the very best time to buy anything you've been holding out on.
Now that Black Friday is going to be moved online, for the most part, it also means that you can score some excellent deals from the comfort of your own home. No more fighting through crowds to snag the last item on the shelf. Whether you're looking to save on a big purchase for yourself, hunting down holiday gifts for your family, or just perusing the promotions to see if something catches the eye, Black Friday is your last chance to save big in 2020.
How do I stay on top of Black Friday deals?
Black Friday 2020 is going to be big with a huge online focus which means it's going to be hard to keep up and ensure you maximize your savings during these big events. The team over at Thrifter is full of professional deal hunters who will literally be providing around the clock coverage of everything on Black Friday. From the best savings, as they hit to roundups of what you should be buying, the team will aim to make it as easy as possible to find the best deals that are available from the first to the last minute.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!A Galaxy Note launch is a different occasion than that of a Galaxy S. The Note has always been one "for the fans," not necessarily for the masses. Yet, the last couple generations have left the fans wanting more, wondering where the differentiation between the Note and Galaxy S lines went. The Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra don't seem to be set up to change that trajectory, frankly. But of course, the details matter, and there's more to a phone than what you can see on a spec sheet.
Normally, we'd be able to bring you our early hands-on impressions of the new products right away, after spending at least some amount of time using them. But as you know, things are weird right now — Samsung had to do a fully virtual event, and we don't yet have a Galaxy Note 20 or Note 20 Ultra.
But while I haven't been using the phones, I do know a lot about them. And I was lucky enough to attend a special event where I was provided an opportunity to see and hold the devices for a very short period. Here are my thoughts based on what I've learned, and the small amount of time I've been around them.
Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra The basics
There's extensive Galaxy S20 DNA in both Note 20s.
As has always been the case, the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra are largely based on the Galaxy S20 series from earlier in the year. The Note 20 is effectively the same size as the S20+, with a 6.7-inch display, and the Note 20 Ultra is similar to the S20 Ultra, with a 6.9-inch display. The Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra also have the same camera arrays as their corresponding S20 counterpart — with two exceptions, which I'll get to below.
Software-wise, things are very similar to the S20 series. This is One UI 2.5, an upgrade over the S20's, which has a handful of subtle tweaks and changes, but nothing substantial. The biggest differences are Note-specific features to do with the S Pen and Samsung Notes. One UI 2.5 is also supposed to include support for using gesture navigation with third-party launchers ... though I wasn't able to test that for myself.
Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra specs: Distant siblings
The rest of the specs and features are basically comparable to the S20 series. There's a small bump in chipset to the Snapdragon 865+, but the Note 20 is paired with just 8GB of RAM versus the 12GB in the S20 series and Note 20 Ultra. The ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor remains unchanged from the S20, Note 10 and S10, which is unsurprising but disappointment in general because it's well behind much of the competition. Samsung is claiming no improvement in display brightness, colors or any other capabilities compared to the S20 — though that's in no way a problem, and still makes the displays an upgrade over the Note 10 series.
Sadly, charging also hasn't been improved. Both phones top out at 25W over USB-C PD (or less with Quick Charge 2), 15W wireless, and 4.5W in reverse-charging configuration. Yes, the Note 20 series already walked back from the 45W fast charging Samsung started to push with the Note 10+ — though that didn't really make much of a difference anyway.
Colors are differentiated between the two models. You can get the Note 20 in dark grey, bronze or green; and the Note 20 Ultra in black, bronze or white. The black and grey are similar, but not the same, while the bronze really is identical between the two.
Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra Important differences
Unlike last year's Note 10 and 10+, which were truly "the same phone in two sizes," there are notable differences in the hardware and capabilities of the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra. To start, the Note 20 certainly isn't a "small" phone — it's tough tell the two apart, size-wise. The Note 20 is just 3 mm shorter and 1 mm narrower than the Ultra, thanks to its smaller 6.7-inch display, and is roughly 7% lighter. Nothing you'd be able to notice by holding just one or the other.
The phones look the same at a glance, but there are many important differences to explore.
The phones actually have different physical designs and builds, though, that you start to notice as you see both together. The Note 20 is a tiny bit more rounded in the corners, compared to the traditional squared-off Note styling in the 20 Ultra. But conversely, the Note 20 has a flat display whereas the Ultra retains Samsung's classic curved screen edges — though the glass is still rounded, so there isn't a huge functional difference between the two.
A bigger functional change is display refresh rate, where the Note 20 is stuck back on 60Hz, like the Note 10 series, and the 20 Ultra is at 120Hz — with the latter also having a new automatic variable refresh rate that should save on battery. The high refresh rate also leads to better S Pen latency, at 9 ms compared to 26 ms on the standard Note 20. This is perhaps the biggest letdown with the Note 20 — not having a high refresh rate display on a $1000 phone is really difficult to get past.
The Note 20 comes up short in specs and features, and has a plastic back.
The back of the Note 20 is, sadly, plastic. It's coated convincingly to look like the matte glass finish on the Ultra, but it isn't — and you know as soon as you touch them both. The frame is still metal, giving you the nice cold-to-the-touch feel and enhanced durability, but having a plastic back on a $1000 phone is disappointing. On the other hand, the Note 20 Ultra feels superb just like all of Samsung's other high-end phones.
Internally, there are two other notable changes. The Note 20 has just 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, versus 12GB and 128GB on the Ultra — with the latter adding both an SD card slot and an optional 512GB storage model. I find it incredibly odd that the Note 20 would have less RAM than the entire S20 line, even though it does have the latest Snapdragon 865+ chipset. And keeping the SD card slot and higher storage option off of the Note 20 just further points to Samsung's clear intentions with the less-expensive model: capture Note buyers on a budget.
Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra Early impressions
The Note 20 is a lovely looking phone, across all three color options, and I've long preferred the more squared-off look of the Notes to Galaxy S models. It's accentuated by the new matte textured back that won't get all smudged like the S20 series, though the camera system is still just as massive and imposing as ever. Thankfully the base Note 20 has a far smaller camera array, because it lacks the 108MP main sensor and periscope zoom lens.
Perhaps due in part to the big camera sets, Samsung has made a massive functional change to the S Pen: for the first time, it's now on the left side of the phone. When I picked up the Note 20 Ultra, my muscle memory immediately sent my right thumb to the bottom-right corner to pop out the S Pen, and it baffled me that it wasn't there. With the S Pen on the left, it's mostly covered up by the palm of your hand, and you have to shift your hand out of the way to get it.
Now this is obviously a boon for lefties (about 10% of people worldwide), but my goodness this is going to throw off every Note fan that's spent years using the S Pen in the exact same place. I'm not sure how long I'll have to use it to get over that.
When the S Pen is out of its silo, it can do more now. Building on the "Air Actions" from before, you can now use the S Pen to navigate parts of the interface with quick gestures. Press and hold the S Pen button, and you can gesture to go home or back, open the multitasking view, start a screen select, or capture a screenshot. Samsung pitches these gestures as helping you navigate your phone from several feet away, but I think they could prove to be useful for lightly navigating the interface when the S Pen is out — saving you from reaching the pen down to tap on the screen as often, especially if you use Android 10's gesture navigation system.
The Note 20's cameras, front and back, are unchanged from the S20 and S20+ — and that's a good thing. But there are changes on the Note 20 Ultra's cameras compared to the S20 Ultra — and that's even more important.
Samsung addressed two big needs in the Note 20 Ultra's cameras.
First, Samsung added a laser auto focus system. This will likely address the auto focus issues faced on the S20 Ultra's camera, which often struggled to find focus on close-up objects or in the dark, particularly with the 108MP main sensor. This isn't to say that laser is a cure-all problem, but this sensor clearly needs help. I'm happy to see it.
Next, Samsung switched up the "telephoto" system entirely. Gone is the 48MP sensor with 0.8-micron pixels, replaced by a 12MP 1-micron pixel sensor. The lens now gets you to a true 5X optical zoom (20-degree FoV), rather than 4X, and at f/3.0 will let more light in than the old f/3.5 aperture. Having one-quarter of the resolution to work with will likely reduce the quality of 20X+ photos noticeably, which is probably why Samsung cuts off zoom at 50X now. But for those 5-10X zoom shots, quality should improve with a longer starting zoom, wider aperture and larger pixels. That's a win overall.
(And just for completeness, this is your reminder that the "telephoto" camera on the Note 20, S20 and S20+ is not true optical zoom. The field of view on that "telephoto" camera is only 3 degrees narrower than the standard camera. Its zoom is almost entirely digital, whereas the Note 20 Ultra and S20 Ultra have true optical zoom.)
I obviously wasn't able to use the cameras and review their effectiveness outside of a perfectly-lit studio space, so the actual analysis of how Samsung's changes improved the experience will have to wait. But these are good, if relatively subtle, changes.
Right now, I'm left a bit puzzled by the Note 20. At $1000, it's in a very weird space. That's a whole lot of money to spend on a phone that is stuck on a 60Hz display, with 8GB of RAM as the industry — including Samsung itself! — moves well beyond that, no SD card slot, and an odd plastic back that cheapens the experience. And at the same time, other than the S Pen, it doesn't offer anything beyond Samsung's own S20 and S20+. I can see why Samsung wants to have it there as the "budget" option to the Note 20 Ultra, but I don't see who will desire buying this phone.
The Note 20 Ultra, on the other hand, has a clearer path to sales. It's debuting at $1300, which is $100 less than the S20 Ultra, yet it's an evolution of that phone. The Note 20 Ultra is roughly the same size (actually a tad shorter), is actually lighter, and has the same basic specs and capabilities — but now has laser auto focus for the camera, a refined telephoto camera, and of course an S Pen. The one downside is the battery, which is 10% smaller than the S20 Ultra — but the new variable refresh rate display may make up the difference when running the phone at 120Hz. Unless the S20 Ultra receives a ~$150 price cut, the Note 20 Ultra should completely eat its sales.
Much more to come soon
Though I wasn't provided extensive time using the phones ahead of the announcement, Samsung is distributing devices to reviewers in short order so we can get right into our usual process of evaluating them. You'll see many more thoughts on the Galaxy Note 20, and Note 20 Ultra in particular, throughout the coming weeks.
Pre-orders are already open for both phones, with some decent incentives including Samsung gift cards. Actual retail availability gets going on August 21. That gives you a little time to settle in on a decision of whether or not one of these phones could be your next upgrade.
The new flagship
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
A couple camera tweaks and an S Pen make this a compelling buy.
The Note 20 Ultra doesn't stand out considerably from the S20 Ultra, but it makes simple adjustments with camera tweaks, a variable refresh rate display, and adds an S Pen. All for $100 less.
Questionable corner cuts
Samsung Galaxy Note 20
A cheaper Note, but not necessarily one you should consider.
The Note 20 brings the latest Samsung features and an S Pen to a lower price, but the trade-offs in key specs and a plastic back make it seem like a comparatively worse value than the Note 20 Ultra.

TicWatch Pro 3
A solid option
TicWatch Pro (2020)
With Mobvoi's most recent flagship entry into the Wear OS smartwatch realm, it's worth taking a look at the newest TicWatch Pro 3 vs. TicWatch Pro (2020). Though the latter has the 2020 moniker, the Ticwatch Pro 3 is the latest and greatest from the smartwatch maker. It's the first to run the Qualcomm Snapdragon 4100 processor, but does this upgrade over the 2100 SoC really make a difference and is that all that's to the Pro 3?
TicWatch Pro 3 vs. TicWatch Pro (2020): It's about more than just silicon
Previously, Mobvoi merely swapped out the processor and called it an upgrade, as was done when the first TicWatch Pro bumped up to 1GB of RAM and became the Pro (2020). In contrast, the Pro 3 is a complete overhaul.

TicWatch Pro 3 vs. TicWatch Pro (2020): Are these watches really that different?
At a quick glance, it may not be all that apparent how different the watches genuinely are. Both the TicWatch Pro 3 and Pro 2020 share the same lineage in design with the metal and plastic casing, dual pushers on the side, and once powered up, each features a dual-layer display. However, upon closer inspection, and after using the watches, the TicWatch Pro 3 starts to outshine its predecessor.
Mobvoi has managed to enlarge the displays on the Pro 3 while at the same time making the watch thinner and way lighter. These changes don't come at the expense of battery life either. The battery in the TicWatch Pro 3 is 40% larger than the one in the Pro 2020, and it really shows in practice. While running all of the health sensors (these have been upgraded too) with 24-hour tracking and nightly sleep tracking, I got easily three-plus days of usage before topping up on the charger. None of this means that the Pro 2020 has bad battery life by any means. It still gets two days of use but, when it comes to time between charges — more is better.
Even when turning off the low power LCD, I got nearly three days between charges.
Both of these devices sport a very good film-compensated Super Twisted Nematic (FSTN) LCD panel, which is reflective and transparent. This top layer screen offers high visibility in sunlight and low power consumption. However, the Pro 3 has a much-improved version. The Dual Display 2.0 has received some style changes, a live seconds counter, and a helpful backlight.
As much as the top layer display's reflective nature is a benefit, it's also an Achilles heel because the technology requires ambient external light to be seen. So the addition of the TicWatch Pro 3 backlight allows the low power display to be visible at the lift of a wrist.
If the improved design and battery life weren't enough, daily usability on the Pro 3 is significantly improved with the Snapdragon 4100. The 1GB RAM upgrade on the TicWatch Pro (2020) solved many of its speed problems, but the difference between the Snapdragon 2100 to 4100 is huge. The Pro 3 has the same 1GB RAM but switching between screens, opening apps, scrolling through text, all goes off without a hitch.
Using Google Assistant speeds things up even further. Accessing the digital assistant from your wrist makes sense. Not needing to pull out your phone to set a reminder, ask for directions, or a question should be low friction. However, it was still sluggish and, at times, downright frustrating to use on the TicWatch Pro (2020). The Google Assistant on the TicWatch Pro 3 is finally at a place that using it is as we have always wanted.
The older TicWatch Pro does a lot of the same things that the Pro 3 does, just not as well. In the case of some health-tracking features, it can't do them at all. All of the sensors have been ugraded on the Pro 3, and Mobvoi also added in a barometer and a blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) sensor.
To go with those sensors, Mobvoi has built new apps to use them and refreshed existing apps. There's also a new app called TicHear to help monitor and alert you of overly loud external noises around you.
While on the subject of software Google is rolling out an update to Wear OS this fall that will only improve much of the operating system's daily use features. The TicWatch Pro 3 will be getting that update, but it's unclear if the Pro 2020 will see it or not.
TicWatch Pro 3 vs. TicWatch Pro (2020): Should you upgrade?
If you have the funds, you should absolutely consider an upgrade. The TicWatch Pro 3 enhances everything from the Pro 2020 and adds new features.
The watch might still be big, but it's much lighter, thinner, way faster, and the battery extends even further than before. While there may have been times when accessing something on your TicWatch Pro 2020 would come with the anticipated delay after a tap, the Pro 3 removes that delay — making quick tasks a reality, on top of using Google Assistant as intended.
TicWatch Pro 2020 is still a good watch. It gets solid battery life, performance is improved over some older devices, and the Dual Display is wonderful. However, in comparison with the Pro 3, it's not a fair fight.

Samsung is one of the biggest phone manufacturers in the world, and with good reason — it makes some pretty incredible phones, combining outstanding hardware design with long lists of handy features that differentiate its phones from the competition. The Galaxy S20 FE is the best Samsung phone you can buy right now, but there are plenty of other devices that hit different sizes and price points.
- Best Overall: Samsung Galaxy S20 FE
- Best Compact: Samsung Galaxy S20
- Best for Productivity: Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
- Best for Less: Samsung Galaxy A71
- Best Mid-range Option: Samsung Galaxy A51
- Best on a Tight Budget: Samsung Galaxy A21
1. Samsung Galaxy S20 FE: Best Overall
The Galaxy S20 FE fundamentally changes the value equation for Samsung, and is one of the best Android phones you can buy right now. The phone offers most of the same features as the regular Galaxy S20, but the fact that it is available unlocked for just $700 makes it a standout value.
The Galaxy S20 FE is powered by the same Snapdragon 865 chipset that's in the Galaxy S20 series, and you also get 5G connectivity. It offers the same excellent AMOLED screen as the S20 and has 120Hz refresh rate, making everyday interactions buttery smooth. The best part, however, is that it has the same 12MP primary sensor as the regular S20, ensuring you get the same great caliber of photos in any lighting condition.
Samsung hasn't removed any of the extras either. The Galaxy S20 FE has IP68 dust and water resistance, 15W wireless charging, and even 5W reverse wireless charging. The 4,500mAh battery lasts all day without any issues, and there's 25W wired charging as well.
The Galaxy S20 FE comes with One UI 2.5 based on Android 10 out of the box, and like the regular Galaxy S20 series, it will get three Android version updates. The only downside with the phone (if you can call it that) is that it has a polycarbonate back instead of glass, but the matte texture masks the fact that it has a plastic build. And the value you're getting here is incredible.
Pros:
- Incredible 120Hz display
- Top-end specs
- Incredible cameras
- 5G connectivity
- 4,500mAh battery with 25W fast charging
Cons:
Best Overall
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE
The best value yet from Samsung
The S20 FE has outstanding internal hardware, amazing cameras, and costs several hundred dollars less than the S20 series.
2. Samsung Galaxy S20: Best Compact
The regular Galaxy S20 is a great choice if you want a smaller device. The phone has a 120Hz AMOLED panel, is powered by the Snapdragon 865 chipset, and has that outstanding 12MP camera at the back. But the standout feature is that it is available in a size that actually fits in your hands (and pockets).
The screen is smaller than other flagships at 6.2 inches, but it's still wonderful with the same 120Hz refresh rate. The 4,000mAh battery should still be plenty for most people (when you consider the reduced power draw of the smaller panel), and you'll be able to zoom all the way up to 30x with the telephoto camera. It also still has 5G, although only sub-6 and not mmWave 5G. Otherwise, this truly is a Galaxy S20 experience through and through, with a much much manageable size and more accessible pricing.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Compact
Samsung Galaxy S20
The surprisingly pocketable member of the S20 family
The S20 excels at the basics while retaining a compact form factor that makes it ideal for one-handed use.
3. Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra: Best for Productivity
The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is Samsung's gigantic flagship. The phone has a massive 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED panel and it is powered by the latest Snapdragon 865+ chipset. You also get 12GB of RAM as standard, with storage options from 128GB to 512GB.
The Note 20 Ultra is the phone you get if you want the largest device in the market today. The large screen is ideally suited for games and consuming videos, and the 120Hz AMOLED panel has outstanding colors, delivers HDR10 content in Netflix and other streaming services, and you get stereo sound.
Then there's the stylus. If you're used to a stylus on earlier Note devices, there's plenty to like on the Note 20 Ultra. Samsung made it easier to take notes thanks to lower latency, and there are better handwriting recognition features that make the device an ultimate tool for productivity.
You also get a 108MP camera at the back along with a 12MP zoom lens that goes up to 50x hybrid zoom, 12MP wide-angle lens, and a 10MP camera at the front. There's the ability to shoot 8K video, Wi-Fi 6 and global 5G connectivity, IP68 water resistance, wireless charging, and that bold new design looks outstanding.
Look, there's nothing really missing here, and if you're looking at the best Samsung phone for productivity, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the device to get.
Pros:
- Best stylus experience on any phone
- Outstanding performance
- Large AMOLED screen
- Excellent battery life and fast charging
- Expandable storage
Cons:
Best for Productivity
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
The ultimate phone for stylus fans
If you want a large phone with a stylus and the latest hardware with 5G, the Note 20 Ultra is the obvious option.
4. Samsung Galaxy A71: Best for Less
The Galaxy A71 is one of Samsung's best phones yet — and not just in the mid-range segment. There really isn't anything missing on the device. You get a massive 6.7-inch AMOLED screen (second only to the S20 Ultra) backed by robust internal hardware, versatile quad cameras at the back with a 64MP primary sensor, and incredible battery life with 25W fast charging.
Combine that with a gorgeous design and it's easy to see why the Galaxy A71 is one of the best devices around. The phone also comes with great hardware that should hold its own for several years, and the U.S. model that's highlighted below has 5G connectivity on all U.S. carriers, which is a big deal.
Oh, and Samsung will deliver three guaranteed Android updates, and the A71 will get the update to Android 13 down the line. If you're looking for a reliable option without spending too much money, the Galaxy A71 should be at the top of your list.
Pros:
- Outstanding battery life
- Gorgeous design
- Massive AMOLED screen
- Robust internal hardware with 5G
- Great 64MP camera
Cons:
Best for Less
Samsung Galaxy A71
The best mid-ranger from Samsung yet
The Galaxy A71 has it all: a massive AMOLED screen, great internal hardware, versatile cameras, and outstanding battery life.
5. Samsung Galaxy A51: Best Mid-range Option
The Galaxy A51 continues the heritage of last year's A50 by bringing the best features that Samsung has to offer to a more attractive price point. The phone has a large 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display with vibrant colors and excellent contrast levels, and you also get a 48MP camera at the back along with a 12MP wide-angle lens, a 5MP macro lens, and a 2MP portrait module.
The design itself has also been refreshed, with the Galaxy A51 looking just as modern as the Galaxy S20 series. There's a hole-punch cutout for the front camera, and the thanks to thin bezels, the phone isn't too unwieldy to use. The A51 has a generous 4,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging, and while it isn't the fastest phone in the world, it gets all the basics right.
The best part about the Galaxy A51 is that it comes with 5G connectivity in the U.S., with the particular model featuring better internal hardware than the global version. The fact that you get to access 5G alone makes the Galaxy A51 a more enticing option, and when you consider that Samsung will deliver three Android updates to the phone, it becomes a fantastic mid-range choice.
Pros:
- Premium design
- Three guaranteed Android updates
- Vibrant AMOLED screen
- Great battery life
- Decent cameras
Cons:
Best Mid-range Option
Samsung Galaxy A51
Gorgeous design meets great cameras
With a modern design and stunning AMOLED panel and quad cameras at the back, the Galaxy A51 has a lot going for it.
6. Samsung Galaxy A21: Best on a Tight Budget
Need a good Samsung phone without spending too much money? The Galaxy A21 may just be the ideal device. The phone has a modern design that's in line with the Galaxy A51 and A71, and you get a large 6.5-inch screen — albeit one that's limited to 720p.
The phone delivers decent performance in day-to-day use, has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a decent 16MP lens at the back, and the best part is that the 4,000mAh battery lasts two days with ease. The Galaxy A21 may not have the same exciting hardware as some of Samsung's other offerings, but it holds up great in everyday use and you're getting a great value all things considered.
Pros:
Cons:
Best on a Tight Budget
Samsung Galaxy A21
A great budget option in 2020
The Galaxy A21 combines a modern design with reliable performance, outstanding battery, and feature-rich software.
The Galaxy S20 FE is the best Samsung phone of 2020
The Galaxy S20 FE is Samsung's best phone in 2020, and the default choice for people who want the best value while still getting the latest hardware. The 12MP camera takes gorgeous photos, the 120Hz AMOLED screen is sublime, it has wireless charging and IP68 water resistance, and a large 4,500mAh battery.
The Galaxy S20 FE absolutely destroys its rivals when it comes to value, and it is great to see Samsung offer such an attractive option for considerably less than its regular Galaxy S20 series. If you want a high-end phone that doesn't cost over $1,000, the Galaxy S20 FE is the default option.
On the lower end, Samsung offers the Galaxy A51, with hints of the flagship Galaxy S models trickled down to a mid-range price that can be incredibly appealing if you can't push your budget as high as the S20 FE. The Galaxy A51 has 5G connectivity and great hardware that's designed to last a few years, and it will get three guaranteed Android updates.

Pair that snazzy Galaxy S20 FE with an awesome case to keep it protected
These cases look great and will keep your Galaxy A20 protected with ease
The Samsung Galaxy A20 is a rather intriguing budget smartphone with some nifty tricks hidden up its sleeve. Today, we're taking a look at the best cases that you can get for this brand new phone.
The Galaxy A21 is a sleek device, so get a case to keep it that way
Life happens to everyone, and it ends up affecting to our smartphones at some point in time. Drops, scratches, bumps, and bruises all happen, and that’s why you’ll want to get a case for the new Galaxy A21.Over the last few months, Verizon has gotten almost all of the press surrounding real-world 5G tests in America. I've tested Big Red's Ultra Wideband 5G network in Chicago twice over the last few months, and while the second visit yielded far more impressive results than the first, one huge problem persisted through both tests: the millimeter wave technology Verizon uses for its 5G network, while incredibly fast, has very short range.
Sprint is the first carrier in the U.S. to implement sub-6, rather than millimeter wave.
This means that even though I saw Ookla speed test results in the neighborhood of 1.5 Gbps while in close proximity of a 5G node (typically between 100 and 300 feet away), that signal would quickly degrade or even drop out entirely once I started moving away. To solve this range issue, Verizon is going to need to implement a lot of 5G nodes throughout the city (and every city in which it plans to launch).
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
That's where Sprint comes in. Chicago is one of Sprint's largest markets, so it makes sense that the Windy City is one of the company's first 5G test areas. Sprint's biggest differentiator against Verizon and other 5G competitors is that it's the only carrier in the U.S. that's implementing mid-band sub-6, rather than mmWave.
Specifically, Sprint is deploying 5G over its excess 2.5GHz spectrum — the fastest of the three bands the company uses for its LTE network. This makes 5G amazingly cost-effective and easy to deploy; rather than installing entirely new hardware, Sprint is simply outfitting its existing towers with Massive MIMO equipment containing 128 antennae, divided evenly between 5G and 4G LTE. During my visit, Sprint said that its 5G network was already able to cover approximately 700,000 people.
Explaining 5G: Millimeter wave, sub-6, low-band and other terms you need to know
So what's the benefit of sub-6 in the real world? In a sense, it's the polar opposite of mmWave, which offers blisteringly fast speeds but suffers from a poor range. Right now, you won't get gigabit speeds on sub-6 — with Sprint's internal tests averaging at 328 Mbps with peak spikes of around 800 Mbps — but its signals travel much further. I've been told to expect close to a kilometer of range from each tower in Chicago, with some towers in Dallas, Texas reportedly reaching twice that distance.
Should the long-negotiated merger go through, Sprint is hoping to combine its 2.5GHz spectrum with T-Mobile's 600MHz low-band and mmWave high-band spectrums to offer massive 5G coverage under the New T-Mobile, even in rural areas.
Real-world testing
Sprint loaned me a Galaxy S10 5G to test out its 5G network across Chicago, along with a list of addresses mapping out the locations of each tower. Those locations ranged across popular spots like Merchandise Mart, Navy Pier, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and even as far west as the United Center Arena — but my favorite part of my field test is that I never needed to refer to the map.
The best part about Sprint's 5G is not having to hunt for it.
Walking around River North, there was no hunting around for a 5G signal; it was consistently just there, a dramatic improvement over my previous tests with Verizon. This is by far the biggest advantage of sub-6, and these tests marked the first time 5G has ever felt truly ready for consumers — at least, to me.
Once again, speed and latency suffer to achieve that range, since 2.5GHz doesn't travel as quickly as the high-band frequencies used by other 5G networks, and in my testing, I saw speeds around 150-200 Mbps on average. Closer to my starting point at the Magnificent Mile on Michigan Ave, I exceeded 300 Mbps quite a few times, while closer to Millennium Park I averaged about 150.
Those speeds may feel paltry when compared to the 1.5 Gbps I reached on Verizon's mmWave network, but the fact of the matter is that even 130 Mbps is far faster than most people typically see on 4G LTE — though admittedly, my colleague Sam Contreras and I were able to exceed it a few times over LTE during stops on the drive over from Indianapolis, with both AT&T and Sprint.
Sub-6 5G is also less susceptible to interference from objects like buildings, tinted glass, and trees. While testing outside one of my favorite coffee shops in Chicago, Intelligentsia off of Randolph Street, I was able to reach over 160 Mbps, while walking inside resulted in only a 20% degradation in speed.
That said, I wasn't able to get quite the same practical use from those speeds that Sprint claimed. Downloading an episode of Stranger Things 3 from Netflix — whose servers should be optimized for the 5G network — took just over a minute, rather than the mere seconds I was told to expect (yes, I'm well aware that complaining about having to wait more than 60 seconds for a high-quality, hour-long video is a bit ridiculous).
Same thing went for downloading shows and movies from Hulu, though I didn't get a chance to try downloading any apps from Samsung's Galaxy Store, which I'm told is also optimized for maximum speeds over 5G.
Is Sprint's 5G worth it?
Here's the good news: Sprint's 5G network isn't just more spread out than Verizon's, it's more aggressively priced. While Verizon plans to eventually add a $10 surcharge to the monthly bills of its 5G customers, Sprint is offering 5G at no additional cost on its Unlimited Premium plan, which offers unlimited data and 100GB of mobile hotspot along with premium memberships to services like Hulu, Amazon Prime, Tidal, and Twitch.
This means that the only entry point to using Sprint's 5G network — aside from living in one of its early test markets — is getting a 5G-capable device. At the moment, that list includes the Galaxy S10 5G, LG V50, or the HTC 5G Hub, all of which utilize Qualcomm's X50 5G modem. The X50 has support for both Sprint's and T-Mobile's 5G networks, so if/when the carriers finally merge, Sprint says you shouldn't need to buy a new device again, which is more great news. (Whether prices stay low if/when the carriers merge, however, is a topic of heavy debate.)
Sprint may not have the fastest 5G network around, but holding a consistent 5G connection all throughout River North was an entirely new experience for me, and it's one that I can't wait to see more of. If you live in the area and you've been considering a 5G phone anyway, there's really no reason not to try it out — just keep in mind that those phones are pricey, but such is the cost of living on the bleeding edge of technology.

Paired up with some of the best Galaxy S20 FE cases and you have all the protection you'll need. This new smartphone is already turning heads with its sleek design and a spec-sheet that could rival some of the best Android phones on the market.
- Screen and eye protection: ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass+
- All the glass: MP-Mall Anti-Fingerprint Tempered Glass
- Plastic works too: Supershieldz PET Film Screen Protector
- Extra backup: LK Ultra-Thin HD Tempered Glass
- Ultra-thin: OMOTON Anti-Scratch Tempered Glass
- No bubbles allowed: UniqueMe Bubble Free Tempered Glass (3-pack)
Screen and eye protection: ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass+
ZAGG makes some of the best Galaxy S20 FE screen protectors with the InvisibleShield Glass+. This screen protector is not only rated to be four times stronger than the competition but also has some benefits for your eyes. The built-in Eyesafe layer also helps to filter out the HEV blue light, making it easier on your eyes.
All the glass: MP-Mall Anti-Fingerprint Tempered Glass
Since the Galaxy S20 FE now features a plastic and aluminum build, you now have two pieces of glass to protect. With this tempered glass kit from MP-Mall, you'll get two screen protectors for the big screen, along with two more glass lens protectors for the camera module.
Plastic works too: Supershieldz PET Film Screen Protector
Although PET Film screen protectors won't do too much to protect the display from cracking, these are still useful. This package from Supershieldz includes six film screen protectors so your display should be just fine for as long as you own the Galaxy S20 FE.
Extra backup: LK Ultra-Thin HD Tempered Glass
Installing screen protectors can be quite a pain, but LK makes it easy with its Tempered Glass kit. There are three glass protectors for the front, along with three for the camera module. But the company also includes an alignment tool to make sure you get the perfect installation on the first attempt.
Ultra-thin: OMOTON Anti-Scratch Tempered Glass
Some screen protectors add too much bulk to a sleek device like the Galaxy S20 FE. That's not the case with the OMOTON Tempered Glass kit, which comes with screen protectors that add just 0.3mm of thickness. This helps to make it feel like you don't even have a screen protector installed.
No bubbles allowed: UniqueMe Bubble Free Tempered Glass (3-pack)
With the UniqueMe Bubble Free Tempered Glass kit, you'll get three screen protectors with rounded corners. The company states these will keep your display looking clear, and the oleophobic coating helps to reduce the number of fingerprints that show up. UniqueMe's screen protectors also feature a nano-automatic absorption technology to ensure that you won't have to worry about bubbles or fingerprints getting in the way of your installation.
Avoid the scratches and get the best Galaxy S20 FE screen protectors

In addition to keeping your device's display looking pristine, these also aim to help alleviate the potential eye strain from staring at your display. These screen protectors even feature "embedded ions" to help kill off most of the bacteria that can accumulate on your display.
Those who want to not only protect the main display but also want some protection for the camera module will love the MP-Mall tempered kit. There are two tempered glass screen protectors for the primary screen, but there are also two smaller protectors for the rear camera module. Installation couldn't be easier with the included instructions, and you won't have to worry about dealing with any bubbles either.

Best Overall: iRobot Roomba i7+
This is most definitely an expensive choice for your home, but it's also one of the only robot vacuums on the market that can dump its dustbin load and continue working. When you spring for the i7+, you get the vacuum and the Clean Base where dustbin loads are stored. You can also purchase a less expensive i7 vacuum on its own, but it won't be compatible with the Clean Base. iRobot designed the Clean Base's bags to hold up to 30 bins worth of debris before needing a replacement, so you can go for long stretches without cleaning up after your vacuum. One thing to note is that while the process of dumping debris into the Clean Base is super convenient, it's also very loud.
Why is this such a big pull for pet owners? Bundles of poofy fur tend to clog dustbins up faster than other debris, which forces the vacuum to stop working. But if the device can empty itself, then it can go on cleaning up after your fluffy friends. The included filter also traps 99% of pet allergens to keep your home clean. If that wasn't enough, the recharge and resume feature makes it so that if the vacuum runs out of juice, it will head to the charger. Once back to a full charge, it will continue the job where it left off.
This device uses advanced mapping skills, which allow it to survey your home and distinguish one room from another. If you want it to clean a specific room or you want it to avoid a particular area, you simply give the command on the iRobot HOME app. You can also control it using Alexa or Google Assistant. What's more, once it has mapped your home, you can place the vacuum in any room, and it will be able to tell where it is by detecting landmarks.
Pros:
- Empties its dustbin
- Traps 99% of pet allergens
- Works with Alexa and Google Assistant
- Control with iRobot HOME app
- Floor mapping and room skipping
- Recharge and resume
Cons:

iRobot Roomba i7+
A vacuum that empties its own dustbin
With this setup, you won't need to interact with your vacuum nearly as much since it empties its dustbin into the Clean Base and continues working.
Best Budget: iLife V3s Pro
If you're looking for a reliable robot vacuum that consistently and reliably takes care of pet hair, then the iLife V3s Pro is the perfect choice for you. It's the least expensive option on our list by a decent amount, and yet it has a decent battery life - up to 100 minutes on one charge. It isn't as fancy as more expensive units; for example, it can't map rooms, it doesn't work with smart home assistants, and it doesn't have an app to control it. To make it operate, there are physical buttons on the vacuum, or you can use the included remote control.
Since it specializes in hardwood and low pile carpet floors, this vacuum doesn't have any brushes. Being brush-less allows it to pick up plenty of fur without the individual hairs getting stuck in the bristles. When it runs out of power, it automatically returns to the dock and charges itself. However, if it runs out of power while it's in the middle of a cleaning job, it won't pick up where it left off once it's gotten some juice.
The best way to get rid of fur bunnies is to schedule cleaning times for when there's little to no foot traffic. Use the spot clean feature to have the vacuum attack areas that tend to get extra messy. As with any robot vacuum, you'll need to clean out the dustbin and filter regularly to keep it in proper working order.

Cons:

iLife V3s Pro
A cheap vacuum for pet hair
It runs for up to 140 minutes before needing a recharge, and you can schedule it to clean at specific times.
Best for Large Capacity: bObsweep PetHair Plus
This robot vacuum is specially designed for people with pets. It has a large dustbin capacity of 1100mL, which is more than double the average size. It will be able to store more fur, dirt, and crumbs than others on the market. As far as robot vacuums go, it's also on the cheaper side of the spectrum while still providing a quality product. For instance, it can run up to 140 minutes before needing to recharge and also features a HEPA filter to trap 99.7% of pet allergens, which will help reduce sneezing in your home.
Unlike some other devices, this one doesn't map rooms, and a smartphone cannot control it. It comes with a round remote control, which you can use to set the vacuum to a 7-day schedule. You can also use this remote to steer the device to a specific section if you want a spot cleaned. When you flip the device over, you'll find a place where you can attach a microfiber mop. Set the bObsweep to wet/dry mop mode, and it will dispense water to clean your floors more thoroughly. Don't worry. It will leave your floors plenty of dry.
The vacuum's impressive LCD screen notifies you if the device is having a problem and lets you see the current battery life. When the battery gets low, this vacuum automatically returns to its base to recharge. This purchase also includes blOck Plus, which you can use to deter Bob from entering certain areas. It comes in five different colors so you can choose the look you like best: champagne, charcoal, rouge, cobalt, or midnight.

An inexpensive vacuum for pet owners
This vacuum features long 11-inch brushes and has an extra-large dustbin to store more dirt and fur when cleaning.
Best Battery Life: Roborock S6
This robot vacuum can run up to 180 minutes and has the longest battery life of any of the devices on this list. That means it will keep cleaning for long periods and can tackle large areas. However, it also has a relatively small dustbin, so you'll need to empty it often (especially if you have a long-haired animal in your home) for it to clean effectively. This unit can be controlled in a few different ways, either by using Amazon Alexa, the Roborock app, or by pressing the physical buttons on top of the device.
In addition to vacuuming, you can use the Roborock S6 to mop your hard floors. Simply attach the mop to the bottom side. It leaves your floors relatively dry, so you don't have to worry about water damage. The thing you'll need to be wary about is that this unit cannot detect when it comes across a carpet in mop mode. You might need to move it for it to clean the proper areas. Altogether, this unit has five different modes to help you clean effectively: carpet, quiet, mopping, turbo, and max. As with most robot vacuums, it's ideal for hard floors and low-pile to medium-pile carpet.
This unit is smarter than others. It has sensors to detect ledges and obstacles, which will prevent it from falling down stairs or damaging things in your home. It also maps your house for a more thorough cleaning. It will zigzag back and forth to cover every inch of flooring instead of randomly wandering. Plus, it comes in either black or white so you can choose the look you like best.
Pros
- Runs up to 180 minutes
- Works with Alexa
- Controlled with app
- Has mop mode
- Smart mapping
- Tackles large areas
Cons

Roborock S6
A long-lasting robot vacuum
With a battery life of up to 180 minutes, this vacuum can work for long stretches before needing a recharge.
Best Dustbin: ECOVACS Deebot OZMO U2 Pro
One of the biggest problems I face when finding a good robot vacuum is dustbin shape and capacity. Sometimes a vacuum's suction is really powerful, but the inner refuse compartment is so small that the robot is relatively ineffective on my carpets. Plus, there's the gross part of emptying out those nasty furballs only to realize that you have to fish them out of the dustbin with your finger. Well, that won't be an issue with the ECOVACS Deebot OZMO U2 Pro.
To help you deal with all of the pet hair on your floors, this unit comes with a tangle-free brush as well as two different dustbins. One of the dustbins features a mop and vacuum compartment, but the other is solely an enormous 0.8-liter dustbin for vacuuming. Plus, the clamshell design on this extra-large dustbin allows it to open so wide that you'll never have a problem getting those puffy piles of pet hair to fall into your dumpster.
Now, the U2 Pro isn't perfect. While an app can control it, it doesn't map your home and uses random cleaning, so it doesn't leave perfect vacuum lines in your carpet. However, it's a lot cheaper than some other options out there and still allows you to set schedules and change various settings using the app.
Pros:
- Extra-large 0.8-liter clamshell dustbin
- Comes with "tangle-free" brush
- Runs up to 150 minutes
- Vacuums and mops
- Works with app
Cons:
Best Dustbin
ECOVACS Deebot OZMO U2 Pro
Enormous clamshell dustbin
Empty out those clumps of fur much more easily with the U2 Pro's extra-large dustbin. It's perfect for gathering giant fur balls while cleaning your floors.
Best for Corners: Neato Botvac D6
If you own pets, then you know that fur somehow manages to ball up in the corners of your home. You'll notice by looking around that most robot vacuums are circular, whereas the Neato Botvac D6 has a flat edge on one side. This allows it to dive into baseboard corners to pick up balls of fur and other litter that collect in these penned areas more effectively. It can hold up to 700mL in its dustbin, which is a little higher than average. You'll need to keep an eye on that dustbin since this unit doesn't let you know when it gets full.
It features an extra-large brush to help pick up pet hair and other litter. It also runs longer than many other devices. This device can clean for up to 120 minutes before needing a recharge. It's one of the more intelligent models as it features Wi-Fi connectivity, laser sensors, and floor mapping. The sensors allow it to detect obstacles in its path, so it's less likely to get snagged on random items along the way.
It can be controlled using Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Watch, or the Neato app. It's definitely on the more expensive side of robot vacuums. But, considering all the conveniences it offers, it's a reasonable price.
Pros:
- Large-than-average dustbin
- Floor mapping
- Runs up to 120 minutes
- Wi-Fi connected
- Works with Alexa and Google Assistant
Cons:

It's a reliable device with a larger-than-average dustbin that can clean up after your four-legged friends.
Best Quiet Mode: Eufy RoboVac 11S Max
Robot vacuums aren't the quietest things in the world — they are vacuums, after all. However, some have been designed with a quiet mode so they won't be as noisy. If your children are sleeping or you're trying not to frighten your poor four-legged friend too much, then the RoboVac 11S Max is a great option to consider. Its quiet mode is one of the best while still having the power to suck up all that pet hair.
It runs up to 100 minutes at a time so that it can tackle large sections in one cleaning. The tradeoff here is that the device doesn't have any mapping abilities. That means that it might wander around a little instead of being as thorough as other vacuums. It still does a great job of cleaning, though, and it features 10 infrared sensors to detect obstacles and ledges. This will prevent it from falling down stairs or bulldozing into your belongings.
Since it doesn't have built-in Wi-Fi, it won't work with an app, Alexa, or Google Assistant. However, it can be controlled with the included remote. To help you better clean your home, there are four different cleaning modes: Auto Mode, Edge Clean, Spot Clean, and Quick Clean. Finally, this vacuum has one of the sleekest designs of any robot vacuum we've seen. It will look good in any home.
Pros:
- Excellent quiet mode
- Runs up to 100 minutes
- Comes with remote
- Four cleaning modes
- Anti-bump/fall sensors
- Sleek design
Cons:
Best Quiet Mode
Eufy RoboVac 11S Max
A quiet vacuum for your home
When in quiet mode, this vacuum's noise level is minimal. It runs up to 100 minutes at a time and has four cleaning modes.
Best Value: Eufy RoboVac 15C Max
This is the ideal robot vacuum for pet owners who want something cheap but effective. It doesn't include all of the high-end abilities of some of its competitors, but it does have built-in Wi-Fi, and it's great at sucking up pet hair. You'll be able to control it using the EufyHome app or by giving voice commands to Alexa or Google Assistant. There's even a remote control included in the box if you'd prefer that method.
It has a good battery life of up to 100 minutes, which means it will be able to tackle large sections of your home in each go. You won't find any mapping abilities with this unit or the ability to set up virtual barricades. However, it does employ 10 infrared sensors to detect stair ledges or objects in its path. This way, it can avoid falling to its doom or ramming into your belongings.
Perhaps the most convenient feature is the ability to set up cleaning schedules. This way, you can have the unit cleaning your home while you're away or doing other tasks. I also love the look of this vacuum. It will clean your home without being an eyesore. With its sleek design and range of abilities, it's one of the best buys for your money.
Pros:
- Works with EufyHome app
- Compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant
- Runs up to 100 minutes
- Comes with remote
- Anti-bump/fall sensors
- Set cleaning schedules
Cons:

This device isn't costly, but it still comes with an app for you to control it with. It's also compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant.
Best Dustbin Removal: Samsung POWERbot R7065
Robot vacuums operate more effectively when the filters and dustbins are clean. For this reason, being able to empty the dustbin and filter on your robot vacuum quickly makes it more convenient to keep your device running effectively. Unlike many other companies that hide the dustbin, Samsung's robot vacuum has a top-loading dustbin that pops out at the press of a button. This makes it so you can easily see how full of pet hair the container is without stopping the device or opening any lids.
Price-wise, this is a mid-range option due to its advanced Wi-Fi abilities. It will map your home, making it easier to cover every inch of your floor. You'll be able to control it or monitor its progress using the SmartThings app. Cleaning sessions can also be started by giving voice commands to Alexa or Google Assistant.
Unfortunately, the battery life of this device isn't the best. It will only run for up to 90 minutes. However, it does have a recharge and resume feature, which means that it will return to its dock when the battery is low and then return cleaning where it left off once it's recharged. Admittedly, this isn't the prettiest vacuum you'll find, but the top-load dustbin and Wi-Fi capabilities make it a great option for pet owners.
Pros:
- Easy dustbin access
- Mapping
- Compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant
- Works with SmartThings app
- Recharge and resume cleaning
Cons:

Unlike other robot vacuums, this one has a top-load dustbin, which is easily removed.
Best Suction: Shark ION R85
My cat is the sloppiest eater on this planet. Her cat food falls to the floor all around her bowl and makes a scattered mess. If you also have a messy four-legged eater, then you'll want to consider the Shark ION R85. It's a powerful device that can suck up a lot more debris than many other robot vacuums. It's perfect for sucking up dry pet food and fur.
It also features a larger-than-average dustbin that can hold up to 0.6 liters of rubbish. That way, it will be able to cover more areas before needing to be emptied. You'll be able to control this vacuum using the Shark Clean app. There you'll receive updates, notifications, and can set a cleaning schedule for your home.
While this device has plenty of features, it can't map your home. This means you won't be able to send it to specific areas of the house for a cleaning. However, it does feature sensors to help it detect walls, objects, and ledges. It will be able to find its way around your home even if it isn't in as orderly a fashion as some other vacuums.
Pros:
- Powerful vacuum
- Large dustbin
- Comes with app
- Works with Alexa and Google Assistant
- Cleaning schedule
Cons:
Best Suction
Shark ION R85
Heavy-duty suction for pet messes
This vacuum has a far more powerful suction than many others, making it ideal for cleaning up fur and pet food. It also has a large dustbin.
Best Dirt Detection: iRobot Roomba 980
When your pet comes back in after playing outside, he usually tracks dirt and dust particles with him. Keeping the area around your cat's litter box clean is also a daunting task since they can track it everywhere. This can leave high-traffic areas like your entryway or kitchen pretty filthy. If you want something that can hone in on these messes for a more thorough cleaning, you should consider the iRobot Roomba 960. It uses Dirt Detect Technology and powerful suction to find and focus in on dirty areas.
This device is definitely on the pricey side, but it has several advanced features to warrant the cost. For one thing, it has built-in Wi-Fi, so you can control it using the app or by giving a voice command to a smart home aid like Alexa or Google Assistant. It also maps out your home so it will vacuum in orderly lines rather than just zooming from one random location to another. Using the app, you can set the device to clean at times that are most convenient for your household.
This isn't the quietest device out there, but it's also not the loudest. Just note that it will make a decent amount of noise when running, especially when on its highest settings. Additionally, it doesn't come with a remote. You'll need to rely on your smartphone to control it. Whether or not that's an issue will vary depending on your personal preference. All in all, this is a mighty vacuum that can help zone in on dirty areas.
Pros:
Cons:

Best Object Avoidance: ECOVACS Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI
I don't know about your pets, but my dog likes to leave her chew toys and bones scattered all over the place. This makes it so that robot vacuums tend to get tripped up or stuck as they go about picking the fur out of my floors. Fortunately, that's where the ECOVACS Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI comes in handy.
In addition to vacuuming in a back and forth fashion and allowing you to set up no-go zones, this unit features a dual-camera system. This allows it to detect obstacles better and effectively avoid them. It can even recognize certain objects like shoes or large cables and mark them on the in-app map. As an added perk, the app allows you to control the robot and view the camera feed from anywhere, which effectively turns the T8 AIVI into a controllable pet camera that you can use to check on your good little boys and girls while away. If you notice that someone has broken into your house, use the vacuum to chase them down and then yell through the microphone for them to get out.
If you're willing to pay a bit more, the T8 AIVI is also compatible with an Auto-Empty Station, which sucks the fur and debris from the robot's dustbin right into the station's vacuum bag. That way, you only have to empty the dustbin debris about once a month. With all of these conveniences, this really is one of the best robot vacuums for pets.

Robomaid
There are hundreds of robot vacuums on the market, but only some of them work well enough to function in a house full of furry pets. When making your choice, you'll want to consider cost, how large the vacuum's dustbin is, how long the battery life lasts, how well it sucks up pet hair, and any additional convenience features.
We highly recommend the iRobot Roomba i7+ since it can dump its dustbin into the included Clean Base and continue working without you needing to do anything. That means that when it fills up with Fluffy's fur, it can dump the load and go back to cleaning your house instead of waiting for you to clean it out. It's Wi-Fi-connected and can be controlled using the iRobot HOME app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. Since it has such an advanced mapping ability, you can explicitly tell the vacuum which rooms to clean and which ones to avoid for a tailored cleaning experience.
How to choose the best robot vacuum
Finding a robot vacuum that efficiently sucks up pet hair and offers additional conveniences can be a difficult chore. If you have a dog, you'll want something that can handle in-depth dirt removal, and if you have a cat, you'll likely want something that can pick up kitty litter as well. Here are some things to help you find the best robot vacuum for your furry needs.
Battery Life
Chances are if you have a pet that you probably have a ton of fur scattered through your home. It tends to gather along baseboards, in your carpet, and especially in corners. Having a vacuum with long battery life ensures that more of your house gets cleaned in one stretch. The best vacuums also have a charge and resume feature to get every section.
Both the Roborock S6 and the ECOVACS Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI are great options for anyone with a large home. They can clean for up to 180 minutes at a time. If either unit runs out of juice, they will head back to the dock. Once recharged, they will finish up their cleaning schedule. Since they both map your house, they do a more thorough cleaning than many other vacuums.
The bObsweep PetHair Plus has an impressive run time of up to 140 minutes. It's one of the rare vacuums that has a display on the top of the unit. If it's nearby, you can glance down and easily see how much battery life it has left.
If you're having issues keeping the corners of your home cleaned and you have a lot of floor to cover, you should look into the Neato Botvac D6. It runs up to 120 minutes at a time, and it's "D"-shaped design allows it to more easily suck up dust and debris from the corners of your home.
Best robot vacuums for pet hair, ranked by Battery Life
- Roborock S6 - 180 mins
- ECOVACS Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI - 180 mins
- bObsweep PetHair Plus - 140 mins
- Neato Botvac D6 - 120 mins
- iRobot Roomba i7+ - 120 mins
- iRobot Roomba 980 - 120 mins
Dustbin Capacity
In addition to long battery life, you want a vacuum with a decent sized dustbin. The average dustbin capacity is 0.5 liters, so anything above that is really nice.
The bObsweep PetHair Plus blows all other devices out of the water with its 1.1-liter dustbin. This makes it ideal for homes with multiple pets or pets with long fur. As we saw before, it also has an impressive battery life. That means it will be able to run for long stretches and pick up more fur before needing to be emptied.
In addition to Neato Botvac D6's impressive 0.7-liter container, this vacuum's shape allows it to clean corners better than many of its competitors. That way, all of those fur piles gathering at the edges of your room will actually get sucked up.
There's a three-way tie for the third-best dustbin capacity, with the iRobot Roomba i7+, Eufy RoboVac 15C Max, and Eufy RoboVac 11S Max all being able to hold 0.6 liters. However, the iRobot Roomba i7+ has the edge over Eufy's vacuums. This self-emptying vacuum dumps its loads into the included cleaning base and then continues vacuuming. The cleaning base holds up to 30 dustbin loads, so you won't have to take the rubbish to the trash nearly as frequently.
Best robot vacuums for pet hair, ranked by Dustbin Capacity
- bObsweep PetHair Plus - 1.1 L
- Neato Botvac D6 - 0.7 L
- iRobot Roomba i7+ - 0.6 L
- Eufy RoboVac 15C Max - 0.6 L
- Eufy RoboVac 11S Max - 0.6 L
Smarts and Conveniences
Having a smart vacuum can seriously make your cleaning experience easier, but there are additional conveniences that can make a vacuum more appealing.
The iRobot Roomba i7+ is by far the most convenient device on this list. Its unique self-emptying ability allows it to dump up to 30 dustbin loads into the cleaning base without you having to do anything. Additionally, this vacuum maps your house to cover every possible inch of floor. Should the device run out of juice, it will recharge at the dock and then resume cleaning. You can control and monitor it using an app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant.
The Roborock S6 is also a device with extra conveniences. It maps your home for a thorough cleaning, and you can set virtual boundaries if you don't want it to go somewhere. When it reaches 19%, it returns to its dock and charges up before resuming its cleaning schedule. You can control it using an app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. You can even have it mop your floors by attaching the proper accessories.
When your pets track in dirt or litter, it helps to have a robot vacuum that can narrow in on the debris. That's where the iRobot Roomba 980 comes in handy. It employs Dirt Detect Technology, so it knows when to focus in on specific messy areas of your floors instead of simply passing over them once. It also maps your home and can be controlled using the app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant.

Price (lowest to highest)
If you're simply looking for a frugal option to help you clean up after your beloved pets, then it helps to know which vacuums can suck up fur without costing too much. Just be aware that you typically pass up certain conveniences by choosing less expensive units.
The iLife V3s Pro is the least expensive device that still works well in pet homes. It doesn't come with an app, but you'll still be able to control it using the included remote. Additionally, since it doesn't map your home, it will bounce around randomly, but it will do a good job cleaning the ground it covers. Just note that this device is specifically meant for hard floors and low-pile carpets.
Despite being the second most inexpensive vacuum, you can start the Shark ION R85 using the included app. You can also set cleaning schedules or control the unit using Alexa or Google Assistant. This is a powerful device that can suck up fur and debris like dry pet food or cat litter. The tradeoff is that it doesn't map your home.
Eufy's RoboVac 11S Max is a great little device for the money. It doesn't have an app, but it comes with a remote so you can control it from a distance. It features four cleaning modes to clean your floors better and has a sleek design. Just note that it doesn't map your home, so that it won't clean every inch of the floor like some other options.

Oculus Quest 2 vs. original Oculus Quest
Is it even worth upgrading to the newest version of the Oculus Quest? In short: definitely. Along with a processor that is three generations newer than the one inside the original Oculus Quest, the Oculus Quest 2 features enhanced ergonomics, a significantly higher-resolution display, a new lens design, redesigned controllers, and more. Best of all, the headset is smaller and lighter to make longer gaming sessions more comfortable. Not to mention, its regular price comes in at $100 less than the original Oculus Quest.
If you want to learn more about all the upgrades inside the Oculus Quest 2, check out our review of the Oculus Quest 2 where it scored a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars and our "The Best" badge of recommendation.

Disney+
The original streamer
Netflix
Disney+ offers some of the highest rated movies and shows in the world. Its monthly subscription fee is cheaper and it offers an annual fee that can save consumers even more. It will be the only source for the vast majority of Disney owned content at launch with even more content leaving Netflix over the next couple years. If you were only going to pick one streaming service, Disney+ would be the winner for most folks, but the coming "streaming wars" aren't a zero-sum game.
Prices and features
If you're picking one of these streaming plans over the other, chances are that it's about not being able to justify paying for two streaming services, and in this regard Disney has been very aggressive with its pricing against Netflix's trio of plans. Whereas 4K streaming and four concurrent streams needs the $16/month Netflix Premium, you can pay half that price for the same 4K streaming and four concurrent streams on Disney+ — or less than half if you opt for the yearly billing rather than monthly.
|Disney+||Netflix Basic||Netflix Standard||Netflix Premium|
|Price||$7/mo||$9/mo||$13/mo||$16/mo|
|Trial period||7 days||30 days||30 days||30 days|
|HD streaming||✔️||❌||✔️||✔️|
|4K streaming||✔️||❌||❌||✔️|
|Concurrent streams||4||1||2||4|
|Profile limit per account||7||5||5||5|
$70/year
Disney+'s trial period is shorter than Netflix's, but that won't be nearly as big a deciding factor for most of us as opposed to the high number of concurrent streams and user profiles. Netflix's five-profile limit has been a huge limitation for larger families, and Disney+ allowing for seven profiles gives families more breathing room rather than forcing the kids to all share a single Kids profile.
4K streaming is included for all Disney+ subscribers, but, unfortunately, 4K streaming won't be available on quite as many devices as Netflix because Disney+ won't be available on quite as many platforms as Netflix is. This isn't surprising; after all Netflix comes on just about every TV, Blu-ray player, and entertainment console sold in America today. Disney+ does have a few blemishes on the platform front since it won't be on Fire TV devices.

While Chromecast means it won't be hard to get Disney+ onto a TV, not having apps for most major smart TVs at launch will be inconvenient for users that are used to just hitting the Netflix button on their remotes and getting their binge on. Disney's engineers are working to bring Disney+ to more platforms, but that takes time and these are all we've got at launch. It won't be able to compete with Netflix in that regard for a while.
Content: A tale of two massive media libraries
Having been in the streaming business as long as Netflix has, it makes sense that its library would dwarf most, if not all of the competition. While Netflix has had a noticeable bite taken out of its library with Disney opting not to extend its contracts, Netflix still has over 47,000 episodes of television shows and over 4,000 movies. At launch, Disney+ will have about 7,500 episodes of television shows and about 500 movies, less than a fifth the size of Netflix's library.
|Platform||Disney+||Netflix|
|Films available||500+||4,000+|
|TV series available||7,500+ episodes||47,000+ episodes|
|Notable Original Series||The Mandalorian||Stranger Things|
|Notable Films||Captain Marvel||The Irishman|
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier
Bojack Horseman
Narcos
Star Wars Episode I-VIII
Every Disney theatrical animated film
El Camino
Roma
That said, as anyone who's every surfed Netflix will no doubt tell you, that massive library doesn't mean much if most of it's trash. While there are thousands of titles absolutely worth losing days and nights of your short life to on Netflix, you'll have to dig through about 2-3 times the chaff to get to the kernels of goodness.
The quality ratio on Disney is much higher than Netflix, especially if you have a child or child-at-heart in the house.
Disney's got plenty of old (mostly live action) films on Disney+ that probably aren't worth the server space they're taking up, but the quality ratio on Disney is much higher than Netflix, especially if you have a child or child-at-heart in the house.
Disney+ isn't just for kids, though: some of the biggest blockbusters on the planet are on here like Avengers: Infinity War, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avatar, Black Panther, Toy Story 3, Pirates of the Carribean — films that drew in just as many adults as they did kids. The most hotly anticipated show on Disney+ is The Mandalorian, a gritty dark Star Wars series about bounty hunters and lawlessness after the collapse of the Empire, something you wouldn't really want to show your kids.
Netflix has a huge, if slightly shrinking, amount of content for you to watch, but Disney+ has it beat on average quality. If you prefer to mostly watch mature content, you'd probably be better off with Hulu, but considering you can get Hulu, ESPN+, and Disney+ for less than a Netflix Premium subscription, Disney still comes out ahead in that fight.
So, Disney+ or Netflix?
Both of these streaming services will provide countless hours of entertainment and both will offer programming the other cannot. As a result, many will choose to pay for both. Fortunately, with the number of ways you can get Disney+ or Netflix included with another service, you may not have to choose at all:
- If you're a T-Mobile customer, you can already get Netflix for free.
- If Verizon is your current wireless provider, you can get a year of Disney+ for free.
- Disney will be offering a bundle of Disney+, ESPN+, and basic Hulu for $13/month on Nov. 12, which is less than Netflix's 4K Premium plan.
There's definite benefits and pitfalls to both services, but in the cordcutting age, Netflix and Disney+ are going to be fighting for your screen time more than they're fighting for your money. You can subscribe to both services and still pay far less than cable, but at the end of the day, you can only watch one stream at a time, and for at least the next few months. Disney+ has my eyeballs and undivided attention as I dive into all the old TV shows I haven't been able to find online since they stopped airing in the late 90's.
Coming for the crown
Disney+
The newest streaming service is changing the game.
Disney+ is taking hold of its own streaming destiny and offering an unparralled selection of content from Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and beyond. It's still working through its learning curve, but even at launch it's quite the tantalizing temptation.

It provides an untethered VR experience and makes it easy to jump into VR. But the original Oculus Quest is dated and surpassed in almost every way by its successor, the Oculus Quest 2.
If you're shopping for a VR headset during Prime Day, don't be tempted by any sales you see on the original Oculus Quest. When it comes to pricing, features, and getting the best VR experience you can on the Oculus platform, you shouldn't grab an original Oculus Quest.
Hardware, features, and graphics
As you'd expect from a next-generation headset, the Oculus Quest 2 improves upon the original Oculus Quest in several ways. The Oculus Quest 2 has a much newer processor, a better display, more RAM, and options for more storage than the original Oculus Quest. The Oculus Quest 2 is also lighter, more ergonomic, and has a refined design that makes it more comfortable when compared to its predecessor.
We have a complete breakdown of the Oculus Quest 2 vs. the Oculus Quest, but in short, the Oculus Quest 2 wins out in just about every category. All of the improvements seen in the Oculus Quest 2 result in a greatly improved overall experience, including much better graphics. Again, that should be expected when moving from one generation to the next, but the Oculus Quest 2 is a nice generational jump.
Pricing
While it's normal for newer hardware to beat out the generation before it, there's often an argument to grab an older generation of a device to save some money. For example, a smartphone that's a year old might do everything you need it to and only be slightly behind a newer model. Grabbing an older smartphone can save you hundreds without sacrificing much. That isn't the case with the Oculus Quest 2.
The starting price of the Oculus Quest 2, $299, is $100 less than that the original Oculus Quest. That means that even if you found an original Oculus Quest for $100 off, which hasn't happened often up to this point, you'd be paying the same price for an older model than the much better Oculus Quest 2. Even if the original Oculus Quest was $150 or $200 off, you'd still only be saving a little bit to get an aging device.
You get more value for money with the Oculus Quest 2
If you already have an Oculus Quest, it's still a nice VR headset. Just because the Oculus Quest 2 improves upon the original doesn't mean the original isn't nice. The original Oculus Quest will be able to play all Oculus Quest games going forward, at least for the foreseeable future. Like the Oculus Quest 2, the original Oculus Quest also has access to Oculus Link, allowing you to play PCVR games.
The main reason to not grab the original Oculus Quest on Prime Day is that the Oculus Quest 2 provides a better experience for a better price. You'd have to find a absurdly unlikely deal on the original Oculus Quest to justify grabbing it now over the Oculus Quest 2.

Based on the legendary title of the same name from 1997, a potential Final Fantasy VII Remake had been rumored for well over a decade before finally breaking cover at E3 back in 2015. The fact that it's finally here, now, fully realized in 2020 feels almost like a dream.
Final Fantasy VII's remake is virtually without precedent. While we have seen games remade over the years, arguably none were as beloved, as iconic, and as potentially large and complex as Final Fantasy VII, which was in its own right a sprawling, multi-faceted RPG of its heyday. I personally regard Final Fantasy VII on the PlayStation 1 as the game that got me into gaming, elevating it from a toy to something I saw more of a passion or an art form.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
It is with that in mind that I was immediately skeptical of Final Fantasy VII Remake. I've been disappointed with the franchise's recent efforts, from the clunky combat and odd story of Final Fantasy XV, alongside the general incoherency of Final Fantasy XIII. Surely FFVII Remake was destined to be something of a cash-in, rather than a true homage that pays respect to a true legend. Thank the stars that I was wrong.
What Square Enix has achieved with Final Fantasy VII is nothing short of staggering. Not a single stone was left unturned. The team meticulously included virtually every detail from the Midgar setting I could possibly remember, along with many that I didn't, while including new ones that weave beautifully to complete the whole.
It's obvious this is the product of a team that not only gets the essence of Final Fantasy VII but also gets the love people have for this fabled title.
This is Final Fantasy VII Remake, which will surely be remembered as one of this generation's most incredible RPGs.
GOTY contender
Final Fantasy VII Remake
Bottom line: A masterpiece of nostalgic goodness, here to top the RPG pile once again.
Pros:
- Satisfying and deep combat
- Stunning boss battles
- Great characters, both new and returning
- Excellent performance and visuals
- 40 hours+ campaign
Cons:
- Red XIII wasn't playable, grr
- "Hard" difficulty should be unlocked from the start, as "Normal" isn't too challenging
Final Fantasy VII Design, performance, and audio
As a remake, Final Fantasy VII had a lot of source material to draw from when it came to art direction, while also being constrained by fan's expectations and decades of nostalgia and hype. Despite the challenges, Square Enix pulls through, elevating the iconic franchise to all-new heights in the process.
Final Fantasy VII aims high and consistently delivers.
With 4K resolution, stunning HDR lightning, and industry-leading effects and combat choreography, Final Fantasy VII aims high and consistently delivers. The game is light on loading sequences too, although there is the gratuitous use of artificial choke points that slow Cloud down so new assets can stream in. I played on the PlayStation 4 Pro and didn't see a single instance of frame rate struggles, hitching, screen tearing, or any other type of performance degradation. The trade-off is, of course, immersion. You're very rarely taken away from the experience, but I'll take that over a loading screen where possible.
Fans of the original musical score are also in for a real treat, with piles of nostalgic tracks remixed and reimagined, but that also preserve the essence of the original compositions. Each area has a signature theme, complete with a battle theme that ramps up and down in intensity as the battles rage on. It is impossibly good.
The game also has a few cheeky nods throughout to sound effects and other auditory cues from the original. Barret hums the victory theme for example, which is endearing. When awards season rolls around for video game music, I wouldn't be surprised if Final Fantasy VII cleans house.
However, it's in the set-pieces and character designs where Final Fantasy VII shines the most. Final Fantasy VII has a truckload of characters, monsters, and locations, and each one feels like they were a labor of love. The characters look like an amalgam of the cartoony silhouettes of the original, blended with the stylized realism from the movie Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The result is gorgeous, and engaging, and speaks to the imagination of everyone who experienced the original games.
Sure, some ambient NPCs lose some fidelity over their main character counterparts, and texture compression can be very aggressive at times, particularly in some of the more complex areas. When it comes to art and design, though, there's virtually nothing to complain about. They nailed it.
Final Fantasy VII Story delivery (spoiler-free)
Final Fantasy VII has spawned movies, spin-off titles, and enjoys a massive fandom for its characters and plot threads. Remaking something as large as this has clearly been no easy undertaking, which goes towards explaining why the full tale will be told across multiple games, rather than one.
For this first installment, Final Fantasy VII Remake retraces the steps Cloud Strife made in the dystopic cyberpunk urban hell of Midgar. Despite being fully-voiced and expressive, with some truly incredible facial motion capture (wait 'til you see the evil scientist Hojo later on), somehow the game still captured the essence of the story delivery of the original. Without spoiling it for those who didn't play the original, and for those who want to avoid new plot details (and yes, there are new plot details), Final Fantasy VII tells the story of Avalanche, an eco-activism group that fights against Shinra Inc., which uses advanced technology to bleed the planet of resources to produce energy.
Midgar is something of a technocracy, governed by the company rather than a parliament or royalty. Everything is about money and power, with those who go against the grain finding themselves living life in the slums, beneath the steel plate that separates Midgar's over-city from the pollution that spews out of the energy reactors.
Cloud is an ex-SOLDIER, part of Shinra's elite forces, who has effectively gone rogue. He joins up with Avalanche as a mercenary to help them bomb some Mako energy reactors, putting a dent in Shinra's plans. As you might expect, things get messy quite quickly, and Cloud finds himself bound up in a bigger plot that has implications for the entire planet.
Despite being a small slice of the full story from the original, Square Enix went all-out recreating every detail, including every character, while sprinkling in new ones here and there. The new ones are no slouch either. The seedy slum entertainment hub Wall Market's new gangsters, like the burlesque Honeybee Inn club owner Andrea Rhodea, fit right in with the salacity and sleaze of the Vegas-like strip, while a trio of bumbling recurring bandits inject some slapstick comedy as you pass between sectors.
It even added more to Midgar, which was a comparatively small part of the original, told through blue text boxes and static backgrounds. It was all tied together with some, at least at the time, cutting-edge CGI cinematics, alongside award-winning music from Nobuo Uematsu. For Final Fantasy VII Remake, Square Enix beefed up and fleshed out the steel metropolis, taking the vast majority of those text-based conversations and turning them into fully-realized in-engine cutscenes, with truly jaw-dropping animation and art.
The game also explores some of the gray morality in Avalanche's eco-terrorism, as well as some of the character's reservations about their actions. The new elements came across as a breath of fresh air, replacing nothing, and only adding to the overall spread.
Plot details that seemed unimportant in the original end up being fleshed out and more realized in this one, too, giving minor characters far more depth in the process. The emotional impact of previously relatively inconsequential moments from the original gets dialed-up into major, pivotal moments in this one, with added benefits from emotional character acting.
It's tough to really go into the story in-depth without getting spoiler-ish. Truly, though, despite knowing almost everything that was going to happen, no game since The Witcher 3 has given me goosebumps through its plot delivery as frequently as this one.
Final Fantasy VII Gameplay
Final Fantasy VII's new combat system was perhaps something I had the most reservations about as a long-time fan of the franchise, but I grew to love it.
Final Fantasy VII recreates elements of the "ATB" system from the original, weaving it remarkably well into something more reminiscent of the impressively choreographed fight sequences from Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. It's impressively intuitive, and probably the best combat system the franchise has spawned in the best part of a decade.
It's probably the best combat system the franchise has spawned in the best part of a decade.
In the game you get access to four playable characters, up to three at any one time in your party, depending on the story. Barret wields a gun for an arm, while Tifa beats enemies down with martial arts. Of course, Cloud has his iconic claymore, and Aerith wields a staff with light magic. You can augment and tailor each character's playstyle, typically favoring magic, regular attacks, or a combination of the two.
In combination with the new stagger system, Final Fantasy VII's combat is as satisfying as it is customizable, without being pigeonholed into specific roles at any given time.
Different types of gear yield different types of bonuses, allowing you to specialize your characters in different ways. Weapons also "level up" and gain additional bonuses. If you like a particular weapon skin or style, you can ensure it remains a competitive option by setting up your Materia and other gear pieces around it.
Speaking of which, Materia is Final Fantasy VII's magic system, which also forms a major part of the game's plot. Socketing Materia into your gear will grant you additional abilities and sometimes bonuses. Unfortunately, slots are finite, forcing you to make choices about what to use and when.
For my playthrough, I made Cloud a bit of a hybrid, able to use a bit of magic while emphasizing his melee attacks. Each character gets a range of unique abilities alongside their usable Materia. Cloud can melee attack using his sword, for example, while Barret is adept at dealing with foes at a range. Regardless of how you set up your characters, you can always take advantage of weaknesses in enemies. Cloud's sword attacks will still deal monstrous amounts of damage to a staggered enemy, even if you've designed him to be more of a caster. Some Materia even have additional benefits beyond simply dealing damage. Aero is wind magic, for example, and even if Cloud's magic attack is weak, Aero will still pull enemies towards you, helping you to more quickly gain ground. Weaving attacks between blocking and dodge rolling is key to victory, alongside learning enemy attack patterns and weaknesses.
Where Final Fantasy VII gets really interesting is in its boss fights. Not only are they incredible set-pieces that showcase truly wonderful designs, but they also weave seamlessly with in-engine cutscenes in a way that feels unique and elegant. Many games have tried to do something like this, even past Final Fantasy games, but this feels like a cut above. I thoroughly expect Final Fantasy VII to become a trendsetter in this regard. Summoning Materia feeds into this too, which allows you to call forth some of the franchise's legendary spirits to aid you in major boss battles, resulting in spectacular showcases of flame and ice.
Some of the boss battles will have you agape with awe
The overall design of the combat system is slick and satisfying. The combat makes you feel like you're the choreographer of a real-time big-budget anime movie. And honestly, I'm only scratching the surface here.
Finding all of those boss battles and those gear pieces will require a lengthy journey through Midgar's winding slums, monster-infested sewers, and rusty scrap heaps. The world is laid out similarly to the original, with small population hubs bustling with NPC activity, commenting on the current story beats while going about their daily business. Some may offer side-objectives that take you into some of the game's more dangerous areas, populated with monsters driven mad or mutated by the Mako pollution. Pushing ahead with the story may prevent you from accessing some of these side-objectives in the future, but upon completion, you're able to return to any previous chapter to tie up any loose ends or hunt down collectibles. FFVII is a beefy game, which offered me 42 hours of playtime for completing every quest and side-objective. If you speed through the main story ignoring everything else, you're still probably looking at around 25-30 hours.
Even while gunning for every quest, the game had great pacing between slower, story-driven sequences and jaunts through enemy-strewn dungeons, which often culminate in a boss battle from the game's returning cast. I don't want to spoil surprises, but Final Fantasy 7 is brimming with boss battles, accompanied by virtually every enemy monster from the previous Midgar experience, at least in some way. Some of the game's unique regular enemies from yesteryear return, too, all elevated to boss status. I don't want to spoil surprises, but some of the boss battles will have you agape with awe.
Most of the sidequests were fairly simple, and primarily tasked you to go somewhere and fight something, but all of those fights were so satisfying that it never felt like a chore. Some of them came with compelling rewards too. Notably, the citizens of the quest hubs remark upon your victories. Kids in the Sector 5 slum, for example, start running around with cardboard swords trying to emulate Cloud if you help them, which shows a warm attention to detail. The game is full of careful, thoughtful details like that that will make you feel more connected than ever to Cloud's story.
I will say that I have some reservations about what Square Enix may be planning to do with the episodic format of the game and how that might impact key plot elements from the original, but it didn't detract from my experience. Right now, I'm just desperate for more.
Final Fantasy VII Should you buy it?
Yes. Final Fantasy VII Remake is quite easily one of the best RPGs of this generation, with endlessly satisfying combat, stunning art in a large world, a dazzling cast of characters, and heaps of nostalgic goodness wrapped neatly in a fulfilling RPG package.
Final Fantasy VII Remake is quite easily one of the best RPGs of this generation.
What really crowns Final Fantasy VII is the meticulous detailing, which is in service of the game's fans. Every quirky little feature, mini-game, oddball conversation, and side-character got at least some time to shine, which shows a level of appreciation few other remakes have even tried to reach for. It also speaks a little to things that we've lost as game budgets have ballooned over time — the finer (maybe stranger) details that give a game its character, outside of the loops that keep us "engaged."
It has simply been amazing to retread this legendary game through the lens of a powerful modern gaming system and is quite honestly something I never thought I'd see happen.
Even if you haven't played Final Fantasy VII before, this is heaps and bounds the best the franchise has been in years. The combat system is fun and functional instead of just flashy, and the plot and characters are relatable, rather than overly philosophical or metaphysical.
Final Fantasy VII defined a generation back in 1997, and it has returned to do so again in 2020.

This dual-band router is capable of 4804Mbps on its 160MHz wide 5GHz band and eight streams. The 2.4GHZ band adds another 1,148Mbps, adding up to the full AX6000 rated speed. 4x4 MU-MIMO keeps speeds high on multiple devices by allowing multiple simultaneous client connections.
Eight high-performance antennas allow this router to cover a large four-bedroom house easily. You can also connect an entire home office or home theater area thanks to the eight Ethernet ports open to devices. It's also a great fit for simplifying a home network that already has multiple Ethernet runs since you won't need to rely on additional switches.
TP-Link has a great software package included thanks to its HomeCare suite. HomeCare antivirus adds additional security to your network stopping attacks and malicious sites before they even reach your computer. It also comes with advanced parental controls and QoS by application support.
Make no mistake, this router is large and its eight antennas flanking the sides help it stand out even more. With a square footprint with a 10.3-inch side, this router will take up a lot of space on a desk or shelf. Still, for the number of features packed in, it's an impressive router.

While it manages to cover up to 1,700 square feet on its own, it also works with any of the Linksys Velop mesh routers or even another MR7350 to add more coverage. This can be a great way to help your network grow with your needs or if you find any areas with a weak signal. It comes in an understated black housing with two antennas around back.
Setup is simple thanks to the Linksys App including remote access. This is also where you can set up the included parental controls and you'll have access to Linksys' 24/7 support to help you if you run into any issues.

3. Asus RT-AX86U
The best Wi-Fi 6 router for gaming on a budget
Bottom line: If you're a gamer looking for a fantastic router experience, the Asus RT-AX86U is a fantastic option — as long as you have the room (it's pretty big).
- Top speeds: 4804Mbps @ 5Ghz, 861Mbps @ 2.4Ghz

The Asus RT-AX86U is a fast AX5700 dual-band gaming router with a 2.5G WAN port and great software to keep your connection fast.
4. Asus RT-AX92U
The best Wi-Fi 6 router for homes with lots of devices
Bottom line: The Asus RT-AX92U has a dedicated backhaul channel, allowing traffic between devices to travel on a separate internal highway without interference. If you're the type with dozens of Wi-Fi devices in your home, this is a perfect option for you.
- Top speeds: 4804Mbps @ 5Ghz Wi-Fi 6, 867Mbps @ 5Ghz Wi-Fi 5, and 400Mbps @5GHz
- Top features: Tri-band, 4x Ethernet ports, 2x USB ports, AiMesh support
Pros:
- Tri-band connection with a dedicated Wi-Fi 6 band
- AX6100 speeds are fast enough for just about anything
- AiMesh compatibility makes adding coverage a breeze
- Adaptive QoS for gamers
Cons:
- Large and imposing
- Speeds not super fast compared to competition
The Asus RT-AX92U is often found as part of a kit including two routers but the individual router can be found alone and is a great option for small to medium homes. The AX6100 speeds break down into one Wi-Fi 6 channel at 5GHz capable of 4804Mbps as well as two channels based on older tech with 867Mbps at 5GHz and 400Mbbps at 2.4GHz.
If you've made the big move to mostly Wi-Fi 6 devices by now, it may be worth getting a router with a faster 2.4GHz Wi-Fi 6 band but for most people, the speeds here will be more than enough. You can also make sure you get your wired devices connected with four open Ethernet ports. Support for ASUS' AiMesh allows you to create a fast mesh network with a Wi-Fi 6 backhaul with more ASUS Wi-Fi 6 routers.
Asus includes its AiProtection Pro suite with Antivirus from TrendMicro as well as advanced parental controls. All of this can be controlled from an app as well. Asus also includes an adaptive QoS for gamers to keep ping times consistent with wtfast software to help your game find the best connection to a server.
Asus RT-AX92U
Best Value Tri-Band
The Asus RT-AX92U is a capable router with AX6100 speeds and AiMesh compatibility makes it a great Wi-Fi 6 mesh starter.
5. TP-Link Archer AX1500 (AX10)
The best Wi-Fi 6 router under $100
Bottom line: If you want Wi-Fi 6 support for your devices but don't want to spend too much — and don't need the additional speed Wi-Fi 6 offers — the TP-Link Archer AX1500 is your best bet.
- Top speeds: 1200Mbps @ 5Ghz, 300Mbps @ 2.4Ghz
- Top features: Dual-band, Low power usage, 4x Ethernet ports, low profile
Pros:
- Incredible price for Wi-Fi 6
- Slim design
- Alexa compatibility
- Basic parental controls included
Cons:
- Lacks WPA 3 security
- Slow 2.4Ghz speeds
- Not for those with larger homes
TP-Link offers the biggest bang for your buck with its entry-level Wi-Fi 6 routers. The Archer AX1500 can deliver speeds up to 1201Mbps at 5GHz and 300Mbps at 2.4GHz. While the speeds aren't leaps and bounds over comparable Wi-Fi 5 routers, you do get the benefits of Wi-FI 6 including better coverage and support for more connected devices thanks to MU-MIMO and OFDMA.
With four Ethernet ports, you don't give up any usability either but you do leave behind WPA 3 support for security. Still, with coverage for a small to medium home, Archer AX1500 is the cheapest way to get into Wi-Fi 6 and in the real world, the speeds should be adequate for most people.
The Archer AX1500 can be configured with the TP-Link Tether app. Once set up, you can control your network with Amazon Alexa allowing you to quickly and easily control your network with your voice. Basic parental controls are included allowing you to restrict time spent online for devices as well as blocking content.
TP-Link Archer AX1500 (AX10)
Get into Wi-Fi 6 networking for as little as possible with the Archer AX1500. You still get four Ethernet ports and USB as well.
6. Linksys Velop MX5
The best Wi-Fi 6 mesh system
Bottom line: If you're going into building your Wi-Fi 6 system with mesh by default, you're going to be well served by the incredible Linksys MX5, which bundled in a two-pack go by the MX10. Just be warned, all that performance and reliability comes at a cost: this is among the most expensive routers on our list.
- Top speeds: 2400Mbps @ 5Ghz, 1147Mbps @ 2.4Ghz
- Top features: Tri-band, 3,000 sq ft. coverage, mesh capable, 4x Ethernet ports, 1x USB port
Pros:
- One of the fastest mesh systems we've tested
- Slim, tall profile
- Easy to set up
Cons:
- Can't be easily hidden due to shape
- Expensive
The Linksys Velop MX5 is a very capable router all by itself with AX5300 tri-band Wi-Fi and four Ethernet ports. With its three bands coming in at 1147Mbps, 2402Mbps, and 1733Mbps, there's plenty of speed for any task. Around back, it also has a USB 3.0 port sitting above the vertically oriented Ethernet ports.
Of course, the killer feature of the MX5 is that it was designed to be part of a mesh so it has the right hardware to create a flawless experience. Paired with another MX5, the tri-band Wi-Fi will be able to keep data speeds high even if you're connected to one of the satellite nodes. Linksys makes it easy to expand thanks to compatibility with the entire Velop range and a few mesh-enabled Linksys routers. Of course, you'll want the fastest router serving as the main routers.
The MX5 has no exposed antennas opting for a somewhat large rectangular case measuring at 9.6 inches tall and 4.5 inches wide. Some people won't love the vertically stacked Ethernet ports but it's nice to see a mesh system with this many Ethernet ports.
If you think you'll need the coverage, Velop MX10 comes with two MX5 routers and makes a great mesh. Velop MX5 is easy to set up with the Linksys App which allows you to control guest access and parental controls. You also get a three-year warranty that comes with three years of tech support if you run into any issues.
Linksys Velop MX5
The Linksys Velop MX5 is a great start to a Wi-Fi 6 mesh system with tri-band AX5300 speeds and great backward compatibility.
7. Netgear Nighthawk MK62
The best value mesh Wi-Fi 6 system
Bottom line: While not quite as performant as the Linksys MX5, Netgear's superb Nighthawk MK62 will fill your home with fast, reliable mesh Wi-Fi 6 signal for just under $200.
- Top speeds: 1200Mbps @ 5Ghz, 600Mbps @ 2.4Ghz
- Top features: 1x Ethernet ports, compact size
Pros:
- Small nodes are easy to conceal
- AX1800 provides enough speed for most usage
- Easy Nighthawk app setup
- Compact housing
Cons:
- Dual-band Wi-Fi isn't the best option for mesh
- Only one Ethernet port per node
The Netgear Nighthawk MK62 is a mesh system capable of covering up to 3,000 sq ft with its two nodes. With dual-band speeds up to AX1800, this system should be fast enough for most standard browsing and even 4K streaming with a good connection. The Wi-Fi speeds break down to 600Mbps at 2.4GHz and 1200Mbps at 5GHz. Tri-band connections will always be better for mesh systems but the speeds offered here should be enough for most people.
On the back of the primary router, you get a WAN port to connect to your modem as well as a single Ethernet port for wired devices. The satellite node only has one open Ethernet port as well which could be an issue if you have several wired devices that need to be connected. You can add a wired switch if you need though. With a small housing measuring just 4.8 inches deep and wide, these nodes can fit in just about anywhere which allows you to make sure you've got it positioned with great signal.
Netgear's Nighthawk app makes setup a breeze and allows you to easily add more satellite units to your mesh. You can also subscribe to Netgear Armor to add more advanced security from Bitdefender to your network as well as more control for each connected device.

Best Value Mesh
The Netgear Nighthawk MK62 system comes with two nodes running at AX1800. This compact system can be expanded with more nodes.
8. Netgear Nighthawk AX5400 (RAX50)
A solid Wi-Fi 6 option for homes with lots of devices
Bottom line: Netgear's RAX50 is another solid Wi-Fi 6 option, especially for homes with lots of devices that don't need a mesh setup.
- Top speeds: 4800Mbps @ 5Ghz, 600Mbps @ 2.4Ghz
- Top features: Dual-band, 2,000 sq ft. coverage, 4x Ethernet ports, 1x USB port
Pros:
- Extremely fast 5Ghz speeds
- Wide, 160MHz channel support
- Compatible with Netgear ecosystem
Cons:
- Very large and imposing
- Low 2.4Ghz speeds
Netgear has one of the widest ranges of Wi-Fi 6 routers around and the RAX50 sits in a great sweet spot for most people. This router is fast with AX5400 speed from a dual-band setup which should be more than enough for a medium home with heavy usage. The speed is delivered at 600Mbps at 2.4GHz and 4800Mbps at 5GHz. It's able to deliver this speed thanks to a large 160Mhz wide channel at 5GHz.
Five Ethernet ports are available with one reserved for your internet connection. All Ethernet ports are gigabit-speed so this isn't a great option for someone building a 2.5Gb or 5Gb home network. You get a USB 3.0 port around the back flanked by four antennas.
The Netgear Nighthawk RAX50 can be easily set up with the Netgear Nighthawk app. You can also choose to subscribe to Netgear Armor which includes internet security for your network powered by BitDefender. Finally, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant compatibility make staying in control of your network a breeze.
Netgear Nighthawk AX5400 (RAX50)
The RAX50 from Netgear is a great choice for someone that wants plenty of speed without the compromises of a mesh system.
9. ASUS ROG Rapture AX11000 Router
The best Wi-Fi 6 router for gaming
Bottom line: Large and imposing, ASUS's ROG Rapture AX11000 is ultra-fast, insanely spec'd, and just plain over-the-top in every way. But it's also the fastest router we've ever tested.
- Top speeds: 4800Mbps @ 5Ghz, 1148Mbps @ 2.4Ghz
- Top features: Tri-band, 4x Ethernet ports, 1x USB port, gaming optimizations, RGB lighting
Pros:
- One of the fastest routers we've tested
- Built-in gaming features
- Free VPN built-in
Cons:
- Massive and very divisive design
The ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 from Asus is designed to look like a hardcore router for hardcore gamers. In the spec department, it doesn't disappoint. This router boasts AX11000 speeds from its 12 stream tri-band setup delivering 4804Mbps on the 5GHz channels and 1148Mbps at 2.4GHz. A 2.5Gbps Ethernet port connects this router to your network or fiber internet connection without compromise.
Coverage should be no trouble even in a very large home thanks to eight massive antennas. If you find you need even more coverage, you can expand your network with AiMesh. This allows you to use any other Asus router with AiMesh software as a remote node to add more coverage to your home under a single Wi-Fi name.
Four Ethernet ports around the back allow you to connect your gaming PC or console and keep the pings low. Asus' software makes it easy to add game-specific settings such as port forwarding easily as well as easy quality of service options. AiProtection is also included allowing for antivirus protection from Trend Micro.
One interesting function called VPN Fusion allows you to connect with a VPN most of the time but allows game traffic to pass by to keep ping times down. You also get adaptive QoS and wtfast software. Gamers care more about ping times and packet loss than looks for the most part but that didn't stop Asus from giving this router full RGB controls and an aggressive angular appearance. It will look right at home next to your gaming hardware.
ASUS ROG Rapture AX11000 Router
The ROG Rapture AX11000 manages to be the ultimate gaming router with fast speeds, aggressive looks, and great software.
10. NETGEAR Orbi Whole Home Mesh (RBK752)
The best Wi-Fi 6 router for advanced mesh needs
Bottom line: The Netgear Orbi RBK752 is another massive, imposing Wi-Fi 6 router that delivers top speeds across huge homes.
- Top speeds: 1200Mbps @ 5Ghz, 600Mbps @ 2.4Ghz
- Top features: Tri-band, 5,000 sq ft. coverage, 3x + 2x Ethernet ports, dedicated 5Ghz backhaul, easy setup
Pros:
- Reliable mesh speeds
- Satellite included in the box
- Support for Netgear ecosystem
- Excellent value
Cons:
- Boring design
Netgear's Orbi line was a great introduction to mesh for many people but Netgear has managed to keep growing with its Wi-Fi 6 Orbi systems. The RBK752 comes with one router and one satellite both with tri-band AX4200 speeds. Orbi does things a little differently than some with a dedicated 2400Mbps 5GHz Wi-Fi band to link the routers together. What remains is a more modest 2.4GHz and 5GHz duo at 600Mbps and 1200Mbps respectively for devices.
This Mesh System will cover up to 5,000 square feet in the home, along with providing access to up to 60 devices at once without slowing down. The primary router comes with three Ethernet ports available to devices and the satellite has two. With this system's strong and dedicated backhaul, adding a satellite to a home office or entertainment system can be a great way to get wired devices online at great speeds.
Netgear kept the design simple with a two-tone gray and matte white housing sitting 7.2 inches wide and 9.1 inches tall. While it is a bit large, it's only 2.8 inches deep making it easy to tuck on the back of a desk or shelf.
Netgear's Orbi app allows for easy setup and access to software updates. You can quickly and easily add additional satellites as needed. You can also use the software to view your traffic usage as well as control internet access to all connected devices. There is an optional Netgear Armor subscription that can add antivirus protection powered by BitDefender as well as additional device controls.
NETGEAR Orbi Whole Home Mesh (RBK752)
The Orbi RBK752 has plenty of speed with a fast dedicated backhaul. Plenty of Ethernet ports are open to wired devices.
Bottom line
While many people are looking to Wi-Fi 6 to make sure they have as much speed as possible, prices have finally come down even to the point that mesh systems are possible. While many of the best wireless routers do have Wi-Fi 6, some still get quite a lot done with the older Wi-Fi 5 tech. Mesh with Wi-Fi 6 makes a lot of sense for people looking for stability and coverage thanks to its improved handling of multiple connections. Wi-Fi 6 is coming to more devices and there are upgrades already available to desktops and laptops. Still, it will be some time before it's fully supported so it's good that all of these routers are backward compatible with older Wi-Fi standards.
Lately, Wi-Fi 6 has made its way into a wide range of routers from hyper-fast multi-gig gaming monsters into the sort of thing most people would buy. Thanks to this, it's possible for someone to get a great Wi-Fi 6 enabled router at most price points. If you want to get ahead of the curve and future-proof your home, you won't find a much better value than the TP-Link Archer AX6000 with its fast speeds and robust wired options.
Should you buy a mesh Wi-Fi 6 solution?
Mesh Wi-Fi is a great way to increase coverage but it offers a bit more than just square footage. Carefully placed mesh nodes can build a strong network even in challenging conditions such as a home with concrete walls or around an HVAC system that causes interference. A mesh with Wi-Fi 6 can have a stronger connection to each node with less of a chance for interference.
Still, a lot of people don't need a mesh system at all depending on the size of their homes. If you do find that a single router just doesn't cut it, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh system will be more capable than one based on Wi-Fi 5. Still, starting with a mesh capable router gives you the option to expand down the road.
Is it worth paying a premium for Wi-Fi 6 right now?
Wi-Fi 5 routers have gotten pretty fast and for most people today and the next couple of years, there won't be a huge improvement in the user experience getting a Wi-fi 6 router. The main reason to go to Wi-Fi 6 with your new router is to ensure it will work as well as possible with new devices over the next few years.
If you have a fast Wi-Fi 5 router that isn't slowing you down, there isn't much reason to ditch it just yet. If you do need a new router today, a Wi-Fi 6 compatible device will keep speeds high and interference low much further into the future.

Protect your back and backside with a comfy ergonomic office chair
Even if you work at a stand-up desk most of the day, you probably want to take sit breaks now and then. And for those who sit all day, a comfy chair is a must. That's why we've rounded up some of the best ergonomic office chairs around.The best VPN service, which is a Virtual Private Network, offers users a top-notch experience that can benefit everyone from the most basic beginner to an experienced professional. The software is used to help keep your online identity anonymous and secure, while also allowing you to spoof your location so that it appears as though you are somewhere that you really aren't.
Most of the best VPN providers allow the services to be used on popular devices like gaming consoles, PCs, laptops, phones, routers, and even web browsers like Chrome. Many of them connect in as little as one click, making it easy to use and understand.
Doing your research to pick the absolute best VPN service is crucial in your overall experience. There are a lot of options out there, some of which are free VPNs or cheap VPNs, but unfortunately not all of them are created equally.
If you are going to be trusting a VPN to anonymize your traffic and keep you safe online, you'll want to make sure it is a reputable service. So much of our personal lives are spent online, like checking your bank account, paying bills, keeping up with friends on Facebook, emails and more. This is all sensitive traffic, and you don't want it falling into the wrong hands. Maybe all you want is the ability to stream a show that's not airing locally to you, and a VPN can help with that as well.
We've tested out hundreds of VPN options and have consolidated it down to this list of only the best VPN services that are worth using in 2020.
How to pick the best VPN service?
Picking the right VPN service for you is not as hard as it may seem. There are a few things that you will want to consider when purchasing a new VPN subscription, so let's break them down now. The first thing you will want to make sure you find is a VPN provider that has a good app that's easy to use, which we've considered strongly in our rating of these services. Nearly all of the best VPN options will work on Mac, PC, Android, iPhone, Fire TV Sticks, gaming consoles, and more.
Another thing you will want to consider is how many devices can be used by your subscription at the same time, whether or not the companies offer strong customer support for when you run into an issue, and the overall cost of the service that you are signing up for. The best VPN services vary in cost big time and range anywhere from $2.49 per month up to over $6 per month. Our top pick, ExpressVPN, happens to be one of the most expensive, while our second favorite option, Surfshark, is one of the cheapest.
We have a full list of picks further down in this guide, but our top three best VPN options right now include ExpressVPN, Surfshark, and NordVPN.
1. ExpressVPN: The absolute best VPN option for most people
2. Surfshark VPN: The best cheap VPN out there
With plans starting out at about 8 cents per day, it's really hard to skip over Surfshark because it's a paid service. It offers a ton of great features that you'd expect from a VPN provider, and is super simple to use.
3. NordVPN: The most well-known VPN for security
NordVPN offers an insane amount of server locations that you can pick from and is one of the best services for unblocking streaming services. It's definitely the most well-known brand in the VPN space right now.
1. ExpressVPN
The single best VPN service for almost everyone
|Category||DeviceNameTKTKTK|
|Compatible with||Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux|
|Streaming services unblocked||Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube|
|Servers||3,000+|
|Server Locations||160 in 94 countries|

Pros

ExpressVPN is the closest you can get to being the single best VPN for every person out there. We've extensively tested the platform, it's apps, and more in our full ExpressVPN review, and it came out with a perfect five star rating. There are a number of factors that weigh into our decision here, like the amazing customer support, strong security measures, and an abundance of servers that are spread throughout various countries. There are no data limits each month when using ExpressVPN either, which means you can set it and forget it which makes it even easier to use.
It's common for VPN providers to have apps for your PC or Mac, and even your phones and tablets. Where ExpressVPN stands out even further is its custom firmware that is offered for some routers, its DNS content unblocking for a variety of streaming hardware, and its browser extensions that make connecting to access it all such a breeze. It's even one of our top VPN for Android picks.
Some of this sounds a bit intimidating, especially if this is the first VPN that you'll ever use. Worry not, though. The software is extremely easy to understand, and couple that with ExpressVPN's stellar customer service and you'll quickly realize there is nothing to worry about. The support agents actually understand the platform and are able to answer questions with actual information, which is surprising to see these days.
When it comes to security, ExpressVPN offers industrial-grade encryption, P2P support, DNS leak protection, a kill switch, no-logging policy, and much more.
When it comes to downsides, there isn't much to complain about. The service checks a lot of the key boxes for what most VPN users will care about and want, though it does charge a bit of a premium for it. The pricing structure is higher than some of the competition, but using our link you can actually save up to 49% on your first year of service, along with an extra three months free. Remember, ExpressVPN gives you a free 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you don't find it valuable or just can't figure it out, you can always get your money back with ease.
ExpressVPN
When trying to pick the best VPN provider for yourself there are a lot of things to consider. Encryption is one of the most important features of a VPN, and one of the main uses for most people. Think about how much time you spend online each day. You enter banking details, credit cards, passwords, and more all around the web, and sometimes from an unsecured public connection. Using a VPN you can keep all that data secure as it's passed from your phone through the virtual tunnels of the internet.
Another great vpn use is that you can easily connect to a server in a different location than where you are. This is called "spoofiing", and it makes it appear as though your traffic is coming from somewhere it isn't actually. That means you can access local content like concerts, sporting events, news, and even things like Netflix libraries.
The hardest part about a VPN is not actually using it, but instead understanding which one to pick for yourself. Nowadays you can find tons of different VPN options, some of which are free and others that are paid. Some of them have data limits, and others cap the number of simultaneous connections, and picking out the best VPN is not an easy task. Don't panic, though. We've done the hard part and have put various options through their paces so that we could break it down for you. Our top pick, for a number of reasons which are listed below, is ExpressVPN. It provides the best overall balance between price, speed, reliability, ease of use, and customer service.
Check out a full breakdown of all the best VPN services to see the good, the bad, and all the differences that make them unique below. We've also rounded up the best Android VPN apps and best free Android VPN options for your consideration.
2. Surfshark VPN
Best VPN service for those on a budget
Pros:
- Over 1,000 servers available
- Company based in British Virgin Islands
- 30-day money-back guarantee
Cons:
- Privacy policy wording is vague
- Android app is less reliable than other versions
Surfshark may have a fun, cute name for its service, but that doesn't mean it's not one of the best VPN options out there to sign up for. The company allows you to connect an unlimited number of devices to your subscription and keep them all secured at the same time. With Surfshark, you'll have access to over 1,000 different servers that are spread throughout 60 different locations. This gives you plenty of variety when trying to change your location and access content not available locally.
The company is based in the British Virgin Islands and has all the basic VPN requirements in place, including AES-256 encryption, a kill switch, DNS leak protection, and an extra security measure in place via its Double Hop capabilities.
You'll be able to easily use and navigate the interface of the apps, as the Surfshark team has stripped out all the extras. The wording in the official privacy policy is a bit unclear, but Surfshark maintains that it does not keep any logs nor user histories for any sessions.
It comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, giving you enough time to try it out and see if it's the VPN service for you or not. Be sure to check out our Surfshark review as well. The company recently changed its pricing structure, now giving you 24 months of access for just $59.76 total, which breaks down to about 8 cents per day. After the first two years, it renews annually at this price.

3. NordVPN
Best server options of any popular VPN
Pros:
- Nearly 6,000 servers
- 2048-bit encryption
- Multiple plan options
Cons:
Now, NordVPN and why it's potentially your next VPN service. The company continually matches or beats all of its competitors in terms of features and speed. There are more than 5,600 servers (see why only one of them being breached seems a bit less impactful now?) in more than 60 countries, and Nord opts to go for 2048-bit encryption instead of 256 that others are using.
As you'd expect, NordVPN offers all the standard security features that the competitors do, but comes with some extras as well. You'll have DNS leak protection, a kill switch, apps for nearly every platform out there, and an easy built-in feature to allow you to get around geo-blocks with ease.
While there is a lot of stuff to enjoy about NordVPN, that doesn't mean that it's perfect. Finding servers is a painful experience because they are not organized alphabetically, and trying to navigate the menus is equally as frustrating. The apps could use a bit of an overhaul, but that's a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things.
Back in 2018 one of the company's servers was compromised, but it was just one of more than 5,600. After investigating it, and the confirmation from Nord, it was understood that it was a single server with limited information being obtained. There's a lot at play here beyond just Nord's involvement, and our pals at TechRadar have a great breakdown, so be sure to check that out.
When signing up for NordVPN, you can opt to pay for just a single month of access, or go with a one-year or three-year plan. The cost per month drops significantly as you commit to a longer period of time, with the best pricing being on the three-year plan.
Be sure to check out our full NordVPN review now!
NordVPN
NordVPN is one of the most common and biggest names in the VPN space, and it also happens to be one of the best. It offers amongst the largest number of server options and some high-quality app experiences.
4. IPVanish VPN
Best VPN with free cloud storage
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, YouTube, Hulu | Servers: 1,400 | Server Locations: 75+ in 50 countries | Trial Period: 30 days
Pros:
- Over 40,000 shared IP addresses
- Great customer support
- Now offers unlimited devices to be connected simultaneously
Cons:
- Server locations don't match what's said
- No iOS kill switch
IPVanish is a provider you won't want to rule out. It offers 1,300 servers spread across 75 different locations, allows for up to 10 devices to be connected at the same time, and boasts an impressive 40,000 shared IP addresses.
There are apps for all the popular platforms, including Roku, Fire TV, Mac, Android, iOS, Windows, and more. They aren't bogged down with useless features, and make connecting to the service the fastest and easiest thing to do from within it.
Throughout testing IPVanish we noticed the servers were almost always up and running, the download speeds were consisent, and slightly above most of the others we tested. One odd thing that was noticed was that not every server actually existed where it was said to be, which could be problematic for those looking to unblock content in specific area. This is only a minor thing, but something that's absolutely worth considering.
Another area where IPVanish excels is customer support. You can get support any time since the company offers 24/7 coverage, and agents are able to be reached right from within the iOS and Android apps. It really doesn't get easier than this, and the company just moved from a 7-day to 30-day money-back guarantee. Give our IPVanish review a read and then get started today.
IPVanish VPN
IPVanish may not have the biggest numbers for stats, but the service that the company offers is reliable and fast. Getting set up takes just minutes, so start today!
5. PIA VPN
Best beginner VPN option
Pros:
- Easy to use apps
- No data limits
- Supports 10 devices at once
Cons:
Before sending the data of your session out anywhere, PIA assigns you a new IP address to help hide your online identity. It uses AES 256-bit encryption and has a no traffic logging policy.
There are more than 3,300 servers, which is great, but they are only spread amongst 50 locations, which is lower than most of the competition. Luckily, there are no data limits, though. This means that you're able to keep your sessions connected for everything you do without a worry of running out of data each month.
The apps are easy to use, and once you set them up the first time all you have to do is click a single button to instantly get connected.
As a United States based VPN company, PIA does store a little bit of user data on hand. Lots of VPN companies talk about no-logging and not keeping any information, so this is something worth keeping in mind as you sign up for it.
PIA VPN
While PIA may have lower server locations than most of the competition, it features zero data limits, 10 simultaneous connections, and easy-to-use apps, meaning it still remains a winner in our book.
6. PureVPN
Best shared IP address selection
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 3,000+ | Server Locations: 160 in 94 countries | Trial Period: 31 days
Pros:
- Over 2,000 servers
- Round-the-clock customer support
- Tons of shared IP addresses
- Works with almost every device & browser
Cons:
These days, odds are you stream a lot of your media via an app or online, and PureVPN is one of the best VPN providers for this. The service works with Android TV, Roku, Kodi, Xbox, PlayStation, and so much more. There's also a router VPN option that lets you use PureVPN on up to five devices that are connected through the router.
PureVPN offers over 300,000 IP addresses (which is amazing) and there are more than 2,000 servers that are spread across 140 different locations. Given the variety of locations, PureVPN is able to maintain fast speeds for streaming relatively easily and allows you to easily unblock content on Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services with ease.
There's an automatic kill switch that ends your internet session should the VPN disconnect so you don't have to keep monitoring it in the background. This little bit of behind the scenes magic just adds a bit more of a sense of security while you are using the service. It supports up to five simultaneous connections, which is a bit lower than some of the competition.
PureVPN offers round-the-clock customer support 365 days a year, and edges out the competition by offering a 31-day money-back guarantee instead of just 30 days. We have a full PureVPN review to check out as well.
PureVPN
PureVPN is so confident you'll like its service, that it offers a whole extra day on its money-back guarantee than Express does. Jokes aside, it offers a ton of server options spread wide in different areas, and offers great customer support.
7. Hotspot Shield VPN
Best free VPN service with lots of features
Pros:
- Great customer support
- Unlimited bandwidth each month
- Over 2,500 servers
- Great free plan available
Cons:
Almost every complaint that we have with Hotspot Shield in our best free VPN post is solved by just paying a few bucks for the company's premium offerings. You step right up to unlimited bandwidth and gain full access to all of its 2,500+ servers that are scattered across 70 different locations. You can connect up to 5 devices at the same time still, and you get that wonderful 24/7 support as an added bonus.
Hotspot Shield is completely ad-free, doesn't log any data. The service is available on a variety of devices, like iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Routers, Chrome, and more. The company switched from OpenVPN support to its own Catapult Hydra protocol, which means you can't set it up on your router, Chromebook, and a few other places.
While talking about areas that Hotspot Shield is lacking, it's worth noting that there is no Bitcoin support, and the raw speeds that it delivered in testing were lower than many of the other services we tested. Hotspot Shield does offer a free 7-day trial, though, so it's definitely worth giving the service a shot.
Hotspot Shield VPN
This is our top recommendation for those looking for a free VPN. You do need to enter your credit card number, but the company won't charge you and you can use the service for free beyond the 7-day trial.
8. CyberGhost VPN
Best streaming VPN with easy one-click connections
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 6,400+ | Server Locations: 110+ in 90 countries | Trial Period: 45 days
Pros:
- Over 6,200 servers available
- Based in Romania & Germany
- Automatic server matching for geo-restricted content unblocking
- 45-day money-back guarantee on 3-year plan
Cons:
CyberGhost is a company that's based out of Romania and Germany. It has more than 6,200 different servers that span more than 110 locations, which is quite impressive.
Where CyberGhost really excels though is in its interface. The company doesn't make you guess which server to use for certain tasks, it helps you identify them with ease. Select the geo-blocked service that you want from a list, like Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, etc, and then it will show you the best servers to connect to in order to view the content. Once connected to the server, the app will even open a browser window for you so you can start streaming. That's convenience if we've ever seen it.
Additionally, the service can block ads, trackers, and malicious sites. It automatically sends you to the HTTPS version of each site to ensure you are viewing the most secure option you can. On mobile, you can enable data compression to help save you some MBs while on the go.
Thanks to the ease of use, speeds, and reliability it offers, CyberGhost has been able to bring over 10 million users to its service. The pricing is quite competitive, and by signing up for longer-term plans you can help reduce the per-month cost of the service as well. Will you be the company's next subscriber? Check out our full CyberGhost VPN review for all the details.
CyberGhost VPN
CyberGhost makes using a VPN easy by helping you choose the best server to use for certain tasks, and it generally offers some of the best pricing around as well.
9. TunnelBear VPN
Best easy-to-use VPN option
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 1,000+ | Server Locations: 23+ | Trial Period: 30 days
Pros:
- App is super simple to use
- Uses independent specialists to conduct audits
- Apps available for major platforms
Cons:
TunnelBear may not be the best option of this list for those looking for granular control over where they are connecting or how their VPN is operating. The company goes for a much more simplistic approach, which works for most people in all honesty. The interface is very clean and easy to understand, and the apps are available on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and there are even a few browser extensions.
Beyond just the app, Tunnelbear offers a pretty simple experience all around. There are only 20 different server locations
The focus on simplicity goes beyond just the app, though. There are only 20 server locations, which is a good bit less than many of the others are offering. That's not a huge concern, though something to note if you're looking to connect to specific locations.
On the privacy front, which is what most people are using a VPN for, TunnelBear scores some extra points for its hiring of independent specialists to run a security audit on its servers. This is something no one else is doing, and we wish that more companies would follow suit and do the same.
TunnelBear VPN
The data limit is low, but if you are just lookint to test the water or use it infrequently, TunnelBear is a great choice to consider.
10. StrongVPN
Best gaming VPN for players & streamers
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 950+ | Server Locations: 60+ in 30+ countries | Trial Period: 30 days
Pros:
- Great connection speeds
- No logging at all
- Built-in WireGuard support
Cons:
StrongVPN really excels when it comes to those looking to game while connected to a VPN, but that doesn't mean that you can't use it for other things as well. It comes with WireGuard integration that allows for an industry-leading speed and performance level which is something that's very important. Beyond just gaming, it works across other platforms like Android, Mac, iOS, Windows, Linux, and more.
There is an absolute zero-logging policy which means that StrongVPN collects no data on your sessions, what pages you look at, your location, or any of that. You can connect up to twelve devices at the same time, which should cover pretty much all of your devices at the same time.
While it may not seem to compete when it comes to the number of servers, how many locations they are in, and all that, but StrongVPN manages to have some of the best connection speeds around. You can also use it to easily unblock media content from different streaming services that may not be available where you are. With prices starting at under $6 per month, you'll want to give StrongVPN a try!
StrongVPN
The built-in WireGuard support here makes StrongVPN a gamers dream VPN. Give it a try today and see how you like it!
11. ProtonVPN
Best security-focued VPN provider
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 800+ | Server Locations: 50+ | Trial Period: 30 days
Pros:
- Based in Switzerland
- Many servers utilize 10 Gbps connections
- Has great free plan with unlimited bandwith
Cons:
- Free plan users are deprioritized during peak hours
Proton may not offer the most servers, or have them spread out in the most locations, but if there is one thing that the company knows it's privacy and security. ProtonVPN is designed to ensure that no one can eavesdrop on your connection, and it does so by routing your connection through fully encrypted tunnels.
The company is based in Switzerland, which means that it benefits from additional strong legal protection. Switzerland offers some of the world's strongest privacy laws, and remains outside of the EU and U.S. jurisdiction, meaning that it can't be coerced into spying on any users.
There are strong no-logging policies, DNS leak protection, a kill-switch, and it can be used as an always-on VPN that automatically reconnects to a server should the connection be interrupted at any point. All of the servers have a minimum speed of 1 Gbps, and many of them actually use a 10 Gbps connection.
Before you get started with the paid service, you can always try ProtonVPN out for free. It is worth noting that the company does prioritize paid users during peak times, so on a free plan you may notice slower speeds when more people are online.
Whether you end up wanting a free or paid plan, Proton is definitely a VPN provider worth considering.
ProtonVPN Free
From the creators of the secure and encrypted ProtonMail comes ProtonVPN. There are no data limits here, but free users are deprioritized in favor of paid ones during peak usage times.
12. Windscribe VPN
Best free VPN with option to earn extra data monthly
Compatible with: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux | Streaming services unblocked: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon, YouTube | Servers: 400 | Server Locations: 110
Pros:
- Free plan offers generous data bucket
- Supports unlimited simultaneous connections
- Apps for all major platforms
Cons:
We featured Windscribe on our best free VPNs post as well because of the unique approach it takes to data allotment. With the paid plans, however, you get an unlimited amount of data to use each month and can connect an unlimited number of devices at the same time. It has more than 400 different servers that span across 60 different locations, which is about average.
There are clients for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and extensions for all the popular browsers. You can manually set up Windscribe on your router, Kodi, and more with a little extra effort.
Unfortunately, Windscribe speeds can be a little bit slow (due to the low overall server count, likely), and there is no 24/7 support which means that you may have to wait a bit to get any issues you encounter resolved. It may not be the fastest, or offer the most options, but Windscribe is definitely worth considering. You'd be best off to check out the free plan for a month first, and then upgrade based on your needs.
Windscribe VPN
You can add to the healthy 10GB data allotment by tweeting your love for the Windscribe service and inviting friends. It's a great way to bring even more data to your free pool.
What about the other VPN companies?
There are hundreds, if not thousands, of other VPN providers. We've worked with our pals at TechRadar to test as many of them as possible and come up with a list of just the best. It seems like a new VPN provider pops up each week, and some of them make some pretty crazy promises.
We'd recommend sticking to one of the options mentioned here when you get started with a VPN. We are constantly looking at new offerings, reviewing our picks on this list, and ensuring that the information included in this guide is as accurate as possible.

VPN FAQs
If you're in the market for a VPN and need a little more information on exactly what a VPN is, what you can use a VPN for, and some basics like that, we have you covered. There are a lot of competitors covered above, but picking the right one for you is dependent on your needs. Let's take a look deeper into VPNs, and help you further in your buying path.
✏️What is a VPN?
A VPN is a Virtual Private Network. The idea behind it is to add an extra layer of security to whichever network you are trying to connect to, including both broadband and internet hotspots. It allows you to send a receive data privately while connecting to a public network.
Once connected, your traffic is routed through a "tunnel" which encrypts the data so that outside eyes can't monitor it. The protection prevents people from being able to not only see what is happening, but also prevents them from knowing where it is happening from.
In addition to adding security, you can use a VPN to "spoof" your location by connecting to a server that's based in a different location. This means you'd be able to bypass some geo-restrictions, and view content that you may not have been able to otherwise.
⚙️How do VPNs work?
A VPN works in a pretty simple manner, even though it may seem complicated. Behind the scenes, the VPN provider takes your data, routes it through a set of servers that can then protect it and change its location, and encrypts it. That means other's can't see what you are doing on public connections.
Instead of going from Your Device to the website, a VPN adds a middle step. Now the pathway actually looks goes from Your Device to Secure VPN servers then ends up at the website.
All of this is done in the background once you are connected to the service and a server. One of the coolest parts is that you can be sitting in an airport in New York and connect to a server in Europe, without having to move. You'd think that this extra step could slow your speeds, or put a delay in getting things done, but many of the best VPN providers offer fast speeds and reliable connections, so you barely notice that it's even connected in the background.
⚖️Are VPNs legal?
In most areas of the world, VPNs are perfectly legal. Some countries have put bans in place to restrict VPNs as a whole, and others have limitations on their use cases, though these generally apply to people who live there not travel there.
For the countries that do restrict VPN uses, there's often times some providers that are specifically approved for use there. This means that you may not have as many options, but some are better than none. For example, in China companies have to get Chinese government approval, and those who use unapproved VPNs can be fined heavily.
On the other hand, in the United Arab Emirates, things are far more serious. The fine for using a VPN (any of them) is over half a million dollars and you can be sentenced to jail time.
If you are unsure of the legalities of a VPN where you live, be sure to seek some information from local authorities before getting one installed.
❓Is a VPN worth it?
At this point, having a VPN is a really smart choice to make, and we would suggest that everyone uses one especially while connecting to public Wi-Fi spots. These don't offer any of their own security measures, so you'll want to make sure your data is safe while you use it.
So much of our day to day activity is done online. Think about how many times you've accessed bank information from a public network, or logged into your most personal accounts from the airport. All of it is unprotected, and in the hands of the wrong people it could be bad for you.
In most cases, a VPN is a nominal cost each month, and there are even some free options that are definitely worth considering. For the price of a cup of coffee, or a fast food lunch, you could add protection to all your browsing sessions for the whole month. It's a pretty great trade off, honestly.
💻What are the best VPN uses?
There are many use cases for having a VPN, though two main ones stick out. Most people will use a VPN to secure their traffic, especially when connecting to public and open Wi-Fi. This is becoming a more popular requirement in the business world where people are constantly traveling. Many companies require the use of a VPN in order to access the company's intranet and services.
Alternatively, many will use a VPN to be able to connect to a server in a different location to access content that may be regionally blocked. This is known as "spoofing" your location, and it allows you to do things like watch Netflix, Disney+, and more from anywhere even if it isn't officially supported where you live.
There are plenty of other uses for VPN services as well.
💰Is a paid VPN better than a free VPN?
Many VPN companies these days offer both free and paid VPN options, but when you opt for the free one you make some sacrifices. Most of the time, the free versions allow for less devices to be connected at the same time, and the data allotments for each month are often substantially less.
Some services, like ProtonVPN offer unlimited data but will offer better speeds to paying customers during peak times. Windscribe allows you to score extra data each month by referring friends and tweeting about the service, so there are definitely ways to live with a free VPN, you just need to be a bit more aware of the limitations.
Upgrading to a paid plan ensures that you see no ads, often times means that there are no data limits, and many companies offer unlimited connections as well.
Any VPN (free or paid) is better than no VPN at the end of the day. Give a free service a shot to see if it works out for you, and if you are happy with it, then maybe you should consider upgrading to a paid option for an even better experience.
🔎What to look for when picking a VPN?
There's a whole lot of information above about different VPN providers, but knowing what's important to look for isn't always easy. We've broken it down into a few easy things that everyone should be focused on when researching different VPN providers.
- Does the provider have servers in the country you need? Sometimes you are looking to watch specific content, or you only want to be able to connect to local servers, and every single VPN provider operates in different areas. The server count isn't always the biggest factor in determining speed or reliability, so be sure to care more about location.
- Can you connect everything you want at the same time? Some providers offer only one connection at a time while others offer an unlimited amount. This is critical because you don't want to be worrying about disconnecting one device to protect another. Get one that works for everything you need it to.
- What is the logging policy? Many providers have a "no-logging" policy, but that doesn't always mean the same thing to each of them. Be sure to read through the Q & A and the privacy policy so that you totally understand what information (if any) is being collected when you use the service, and how it is used.
- Are you comfortable with the pricing structure? Prices vary from free to $15 per month for some services. The longer you commit to using the service (buying a one or three year plan) the cheaper you can get the per-month rate. It may prove worth spending a little more upfront to keep yourself protected for a longer period of time, for less.
📺Can a VPN unblock regional content?
One of the big selling points for many people is that you can use your VPN to spoof your location, meaning that you can access content that may not be available locally where you are at that moment. This is great for those who frequently travel and want to keep up with local shows. You can use it to unblock content from Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, and much more. Normally, you just need to connect to the VPN, then select a server based where the content you want to watch is streaming, and then you are able to watch it like you are in that country.
📱Should I use a VPN on my phone?
In an ideal world, you would use a VPN on every device that connects to the internet. This is the absolute best way to keep yourself and your data safe from tracking, hacking, and more.
Luckily, every one of the VPNs mentioned in this best VPN guide offer mobile apps, which means you can easily get started using it on your iPhone or Android device. We've also rounded up the best VPNs for Android along with the best VPN for iPhone, so be sure to check those out.

Headphones will improve sound quality and allow you to enjoy VR without projecting sound to everyone around you. If your headphones of choice are wired, you're in luck because it's just plug and play to use any wired headset. If you want to use wireless headphones, it's significantly more complicated.
Please note that the Oculus Quest 2 doesn't ship until October 13, 2020. We'll update this guide as soon as we get our hands on the headset and can test the stops on the Oculus Quest 2. If you are grabbing an Oculus Quest 2, make sure to get the one with the right amount of storage.

How to use wired headphones
Wired headphones are the way to go on the Oculus Quest. They're literally just plug and play. There is an audio jack on both sides of the headset. You can plug a pair of headphones into either side or plug a separate headphone into each side.
It's that simple. Just like on a phone, PC, or any other device with an audio jack, you just need to plug in your headphones to use them.
How to use wireless headphones
Using wireless headphones is an entirely different animal. The Oculus Quest is a completely untethered headset when it comes to what powers the device. You don't need a PC, phone, or any external sensors to use your Oculus Quest for VR. But the wireless nature of the Oculus Quest does not extend to headphones. Using wireless headphones is technically possible, but you'll have to jump through a lot of hoops, and even then, it might not work with all types of headphones.
Unlocking developer mode
The first thing that you need to do with your Oculus Quest to use wireless headphones is unlock developer mode. This is done through the Oculus app on your phone.
- Open the Oculus app.
- Select Settings.
Select your Oculus Quest headset.
- Select more settings.
- Select developer mode.
Toggle the developer mode setting to on.

Next, you'll have to get your Oculus Quest ready to sideload APKs. This requires your PC and a cable that can connect your Oculus Quest and your PC. This allows you to sideload any APK that you want onto your device, which is important for this process, which requires sideloading a settings app. The easiest way to sideload apps onto the Oculus Quest is to use a program called SideQuest.
- Go to SideQuest's Github page.
- Download the version appropriate for your device.
- Click on the downloaded file.
- You'll get a pop-up from Windows that says, "Windows protected your PC." Select more info.
Click Run anyway.
- Click extract.
- Open the folder that you extracted it to.
- Find the folder SideQuest-win32-x64.
- Double click SideQuest.exe.
Connect your Oculus Quest and SideQuest
Now, you'll need to connect your headset and your PC for sideloading.
- Connect your Oculus Quest to your PC using a USB-C cable.
- Select Connect Device in SideQuest
- Put on your headset, and select Allow USB debugging.
- Make sure to check Always allow from this computer.
- Install the App Launcher by selecting Install App Launcher on SideQuest on your PC.
The app launcher creates an Unknown Sources folder in your Oculus Quest's library so you can easily find apps and games that you've sideloaded. You can now install APKs onto your Oculus Quest.
Sideloading a specific settings app
Now, you need to sideload a specific settings app onto your Oculus Quest. A user on Reddit, TyHurd has uploaded the Settings app we need.
- Download the settings app here.
- Locate Settings_1.0.apk so you know where it is.
- Select Repos in SideQuest.
Drag and drop your Settings_1.0.apk over the SideQuest Window.
The Settings app is now sideloaded onto your Oculus Quest.
Enable Bluetooth on Oculus Quest
With developer mode enabled and the Settings app sideloaded, you are now ready to enable Bluetooth settings on your Oculus Quest. The settings app we installed allows you to access the Android settings of the device, including Bluetooth.
- Inside your Oculus Quest, open Oculus TV.
- Select the black box listed under "Unknown Sources."
- Select Bluetooth.
- Select your headphones, and they should pair.
This setup won't work with all Bluetooth headphones. And even if it does work, you might experience latency issues. After all, latency issues are why the makers of the Oculus Quest chose not to enable this by default in the first place. But if your headphones can pair, and you have low-latency headphones or happen to luck out and not deal with latency issues, you now have Bluetooth headphones paired to your Oculus Quest.
Our top equipment picks
While the Oculus Quest has built-in speakers, good headphones will provide higher quality audio and more immersive gameplay. While you can use some wireless headphones in the right circumstances, the best experience will come from using a good pair of wired headphones.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!If you have a Samsung Galaxy S or Note phone along with a spare monitor, keyboard, and mouse, then you've got yourself a pretty powerful pocket computer. Samsung's DeX app allows you to plug your Galaxy phone into a monitor and project a desktop-based UI version of your phone onto the screen. It even works (through an app) with Windows PCs and Mac computers. Samsung isn't the only Android OEM who has built a desktop mode into its devices, but it just might be the most well-known and best execute implementation thus far. We'll show you how to get it set up so that you can take your productivity anywhere.
How to use Samsung DeX on your Galaxy S or Note phone
- If you're going to be using Samsung DeX on your Galaxy phone with just an external monitor, just plug in a USB-A to USB-C cable from your monitor to your device and skip to step
If you're going to be using Samsung DeX on your Galaxy phone with a Mac or Windows PC, you'll need to first download the DeX app for whichever respective platform you are on from https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/dex/. I'm using a Mac, so I'll choose the MacOS download option.
Click to download, and follow the installation prompts.
Once the DeX app has been downloaded and installed, plug your phone in via a USB-A to USB-C cable.
- Read the Samsung DeX pop up menu and click OK.
- If you experience any issues connecting, you may need to try unplugging and replugging your cable or turning off Android File Transfer.
- You should see a notification in your status bar that DeX is available. Click on that notification.
When you see a popup notification that asks Start Casting with Samsung DeX? Tap Start now.
Now you should see a desktop view of your Samsung Galaxy device on your Mac, PC, or monitor. You can click on any of the apps on the "desktop" or on the navigation/settings menus at the bottom right and left of the screen.
- If you click on the bottom left of the screen, you can access a version of the app drawer, home, and back buttons. You can also get some tips and tricks for navigating the UI, and logout of DeX.
If you click on the bottom right of the screen, you can access the quick settings and notification menus.
Click on the grid icon on the bottom left menu to access your phone's app drawer.
Click on an app to open and use it as if you were on your phone.
You can resize windows and apps, change the desktop background and wallpaper, and even take screenshots from your new phone desktop. Pretty powerful stuff!
Samsung DeX works on Windows 7 and 10 machines, as well as the latest versions of macOS. Alternatively, you can get to work on DeX much more cheaply with just a spare monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Here are some of our favorites for just this kind of setup.
Our top equipment picks
If you've already got a working Windows PC or Mac, then the first thing you'll want to do is download the Samsung DeX app for your computer.
DeX appeal
Samsung DeX App
Turn your phone into a computer
Samsung DeX is a powerful app that can turn an existing computer or monitor into a second screen for your Samsung Galaxy phone. Just plug in your device and start using it on the big screen.
Additional Equipment
Once you have the app for your PC or Mac, you'll still need the following accessories to get the most out of Samsung DeX.
AmazonBasics USB-A to USB-C Cable ($11 at Amazon)
No need to spend big bucks on a fancy cord. This offering from Amazon will do the job for DeX just fine.
Logitech Pebble M350 Wireless Mouse (From $27 at Amazon)
This has long been one of our favorite Bluetooth mice. It connects fast, is super portable, and it's easy to quickly change the batteries (not that you'll need to often).
ASUS VA24 EHE Full HD Monitor ($109 at Amazon)
This monitor from ASUS is the one I chose to complement my Samsung DeX setup. It's got excellent color reproduction, more than enough room to maneuver, and its Eye Care technology makes it easier to use for longer.

Limited Time Only
If you're unfamiliar with the differences between open-box and refurbished, it's a pretty big one. Open-box items have been returned to the store for a variety of reasons though are generally in new condition and include all the essential components that usually come with that item. Meanwhile, refurbished items have been used for potentially a longer period, returned, and then tested and repaired where necessary to ensure they're in like-new condition. There may be slight cosmetic damage, or a missing manual, or plain packaging instead of the product's usual packaging, though all of these issues are stated in the description of the item you're buying — if any apply.

The Amazon Fire HD 10 is a remarkably good tablet and with some of the best Fire HD 10 accessories when you watch shows, look for recipes, read books, or play games, the experience can be even better. Getting the tablet itself is just the start; you're going to want to snag a few accessories for the Fire HD 10 both to protect it and to give it a unique look, like the MoKo Slim Fold Case. Here are the best things to buy alongside your new tablet.
- Best Case: MoKo Slim Fold Case
- Best Kids Case: Finitie Kids Shock Proof Case
- Best Screen Protector: JETech Screen Protector
- Best MicroSD Card: SanDisk 128GB Ultra
- Best Charger: Anker USB Type C 30W Wall Charger
Best Case: MoKo Slim Fold Case
This folding case is much less expensive than the official case and provides more features. The cover protects your screen from damage and doubles as a stand so you can prop your tablet up without using your hands. Just note that it isn't designed to hold your tablet up vertically. On the inside you'll find a hand strap, so you can hold your device more easily while you use it.
The case is designed so that you can still access all the ports and buttons. The vents and speakers are also accessible, so you don't have to worry about muffled sound or overheating. Since this beautiful case is available in 34 different designs you'll be sure to find one you like.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Case
MoKo Slim Fold Case
An elegant case with different designs
Choose from one of 34 designs to protect your Fire HD 10 tablet. The cover even folds to double as a stand.
Best Kids Case: Finitie Kids Shock Proof Case
This case is made with shock-resistant lightweight EVA durable foam, so it's designed to withstand drops of all sorts. It's perfect for little children who are likely to let the tablet slip from their hands. The handle makes it easy to carry and also converts into a hands-free stand, so children can watch shows or play games unaided.
The only downside to this case is that it makes the tablet a lot bulkier. It might not be as easy to store or travel with. Still, it provides plenty of extra protection without costing too much. You can choose between four different colors to get the look your child likes best.
Pros:
Cons:

Extra protection for a kid's tablet
This case provides extra protection against drops and bumps. The included handle doubles as a stand.
Best Screen Protector: JETech Screen Protector
You'll want a screen protector to keep your tablet's screen unscathed. If you want to avoid bubbles and replacements you'll love this option. It's made of tempered glass to protect against scratches, oils, dust, and grime. In fact, it provides enough protection to prevent harder scratches like what you might get from a knife. Besides that, glass feels more pleasant to the touch than plastic screen protectors.
It's a little more expensive than plastic screen protectors, but it will provide better protection and shouldn't need replacing. Since it's glass, you aren't likely to get bubbles when applying it to your device, so that should save you a headache.

Best MicroSD Card: SanDisk 128GB Ultra
The Fire HD 10 tablet can hold as much as 256GB of external storage. This is way more than the average user will need, but it's nice that you have the option. To take advantage of this space you should consider getting this SanDisk 128GB Ultra microSD card. It provides plenty of space, is highly rated on Amazon, and doesn't cost as much as other options on the market.
It also comes with an adapter so you can use it with a variety of devices. The only way this could be better is if this were a two-pack.
Pros
Cons
Best MicroSD Card
SanDisk 128GB Ultra
Memory for your tablet
This microSD card is decently priced and gives your tablet plenty of extra storage space. It even comes with an adapter.
Best Charger: Anker USB Type C 30W Wall Charger
When Amazon updated the Fire HD 10 in late 2019, it finally updated its charging port from Micro-USB to USB-C. Hallelujah! While the Fire HD 10 does come with its own 9W wall charger and USB-C cord, in order to take full advantage of the increased charging speeds that the USB-C standard promises, you'll want to pick up a fast-charging brick.
The Anker USB Type C 30W Wall Charger fits the bill and will deliver more than three times the power of the Amazon included charger. Not only will this work with your other portable devices, but Anker's MultiProtect system also uses 10 safety features to make sure that your device doesn't overheat or get damaged in any way while using the charging brick.
Pros:
- Very small form factor
- Blue LED indicates power and helps you see it in the dark
- Can be used with most devices
Cons:

Buying one of the best Echo Spot Stands can really help enhance your use of the device. Amazon's Echo Spot is the original compact Alexa display that allows you to stream Amazon Prime shows, listen to music, order items, check the news, and more. Since the speakers are on the bottom of the device, it's best to use a stand if you want decent audio. Some stands also make it so you can adjust the screen up and down or make it swivel for a better viewing experience. See which one works for you.
- Little astronaut: BMK Echo Spot Stand
- Wall buddy: HumanCentric Wall Mount
- Best value: BLUERIN Echo Spot Stand
- Long neck: VinSa 360 Degree Rotation Stand
- Official stand: Amazon Echo Spot Adjustable Stand
- Classy support: Wero Aluminum Swivel Stand
Little astronaut: BMK Echo Spot Stand
In addition to a 360-degree swiveling stand, the adorable astronaut body raises the screen higher into the air so you don't have to bend down as far to view it. You can also angle the screen up or down for a better viewing experience.
Wall buddy: HumanCentric Wall Mount
Looking to save some counterspace and bring the screen closer to your face? Why not mount it on a wall somewhere. HumanCentric's wall mount allows you to rotate the device horizontally and vertically so you can angle the Echo Spot just right.
Best value: BLUERIN Echo Spot Stand
In addition to swiveling around 360 degrees, you can also adjust the screen up and down. The base features rubber pads to keep your expensive Echo Spot from slipping off a counter or end table to its doom. It comes in black and white.
Long neck: VinSa 360 Degree Rotation Stand
This is one of the only stands that allows you to adjust the screen up and down as well as make it swivel 360 degrees. But that's not all: Extend the base for a better viewing experience if necessary or keep the Echo Spot nestled in the base if not. It comes in black or white to match your Echo Spot.
Official stand: Amazon Echo Spot Adjustable Stand
This is the official stand Amazon created specifically for its Echo Spot. It doesn't swivel to either side like other stands on this list. However, by raising the speakers off of a surface it increases sound quality. If you're the kind of person that only likes to purchase official gear, this is the stand for you.
Classy support: Wero Aluminum Swivel Stand
The design of this metal stand matches the look of your Echo Spot beautifully and allows the device to swivel 360 degrees to face any section of a room. The non-skid bottom prevents the device from moving around too much as you adjust the screen to face in different directions. Get it in silver or black.
Stand out
It's unclear whether or not the Echo Spot will be phased out now that Amazon has announced its new compact Echo Show 5 display. This new device could account for the fact that many Echo Spot stands are no longer available or have limited quantities remaining. Either way, when choosing a stand, you'll want to consider the price you want to pay, how durable the stand is, and what features it brings to the table. You'll preferably want something that rotates 360 degrees or even allows you to adjust the screen up and down.
Our personal preference is the Lanmu Stand since the base rotates 360 degrees and your purchase includes a screen protector that features a camera cover. You'll appreciate the ability to slide a cover over the lens, especially if your device happens to be in your bedroom.
For those who want to use the Echo Spot mainly as a speaker, you'll want to check out the Vault Portable Speaker Dock and Battery. It greatly increases the sound and lasts up to eight hours before needing to be plugged back in.

But are there differences between these versions?This year has proven to be a really fascinating year for cord-cutting. Peacock and HBO Max both hit the scene, major movies have forgone theaters entirely in favor of digital-only releases, and there's been a revival for Android TV. Following 2019's updates to the NVIDIA Shield TV family, this year has given us the Chromecast with Google TV and the TiVo Stream 4K.
The TiVo Stream 4K hasn't gotten the same buzz or attention as the new Chromecast, and when you compare the two side-by-side, it's a little confusing as to why that is. The Stream 4K has many of the same features that the Chromecast does, right down to content curation features that make it easier to find what you want to watch.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
TiVo did a lot right with the Stream 4K, and while I don't think it's a better overall gadget compared to Chromecast, it's absolutely worth considering depending on the kind of streaming you do.
At a glance
TiVo Stream 4K
Bottom line: The TiVo Stream 4K is yet another compelling entry in the streaming market, and in a lot of ways, it's one of the best options out there. You get 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos all for just $49, along with access to just about every major streaming app in existence. TiVo's exclusive Stream app is a great tool for curating all of your content into place, and while it is helpful, the experience isn't quite as seamless as what you can get with the new Google TV interface.
The Good
- 4K HDR streaming
- Dolby Vision/Atmos support
- TiVo Stream app for content curation
- Compact, reliable remote
- Great price
The Bad
- Live TV integration limited to Sling TV
- Slightly confusing interface
- Limited home screen customization
TiVo Stream 4K Price and availability
The TiVo Stream 4K was released on May 6, 2020, in the United States. It was originally supposed to have a retail price of $70, but after offering it for $49 as a promotional offer, TiVo decided to make that the permanent cost going forward. Companies don't do stuff like that very often, so props to TiVo for doing it.
You can buy the TiVo Stream 4K from Amazon, Walmart, and directly from the TiVo website. Unlike TiVo's DVRs, the Stream 4K does not require any sort of monthly subscription to use.
TiVo Stream 4K What I like
The market for $50 streaming devices can feel very familiar at times, because as you'll see below in the Competition section, many of them have the same core feature-set. The TiVo Stream 4K falls into that camp, though that's not a bad thing at all. Once plugged into your TV, it delivers 4K, HDR, HDR10, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos.
Those are all of the core standards you can ask for in a modern streaming device, and it means all of your content will look and sound as good as it possibly can. Everything I watched on the Stream 4K looked just as good as it does on the Chromecast with Google TV or the Android TV interface built-in my Hisense television, so I have no complaints on this front at all.
I've also been quite happy with the TiVo Stream 4K's remote, which is a little bit bigger than the one you get with the new Chromecast. Unlike that one which can feel a bit too simplistic, however, the Stream 4K has ample controls for you to mess with. The channel buttons are really useful for quickly channel-hopping in an app like Sling TV, the Guide button takes you right to the live TV section in the TiVo Stream app (more on that later), and you can press Live to skip ahead to the live broadcast of a show if you've rewound to an earlier part and want to catch up. All of the buttons are clicky, responsive, and I appreciate that TiVo was able to add so much functionality without making the remote gigantic.
Rounding out the hardware side of things, there's an extra USB-C port in addition to the Stream 4K's micro-USB power output. So, if you want to expand your storage, doing so is quite easy.
All of the fundamentals of the TiVo Stream 4K work without a hitch, though that's what we've come to expect for just about any streaming device. Where things get really interesting is when we start digging into the Stream 4K's software.
The main interface is Android TV, but you'll spend most of your time in the Stream app.
The TiVo Stream 4K is powered by Android TV, and it works just like any other Android TV device on the market. You have a row of apps at the top of your screen, and below them, app channels that highlight recommended content for you to watch. You can rearrange the position of your apps (for the most part), download new ones from the Play Store, and the vast majority of streaming apps are here. There's still no Apple TV+, but you can at least download and watch HBO Max and Peacock — something you still can't do on Amazon Fire TV.
Performance has been quite solid on the Stream 4K, with it navigating through apps and starting new video streams without a hitch. I've noticed that it can sometimes feel slightly choppy with certain apps (namely Disney+), but it's a very smooth and snappy experience more often than not.
You can open individual streaming apps and watch your content the old-fashioned way, but the TiVo Stream 4K has a trick of its sleeve — the TiVo Stream app. It comes pre-installed on the Stream 4K, and similar to the Google TV interface on the Chromecast, promises to curate all of your apps into one handy place.
When you open TiVo Stream, your home page shows a list of trending shows, things you've recently watched, and heaps of recommended content that's personalized just for you. The initial set up of the Stream 4K asks you to indicate your preferred shows and types of things to watch so it has a general understanding of your viewing habits right out of the gate, but as with any service like this, it gets better the more you use it. You can add items to your My Shows library for easy viewing at any time, along with giving movies and TV shows a thumbs up or thumbs down to help train TiVo Stream's recommendations.
None of this would matter if TiVo Stream only worked with a small handful of apps, but thankfully, a lot of the big names are here. The current list includes:
- Sling TV
- Netflix
- HBO Max
- Amazon Prime Video
- Hulu
- Disney+
- Starz
- CBS All Access
- Pluto TV
- Tubi TV
- Google Play Movies & TV
There are a few notable omissions, such as Peacock, Crackle, Showtime, Epix, and any TV Everywhere apps, but it's a strong foundation that should cover the vast majority of users. You'll indicate during set up which services you'd like to integrate with the Stream app, and at any time, you can add and remove them as needed.
Even if the recommendations aren't always 100% spot-on, being able to open one app and browse through everything at my disposal is far and away better than digging through multiple applications for all my streaming services. Things get even better if you're a Sling TV subscriber, as the TiVo Stream app has a dedicated Guide page that shows everything currently airing on your Sling channels (in addition to Pluto TV and a few TiVo+ channels). So, whether you're in the mood for something on-demand on airing right now, you can find it through TiVo Stream.
I almost wish that TiVo Stream was your actual home screen and not just an app, because there's not really any need to use the regular Android TV interface when it exists. Thankfully, TiVo sort of lets you do this. Pressing the TiVo button on the remote exits whatever app you're currently in and brings you back to TiVo Stream, and if you hold down on the regular Home button while in TiVo Stream (or any app), you can browse a list of all your installed applications. It's not perfect, but it is a possible workaround if you want to make the Stream app your pseudo home screen.
TiVo Stream 4K What I don't like
However, therein lies my main issue with the TiVo Stream 4K. The TiVo Stream app works really well as a destination for finding something to watch, but the experience always feels a bit disjointed.
Here's a great example. If you open the Sling TV app and start watching something there, you can use the Channel buttons on the remote to browse through channels just fine. If you press Guide, however, it exits Sling and takes you to the guide in TiVo Stream app. Even more annoying, if you're in the Sling app and press the Live button on the remote, it boots you out of Sling and takes you to the last live channel you were watching on Sling through the Stream app (which is different from the one you were watching on the actual Sling app). Confused yet?
On the subject of Sling TV, that's the only paid live TV service that integrates with the Stream app. If you have YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, Philo, or anything else, you're out of luck. Yes, the Chromecast only integrates with YouTube TV for its Live page, but Google has at least said that it'll be expanding support to other services in the near future.
While we're comparing TiVo Stream to Google TV, I think Google's software is much more pleasing to look at and offers a lot more information. The Stream app just looks really bland to my eyes and feels outdated compared to interfaces we've seen from a lot of other streaming applications. It also doesn't show Rotten Tomatoes scores for shows, how much an on-demand title costs if it needs to be rented/purchased, or allow you to browse the filmography of actors and directors of a show you've selected — all features present on Google TV that I rely on every time I use it.
And, since there's no mobile companion app for TiVo Stream, you can only interact with it when you're in front of your TV. Being able to hop on the Google TV app on my phone and add shows to my watchlist whenever I want has proven to be incredibly useful, and not having something similar for TiVo Stream makes the whole experience feel less complete.
Rounding out my complaints, I'm not thrilled with the customization restrictions TiVo added to the normal Android TV home screen. You can't move or remove the Stream or Netflix app shortcuts from your row of favorite applications, which is a corporate move that feels unnecessarily crummy.
TiVo Stream 4K The competition
As mentioned above, one of the closest competitors currently facing the TiVo Stream 4K is the Chromecast with Google TV. The devices are nearly identical on paper, offering the same streaming features, content curration services, and a nearly identical price. In our testing, however, we've found that the Google TV interface on the Chromecast does a better overall job of organizing and recommending shows for you to watch. The curation is built into the operating system rather than being a standalone app, and while the live TV support only works with YouTube TV right now, Google has said that's expanding to other apps in the near future (something we aren't expecting anytime soon on the TiVo Stream 4K).
There's also the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, which has the same elevator pitch of 4K HDR, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos for $50. The main difference with it is that it's powered by Fire TV OS which puts a heavy emphasis on Amazon Prime Video content. If you're someone that watches a lot of Prime Video shows and/or have a few Alexa speakers in your home, this could be a better fit. You can also watch Apple TV+ on it, but as of right now, there's still no HBO Max or Peacock.
Last but certainly not least, you shouldn't sleep on the Roku Streaming Stick+. Its interface isn't as flashy or content-heavy as the Fire TV, Chromecast, or TiVo Stream 4K, but it gets a lot of points for being incredibly simple and easy-to-use. You'll find a bunch of smaller streaming apps on the Roku that you can't get anywhere else, and you can watch Apple TV+ and Peacock just fine (but no HBO Max — yes this is all very confusing). 4K, HDR, and Dolby Atmos are all here, though you won't find Dolby Vision.
TiVo Stream 4K Should you buy it?
You should buy this if ...
You want a way to organize all your content into one app
The TiVo Stream app isn't perfect, but there's no denying it takes a lot of headache out of trying to find something to watch. With integrations for Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and more, it's a handy one-stop-shop.
You use Sling TV
Once you get a feel for how the remote favors the Stream app over the Sling TV one, the TiVo Stream 4K is probably the best streaming device you can get for watching the live television service.
You want an affordable 4K streaming device
The TiVo Stream 4K isn't the only $50 streamer with 4K, HDR/HDR10, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos, but it handles all content with ease and keeps it looking and sounding amazing the entire time.
You don't like the new Google TV interface
While I love how Google TV looks, you may not. If you aren't ready to move away from the current Android TV setup but still want a way to organize your shows, the TiVo Stream 4K could be a perfect fit.
You should not buy this if ...
You want the best content curation currently available
TiVo Stream gets a lot right, but I think it's fair to say that Google TV handles curation better. Not only is the interface more pleasing to look at, but it provides you with more information about all of your shows/movies and works with a bunch more services.
You don't like Android TV
While you can spend most of your time in the TiVo Stream app, the Stream 4K is still an Android TV device at the end of the day. If you don't like how the operating system works for whatever reason, you're probably better off with something else.
You want to watch Apple TV+
This isn't a specific con of the TiVo Stream 4K, but Android TV in general. There still isn't an Apple TV app for the platform, so if you plan on watching a lot of stuff on Apple TV+, you should consider getting a Roku or Fire TV instead.
While I have my fair share of annoyances with the TiVo Stream app, that doesn't take away from the Stream 4K being a superb $50 streaming device. It has all of the audio and video standards you could ask for, the remote works well, and the extra USB-C port allows for easy storage expansion (something you need an entire USB-C hub for on the Chromecast).
The Stream app isn't perfect, but it's still better than not having anything at all. It succeeds in its goal of curating all of your content into one destination, and while it may not have the prettiest or most seamless execution in the process, I'd rather have it over a regular Android TV setup that lacks the app.
I'm personally going to stick with my Chromecast with Google TV for the time being, but whether you're an avid Sling user, want the extra USB-C port, or can't stand how Google TV looks, the TiVo Stream 4K makes for a great alternative.
TiVo Stream 4K
Bottom line: Rather than being just another run-of-the-mill Android TV device, the TiVo Stream 4K stands out with its exclusive TiVo Stream app. It's a bit rough around the edges, but it's still genuinely helpful for simplifying how you stream things. Add that together with excellent picture/audio and a $50 price, and it's a great offer.

It includes multiple contact and motion detectors to cover most entry points of the house, and you can get it all for a reasonable price.
- The best value: Ring Alarm Security 8-Piece Kit ($250 at Amazon)
- The kitchen sink: Ring Alarm 14 Piece Kit ($330 at Amazon)
Cover all your main doors and points of entry with a Ring Alarm kit
When shopping for a home security system, you always start with one consideration: the layout of your home. How many doors do you have? How many windows? How much outside ground do you want to monitor? These are essential questions to answer because they will give you an idea of how much equipment you will need for proper coverage. The trick is to get as close as possible to the number of sensors you need without spending too much. If you can get close to the number of items you need in the same bundle, you will save yourself a good chunk of money.
Most average homes have two main points of entry and several windows on the bottom floor. If this is you and you are shopping for a Ring Alarm Security Kit, the eight-piece configuration should be enough to get you started.
With this configuration, you get three contact sensors, which are the devices you put on doors to be notified whenever they're opened. This is the perfect number, as you will get enough sensors to cover the front door and backdoor, as well as a third for a patio door or one of your primary windows.
The kit also comes with two motion detectors, enough to cover a couple of the main rooms in your home. Where you can't install a motion detector, you can choose to cover a window or door on that part of the house with a contact sensor.
All Ring Alarm Security kits also come standard with a base station, a keypad, and a range extender. You can also use any of them on any of Ring's Protect Plans. It should be noted, however, that while Ring's subscription plans offer you features like video recording and alerts, they can also add more to the overall price tag.
Finally, if you are an Amazon Alexa user, then you can connect your Ring security system to the Alexa Guard service. Alexa Guard is a free service from Amazon that lets you leverage the listening abilities of your existing Echo devices to enhance your home security. When connected to Alexa Guard, you can ask the Amazon smart assistant to arm/disarm your Ring security system. Alexa can also push security alerts to Ring emergency responders through the Ring app if you have a Ring Protect Plan.
You can always add more pieces later
If you've bought one of Ring's Alarm Security Kits and come to the conclusion that you need more, don't fret. You can buy individual pieces of equipment to fill out your home. Ring offers extra contact sensors, motion detectors, keypads, and range extenders on an individual basis.
You can also get a number of extras such as an alarm sound amplifier, as well as add other pieces of equipment from the Ring family such as smoke and CO alarms, flood and freeze sensors, security doorbells, and security cameras. Smart lighting systems are also available. In fact, there are a plethora of Ring security products for you to choose from!

I got about halfway through writing that sentence and then it all came flooding back — the summer of 2016, when reports of Note 7s catching fire started trickling in. Then came the recall, then the reissue, then the second recall, then the bans. How could I have forgotten, even briefly, something that fundamentally changed Samsung, and the wider smartphone industry, so dramatically?
I forgot it for a moment because Samsung's done such a profoundly good job helping us forget it. In the wake of the Note 7 debacle, the company returned the following April with the Galaxy S8, which turned out to be its best-selling flagship ever (and retains that title today), followed by the Note 8 a few months later. A year later, the Note 9 was the first premium Android phone to justify its thousand-dollar price tag, and last year Samsung gave us two Note 10 models to gawk over as it worked hard to convince us they stood apart from their Galaxy S counterparts.
So now we have the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, which borrows more than a bit of its pedigree from the huge and ultimately flawed Galaxy S20 Ultra. That phone, as you may have read, had some major issues with its cameras, from autofocus woes to exaggerated claims of telephoto prowess. Thankfully, the Note 20 Ultra makes up for those shortcomings and then some.
But is it right for you? Let's dig into it.
At a glance
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
Bottom line: If you're a loyal Galaxy Note buyer, the Note 20 Ultra is the best possible version ever made. Featuring a much-improved S Pen experience, a huge camera upgrade over previous Note versions, and every possible spec you could ask for, this $1300 monolith is worth the price of admission. You just have to know you need it.
The Good
- The best phone display out there
- Impeccable performance
- Great camera performance
- S Pen upgrades
- All-day battery life
The Bad
- Inexcusably slow and inconsistent fingerprint sensor
- Curved display causes false touches
- Very expensive
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Price & release date
The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is now available starting at $1,300 in the U.S., with an optional $1,400 model available offering 256GB of storage. Lucky for you, the Note 20 Ultra will likely be on sale for Amazon Prime Day 2020 on October 13-14 as well as on Black Friday 2020 later in November. We're not sure how low the price will go, but you can expect at least a few hundred dollars off.
It's also available much cheaper if you trade in your current smartphone — Samsung gives up to $650 in trade-in credits if you have a recent Galaxy flagship like the Note 10+ or S20 Ultra — or if you buy it through a carrier. In the U.S., like all Samsung products, the Note 20 Ultra is available at AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, along with smaller regional carriers and MVNOs. And because it's a 5G phone, you'll need a 5G plan to take advantage of the phone's extra cellular speeds.
You can get the Note 20 Ultra in three colors: Mystic Bronze, Mystic White, and Mystic Black. We're reviewing the new Mystic Bronze version and think it's the best color for the new phone.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Hardware & design
If it looks like a Note and smells like a Note, it must be a Note. That's basically what you get with the Note 20 Ultra since it hews closely to Samsung's boxy-body-curved-display design language employed since the Note 8 three years ago. This year, though, the Note 20 distills the design language to a science, executing tolerances that few manufacturers can achieve at scale.
From the front, it's really hard to tell the Note 20 Ultra apart from last year's Note 10+.
From the front, it's pretty hard to distinguish the Note 20 Ultra from the Note 10+, down to the only-slightly-larger 6.9-inch screen size. Turn it around, though, and the Ultra's enormous camera module is the first thing you see — especially because it prevents the phone from lying flat on a table.
As with all Samsung AMOLED displays, the one on the Note 20 Ultra is stunning — nearly perfect in many regards — with seamless color roll-off, inky blacks, incredible daytime brightness that's some 20% higher than last year's model (though during regular usage it's difficult to tell the difference), HDR10+ support, and more. The upside is that, once again, Samsung's made the best mobile screen out there, though it's not notably better than those from the Galaxy S20 series.
Samsung's made some slight alterations to the way 120Hz works versus the S20 series, too; instead of asking you to manually choose between keeping the refresh rate at either 120Hz or 60Hz, when set to the higher rate the system decides when to dynamically step down to 60Hz again. By taking the onus away from the user in deciding whether they want to prioritize smoothness over battery life, Samsung's landing on the best of both worlds, and I only noticed a few instances where the step-down was awkward and noticeable.
You still can't do 120Hz at the Note 20 Ultra's full resolution, which feels patronizing. Let me kill my battery if I want to!
OnePlus does the same thing with its OnePlus 8 series, but outdoes Samsung in one important area: it allows 120Hz at the phone's highest 1440p screen resolution. Samsung still limits Dynamic Motion Smoothing, as it calls the feature, to 1080p. I actually think this is a good move, since 120Hz at FHD resolution is a far better experience than 60Hz at QHD, but the option to override (and kill the battery much more quickly in the process) would be nice.
There are two areas where I wish Samsung would have taken critics' criticisms of the previous Note series to heart. The first is that Samsung did not improve the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor inside the Note 20 series. It's the same slow, unpredictable module from Qualcomm that debuted in early 2019 with the S10. The touch area is too small, and there's minimal visual or haptic feedback to indicate you've identified the correct location. The best Samsung can do is offer a small fingerprint overlay when the always-on-display is enabled, which it isn't by default.
I've complained about this fingerprint sensor through four Samsung phone generations now, and the response usually falls into two camps: people who think I'm completely overreacting and have no issues with usage at all, and those who, like me, despise the sensor and would prefer literally any other biometric option than this one. My frustration is exacerbated by the fact that, back in December, I saw Qualcomm's second-generation ultrasonic fingerprint sensor in action, and its promise was incredible: bigger, faster, and less error-prone. Maybe next year.
This hardware is massive and beautiful, but Samsung still uses last year's annoying and slow ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which is tragic.
My other area of complaint centers around the Note's curved glass. With any curved surface, palm and errant touch rejection need to be perfect. But it's not. On dozens of occasions during my time with the Note 20 Ultra I had to either repeat touches that weren't registered or correct errant taps in the wrong places. I know it's a hard problem to solve, but it's one of Samsung's own making; the company didn't put curved glass on the mainline Note 20 because it's cheaper. Samsung even lessened the severity of the curve radius on the S20 series earlier this year. But the Note 20 Ultra reinforces the fashion-over-function the series has been struggling with since the Note 5 back in 2015. I'm confident subsequent software updates will lessen the problem, but right now it is a problem.
Of course, the Note has always strived to appeal to both fashion and function, and the Note 20 Ultra, at least in this Mystic Bronze colorway, is stunning. Like, nicest-hardware-ever gorgeous. There were more than a few moments during my time with the phone when I just sat with it and admired the amount of work, and the years of exhaustive iteration, that led to this finished product. Yes, I think it's a bit too big for my personal tastes, but as a physical object, this phone is beautiful.
Samsung's decision to go matte with its finish this year should also be applauded, too. Glass phones are fragile, yes, but they're also disastrous fingerprint magnets. This phone is both hardier than previous Galaxy phones, outfitted with Corning's new Gorilla Glass Victus on the front and back, but it's the particular light-absorbing coating on top of it that I appreciate most. Contrasted with the reflective color-matched aluminum frame, I'm all-in on this particular design decision, and I hope Samsung keeps it around past this generation.

It should come as no surprise that the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra runs perfectly. The Snapdragon 865+ inside it isn't much changed from the 865 in the Galaxy S20 series, but the 10% bump in the Prime core clock speed, along with a GPU 10% faster, should be enough to satisfy you if top performance is a priority.
I really tried to tax the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, from trying my hand at S Pen-assisted video editing to playing round after round of COD:Mobile, and the phone obviously passed muster. Of course it did; it costs $1300. If you can find anything on the Android platform that is legitimately onerous to the Snapdragon 865+, I'll buy you a beer. (Seriously, tell me what you do to tax your phones aside from synthetic benchmarks.)
The Note 20 Ultra also comes with 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM standard, which should be more than enough for even the most spasmodic of multitaskers; 128GB of UFS 3.0 storage is the baseline, with an optional bump to 512GB for $100 more. And a microSD slot lengthens the still-plastic SIM tray (Samsung, up your game here); strangely, the regular Note 20 doesn't offer expandable storage.
There should be nothing surprising about the rest of the Note 20 Ultra's spec sheet: it has impressively full and loud stereo speakers, which I used often to play nursery rhymes for my two-year-old daughter; an IP68 rating, which protected the phone from the time my daughter grabbed it and dropped it into a bathtub full of water (it survived); and a 4,500mAh battery, which did a pretty good job lasting through most days.
I can confidently say the Note 20 Ultra will be an all-day phone for the vast majority of people who buy it, even with 120Hz enabled. I found my unit was usually nearly dead by around 9pm or 10pm most nights, after having removed it from the wireless charger next to my bed at 7am that morning. With an average of six hours of screen-on-time, I'm happy with the Note's uptime, but if battery life is more important than anything else, I'd stick with something in the Galaxy S20 line.
My colleague, Hayato Huseman, who produced our companion review video, told me he got over seven hours of screen-on-time per day, so your mileage may vary.
The 5G dilemma
It would be easy to ignore the elephant in the room, the single-biggest thing weighing on Samsung's 2020 smartphone pricing: 5G and the Snapdragon 865.
While 5G is certainly promising, right now it's hard to justify the added hardware cost that's built into it. Qualcomm charges the phone makers a lot of money for its top-of-the-line chip, and while some, like LG and OnePlus, have chosen to cut various corners to keep their flagships under $1000, Samsung leans into the reality.
At the moment, the U.S. is in a transitional phase, with T-Mobile in the best position to show its strength. And in markets where it inherited Sprint's 2500Mhz-based 5G network, it's a great value proposition, but the vast majority of the cities where the company operates have slower-than-LTE 600Mhz 5G.
AT&T suffers from the same problem: where its 5G network is available, it's only sending slower, more weather-hardy signals over the 850Mhz spectrum, which makes it similar to LTE in most regards.
Verizon's 5G, while considerably faster, is harder still to come by, and the company even admitted that it's not worth spending extra money on right now when it chopped the additional fee it used to charge to access its mmWave 5G network.
The problem is that, at the moment, if you want to spend good money on a phone in the U.S., you're essentially paying a 5G tax. That tax is less pronounced on devices running Qualcomm's less powerful Snapdragon 765, like the LG Velvet and Motorola Edge, but it's still there. If you don't care about being on the latest wireless network right now, and I don't blame you if that's the case, you have to make the choice to wait for the networks to improve or the phones to get cheaper. Either way, it's hard to recommend spending $1300 on a phone when you know so much of that investment is going to waste right now.
The S Pen — Joe's take
Year after year, the distinction between the Galaxy S and Note series becomes increasingly difficult to identify. The Note used to stand out as Samsung's power-user smartphone, but we now live in a world where the Galaxy S handset that comes out before the Note is every bit as fast and capable. As such, the biggest differentiator between these two devices comes down to a small piece of plastic — the S Pen. The S Pen has been one of the Note's greatest strengths since the very beginning, and with the Note 20 Ultra, it picks up a few key features and improvements in an attempt to make it stand out as a legitimate benefit over the already-great S20 lineup.
Perhaps the most notable upgrade the S Pen sees this year is its reduced latency. The Note 20 Ultra boasts an impressive latency response of just 9ms, which is considerably less than the 42ms latency previously offered on the Note 10. That's a flashy number to tout on paper, but the real-world benefits are more difficult to discern.
I don't have an artistic bone in my body, which means my use of the S Pen is reserved for navigating the user interface and taking handwritten notes. The Note 10's S Pen never felt slow or unresponsive to me, and using it side-by-side with the Note 20 Ultra, I personally can't notice much of a difference. The only time where I could visibly see the Ultra's reduced latency came into play when drawing long lines very quickly on the screen. Where the Note 10's S Pen gets every-so-slightly ahead of the line that was being drawn, the S Pen on the Note 20 sticks with its virtual ink as if you were writing on real paper. It's great to see that Samsung is constantly working to improve the S Pen experience, even if this is likely something that only skilled artists will see any true benefit from.
The other big upgrade for the S Pen this year is a new batch of Air Actions. Air Actions were introduced on the Note 9 as a way to remotely interact with the camera app, and with the Note 20, they're expanded as a new way to navigate the phone and quickly open apps. There are five actions/gestures you can perform with the S Pen, and each one can be customized as a navigation button, S Pen feature, or app shortcut.
The S Pen's new Air Actions are pretty unreliable, which means most people will abandon them before they're memorized.
The idea is to expand the functionality of the S Pen and make it more of a remote for the Note rather than just a stylus. In my testing, however, I found these Air Actions to be incredibly unreliable. Air Actions require an insane amount of precision to be performed accurately, and because of this, the majority of my time spent using them saw me making the wrong action or messing up the gesture altogether. The idea of having five app shortcuts that you can call on at any time is excellent, but after my 10th failed attempt at using Air Actions, I mostly gave up on the feature.
Samsung's also packed a bunch of smaller tweaks into the Samsung Notes app, and while there's nothing here that's revolutionary, they all help Samsung Notes feel even more fleshed out than it already was. Notes can now be organized in desktop-like folders for vastly better organization, there's a new PDF import tool for quickly annotating files, and an Auto Straighten feature that automatically straightens-out your handwriting with the tap of a button.
One of the flashers additions is Audio Bookmark, which works when you're jotting down notes while recording audio from a business call, lecture, etc. Once the recording is complete, you can tap on any notes you took during it and jump to that section of the recording. It's a very specific feature that a lot of folks may completely ignore, but it's honestly quite handy and could prove to be a lifesaver during especially long Zoom calls.
Here's the thing. Even though the reduced latency isn't super noticeable and the new Air Actions are disappointing, the S Pen was already the best stylus available for a smartphone. Even if Samsung only made it marginally better, it already had an incredible foundation to begin with. There's nothing here that'll completely change your mind about the S Pen if you already weren't a fan of it, but if it's a tool you've relied on for years, the Note 20 Ultra offers the best experience you can get for it.
And the good news is that the improvements to Samsung Notes will likely come to older versions of the Galaxy Note in an upcoming software update.
The S Pen — Daniel's take
Because of how much space the camera housing takes up on the right side of the phone, Samsung moved the S Pen's housing to the left side of the phone's underside, next to the bottom-firing speaker and the USB-C port. A lot of people have complained about how this interrupts muscle memory, or that it's not ideal for right-handed users. These are all true, and it's also true that even if you're coming from another Galaxy Note you'll likely get used to it within a couple of days. I did.
The more meaningful thing to know about the S Pen is that, while physically identical to the one on the Note 10 series (they're interchangeable if you have last year's phone), the Note 20 Ultra accepts input at five times lower latency than the Note 10 — 9 milliseconds versus 45ms — and less than half that of the Note 20, at 26ms. The 120Hz display also conveys that lower latency much more realistically.
In real-world usage, this means that there's considerably less lag between the time your S Pen touches the screen and when you see something happen, like a pen or brush stroke, or when navigating Samsung's One UI software.
With previous Notes, I'd always made a concerted effort to use the S Pen, but got frustrated by the input lag, which got worse the more text was added to the page. Even on first-party apps like S Note, I always got the impression the phone couldn't quite keep up with me, and I heard the same sentiment expressed by students and enterprise workers alike. This year, there are no such issues; Samsung not only made the software stack more robust, as you'll see below, but the hardware can now easily keep up with whatever you want to do, be it jot quick notes, sketch a thought, or spend time making fine art in one of the supported apps.
I surveyed my Twitter followers to see what they usually do with the S Pen and answers ranged from jotting down quick reminders or to-do items on the lock screen (one of my favorite features) to annotating complex scripts inside Microsoft OneNote. It made me understand that, for many people, having the S Pen is a nice-to-have addition to an already wonderful phone. But there are people who have been buying the Note series over the Galaxy S since 2011 and consider it an essential tool they couldn't live without.
Now that the S Pen is finally good enough, at least for me, to replace a traditional pad and paper setup for jotting down quick notes and organizing my thoughts, I look forward to revisiting this section in a few months with an update.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Software
Love it or hate it, using a Samsung phone means using and interacting with its One UI user interface. The Note 20 Ultra ships with the latest One UI 2.5 update, which is based on Android 10. It's made up of minor improvements that work together to feel like a significant upgrade to the user experience. If you're not a fan of Samsung's software, this isn't likely to change your mind, but at least it feels like the company is listening to feedback.
Samsung has created and stuck with a very cohesive design language for the core user interface and all of its first-party apps. This makes the Note 20 Ultra feel super polished, along with giving it a distinct look that's started to catch the attention of competing companies. It's bold, instantly-recognizable, and feels faster than ever thanks to the 120Hz display.
There are far too many extra features here and there to talk about everything that you get with One UI, but there are a few things that are especially noteworthy — one of which being Samsung's continued partnership with Microsoft for the Link to Windows feature. Samsung Notes can now auto-sync with your Microsoft OneNote account, and later this year, you'll be able to run multiple apps from your Note 20 side-by-side on your Windows computer.
Samsung DeX also gets a marked improvement this year, with the Note 20 adding the ability to use the DeX interface on your smart TV wirelessly. As long as you have a TV/streaming device that supports Miracast, you can send the DeX desktop UI to your television and use your Note 20 as a trackpad for navigation. It's another one of those features that you can very easily ignore, but it further adds value to the already massive list of things you can do with a Samsung phone. We didn't have a Miracast-enabled TV to test out wireless DeX, but when we get our hands on one we'll update this review.
Oh, and you can finally use third-party launchers with Android 10's fully gestural navigation. It's been a long time coming, and I was looking forward to switching over full-time to a third-party launcher like Lawnchair. Unfortunately, the implementation is extremely buggy; many times I found myself stuck inside my active app with the navigation gestures refusing to work until I turned off the screen and unlocked it again. So back to Samsung's launcher I went.
But that choice is ultimately the biggest strength of One UI. I don't have a need for a lot of the features Samsung bakes into it, but for the most part, you can pretty easily ignore them if they aren't of interest to you. There are still a few duplicate apps, which feels wasted on a $1300 smartphone, but the overall software package is pretty damn great. There's also the fact that Samsung is now promising the same three years of software updates that you get on a Pixel, which means you get the best of both worlds — endless features and guaranteed updates.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Cameras
Right off the bat, yes the Note 20 Ultra fixes the autofocus problems of the S20 Ultra. If that was a concern of yours, take heed and rest easy. Samsung accomplished this not by swapping out the 108MP sensor itself — that's still identical to the S20 Ultra — but by replacing phase-detect autofocus with a laser-assisted focus module.
While Samsung still considers the $1400 Galaxy S20 Ultra to be the best camera it makes, largely thanks to the beefed-up 48MP telephoto camera that can do 100X "Space Zoom," give me the Note 20 Ultra's camera loadout any day of the week, largely due to that more reliable autofocus.
This may not be Samsung's best camera, but it's definitely the most reliable.
The Note 20 Ultra's primary camera is huge, both physically and influentially. It's a 1/1.33" sensor, only slightly smaller than the beefy boi inside the Huawei P40 Pro, considered by many (and us) to be the best sensor in a phone today. That large sensor there's plenty of room for packing tiny pixels, and Samsung is using nona-binning, pixel binning by a factor of nine, to reach a social media-friendly 12MP with the final shot. Along the way, the photo not only does a great job retaining the incredible spatial detail that 108 megapixels provides, but it technically performs better in lower light situations, too, than other high-resolution sensors that don't bin down as much.
And now that Samsung's resolved the issues around autofocus, I'm happy to say that this is one of the most versatile cameras on an Android phone today. Photos come out typically Samsung-saturated, and the shallow depth of field afforded by the larger sensor adds natural background blur, dramatically accentuating foreground subjects like a DSLR.
This blessing can also be a curse, though, as the usable in-focus area is much narrower than with most other phone cameras; photos that look like they're in focus on the phone may be slightly out of focus when viewed on a larger display. But that shallow focus also yields some incredibly striking shots, including a few that are going to be added to my Google Photos Favorites. I'd have liked a closer minimum focus distance, or a dedicated macro lens, but you can't get everything you want.
Protip: An easy way of ensuring your subject is in focus is by switching to Pro mode in the camera app and selecting manual focus. Adjusting the focus ring creates a green "peaking" overlay on what's in focus.
I wrote this in my Galaxy S20+ review and the same is true here: Samsung still applies way too much skin smoothing to its photos captured in Auto mode. Personal preference perhaps, but Samsung needs to get out of its own way here and let people add these filters in post-production.
I find the effect less severe than on previous models, but it's still reliably distracting, something I wish Samsung would address. But then I switch to the ultrawide (which is great, but I'm not going to talk about it because it's the same one as found in the Galaxy S20 series) or the telephoto, and I remember why I love this phone's camera setup.
As I mentioned at the top of this section, Samsung considers the cheaper Note 20 Ultra a step down from the S20 Ultra's telephoto because it uses a smaller 12MP sensor paired with a 5x optical "periscope" f/3.0 lens. Samsung employs this sensor very conservatively; in anything but the brightest conditions, it hops back to a cropped version of the primary sensor.
But I've managed to take some really great photos from this telephoto, far better than the temperamental one on the S20 Ultra (though admittedly I gave up on that phone before a series of software updates improved telephoto performance). The ultrawide is also tons of fun to use, because, not in spite of, its tremendous optical distortion.
Night mode performs about the same as the S20 Ultra, which means that despite the larger sensor, the tiny individual pixels can't pull enough light from a very dark scene to eke out much resolvable detail. In this comparison between the Note 20 Ultra, the S20+ and the Pixel 4a, the cheaper Galaxy easily comes out ahead.
The Note 20 Ultra's 10MP selfie camera isn't as good as the one on the S20 Ultra, but that's OK, it's still pretty good. While I also found it to soften facial detail, it still makes me look pretty good, and that's good enough for me.
Finally, Samsung still does video better than any other Android manufacturer; this one does 8K at 24fps or 4K at 60fps, but you'll only get Super Steady mode at 1080p30, and only with the ultra-wide sensor.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Competition
To say that the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is one of the best smartphones of 2020 is no exaggeration, but as powerful and impressive as it may be, we've seen tons of other top-notch handsets that have come out before it — one of which being Samsung's own Galaxy S20. The Galaxy S20 offers a very similar user experience compared to what you get on the Note 20 Ultra, including a 120Hz AMOLED display, top-of-the-line Snapdragon processor, and an excellent camera system. The form factor is also a lot easier to manage and use with one hand, not to mention it has a retail price that's $300 cheaper. If you can live without the S Pen and are OK with a smaller phone, the Galaxy S20 is a phenomenal purchase.
If you absolutely need the S Pen but can live without the 120Hz refresh rate screen, last year's Galaxy Note 10+ is still sublime, and Samsung has committed to an extra year of software updates, so you don't have to feel rushed to buy a new phone anytime soon. At over $1000, it's still nowhere near a cheap phone, but the Note 10+ does come with double the base storage as the Note 20 Ultra, which is a weird brag.
Small phones aren't for everyone, however, so another great alternative is the OnePlus 8 Pro. It touts a 6.78-inch 120Hz screen, Snapdragon 865 chipset, excellent cameras, wireless charging, and 5G connectivity. It's also powered by OxygenOS, which is widely regarded as one of the best Android interfaces on the market. You don't get the S Pen or all of the software goodies found with One UI, but you're getting a phone that's every bit as capable as the Note for less money.
Finally, if you're getting ready to spend $1,300 on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, it may be worth spending a little bit more for the Galaxy Z Flip 5G. This is one of the best folding phones that's currently available, and while it touts plenty of impressive specs, the Z Flip also has a cool factor that you just don't get with any other "normal" smartphone. The Z Flip 5G looks like a typical Android phone at first glance, but when you're done using it, you can fold it up like a flip-phone for incredible portability. You make some technical compromises compared to the Note 20 Ultra, but if you're able to spend this kind of money on your next phone, you may want to consider getting something a tad more exciting.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Should you buy it?
Who it's for
- Current Galaxy Note owners
- Someone looking for an all-in-one smartphone
Who it's not for
- Fans of oversized phones
- Value shoppers
The Note 20 Ultra is big. It's expensive. It's niche. It does everything, yet Samsung's having an increasingly difficult time differentiating it from the Galaxy S series.
At this point in the smartphone game, buying a Note is either in your vocabulary or it's another language completely. Especially at this starting price, and with these compromises.
I've used the Galaxy S20+ more than any other phone this year; for me, it strikes the right balance for my needs. The Note 20 Ultra is a better phone, but it just may also be too much phone for me. I think by now we've all identified where we land on the spectrum of smartphone needs, and I'll just keep chipping away at S Pen mastery until it's part of my daily routine and I can finally say, without reservation, that I'm a Note person, too.
I have absolutely no reservations recommending such an extraordinary phone, but if you don't need 5G right now, you may want to wait a few months for the networks to improve — and for the Note 20 Ultra's first inevitable discount.

Features you should know
The Note 20 Ultra has an absolutely gorgeous AMOLED display, and while the stark white background of the user interface looks great during the day, it can be rather blinding at night. This is where dark mode comes into play, which replaces all of those white backgrounds with sleek black ones. It's easy on the eyes, looks fantastic, and can even help you conserve some battery life if you're in a pinch.
We also recommend setting up Samsung Pay on the phone. Samsung Pay is one of the most capable mobile payment solutions on the market, as it works with both NFC and MST technologies. In simpler terms, this basically means that you can use the Note 20 Ultra with Samsung Pay at virtually any store you go to. There are still plenty of retailers/shops in the U.S. that haven't adopted payment terminals with tap-and-pay technology, but Samsung Pay is still able to work at these places just fine.
Other features you'll want to explore are Samsung Health and Samsung DeX. The former is basically Samsung's alternative to the Fitbit app, giving you a platform for tracking your steps, exercise, and more. With DeX, you can plug your Note 20 Ultra into a computer monitor (or connect it wirelessly to a supported television), see a desktop-like interface, and use your phone as a mobile workstation that's designed to help you get as much work done as possible.
What about the Note 20?
While this review focuses on the larger and more expensive (and better, if we're being honest) Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, the Note 20 is also available now starting at $999.
There are a lot of differences between the two phones, but the main ones revolve around screen refresh rate, material use, and cameras.
While the Note 20 Ultra has a beautiful QHD+ 120Hz refresh rate AMOLED display, the Note 20 is limited to 1080p and 60Hz. Its glass is also flat as opposed to curved, which some may argue is a benefit — our reviewer, Hayato Huseman, agrees, giving the Note 20 a 4.5/5-star review.
The Note 20's back is plastic, though the frame is aluminum like its more expensive counterpart. Its camera setup is also very different — nearly identical to the Galaxy S20+ with a 12MP primary sensor, a 64MP 3x telephoto lens, and a 12MP ultrawide along with a 10MP front-facer.
And while it has a Snapdragon 865+, just like the Note 20 Ultra, the regular Note 20 is limited to 8GB of RAM. There's also 128GB of storage with no option of expansion.
While on paper the Note 20 doesn't seem all that impressive — especially for the $1000 price — we've now reviewed the Note 20 and came to the conclusion that it's a really good product and definitely worth your consideration.

While on its surface Genshin Impact is a straightforward action-adventure that tutorializes itself pretty well, there are a lot of hidden systems buried in the menus that can make the game complicated to navigate.
Explore the vast world of Teyvat
Genshin Impact
A Ghibli-esque open-world adventure
Genshin Impact puts you in the shoes of the Traveler, a world-hopping protagonist stranded in the world of Teyvat, which is stuffed with elemental magic and mystical beings. As you search for your lost siblings, you'll meet new companions with elemental powers, seven deities, and a strange sprite named Paimon who will help you hone your abilities and meet your destiny.
Fortunately, once you get past all the buttons, notifications, and currencies, Genshin Impact is still a pretty straightforward experience. So while you're wrapping up the tutorials and deciding which mountain to climb first, here are some basics to the game that will help you as you set off on your adventures with Paimon and friends.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
What is Genshin Impact?
Genshin Impact is an open-world action-adventure title developed by Chinese studio MiHoYo and released on mobile, PC, and PS4 (with other platforms to come). It's free-to-play with gacha microtransactions, and while it's mostly single-player, there are some cooperative elements in the later game.
There's more info on what exactly this game is and whether you should play it in our guide on the subject, but suffice to say: if you like open-world titles, games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and are happy trying something to free to see if you like it, it's worth giving Genshin Impact at least a shot.
What character should I play as in Genshin Impact?
You'll begin Genshin Impact in the shoes of the Traveler, selecting either the male or female of the Traveler siblings at the outset. The Traveler is a sword wielder who at first will use Anemo (wind) magic, but later will gain access to other elements. They're solid enough for the game's story and will be required for some in-game moments, but they're not mind-blowing in the late game.
You'll gain three other characters just by playing the tutorial: Amber, a fire-element archer, Kaeya, another sword user with ice powers, and Lisa, a mage with lightning abilities. Kaeya is fine, Lisa is decent, and while fire attacks and ranged abilities are critical for exploring the world, Amber isn't very strong at all. Additionally, if you're playing during the game's early launch period, you're likely to get Noelle from your first gacha roll. Noelle's pretty solid.
Basically, these four are fine if you just want to play through the story. But if you want to use powerful characters to beat some of the game's difficult later challenges, you'll need to engage with the game's gacha mechanics to roll for others. More on how to do that later, but here are the characters of each element you should be on the look-out for:
- Wind: Venti, Jean
- Fire: Diluc, Ziangling
- Ice: Qiqi, Chongyun
- Water: Mona, Barbara
- Lightning: Fischl, Kequing, Razor
- Earth: Ninguang, Traveler (The Traveler's Wind form is actually stronger than their Earth form, but there just aren't nearly as many good Earth users in the gacha pulls as there are Wind)
How do I get more characters in Genshin Impact?
Aside from the Traveler, Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa, all other characters in Genshin Impact are obtained via the game's gacha system, where you can spend a currency called "Fate" for a chance at new weapons and new characters.
You can acquire Fate by spending 160 Primagems for either an Acquaint Fate or an Intertwined Fate, and each Fate is equal to one "roll" of the gacha system. You can also save up your Fates and use ten at once for a guarantee of one rarer item or character in that set of ten.
The currency system can be a bit complex, and if you want to spend real money you'll be buying an entirely different currency that you'll then convert to Primagems, but the game gives you a lot of free Primagems just for playing, finishing achievements, and progressing the story. It's easy enough to roll a new character every week or so if you're playing regularly, so keep an eye on those Primagems, spend them on Fate when you can, and hope for the better characters!
How do I level up my characters in Genshin Impact?
You may have noticed as you play Genshin Impact that there are two different ways to level up. One is your Adventure Rank, which we'll get to in a moment. But separate from that are the individual character levels, which impact how strong they are in combat.
Characters will get small amounts of experience from defeating monsters, but that's not at all the ideal way to level them up. Instead, you want to visit their character screens and choose "Level Up," then spend different types of tomes to give them EXP and raise their levels.
There are three types of tomes: Hero's Wit, Adventurer's Experience, and Wanderer's Advice. Hero's Wit gives the most EXP, Adventurer's Experience gives a moderate amount, and Wanderer's Advice gives a small amount. You'll get all three by completing achievements, progressing the story, defeating monsters, and searching treasure chests out in the world, and you can use them in bulk to raise a character's levels rapidly.
Once a character reaches certain level milestones (20, 40, 60, etc) they'll no longer be able to level up, and you'll have to use a combination of rarer items to "Ascend" them to the next rank and enable them to level up again. Ascension items are different for each character and can be obtained in a variety of ways. Once they Ascend, they'll learn a new talent and you'll be able to level the character up again. It's also worth mentioning that you don't unlock Ascension at all until you're at least Adventure Rank 15 in order to use the feature, and higher Adventure Ranks are needed to unlock higher Ascensions too.
How do I raise my Adventure Rank in Genshin Impact?
Adventure Rank is separate from character levels in Genshin Impact -- think of it more as your level as a player. Adventure Rank is increased by finishing quests, opening chests, and completing various objectives out in the world.
To gain EXP toward your Adventure Rank, you can:
- Worship at Statues of the Seven
- Open treasure chests
- Complete story quests
- Do commissions for the Adventurers' Guild
- Complete tasks for the Adventurers' Handbook
- Complete Shrine of the Depths
- Complete dungeons
Every time you raise your Adventure Rank, you can collect rewards from the Adventurers' Guild in Monstadt. You also unlock certain features at higher ranks, such as Ley Lines at 8 and 12, Expeditions at 14, co-op mode at 16, and a Battle Pass at 20.
How do I get better weapons in Genshin Impact?
Though you can acquire some weapons just by exploring and opening treasure chests, you'll obtain the better weapons in the game by engaging with the same gacha system that allows you to unlock new characters. Just like with characters, you'll need to spend Primagems on Fates, then spend those on the gacha for the chance to get random weapons for your characters.
The good news is, you will get a lot more weapons than you will characters -- far more than you need. The bad news is, you won't get a lot of the really good weapons, which you do need.
You see, the way weapons work in Genshin Impact is that most weapons are fairly weak when you first get them. However, you can break down weaker weapons to level up the ones you are using, and you can use duplicates of the weapon you're using to "refine" it to get stronger still. All this happens in the "Weapons" menu.
Like leveling up characters, eventually you won't be able to level up a weapon anymore, and you'll have to use special materials to "Ascend" the weapon further. These items come from a wide range of sources including monsters, dungeons, and shops, so you'll have to hunt far and wide to empower your best equipment.
How do I finish the story of Genshin Impact?
For now, the story of Genshin Impact isn't finished. You can get as far as Chapter 1, which takes you to Liyue, but many of the game's regions and plotlines haven't been released yet. That's okay, because MiHoYo is still working on the game, and more chapters will be released at later dates. Plus, the content that's already in the game will take hours to finish, and there's plenty of places to explore and things to do even after you hit pause on the story.
That said, you might find yourself stuck and unable to progress despite there being more story to go. When this happens, the best thing to do is work on increasing your Adventure Rank. There are multiple points in the story where it won't move forward until you've achieved a certain Adventure Rank, so if nothing seems to be happening, then get out there and open chests, explore, finish commissions and sidequests, and complete dungeons until you get a bit higher up the ranks.

Not only did we get the long-awaited dark mode and important changes to app permissions, Android 10 also marked Google's departure from dessert names and ushered in a new Android logo/brand.
Android 10 was a year of growth and maturity for the operating system, and those same principles are being carried over to Android 11. The core user interface and design remains mostly unchanged, but a bunch of smaller tweaks and features help to further refine the platform as a whole.
Ready to learn all about what Android 11 is packing? Here's everything you need to know!
Fast updates
Google Pixel 4a
Get Android 11 before anyone else
If you want to be among the first to use Android 11, the Pixel 4a is for you. The big draw is its guaranteed software updates and being first-in-line for them as they're released. You're also getting a fantastic rear camera, OLED display, snappy performance, and reliable battery life.
Is Android 11 available for my phone?
Following months of Developer Previews and Betas, Google launched the final build of Android 11 on September 8, 2020. The update was ready right away for Pixel phones as per usual, and this year, Android 11 was also available Day One for select handsets from OnePlus, Xiaomi, OPPO, and Realme.
That's a big step forward for Android updates as a whole, but there's also still plenty of work that's left to be done. If you have a phone from Samsung, Motorola, or most other companies, you'll be waiting a few more months before Android 11 arrives on your device.
While that's certainly annoying, we're making things as easy as possible for you by tracking any and all Android 11 updates as we learn more about them.
What's going on with Android 11 on non-Pixel phones?
As noted above, this year's Android update rollout was a bit different compared to past releases. Instead of Pixels being the only phones that were treated to the new software, handsets from other select manufacturers were also treated to Android 11 in some form.
Let's first look at Samsung, which is marketing its Android 11 update as One UI 3.0. Most of the core design principles remain in place, but there is a lot that's new to check out. Samsung's touting things like an improved lock screen, a more customizable always-on display, new accessibility tools, and more. It's currently in a limited beta, and we expect the final build to be available by the end of 2020.
We should also mention OxygenOS 11, which is the Android 11 update for OnePlus phones. OxygenOS 11 introduces a major design shift for OnePlus, with the company shifting away from its stock Android aesthetic and embracing design elements found in Samsung's One UI interface. We aren't entirely sure how we feel about the change quite yet, but it'll certainly be interesting to see where OnePlus goes from here.
Lastly, we have ColorOS — the custom Android interface used on OPPO smartphones. ColorOS 11 is rolling out now to OPPO devices, and it offers a lot of key improvements. In addition to the usual Android 11 goodies, some other highlights include a customizable dark mode, a Super Power Saving Mode to extend battery life, and a new feature called OPPO Relax 2.0 that aims to help you unwind and fall asleep at night.
Have we reviewed Android 11?
We'll dive into some of Android 11's biggest features below, but before we do any of that, we should address the elephant in the room — is Android 11 any good? The short answer, yes. It is very, very good.
It's understandable that some people may find Android 11 to be boring or not very different from Android 10, but the fact of the matter is that Android no longer needs massive overhauls every single year the way it used to. The core Android experience in 2020 is really darn good, and Android 11 elevates it even more. All of the conversation improvements are great for streamlining notifications, more powerful permissions is always something we're happy to see, and the redesigned power button menu adds a ton of extra functionality.
There are a couple of changes we aren't completely in love with (namely the new multitasking window and Suggested Apps feature for the home screen), but those things are easy to overlook. The vast majority of what Google did with Android 11 was for the better, and the end result is software that's more functional and enjoyable to use.
How do Android 11 chat bubbles work?
As mentioned above, there isn't one single overhaul or massive change found with Android 11. Instead, it's a mix of many small tweaks here and there. A few of them focus on improving your messaging experience, with Google offering a lot in this department.
First on the list, we have chat bubbles. Similar to what Facebook's offered for years with its Messenger app on Android, chat bubbles in Android 11 hide your ongoing conversations in little bubbles on the side of your screen. You can move the bubbles around, and tapping on them reveals that specific conversation. The Bubbles API is available for all messaging apps, with Google encouraging developers to adopt it.
In another effort to make sure you can get to your messages as quickly as possible, Android 11 introduces a dedicated conversation section in your notification shade that offers instant access to any ongoing conversations you have. It also makes it easier for your messaging notifications to stand out from other ones, ensuring you never miss an important text ever again.
Speaking of messages and notifications, Android 11 makes it possible to send images when replying to a message directly from the notification shade.
What's new with permissions in Android 11?
Looking back on Android 10, one of its highlights was its improved handling of app permissions. Android 10 gave users more control over applications and what they could access, and Android 11 keeps this train rolling with a wonderful new addition.
Now, when an app asks for permission to use sensitive features like your location, microphone, or camera, you can choose to only grant it access on a one-time basis. The app will be able to use that permission during that instance of you using the app, but as soon as you leave it, the permission is revoked. The next time you use the app and it wants to use that permission, it needs to be granted access again.
Giving apps permission to these aspects of your phone should not be taken lightly, so we're thrilled to see Google giving users more control over their data like this.
On the subject of permissions and privacy, we had the opportunity to sit down and talk with Charmaine D'Silva — Product Manager and privacy specialist over at Google. They helped give us a deeper understanding of how some of these features came to be and why they're so important. If you have a few minutes to check it out, it's definitely worth a read.
Does Android 11 have a built-in screen recorder?
For the past few Android releases, we've been patiently waiting for Google to add a built-in screen recorder. It's not something you'll use every day (if ever for some people), but the fact that such a basic function isn't baked into Android at its core is getting annoying.
Thankfully, Android 11 finally changes that. This version of Android does include the feature, accompanied with a clean UI and toggles for recording audio and showing touches with your recording.
There's not much else to say about this, other than the fact that we're glad we can finally put this feature request to bed.
Is Android 11 compatible with folding phones?
If there's been a place of notable advancement in the Android space, it's been with displays. Companies are doing what they can to offer the best and most exciting smartphone screen possible, and as great as this is, Android needs to catch up with better support for all of these advancements.
Folding phones are proving to be quite popular so far in 2020, and especially with devices like the Galaxy Z Flip and Motorola RAZR that have the "flip phone" folding design, Android 11 adds the "hinge angle sensor API" so apps can easily detect the hinge of these folding phones. With this information, developers can adapt their apps to work around the hinge and create unique experiences because of that (like how Google Duo changes its UI when you do a half-fold on the Z Flip).
The other big upgrade smartphone displays have seen has to do with faster refresh rates. It's no longer uncommon for phones to ship with screens that refresh at 90Hz or 120Hz, and Android 11 allows developers to take better advantage of these powerful displays. Developers can select which refresh rate their application should run at, and if the developer determines their app looks best at 90Hz or 60Hz, they can make that decision and have the phone's display change its refresh rate accordingly when using that app.
How does Android 11 work with 5G?
5G finally started making its way to people in 2019, and throughout 2020, more and more folks have started connecting to the next generation of wireless data. To help that process be as smooth as can be, Android 11 adds a very important "Dynamic Meterdness API."
That may not sound very exciting on paper, but it essentially allows phones to take full advantage of all the power 5G brings.
If the API detects that you're connected to an unlimited 5G signal, you'll access the highest possible quality for videos and graphics. The potential for 5G is pretty darn cool, and this API ensures you take full advantage of the speeds available to you.
What phone should I get for the best Android 11 experience?
Whether you want to be among the first to get Android 11 or experience it the way Google intended, the Pixel 4a is the phone for you. It's the newest Pixel that's currently available, and especially if you like getting a good deal, it's a hard phone to ignore.
The Pixel 4a is all about delivering a quality Android experience for a low price, and in these regards, it suceeds tremendously. Google crammed a lot into the 4a, inlcuding phenomenal cameras, an OLED display, good performance, long battery life, and more. The design is a little boring, but the phone's also a great size for one-handed use.
You won't find any features like wireless charging or a 90Hz display, but if you want a meat and potatoes Android phone that does everything really well for a low price, the Pixel 4a is the phone for you.

In Final Fantasy 7 Remake, weapons are handled a little differently than in the original. Implementing the SP system, you can level up your gear and customize each piece to suit your play style. Even better, each weapon you pick up has the potential to serve you throughout the game, so if you want to rock Cloud's Buster Sword until the end, you can do that!
Weapons in Final Fantasy 7 Remake
While each of your four characters starts with a weapon, there are five other weapons for each of them scattered throughout Midgar, giving you a total of 24 weapons in the game. Some are impossible to miss, while others will require a fair bit of effort to acquire. Each has a unique ability and each can be leveled up using your total SP. While every weapon has its uses, you are likely to find some that just don't mesh well with your style of play.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Cloud's Weapons
Cloud, the ex-SOLDIER turned mercenary, relies primarily on swords. He starts with the iconic Buster Sword and quickly gains his second blade.
- Buster Sword - Cloud starts with this sword. It is well-rounded with just a slight edge on physical attacks and can suit many roles.
- Iron Blade - Cloud is given this sword in Chapter 3. It focuses a little more on defense and magic, while still being well-rounded.
- Nail Bat - If you complete the Chapter 8 side quest Kids on Patrol, Cloud receives this weapon. It is focused exclusively on physical attacks with no bonuses to magic.
- Hardedge - This sword can be purchased from the weapons shop in Wall Market in Chapter 9. More physical attack than magic or defense, this sword is fairly versatile.
- Mythril Saber - This sword can be purchased from the weapons shop in Wall Market in Chapter 14. Focused exclusively on magic, this is the sword you'll want to use Cloud as a magic attacker.
- Twin Stinger - This sword can be found in a chest directly in your path in Chapter 17. It is not as magic focused as the Mythril Saber but still provides more magic boosts than any other weapon.
Tifa's Weapons
Tifa's weapons are all specialized gloves since she's a melee fighter who relies on her fists. Although Tifa is primarily used in close combat, some of her gloves can hold a lot of materia, giving her even more room for customization.
- Leather Gloves - Tifa starts with these gloves. They are well-rounded with a slight edge to physical attacks.
- Metal Knuckles - Tifa is given these gloves after defeating the Crab Warden in Chapter 5. They sacrifice magic and defense to make Tifa a strictly physical attacker.
- Sonic Strikers - These gloves are in a chest in one of the connecting corridors in Chapter 7. They provide a good balance between physical attack and magic attack but cost Tifa in defense.
- Feathered Gloves - Another pair of gloves found in a chest, this pair can be found in Chapter 10, in the first sluice gate you find in the sewers. They are well balanced while providing increased ATB gain and damage reduction when blocking.
- Mythril Claws - These gloves are a reward for beating the boss Failed Experiment in Chapter 13. Focused exclusively on magic and mostly offensive attacks, these gloves turn Tifa into the fastest black mage.
- Purple Pain - Tifa can find these gloves in Chapter 16. After she falls, instead of using the first ladder, cross over using monkey bars to reach the chest. These specialized gloves focus on critical hits and critical hit damage. Because of Tifa's speed, these gloves can shred your enemies, especially when paired with Luck Materia.
Barret's Weapons
Not one to let something as minor as losing half his arm hold him back, all of Barret's weapons are attached where his forearm used to be. Ranging from guns to specialized close combat weapons, Barret's weapons give the most variance in utility.
- Gatling Gun - Barret starts with this gun. It is well balanced with a lot of basic upgrades, leaving you room to explore all of Barret's possibilities.
- Light Machine Gun - Biggs gives Barret this gun at the end of Chapter 6. While still well balanced, this gun gives Barret more magic options, making him a better support.
- Big Bertha - This gun can be purchased from the weapons shop in the Sector 7 Slums in Chapter 13. This gun takes Barret's already high HP and boosts it even further, making him the ideal tank.
- Steel Pincers - This weapon can be purchased from the Moogle Emporium in Chapter 14 for 7 Moogle Medals. With more magic boosts than any of Barret's other weapons, this weapon gives Barret both melee options and mage options.
- Wrecking Ball - If you complete the Chapter 14 side quest: Subterranean Menace, Barret will be given this weapon. another melee option for Barret, this weapon focuses on dealing as much physical damage as possible while relying on his high HP to survive the fight.
- EKG Cannon - After you speak with Mayor Domino in Chapter 16, Hart will sell you this weapon for 10,000 Gil. High in magic, while retaining physical attack, this gun lets Barret deal a done of damage from a distance.
Aerith's Weapons
Aerith is a magic user connected to the very lifeforce of the planet. She uses staffs and rods to cast magic and keep a bit of space between herself and enemies. Her weapons are made for enhancing her magic.
- Guard Stick - Aerith starts with this staff. Not nearly as balanced as the other starting weapons, this staff focuses Aerith on magic use.
- Silver Staff - This staff can be purchased from the Moogle Emporium in Chapter 8 for two Moogle Medals. Leaning even heavier into magic-exclusive territory, this staff sacrifices defense and physical attack for more specialized magic.
- Arcane Scepter - If you complete either the A Dynamite Body or the Shears' Counterattack sidequests in Chapter 9, Aerith will be rewarded with this scepter. Another magic focused weapon, this staff primarily boosts offensive magic. Aerith can do a ton of damage with this, but doesn't do nearly as much healing or support.
- Mythril Rod - This rod can be found in a chest in an abandoned carriage near the beginning of the Train Graveyard in Chapter 11. You may be noticing a trend here with yet another magic focused weapon. This staff gives more defense than Aerith's other staves, allowing her to survive a little longer.
- Bladed Staff - In Chapter 11, you can only get this staff if you equip the Steal Materia and steal it from Eligor. This staff boosts Aerith's critical hits and magic damage if her luck holds out. Definitely equip Luck Materia with this one.
- Reinforced Staff - This staff is in a chest in the first room at the start of Chapter 17. This staff sacrifices a fair bit of offensive capability in exchange for defense. If you want to focus on Aerith as a supporting character, this might be your best bet.
What are weapon abilities?
Every weapon in Final Fantasy 7 Remake has a weapon ability. This is a special attack that can be used in battle from the abilities menu. The more a character uses their weapon in battle, the more they increase their proficiency and when their proficiency reaches 100%, they permanently learn that ability. This means you may want to spend time using each weapon, so you can use every ability, no matter which weapon you have equipped.
Cloud's abilities
- Focused Thrust: Cloud lunges and hits multiple times, increasing stagger.
- Triple Slash: Cloud attacks three times, bouncing from one enemy to the next, each hitting harder than the last.
- Disorder: Cloud strikes with a devastating attack followed by a fluid mode switch.
- Infinity's End: Cloud winds up and strikes from overhead with increased damage on stagger.
- Blade Burst: Cloud sends out a wave of non-elemental energy.
- Counterstance: Cloud braces for an attack, and follows up with a powerful counterattack.
Tifa's abilities
- Divekick: Tifa leaps into the air to unleash a powerful kick.
- Overpower: Tifa uses this in conjunction with basic attacks to deliver more pressure.
- Focused Strike: Tifa evades, only to unleash a charged attack which increases stagger.
- Starshower: Tifa attacks many times in rapid succession, and increases the strength of the next command.
- Chi Trap: Tifa creates an orb of chi that damages enemies upon contact.
- True Strike: Tifa attacks with incredible strength at close range, increasing stagger damage bonus.
Barret's abilities
- Focused Shot: This uses all ATB for a single, concentrated burst, and increases stagger.
- Lifesaver: Barret takes damage in place of other party members.
- Maximum Fury: This uses all ATB to fire a long stream of bullets.
- Charging Uppercut: Barret rushes the enemy and launches them into the air while increasing charge.
- Smackdown: Barret strikes the ground sending nearby enemies flying.
- Point Blank: This uses all ATB to deliver a powerful, close-range attack that sends enemies flying.
Aerith's abilities
- Arcane Ward: Aerith casts a ward that doubles all offensive spells cast within the ward.
- Sorcerous Storm: Aerith deals magic damage to nearby enemies.
- Fleeting Familiar: Aerith summons a fairy who follows up your abilities and spells.
- Ray of Judgment: This costs two ATB to fire a series of energy bursts, and increases stagger damage bonus.
- Lustrous Shield: Aerith conjures a magic shield that keeps enemies and projectiles from hitting.
- ATB Ward: This costs two ATB to conjure a ward. Allies partially regain ATB spent within the ward.
What is SP and how does it work?
Regardless of which weapons you choose to use, every weapon can be enhanced with the entire pool of SP your character has earned. This is good news because it means each of your weapons remains useful throughout the entire game. Most of your SP will be earned just by battling and leveling up. You can also buy an additional 10 SP for each character from the Moogle Emporium for five Moogle Medals each. When you have enough SP, you can enhance your weapons by following these easy steps:
Press the Options button to open the main menu.
Select Upgrade Weapons.
Press X to select the character whose weapons you wish to upgrade.
Press X to select the weapon you wish to upgrade. This will open the Weapon Core menu.
- Depending on how far along you are, you will be presented with a Core and potentially several Sub-Cores. Using L2 and R2, select the Core or Sub-Core you wish to enhance.
Using either the left joystick or the left and right buttons on the directional pad, move to the skill you wish to unlock.
- Press X to unlock the skill.
- Continue until you have spent your SP.
- Repeat the process on each of your weapons.
Each weapon has different skills in their Cores and Sub-Cores, giving them the potential to be used in very different ways. Some will enhance a character's magic, while others focus more on physical attacks. Some are very well balanced, while others are specialized. Depending on your style of play, you will likely favor some weapons, but the SP system allows all of your weapons to be fully upgraded, putting them on relatively equal footing.

Remembering Google Play Music: A mixtape for my favorite streaming service
How are you liking the Pixel 5 so far?
Get spooked with these great horror games for the PS4
Enjoy getting the pants scared clean off you? You might want to check out these horror games.My wife likes to say that I am the internet. I work over the internet all day, I play games over the internet, and I look to the internet when it's time to settle in and watch a movie or a show. I guess she's right.
2020 has been hell for everyone.
But these past six months have been hell. Not just for me, but for everyone. Being cooped up inside or trying to stay six feet away from anything on two legs is stressful enough, but once you run out of things to do, you end up spending more and more time on your phone or at the computer. My wife and I decided that enough was enough and we needed to get away.
This past Wednesday, I borrowed a friend's boat and drove up to the top of a mountain where, at the end of the overgrown Jeep trail, was a big lake. We loaded up with a cooler filled with sandwiches and cheap beer (my wife was the designated driver that day) along with a bunch of fishing tackle, but no phones because there is absolutely zero cell service where I was. Also, lots of beer, a small boat, and a phone is not a good combo unless you're a scuba diver.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
I didn't catch any fish worth mentioning, but it was the best day I've had in recent memory. Being away from the internet was a big part of that. It was like having OnePlus' Zen Mode on the entire time.
The internet is great, don't get me wrong. You can learn anything, read anything, or watch anything. It's also great for working, especially right now while a lot of folks are still working and schooling from home over their iPads or Chromebooks. But that's the good half of the internet.
The internet has two sides and the bad can overwhelm the good.
There is another half of the internet where people argue about politicians, or argue about headphones, or argue about phones. And that's not the worst of it, as I'm sure everyone reading knows. This half of the internet is not a good place, nor a fun place, nor a place to learn anything except bad behavior. I hate it. Even worse, I hate that I sometimes participate in it.
Since that side of the internet is never going to change (maybe it shouldn't, if people enjoy it) a day away from it was, well, amazing. Having a day off in the middle of the week was awesome, but not having to see random crapola on social media while looking at the Android news or sorting out spam in my email was even more awesome. As a bonus, no service means no robocalls from Team Trump, which are hitting my area hard right now. Don't rush to the comments — Team Biden robocalls would be just as bad.
I know I make my living on the back of tech, most of which is connected to the internet. Without a connected lifestyle, I'd be doing something else that I probably wouldn't love doing. But I'm saying everyone needs a break from it all.
I love having the internet at my fingertips, but I loved being without it for a day, too.
I choose to live that connected life as well as work in it, so I do appreciate how the internet has grown and the great things that exist because of it. I love using an Android phone to read my news, talk to my family, or watch fail videos on YouTube. I am really glad to have something as great as the internet at my fingertips.
But man, getting away from it and living like some sort of non-connected caveman — even for just one day — was a good way to kick out all of the cobwebs and enjoy the simple things in life like family, cheap beer, and fishing. I plan to do it more often, and I'd suggest everyone give it a try at least once.

There are some great products available that are easy to set up and keep running, including Nest Wifi and an Eero system. Setting up your own mesh Wi-Fi network is simple, thanks to consumer gear that does the hard work for you.
However, "regular" Wi-Fi routers and access points are getting better, too. Many people will get plenty of coverage by upgrading to one of the best wireless routers rather than moving to a mesh. Faster speeds and more extended range are more than buzzwords when it comes to buying the latest Wi-Fi router, and you'll often find advanced tools that a simple mesh system can't offer.
That leads to the obvious question — should anyone switch to a mesh-based Wi-Fi network in their house? Like most things, the answer isn't a simple yes or no. There are a couple of things you should consider before you dust off your credit card.
More: Google Wifi vs. Orbi vs. Eero vs. Amplifi: Which mesh system should you buy?
Router vs. Mesh Networking Do you need to upgrade your Wi-Fi network?
This is the first thing you should ask yourself. Ideally, a Wi-Fi network is something you should set up once and then never have to think about it until it's time to replace it. When properly planned, a Wi-Fi router or mesh client device should run unattended for several years — at least until it's time to upgrade to a newer wireless standard for increased speeds and bandwidth.
Ideally, a Wi-Fi network is something you should set up once and then never have to think about it until it's time to replace it.
Of course, that's often not the case, and many of us know our router needs that weekly reboot or things start misbehaving. Even worse, maybe we aren't particularly savvy when it comes to network issues and gear and have to call your internet service provider for help. Waiting for a technician to arrive sometime between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. is never fun.
Wi-Fi 6 is the newest wireless networking technology to work its way onto the front of router boxes, and for many people, it's a great option. Also called 802.11ax, Wi-Fi 6 is the followup to 802.11ac, and it brings with it some speed and coverage improvements. While pretty much anyone can upgrade now and get great speeds with backward compatibility, many people still don't have Wi-Fi 6 devices yet, so they won't get the most out of a Wi-Fi 6 setup.
Still, if you want your router to last for several years without an upgrade, jumping up to one of the best Wi-Fi 6 routers now is a good move.
Router vs. Mesh Networking Are you just trying to fix a dead spot?
This is a pretty common issue. You have great Wi-Fi in the kitchen or living room, but when you go downstairs, or to the bedroom, the connection quality drops. If everything is working well in parts of your home that are close to the router or that aren't blocked by things not Wi-Fi friendly — the walls of your bathroom are notorious Wi-Fi signal blockers because of the special drywall used and all the copper pipes inside them — you could be the perfect candidate for a wireless repeater instead of setting up a whole new network.
A Wi-Fi Extender is a cheap way to fix a single dead spot in your Wi-Fi coverage, but there are drawbacks.
Also known as Wi-Fi extenders, wireless repeaters do precisely what their name implies — they take your existing Wi-Fi signal and repeat the signal to extend its range. Usually very easy to set up using a network cable or an online settings page, Wi-Fi Extenders are also compact and only need a power connection. One thing to be aware of is that you usually can't connect a consumer-grade Wi-Fi extender to an existing extender, so daisy-chaining them to reach your garage or the neighbor's house isn't very practical.
You also will have a new network name (known as an SSID) to use when connecting to the extender instead of the router itself. This can be a bit of a pain if you move in and out of a room that needs an extender very often. Quality Wi-Fi Extenders run between $30 and $150 depending on the network type, so if you need multiple fast 802.11ac extenders, it might be more practical to set up a mesh network.
Another quirk of using a network extender is that they often cut the available bandwidth in half. This means your Wi-Fi network can only run at 50% speed whenever you're connected through the extender (not your internet speeds, which are usually much slower than your actual Wi-Fi network). While you might never notice it, it still will have an effect whenever you're trying to send or receive a lot of information, like watching an HD movie or transferring large files from one device to another.
These drawbacks aside, a simple Wi-Fi Extender is an easy way to fix a single dead spot and a great idea if the rest of your Wi-Fi network is working well. If you're in the market for one, we can recommend one of Netgear's extenders that plugs directly into a wall socket for home use.
A hybrid
Some routers can even be configured into a mesh with software. This is the case with the AiMesh software built into newer ASUS routers. With this software, you'll be able to throw another ASUS router or on the network and use it as a mesh point. The setup is a bit more complicated, but you'll get to keep the benefits of a full router while enabling mesh-like improvement.
This capability is being rolled into other routers as well, such as a couple of Linksys models like the MR7350 which manages to maintain compatibility with all of Linksys' Velop mesh products.
Router vs. Mesh Networking When to choose a mesh network
If you've decided you need to get rid of the gear you have and set up a new network or are setting things up in a new place, the choice between a mesh network and a traditional linear router-based network comes down to one thing — money.
A standard Wi-Fi router will still work for many homes and, in general, will be cheaper than a mesh system with comparable speeds. One of the biggest contributors to a mesh system's higher price is simply that they have multiple routers. Mesh systems also tend to be delivered more as a service with automatic software updates, monitoring, and even add-on security services like Linksys Aware or Netgear Armor.
If you need anything more robust than a simple router solution, mesh networking makes a lot of sense.
Mesh systems have been growing in popularity, and manufacturers have been quick to add more options. Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems with incredible speeds are now widely available. Whether you want to start with a mesh router under $100 like an eero or go all-in on crazy Wi-Fi 6 speeds with a router like the top-spec Orbi, there are a ton of mesh options available.
The only case I would hesitate to use a wireless mesh network in favor of a linear router-based setup would be if you have equipment that requires a physical wired network connection. Even then, the addition of a simple switch could be added to a mesh network. If you have those sorts of networking needs, you're probably not looking for basic networking advice, and you understand exactly what we're talking about here.
What about gaming on a mesh?
If you're a serious gamer, you should stay as far away from Wi-fi as possible generally. Modern routers are faster and more reliable than ever but they still won't beat the latency and consistency possible with a simple Ethernet cable. A long, high-quality Ethernet cable isn't even that expensive with several options available on Amazon for under $20. Certainly less expensive than a new router.
When it comes to a gaming connection, you should try to minimize the number of hops your connection has to make. That means that if you can hook straight into your router or the mesh router that's hooked directly to your modem, you should. No matter how great the wireless cards are in your gaming PC or console, a physical wire is going to be better. Something as simple as a microwave oven turning on between your console and router can cause a lag spike when you're connected to Wi-Fi.
Router vs. Mesh Networking For the rest of us, mesh Wi-Fi is exactly what we're looking for
Two of the biggest drawbacks to wireless mesh networking are no longer an issue when using a consumer mesh setup like Nest Wifi — needing an advanced networking education to set things up and maintain them, and a pocket full of money.
Consumer mesh products tackle the biggest problems with home networking — administration and cost.
A wireless mesh network is designed to handle high volumes of traffic in a big area with no downtime due to equipment failures. You'll find the right set of products to work in your home for about $250, and most brands use a simple Android or iOS app to set things up. New stations are easy to add using the same app, and all traffic shaping and route handling are automatic, so you'll have no need for QoS scheduling when you want to play Call of Duty without lag glitching or when you want to work while the kids are watching Netflix.
Mesh routers are small, don't look like leftover robot parts, and everything you need to connect to your modem is in the package. And anytime you need to expand your network, adding a station only makes the rest of the network better by offering another node to handle traffic from all points.
The easy administration and relatively low cost make adding a mesh network to your home (or place of business, where it can be even more important) something any of us can do. Whether you're upgrading your existing equipment or building a network in your new house, there are very few reasons not to make the switch.

- The new camera will be announced next week on Wednesday, October 28, 2020.
- Insta360 is running a giveaway campaign that ends on the announcement date.
360-degree cameras aren't anything new, but Insta360's latest pocket-sized camera aims to make people reimagine what they think a 360 camera can do. That, according to the teaser the company put out for the new camera which is to be announced on Wednesday, October 28th.
In the teaser video, which you'll find below, the camera is clearly being handled in a way that most people would probably never imagine handling the average electronic device. Swinging it around, flying through car windows, and being tossed about are a few examples of what Insta360 sees happening with this new, versatile 360 camera. Based on what we know so far, it's possible that this product will fit somewhere in-between the high-end Insta360 ONE R and the Insta360 GO, but we'll have to wait until next week to find out for sure.

- Dark mode has been a feature that Chrome OS users have been demanding for quite some time.
- Chrome OS dark theme is available now through the Flags menu on the Canary channel.
- The feature is still in early development, so it's unclear when it'll come to the Stable channel.
While Windows and macOS users have been enjoying their flavors of dark mode for quite some time now, Chrome OS users have sadly been missing out on the fun. However, thanks to a recent sighting by Android Police on the Chrome OS Canary channel, it looks like Chrome OS users can now join in on the dark mode hype train.
We reported back in September that Google has been internally working on proper dark and light themes for Chrome OS. The system-wide feature is still in its early development stages and is not officially ready to come to the Stable channel yet, but if you have a Chromebook and are itching to start using the upcoming feature today, you can do just that by going into the Flags menu on Chrome.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Simply open Chrome on your Chomebook, and then copy and paste chrome://flags/#enable-force-dark and chrome://flags/#enable-webui-dark-mode into the URL bar, where you can turn on both flags in the drop-down menu.
Although the feature isn't fully ready and definitely has some bugs to squash, it already works on the Chrome browser and a bunch of different system web apps. The dark theme already seems to be a pretty comprehensive feature so far as it not only applies to the app backgrounds, but seems to apply to other UI elements as well.
Dark mode has been in high demand for any OS over the past few years for its benefits on eye strain and general readability. Even if you're not a fan of dark mode, you have to admit it's always refreshing getting to try a new look on your current device.
If you're a Chrome OS user, let us know down in the comments if you'll be using dark mode from now on, or if you're just going to wait for the Stable release. For those of you in the market for a new Chromebook, make sure you know what the best Chromebooks are right now.

- Ragnarok Games sued the now-closed Human Head Studios in December 2019 for breach of contract.
- Human Head Studios shut down and the staff were all hired by ZeniMax as a new team, Roundhouse Studios.
- Ragnarok Games has amended its lawsuit to include ZeniMax and Bethesda.
Back in December 2019, the now-defunct Human Head Studios was sued by Ragnarok Game LLC. The charges included but were not limited to breach of contract and fraudulent concealment, seeking restitution of "no less than $100 million." The lawsuit also noted the loss of the source code for Rune II, though this source code was returned on a hard drive shortly after.
Human Head Studios closed down in November 2019 while the staff were all hired at a new studio built by ZeniMax and Bethesda called Roundhouse Studios. Now, Ragnarok Game LLC is amending its lawsuit to include ZeniMax and Bethesda.
As spotted by PC Gamer, the updated complaint now includes Bethesda and ZeniMax, while it states that "In an act of utter bad faith and contractual breach of confidentiality requirements, Human Head secretly provided Bethesda and Zenimax with "keys" that permitted it to play a confidential, pre-release version of Rune II. This enabled Bethesda and Zenimax to see for themselves the threat that Rune II posed to their hit franchise, Skyrim/Elder Scrolls. Plaintiffs were never informed of this betrayal."
We'll continue to cover future updates on this case. It's unclear exactly how things will proceed now that Microsoft is acquiring ZeniMax Media and Bethesda Softworks is joining Xbox.

Listen to three months of Amazon Music Unlimited absolutely free
Amazon Music Unlimited is a streaming service that's accessible on tons of devices and features millions of songs that you can play on-demand or download to your device. It's entirely ad-free, too.Yesterday, Oculus released Oculus Link Beta for Oculus Quest. It allows you to use your headset with it's gorgeous AMOLED display as an Oculus Rift, essentially. As with any beta software, there a number of issues that you should be aware of going forward. In order to get started, you need to download the Oculus software for PC, and use another USB cable to connect the Oculus Quest headset to your gaming PC. After going through setup, you should be ready to go.
I was using a Razer Blade laptop with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card. While Oculus said that this card isn't supported at the moment, we didn't have any problems running games like Arizona Sunshine and Crow: The Legend through Oculus Link Beta. You can read about the problems we encountered during our testing below.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Controller and headset problems
When you connect the Oculus Quest to PC, you'll keep on getting errors that say that your Oculus Quest has a problem or one or both of the controllers have a "problem." It's unclear what this "problem" is, but you just have to ignore it because everything works fine. Instead of using your "eye and the volume button" to select menus, you have to point the controllers and press the trigger. Turning off notifications for this software is a good solution if you find them to be a nuisance.
Random disconnections
Many times, the Oculus Quest will randomly disconnect from the PC and revert back to its built-in menu. In order to fix this, you just have to unplug the headset from your PC and plug it back in after a few seconds. In the headset, you'll get a prompt that asks if you want to connect the headset to the PC. Just accept and you'll be taken to the PC Oculus menu where you can launch any Oculus virtual reality (VR) games you have installed on your PC. While this isn't a great solution, it's the only one that works reliably.
Incorrect height
When you're playing select VR games, you'll notice that you're way taller than you really are. For example, when we tested out Arizona Sunshine, the device pegged us at 15 feet and our field-of-view was sticking out of the roof. In order to fix this, you'll have to disconnect your headset and then reconnect it to your PC and relaunch the game. We tried using in-game calibration options, but they didn't work.
Are you using Oculus Link Beta with Oculus Quest? Let us know. Hopefully, this troubleshooting guide will help you fix the most frustrating problems at the moment. If you encounter a bug, let us know and we'll try to find a solution as soon as possible.

Does the Google Pixel 5 support 4K60 video capture?
Pixel phones have always been fantastic at capturing still frames with fantastic quality, and so it's worth wondering does the Google Pixel 5 supports 4K60 for video. After omitting it from the Pixel 4 series, Google is launching the feature on the Pixel 5.
Video in the crystal clear resolution of 4K, 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels, is a favorite of watchers and those filming. While it can be argued that a resolution this high on a small screen such as a phone may not make much sense, but when recording in such a high pixel density allows for much more flexibility in the editing process.
Even if you don't have any intention of doing and video editing of your dog chasing a stick or your kid shoving their first birthday cake into their mouth, the high pixel count makes for excellent watching on televisions. Adding in the extra frames per second from the 30 that Pixel 4 had to 60 is a style that many folks enjoy.

What else is Google adding to video capture?
Aside from finally giving us 4K60, Google is also adding some other great features to the video camera with modes like Locked, Active, and Cinematic. Cinematic Mode lets you can take extremely steady pan video shots using your phone. These types of shots are like what we get from some of our favorite movies on the silver screen.
Of course, the Pixel 5 still has fantastic Night Sight, astrophotography mode, and improved HDR+. Keep in mind that if you are taking those gorgeous photos of stars you'll want a stand for those long exposures. Google Pixel camera seems to be taking another step to maintain the crown one of the best cameras on a smartphone.

★ Featured favorite: The Curious Tale of the Stolen Pets
The Curious Tale of the Stolen Pets is a charming game for all ages, heights, and skill levels. Follow the narration of your grandfather through half a dozen imaginary worlds to find the stolen pets and discover a wonderful tale of lost childhood memories in the process. Hand tracking is a perfect fit for this laid-back title, and the accuracy and consistency of hand tracking in this game is second to none.
Cast your own Hadouken: Waltz of the Wizard: Extended Edition
Waltz of the Wizard pits you as a wizard with nearly unlimited magic power. Practice your moves in your den before heading out into the world to vanquish evildoers and monsters alike. Aside from some incredible hand tracking capabilities, Waltz of the Wizard features an impressive new movement system that's sure to keep your mind off typical "fake" VR movement and more on the action at hand.
Tentacle fingers: Elixir
As a fledgling apprentice, you get free rein of the sorceress' lab and all the amazing magic hidden within. But be warned, you may just alter yourself in unintended ways with no option of turning back. Do you think you can master the spells and tasks assigned to you, or are you doomed to live the rest of your life with tentacle fingers?
Only available on Sidequest
What can your hands do for you?: Hand Physics Lab
Developer Dennys Kuhnert of Holoception fame has been working on this incredible collection of hand tracking experiments since Oculus opened up the development floodgates a few months ago, and the results are nothing short of revolutionary. Simply put, there's nothing on the Sidequest market that competes with the accuracy, interactivity, or imagination of Hand Physics Lab. The only thing we can hope for is that all of these concepts make their way into a full game because it could certainly compete with the likes of Boneworks without ever requiring a controller. So long as you're in a bright room, of course.
Pew pew forever: Tea for God
If you're looking for a great example of what hand tracking can add to an already unique experience, the oddly named Tea for God is a great choice. Tea for God is a never-ending procedurally-generated experience. That means the game creates its world as you play, and it's different every single time. On top of being one of the best room-scale experiences available, Tea for God utilizes the hand tracking feature in a wholly natural way. You can make guns by simply holding up your thumb and index finger, punch enemies when they get too close, and even use your fingers to touch buttons and control environmental objects.
Failing driver's ed…again: Car Parking Simulator
Did you hate driver's education when you were a teenager? Maybe you didn't learn the skills you needed to make it in the real world? This virtual experience puts you back behind the wheel of several different types of cars in an attempt to help you learn the ropes all over again. You'll be using your hands to grip the wheel and change gears, adding to the feeling of realism in 45 surreal challenge courses. Just as most "simulator" games have shown, this is more than just recreating a real-life experience; it's about creating an experience unique to a virtual world.
Learn how to play your piano: VRtuos
Were you once interested in learning how to play the piano, only to find that the keyboard you picked up from a garage sale was too challenging? VRtuos works by lining up your real-world piano, whether it's a bargain-bin keyboard or a glorious grand piano, with a virtual one that teaches you the ropes. Colored notes rain down into each key you need to press, helping you not only press the right notes but to hold them as long as you're supposed to. Five bundled songs get things started, and you can even import any MIDI file to help you learn that song you've always wanted to play.
When you simply don't have a piano at home: Virtual Piano
Virtual Piano is a similar concept to VRtuos but with one big exception: you don't actually need a piano to play this virtual one — just a table. Virtual Piano starts by aligning the real table in front of you as if it were a piano and then overlays the appropriate keys where they would actually be if there were a piano in front of you. While it's not quite as geared toward teaching piano as VRtuos is just yet, it's still under development and gives you a great way to practice. The physical table helps deliver convincing tactile feedback that would otherwise be lost in the virtual world without a real piano.
Pulling worlds apart: Interdimensional Matter
Interdimensional Matter is a puzzle game that appears to be simple on the surface; take the object apart, insert the "cores" into the correctly shaped slots, and put the object back together. Even a preschooler could do it, right? In this dimension, sure, but between dimensions, there's no telling what's going to happen to the matter as it bends and moves in ways you won't expect. It doesn't feel the same without your hands, and that's what makes this such an excellent experience!
Tetris in the fourth dimension: Cubism
Tetrominoes get a three-dimensional enhancement in Cubism, a puzzler that has you placing funky-shaped pieces inside a larger puzzle. The trick here is that, like playing Jenga, you'll be utilizing your primary digits to grab these pieces and put them in the right place. It's a great way to relax while keeping your brain active, and using your fingers to grab virtual puzzle pieces feels amazing.
Craft and mine all the time: Voxel Works Quest
While the Oculus Rift has an official version of Minecraft, the Oculus Quest is without its own port of the venerable voxel survival game. Voxel Works Quest attempts to recreate the magic of Minecraft with the bonus of letting you use your actual hands to interact with the blocky world. It's still got a long way to go before it has all the features of Microsoft's incredibly deep title, but it's darn fun to play, given the new level of interaction present.
Giving beast mode a new name: VRWorkout
VRWorkout is designed to be a way to get exercise rather than playing a game that happens to accelerate your heart rate. It's better designed for hand-only interaction than games like Beat Saber or Pistol Whip, which rely on ultra-precise controller aiming and movement. It's actively being developed and has seen several updates since its debut in late December, and the developer has been very responsive with feature requests and additions.
Make happy trees: Mr. Scribbles
Mr. Scribbles is a unique drawing game that aims to create a completely natural way of interacting with virtual elements. Utilizing a set of gestures and hand movements, virtual artists can create lines and shapes out of thin air. These shapes can then be manipulated in several ways, including resizing, changing the color or material, and just about anything your mind can concoct. You can even create little planets, set them to spin, and toss objects into their orbits. It's still early in the prototype stage, but the potential here is massive, and the development is very active.
A god-game on a smaller scale: Sun Shard: Hand Tracking Demo - Might of the Gods
Gamers familiar with the Black & White series will know that god games can be incredibly rewarding to play. While Sun Shard doesn't encompass all the qualities of a full-fledged god game, it does put you in the shoes of a rather large deity who's goal is to defend a totem against an invading hoard. Grab, smack, pummel, and shoot magic at your enemies as they head wave-after-wave into your sanctuary and try to dismantle the totem that gives you power.
Rock, Paper, Scissors: RPS Championship
It's rock, paper, scissors in VR. There's little in the way of extras here, and, at the present moment, you can only play against a computer-controlled opponent. It looks like the developer will be adding several new features and a possible multiplayer mode but, until then, it's a fun distraction for a few minutes.
An aptly-named experience: Hand tracking demos
While the title is a bit ambiguous, it perfectly describes the experience you'll find inside. The developer took the Oculus trains demo and added hand tracking to it, including some neat modifications that'll make you feel like you're 6 years old and playing with trains again. The developer has taken to Reddit and unveiled plans to continually update this app with additional demos, including concepts like Rocket Punches, Rubber Stretchy Arms, Finger Guns, and Hand grenades.
Hand tracking 101
Hand tracking is finally becoming a major feature on the Oculus Quest, thanks to nearly a year of testing and development. Early partner developers have now released their first big updates to include hand tracking in existing games like The Curious Tale of the Stolen Pets and Waltz of the Wizard, but there's certainly a lot more on the horizon. For now, Sidequest remains the bastion of experimentation, particularly when it comes to hand tracking, and sports dozens of developers working on intriguing titles.
Hand Physics Lab is probably the single most impressive hand tracking demonstration on Sidequest, while other experiences like Tea for God, Interdimensional Matter, and Cubism are a bit more along the lines of an actual game. These titles will give you a few good hours of fun between them, and they won't cost you anything more than your time. Setting up SideQuest is a breeze, and once you have it down, you can enjoy all sorts of titles and mods for your existing games that wouldn't otherwise see the light of day on the Oculus Store.
Oculus was quick to roll out automatic hand tracking to the Quest after just a month of testing, and we expect significant improvements to hand tracking just as we saw significant improvements to controller tracking just a few months after the release of the Oculus Quest. That being said, expect a few bugs but go into the experience expecting to have fun. After all, having fun is one of the biggest purposes of gaming, and the immersion of VR only makes that fun more palpable.

$699.99 $350 off
Samsung's Powerbot R7070 utilizes CycloneForce separation technology to offer 40 times stronger suction than conventional vacuums, meaning you won't ever have to worry about whether it's doing its job properly or not. It's able to create a map of your home and then makes an optimal cleaning path to help avoid obstacles and clean your house efficiently.

The best part about a vacuum like this is the ability to control it using an app on your phone. You don't even need to be home and you'll be able to schedule or manually start a cleaning whenever you'd like.

Though we're still a little way out from the traditional Black Friday weekend, and we just wrapped up Amazon Prime Day, this year's unusual annual shopping calendar has prompted a whole host of great fall deals to kick off sooner than usual so there's a ton of stuff to shop already.
Black Friday is usually the last chance to score a great deal on tech, kitchen appliances, toys, and more, ahead of the holidays, though some unexpected circumstances this year are likely to affect exactly how the event plays out at various retailers.
Let's dive into everything we know about Black Friday 2020 including some official sale announcements!
When is Black Friday 2020?
With how crazy everything has been in 2020 you may be wondering when Black Friday is taking place this year, especially after Amazon already delayed Prime Day by several months. Black Friday itself is always the Friday after Thanksgiving, making it November 27 this year. Traditionally, retailers would kick off their big sales early on the Friday morning with the discounts, and the hype, running all the way through the weekend.
However, the Black Friday sales are going to look a little different this year with huge amounts of in-store traffic not exactly desirable. A bunch of the biggest retailers in the U.S. are also giving their staff Thanksgiving day off for the first time in recent years suggesting a more low-key take on Black Friday this year, at least in stores.
Due to the current health crisis, we expect to see way more attention shown to online-only deals and since we're breaking out of the usual 'doorbuster' mindset, we're probably going to see many retailers kicking off their Black Friday sales much earlier, too.
Now Prime Day is out of the way, we've now got some official Black Friday plans from retailers which we'll go through below.
Black Friday sales at Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, and more
There's a running theme when it comes to Black Friday plans at all of the major retailers: the deals are starting early!
Amazon's Black Friday sale has already begun in the form of the 'Holiday Dash' promotion. Each day in the run-up to Black Friday itself Amazon will be offering "Black Friday-worthy" deals that last just one day. It also just kicked off a limited-time sale on Amazon devices to celebrate Alexa's birthday. We've already seen deals on tech, fashion, smart home, and much more with some Prime Day prices returning.
This year's Black Friday sale at Best Buy also kicked off early with some standout deals kicking off during Prime Day with the rest of the deals now being revealed in its Black Friday ad. Many deals are available there right now in pre-Black Friday sales with a detailed timeline of events leading up to the big day.
Walmart has also provided a thorough outline of its plans so far with its 'Deal for Days' promotion. Instead of one big Black Friday weekend sale, it is opting to spread out the deals throughout November with three separate events. The first kicks off on November 4 and online shoppers will get first dibs on many, if not all, deals. Walmart has also unveiled its Black Friday ad.
Not to be left behind, Target's Black Friday sale has also been detailed and it too will be launching some early Black Friday sales starting on November 1. Each week, it will be releasing a mini Black Friday ad with limited-time deals to snap up before the big event.
We expect other retailers will probably do something similar to Walmart and space out the deals (and the hype) throughout the next several weeks while prioritizing at-home shoppers.
Other Black Friday sales announced already include those from Dell, Home Depot, and Sam's Club.
Best early Black Friday deals available now
We've seen a few full Black Friday ads now so we know some of the specifics with regards to what products will be discounted during Black Friday. That being said, there are tons of early deals already available so you can actually get started on your holiday shopping now at most of the big retailers.
There are already some nice early Black Friday deals taking place, and we've taken some time to round up all of the best deals you can take advantage of today.

What deals do we expect during Black Friday 2020?
Now that a few ads from the biggest retailers are out in the open, we know the kinds of products we will see on sale and can start to make some educated guesses as to which products will be the most popular over the coming weeks.
At Amazon and most other retailers, there's a strong emphasis on Amazon device deals with Fire TV sticks, the Echo line, Kindles, Ring gear, and more being discounted back down to Prime Day prices in most cases. We'll also see a huge focus on Black Friday 4K TV deals, home appliances, toys, and more ahead of the holidays. Black Friday tends to bring many of these devices to historic low prices and the best Black Friday deals are generally focused directly around these items.
Beyond the usual suspects, we're seeing popular electronics like the TCL Roku TVs, Sonos speakers, Beats products, and more on sale, along with kitchen gadgets from Instant Pot, Keurig, and more.
What are the Black Friday hours in stores?
For most retailers, the emphasis has shifted online this year. In years gone by, retailers closed their stores late on Thanksgiving for a quick turnaround ahead of the opening to huge queues on Black Friday in the early hours of the morning. With a reduced focus on in-store shopping, stores are actually giving their staff members the day off for Thanksgiving and re-opening early on Black Friday.
We know that both Best Buy and Walmart will be opening their doors on November 27 at 5am local time so we expect that will be the standard across other retailers too.
Of course, you can shop online at any time. Since pretty much all of the best Black Friday deals will be available online this year, it's probably going to be safer and more enjoyable to shop from the comfort of your own home this time around.
Are Black Friday deals available online?
Given the current global health crisis, it's very likely that all of the best Black Friday deals will be available online. There are always online-only deals plus many of the same in-store deals being available at the retailer's website, save for a few 'doorbuster' deals.
Retailers are preparing for a very different Black Friday sale this year and those enticing in-store deals are off the cards for 2020. Expect many more online exclusives and incentives to keep shoppers happy at home.
Why should I care about Black Friday?
Whether you are a keen deal hunter or not, you probably prefer not to pay full price for the things you buy. Black Friday is the one time a year where all of the major retailers run sales simultaneously, try to outdo each other, and offer you some of the best deals around making it the very best time to buy anything you've been holding out on.
Now that Black Friday is going to be moved online, for the most part, it also means that you can score some excellent deals from the comfort of your own home. No more fighting through crowds to snag the last item on the shelf. Whether you're looking to save on a big purchase for yourself, hunting down holiday gifts for your family, or just perusing the promotions to see if something catches the eye, Black Friday is your last chance to save big in 2020.
How do I stay on top of Black Friday deals?
Black Friday 2020 is going to be big with a huge online focus which means it's going to be hard to keep up and ensure you maximize your savings during these big events. The team over at Thrifter is full of professional deal hunters who will literally be providing around the clock coverage of everything on Black Friday. From the best savings, as they hit to roundups of what you should be buying, the team will aim to make it as easy as possible to find the best deals that are available from the first to the last minute.

Do you have your stay-at-home essentials? Here are some you may have missed.Best Smart LED Light Bulbs that Work with Google Home Android Central 2020
Not only are LED smart bulbs more energy-efficient than traditional incandescent bulbs, but you'll feel like Tony Stark walking through your home, controlling the lighting with just your voice. Google Home is one of the tentpole home assistant platforms, so of course, there are a plethora of smart bulb brands eager to get that "works with the Google Assistant" badge. The question you need to ask yourself as a consumer is how many bulbs you need for your home and how much are you willing to spend?
Full-feature smart lights
To experience the best that smart LED lights can offer, you'll want to start with ones that are entirely customizable with the full spectrum of colors available. Because these bulbs are way more expensive than any light bulb you've probably bought in your life — and often require a dedicated smart hub to relay between the bulbs and your home network — you're going to want to choose a brand that can satisfy all your smart lighting needs or piece together your house plan with bulbs that don't need a hub.

Dimmable white smart bulbs
Let's be real, not every smart bulb in your home needs to cycle through 16 million different colors; they just need to be dimmable and react to your voice commands. You can save some money buying white LED smart bulbs for the more mundane areas of your house like hallways and bathrooms and save the fancier color bulbs for the areas you entertain your guests. There are dimmable white smart bulbs available for each smart hub ecosystem along with many options that only require a Wi-Fi connection.
Ease into the Hue ecosystem: Philips Hue White Smart Bulb 4-Pack
As long as you already own a Philips Hue Bridge, you can start adding smart bulbs to any room in your house. With this four-pack of dimmable white bulbs, you're able to schedule and automate your lighting to fit your daily needs or make it appear that your home is lived-in while you're out by scheduling lights in different rooms to turn on and off throughout the evening.
Mini bulbs for lamps and light fixtures: LIFX Mini A19 Smart LED Bulb
LIFX bulbs don't require a hub, just a reliable connection to the Wi-Fi network. This bulb is comparable to a 60W bulb and is perfect for smaller lamps or lighting fixtures. The white variation offers the best value for your money, but there are mini color bulbs or day & dusk bulbs that will change the color and warmth of the lighting based on the time of day. These are sold individually and are perfect for lamps on bedside tables.
Buy'em in bulk: Sengled Element Classic Smart LED bulbs (8-pack)
If you've already got a Sengled hub — or even a SmartThings or Wink hub — you can add eight bulbs to your network for the best price per bulb that you will find. That's a heck of a deal and a great option if you desire to replace every bulb in your home with a voice-controlled smart bulb without spending hundreds of dollars.
For that retro Edison look: SEALIGHT Smart Bulb Glass Vintage LED Bulb (2-pack)
Check out this two-pack of SEALIGHT bulbs for the retro look of an incandescent bulb with all the convenience of a connected smart bulb. The per-bulb price is pretty good, and no hub is required. These are standard A19 bulbs that are controllable through your phone or with Google Assistant are easy to dim and can be set on scheduled timers.
Best Wi-Fi bulbs on a budget: TP-Link Kasa LED Bulbs (3-pack)
For those of you who are okay with standard white, dimmable smart bulbs, and don't want to spend a fortune, TP-Link's Kasa bulbs are a good pick that offers the added benefit of no hub — just a reliable connection to your home's Wi-Fi network is required. The starter kit, which includes three bulbs is a good starting point and connects easily with the Google Home app.
Anker's smart home brand: Eufy Lumos Smart Bulb
Last but not least, Eufy also offers a selection of smart bulbs that include soft white bulbs, tunable white bulbs that are capable of mimicking daylight, and a multi-color bulb that can groove along with your music. All bulbs include built-in Wi-Fi to get around needing a hub and can be easily added to your connected devices in the Google Home app.
Don't be afraid to mix and match
The best part about having so many smart lighting options available that all work with the Google Assistant is that you can have a hub set up and some individual Wi-Fi bulbs all running on your home network and still control everything using just your voice.
Our top recommendation is the Philips Hue Starter kit which gets you all you need to start building out your dream smart home. Once you get all set up, you'll want to start looking into other Hue products that are just as easy to set up and control. If you're going to splurge, you can create the perfect lighting ambiance for every room in your home using Hue smart lights.
Of course, the beautiful thing about using the Google Assistant is that it works with countless other brands, so you can save on LED light strips by getting a 16ft Minger Govee LED smart strip for half the price of the Philips Hue equivalent. And then there are just dope accent pieces like the Nanoleaf Rhythm Smarter Kit that would look cool in any media room or gamer's den.

The best smart lights that work with the Google Assistant
Smart lights are essential for any smart home — especially ones that work with the Google Assistant. Need some help deciding what to buy? We're here to help!At one point, I was going to start this review with a sentence like, "Samsung's never really screwed up the Galaxy Note; every version has been better than the last." I got about halfway through writing that sentence and then it all came flooding back — the summer of 2016, when reports of Note 7s catching fire started trickling in. Then came the recall, then the reissue, then the second recall, then the bans. How could I have forgotten, even briefly, something that fundamentally changed Samsung, and the wider smartphone industry, so dramatically?
I forgot it for a moment because Samsung's done such a profoundly good job helping us forget it. In the wake of the Note 7 debacle, the company returned the following April with the Galaxy S8, which turned out to be its best-selling flagship ever (and retains that title today), followed by the Note 8 a few months later. A year later, the Note 9 was the first premium Android phone to justify its thousand-dollar price tag, and last year Samsung gave us two Note 10 models to gawk over as it worked hard to convince us they stood apart from their Galaxy S counterparts.
So now we have the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, which borrows more than a bit of its pedigree from the huge and ultimately flawed Galaxy S20 Ultra. That phone, as you may have read, had some major issues with its cameras, from autofocus woes to exaggerated claims of telephoto prowess. Thankfully, the Note 20 Ultra makes up for those shortcomings and then some.
But is it right for you? Let's dig into it.
At a glance
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
Bottom line: If you're a loyal Galaxy Note buyer, the Note 20 Ultra is the best possible version ever made. Featuring a much-improved S Pen experience, a huge camera upgrade over previous Note versions, and every possible spec you could ask for, this $1300 monolith is worth the price of admission. You just have to know you need it.
The Good
- The best phone display out there
- Impeccable performance
- Great camera performance
- S Pen upgrades
- All-day battery life
The Bad
- Inexcusably slow and inconsistent fingerprint sensor
- Curved display causes false touches
- Very expensive
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Price & release date
The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is now available starting at $1,300 in the U.S., with an optional $1,400 model available offering 256GB of storage. Lucky for you, the Note 20 Ultra will likely be on sale for Amazon Prime Day 2020 on October 13-14 as well as on Black Friday 2020 later in November. We're not sure how low the price will go, but you can expect at least a few hundred dollars off.
It's also available much cheaper if you trade in your current smartphone — Samsung gives up to $650 in trade-in credits if you have a recent Galaxy flagship like the Note 10+ or S20 Ultra — or if you buy it through a carrier. In the U.S., like all Samsung products, the Note 20 Ultra is available at AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, along with smaller regional carriers and MVNOs. And because it's a 5G phone, you'll need a 5G plan to take advantage of the phone's extra cellular speeds.
You can get the Note 20 Ultra in three colors: Mystic Bronze, Mystic White, and Mystic Black. We're reviewing the new Mystic Bronze version and think it's the best color for the new phone.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Hardware & design
If it looks like a Note and smells like a Note, it must be a Note. That's basically what you get with the Note 20 Ultra since it hews closely to Samsung's boxy-body-curved-display design language employed since the Note 8 three years ago. This year, though, the Note 20 distills the design language to a science, executing tolerances that few manufacturers can achieve at scale.
From the front, it's really hard to tell the Note 20 Ultra apart from last year's Note 10+.
From the front, it's pretty hard to distinguish the Note 20 Ultra from the Note 10+, down to the only-slightly-larger 6.9-inch screen size. Turn it around, though, and the Ultra's enormous camera module is the first thing you see — especially because it prevents the phone from lying flat on a table.
As with all Samsung AMOLED displays, the one on the Note 20 Ultra is stunning — nearly perfect in many regards — with seamless color roll-off, inky blacks, incredible daytime brightness that's some 20% higher than last year's model (though during regular usage it's difficult to tell the difference), HDR10+ support, and more. The upside is that, once again, Samsung's made the best mobile screen out there, though it's not notably better than those from the Galaxy S20 series.
Samsung's made some slight alterations to the way 120Hz works versus the S20 series, too; instead of asking you to manually choose between keeping the refresh rate at either 120Hz or 60Hz, when set to the higher rate the system decides when to dynamically step down to 60Hz again. By taking the onus away from the user in deciding whether they want to prioritize smoothness over battery life, Samsung's landing on the best of both worlds, and I only noticed a few instances where the step-down was awkward and noticeable.
You still can't do 120Hz at the Note 20 Ultra's full resolution, which feels patronizing. Let me kill my battery if I want to!
OnePlus does the same thing with its OnePlus 8 series, but outdoes Samsung in one important area: it allows 120Hz at the phone's highest 1440p screen resolution. Samsung still limits Dynamic Motion Smoothing, as it calls the feature, to 1080p. I actually think this is a good move, since 120Hz at FHD resolution is a far better experience than 60Hz at QHD, but the option to override (and kill the battery much more quickly in the process) would be nice.
There are two areas where I wish Samsung would have taken critics' criticisms of the previous Note series to heart. The first is that Samsung did not improve the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor inside the Note 20 series. It's the same slow, unpredictable module from Qualcomm that debuted in early 2019 with the S10. The touch area is too small, and there's minimal visual or haptic feedback to indicate you've identified the correct location. The best Samsung can do is offer a small fingerprint overlay when the always-on-display is enabled, which it isn't by default.
I've complained about this fingerprint sensor through four Samsung phone generations now, and the response usually falls into two camps: people who think I'm completely overreacting and have no issues with usage at all, and those who, like me, despise the sensor and would prefer literally any other biometric option than this one. My frustration is exacerbated by the fact that, back in December, I saw Qualcomm's second-generation ultrasonic fingerprint sensor in action, and its promise was incredible: bigger, faster, and less error-prone. Maybe next year.
This hardware is massive and beautiful, but Samsung still uses last year's annoying and slow ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which is tragic.
My other area of complaint centers around the Note's curved glass. With any curved surface, palm and errant touch rejection need to be perfect. But it's not. On dozens of occasions during my time with the Note 20 Ultra I had to either repeat touches that weren't registered or correct errant taps in the wrong places. I know it's a hard problem to solve, but it's one of Samsung's own making; the company didn't put curved glass on the mainline Note 20 because it's cheaper. Samsung even lessened the severity of the curve radius on the S20 series earlier this year. But the Note 20 Ultra reinforces the fashion-over-function the series has been struggling with since the Note 5 back in 2015. I'm confident subsequent software updates will lessen the problem, but right now it is a problem.
Of course, the Note has always strived to appeal to both fashion and function, and the Note 20 Ultra, at least in this Mystic Bronze colorway, is stunning. Like, nicest-hardware-ever gorgeous. There were more than a few moments during my time with the phone when I just sat with it and admired the amount of work, and the years of exhaustive iteration, that led to this finished product. Yes, I think it's a bit too big for my personal tastes, but as a physical object, this phone is beautiful.
Samsung's decision to go matte with its finish this year should also be applauded, too. Glass phones are fragile, yes, but they're also disastrous fingerprint magnets. This phone is both hardier than previous Galaxy phones, outfitted with Corning's new Gorilla Glass Victus on the front and back, but it's the particular light-absorbing coating on top of it that I appreciate most. Contrasted with the reflective color-matched aluminum frame, I'm all-in on this particular design decision, and I hope Samsung keeps it around past this generation.

It should come as no surprise that the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra runs perfectly. The Snapdragon 865+ inside it isn't much changed from the 865 in the Galaxy S20 series, but the 10% bump in the Prime core clock speed, along with a GPU 10% faster, should be enough to satisfy you if top performance is a priority.
I really tried to tax the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, from trying my hand at S Pen-assisted video editing to playing round after round of COD:Mobile, and the phone obviously passed muster. Of course it did; it costs $1300. If you can find anything on the Android platform that is legitimately onerous to the Snapdragon 865+, I'll buy you a beer. (Seriously, tell me what you do to tax your phones aside from synthetic benchmarks.)
The Note 20 Ultra also comes with 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM standard, which should be more than enough for even the most spasmodic of multitaskers; 128GB of UFS 3.0 storage is the baseline, with an optional bump to 512GB for $100 more. And a microSD slot lengthens the still-plastic SIM tray (Samsung, up your game here); strangely, the regular Note 20 doesn't offer expandable storage.
There should be nothing surprising about the rest of the Note 20 Ultra's spec sheet: it has impressively full and loud stereo speakers, which I used often to play nursery rhymes for my two-year-old daughter; an IP68 rating, which protected the phone from the time my daughter grabbed it and dropped it into a bathtub full of water (it survived); and a 4,500mAh battery, which did a pretty good job lasting through most days.
I can confidently say the Note 20 Ultra will be an all-day phone for the vast majority of people who buy it, even with 120Hz enabled. I found my unit was usually nearly dead by around 9pm or 10pm most nights, after having removed it from the wireless charger next to my bed at 7am that morning. With an average of six hours of screen-on-time, I'm happy with the Note's uptime, but if battery life is more important than anything else, I'd stick with something in the Galaxy S20 line.
My colleague, Hayato Huseman, who produced our companion review video, told me he got over seven hours of screen-on-time per day, so your mileage may vary.
The 5G dilemma
It would be easy to ignore the elephant in the room, the single-biggest thing weighing on Samsung's 2020 smartphone pricing: 5G and the Snapdragon 865.
While 5G is certainly promising, right now it's hard to justify the added hardware cost that's built into it. Qualcomm charges the phone makers a lot of money for its top-of-the-line chip, and while some, like LG and OnePlus, have chosen to cut various corners to keep their flagships under $1000, Samsung leans into the reality.
At the moment, the U.S. is in a transitional phase, with T-Mobile in the best position to show its strength. And in markets where it inherited Sprint's 2500Mhz-based 5G network, it's a great value proposition, but the vast majority of the cities where the company operates have slower-than-LTE 600Mhz 5G.
AT&T suffers from the same problem: where its 5G network is available, it's only sending slower, more weather-hardy signals over the 850Mhz spectrum, which makes it similar to LTE in most regards.
Verizon's 5G, while considerably faster, is harder still to come by, and the company even admitted that it's not worth spending extra money on right now when it chopped the additional fee it used to charge to access its mmWave 5G network.
The problem is that, at the moment, if you want to spend good money on a phone in the U.S., you're essentially paying a 5G tax. That tax is less pronounced on devices running Qualcomm's less powerful Snapdragon 765, like the LG Velvet and Motorola Edge, but it's still there. If you don't care about being on the latest wireless network right now, and I don't blame you if that's the case, you have to make the choice to wait for the networks to improve or the phones to get cheaper. Either way, it's hard to recommend spending $1300 on a phone when you know so much of that investment is going to waste right now.
The S Pen — Joe's take
Year after year, the distinction between the Galaxy S and Note series becomes increasingly difficult to identify. The Note used to stand out as Samsung's power-user smartphone, but we now live in a world where the Galaxy S handset that comes out before the Note is every bit as fast and capable. As such, the biggest differentiator between these two devices comes down to a small piece of plastic — the S Pen. The S Pen has been one of the Note's greatest strengths since the very beginning, and with the Note 20 Ultra, it picks up a few key features and improvements in an attempt to make it stand out as a legitimate benefit over the already-great S20 lineup.
Perhaps the most notable upgrade the S Pen sees this year is its reduced latency. The Note 20 Ultra boasts an impressive latency response of just 9ms, which is considerably less than the 42ms latency previously offered on the Note 10. That's a flashy number to tout on paper, but the real-world benefits are more difficult to discern.
I don't have an artistic bone in my body, which means my use of the S Pen is reserved for navigating the user interface and taking handwritten notes. The Note 10's S Pen never felt slow or unresponsive to me, and using it side-by-side with the Note 20 Ultra, I personally can't notice much of a difference. The only time where I could visibly see the Ultra's reduced latency came into play when drawing long lines very quickly on the screen. Where the Note 10's S Pen gets every-so-slightly ahead of the line that was being drawn, the S Pen on the Note 20 sticks with its virtual ink as if you were writing on real paper. It's great to see that Samsung is constantly working to improve the S Pen experience, even if this is likely something that only skilled artists will see any true benefit from.
The other big upgrade for the S Pen this year is a new batch of Air Actions. Air Actions were introduced on the Note 9 as a way to remotely interact with the camera app, and with the Note 20, they're expanded as a new way to navigate the phone and quickly open apps. There are five actions/gestures you can perform with the S Pen, and each one can be customized as a navigation button, S Pen feature, or app shortcut.
The S Pen's new Air Actions are pretty unreliable, which means most people will abandon them before they're memorized.
The idea is to expand the functionality of the S Pen and make it more of a remote for the Note rather than just a stylus. In my testing, however, I found these Air Actions to be incredibly unreliable. Air Actions require an insane amount of precision to be performed accurately, and because of this, the majority of my time spent using them saw me making the wrong action or messing up the gesture altogether. The idea of having five app shortcuts that you can call on at any time is excellent, but after my 10th failed attempt at using Air Actions, I mostly gave up on the feature.
Samsung's also packed a bunch of smaller tweaks into the Samsung Notes app, and while there's nothing here that's revolutionary, they all help Samsung Notes feel even more fleshed out than it already was. Notes can now be organized in desktop-like folders for vastly better organization, there's a new PDF import tool for quickly annotating files, and an Auto Straighten feature that automatically straightens-out your handwriting with the tap of a button.
One of the flashers additions is Audio Bookmark, which works when you're jotting down notes while recording audio from a business call, lecture, etc. Once the recording is complete, you can tap on any notes you took during it and jump to that section of the recording. It's a very specific feature that a lot of folks may completely ignore, but it's honestly quite handy and could prove to be a lifesaver during especially long Zoom calls.
Here's the thing. Even though the reduced latency isn't super noticeable and the new Air Actions are disappointing, the S Pen was already the best stylus available for a smartphone. Even if Samsung only made it marginally better, it already had an incredible foundation to begin with. There's nothing here that'll completely change your mind about the S Pen if you already weren't a fan of it, but if it's a tool you've relied on for years, the Note 20 Ultra offers the best experience you can get for it.
And the good news is that the improvements to Samsung Notes will likely come to older versions of the Galaxy Note in an upcoming software update.
The S Pen — Daniel's take
Because of how much space the camera housing takes up on the right side of the phone, Samsung moved the S Pen's housing to the left side of the phone's underside, next to the bottom-firing speaker and the USB-C port. A lot of people have complained about how this interrupts muscle memory, or that it's not ideal for right-handed users. These are all true, and it's also true that even if you're coming from another Galaxy Note you'll likely get used to it within a couple of days. I did.
The more meaningful thing to know about the S Pen is that, while physically identical to the one on the Note 10 series (they're interchangeable if you have last year's phone), the Note 20 Ultra accepts input at five times lower latency than the Note 10 — 9 milliseconds versus 45ms — and less than half that of the Note 20, at 26ms. The 120Hz display also conveys that lower latency much more realistically.
In real-world usage, this means that there's considerably less lag between the time your S Pen touches the screen and when you see something happen, like a pen or brush stroke, or when navigating Samsung's One UI software.
With previous Notes, I'd always made a concerted effort to use the S Pen, but got frustrated by the input lag, which got worse the more text was added to the page. Even on first-party apps like S Note, I always got the impression the phone couldn't quite keep up with me, and I heard the same sentiment expressed by students and enterprise workers alike. This year, there are no such issues; Samsung not only made the software stack more robust, as you'll see below, but the hardware can now easily keep up with whatever you want to do, be it jot quick notes, sketch a thought, or spend time making fine art in one of the supported apps.
I surveyed my Twitter followers to see what they usually do with the S Pen and answers ranged from jotting down quick reminders or to-do items on the lock screen (one of my favorite features) to annotating complex scripts inside Microsoft OneNote. It made me understand that, for many people, having the S Pen is a nice-to-have addition to an already wonderful phone. But there are people who have been buying the Note series over the Galaxy S since 2011 and consider it an essential tool they couldn't live without.
Now that the S Pen is finally good enough, at least for me, to replace a traditional pad and paper setup for jotting down quick notes and organizing my thoughts, I look forward to revisiting this section in a few months with an update.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Software
Love it or hate it, using a Samsung phone means using and interacting with its One UI user interface. The Note 20 Ultra ships with the latest One UI 2.5 update, which is based on Android 10. It's made up of minor improvements that work together to feel like a significant upgrade to the user experience. If you're not a fan of Samsung's software, this isn't likely to change your mind, but at least it feels like the company is listening to feedback.
Samsung has created and stuck with a very cohesive design language for the core user interface and all of its first-party apps. This makes the Note 20 Ultra feel super polished, along with giving it a distinct look that's started to catch the attention of competing companies. It's bold, instantly-recognizable, and feels faster than ever thanks to the 120Hz display.
There are far too many extra features here and there to talk about everything that you get with One UI, but there are a few things that are especially noteworthy — one of which being Samsung's continued partnership with Microsoft for the Link to Windows feature. Samsung Notes can now auto-sync with your Microsoft OneNote account, and later this year, you'll be able to run multiple apps from your Note 20 side-by-side on your Windows computer.
Samsung DeX also gets a marked improvement this year, with the Note 20 adding the ability to use the DeX interface on your smart TV wirelessly. As long as you have a TV/streaming device that supports Miracast, you can send the DeX desktop UI to your television and use your Note 20 as a trackpad for navigation. It's another one of those features that you can very easily ignore, but it further adds value to the already massive list of things you can do with a Samsung phone. We didn't have a Miracast-enabled TV to test out wireless DeX, but when we get our hands on one we'll update this review.
Oh, and you can finally use third-party launchers with Android 10's fully gestural navigation. It's been a long time coming, and I was looking forward to switching over full-time to a third-party launcher like Lawnchair. Unfortunately, the implementation is extremely buggy; many times I found myself stuck inside my active app with the navigation gestures refusing to work until I turned off the screen and unlocked it again. So back to Samsung's launcher I went.
But that choice is ultimately the biggest strength of One UI. I don't have a need for a lot of the features Samsung bakes into it, but for the most part, you can pretty easily ignore them if they aren't of interest to you. There are still a few duplicate apps, which feels wasted on a $1300 smartphone, but the overall software package is pretty damn great. There's also the fact that Samsung is now promising the same three years of software updates that you get on a Pixel, which means you get the best of both worlds — endless features and guaranteed updates.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Cameras
Right off the bat, yes the Note 20 Ultra fixes the autofocus problems of the S20 Ultra. If that was a concern of yours, take heed and rest easy. Samsung accomplished this not by swapping out the 108MP sensor itself — that's still identical to the S20 Ultra — but by replacing phase-detect autofocus with a laser-assisted focus module.
While Samsung still considers the $1400 Galaxy S20 Ultra to be the best camera it makes, largely thanks to the beefed-up 48MP telephoto camera that can do 100X "Space Zoom," give me the Note 20 Ultra's camera loadout any day of the week, largely due to that more reliable autofocus.
This may not be Samsung's best camera, but it's definitely the most reliable.
The Note 20 Ultra's primary camera is huge, both physically and influentially. It's a 1/1.33" sensor, only slightly smaller than the beefy boi inside the Huawei P40 Pro, considered by many (and us) to be the best sensor in a phone today. That large sensor there's plenty of room for packing tiny pixels, and Samsung is using nona-binning, pixel binning by a factor of nine, to reach a social media-friendly 12MP with the final shot. Along the way, the photo not only does a great job retaining the incredible spatial detail that 108 megapixels provides, but it technically performs better in lower light situations, too, than other high-resolution sensors that don't bin down as much.
And now that Samsung's resolved the issues around autofocus, I'm happy to say that this is one of the most versatile cameras on an Android phone today. Photos come out typically Samsung-saturated, and the shallow depth of field afforded by the larger sensor adds natural background blur, dramatically accentuating foreground subjects like a DSLR.
This blessing can also be a curse, though, as the usable in-focus area is much narrower than with most other phone cameras; photos that look like they're in focus on the phone may be slightly out of focus when viewed on a larger display. But that shallow focus also yields some incredibly striking shots, including a few that are going to be added to my Google Photos Favorites. I'd have liked a closer minimum focus distance, or a dedicated macro lens, but you can't get everything you want.
Protip: An easy way of ensuring your subject is in focus is by switching to Pro mode in the camera app and selecting manual focus. Adjusting the focus ring creates a green "peaking" overlay on what's in focus.
I wrote this in my Galaxy S20+ review and the same is true here: Samsung still applies way too much skin smoothing to its photos captured in Auto mode. Personal preference perhaps, but Samsung needs to get out of its own way here and let people add these filters in post-production.
I find the effect less severe than on previous models, but it's still reliably distracting, something I wish Samsung would address. But then I switch to the ultrawide (which is great, but I'm not going to talk about it because it's the same one as found in the Galaxy S20 series) or the telephoto, and I remember why I love this phone's camera setup.
As I mentioned at the top of this section, Samsung considers the cheaper Note 20 Ultra a step down from the S20 Ultra's telephoto because it uses a smaller 12MP sensor paired with a 5x optical "periscope" f/3.0 lens. Samsung employs this sensor very conservatively; in anything but the brightest conditions, it hops back to a cropped version of the primary sensor.
But I've managed to take some really great photos from this telephoto, far better than the temperamental one on the S20 Ultra (though admittedly I gave up on that phone before a series of software updates improved telephoto performance). The ultrawide is also tons of fun to use, because, not in spite of, its tremendous optical distortion.
Night mode performs about the same as the S20 Ultra, which means that despite the larger sensor, the tiny individual pixels can't pull enough light from a very dark scene to eke out much resolvable detail. In this comparison between the Note 20 Ultra, the S20+ and the Pixel 4a, the cheaper Galaxy easily comes out ahead.
The Note 20 Ultra's 10MP selfie camera isn't as good as the one on the S20 Ultra, but that's OK, it's still pretty good. While I also found it to soften facial detail, it still makes me look pretty good, and that's good enough for me.
Finally, Samsung still does video better than any other Android manufacturer; this one does 8K at 24fps or 4K at 60fps, but you'll only get Super Steady mode at 1080p30, and only with the ultra-wide sensor.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Competition
To say that the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is one of the best smartphones of 2020 is no exaggeration, but as powerful and impressive as it may be, we've seen tons of other top-notch handsets that have come out before it — one of which being Samsung's own Galaxy S20. The Galaxy S20 offers a very similar user experience compared to what you get on the Note 20 Ultra, including a 120Hz AMOLED display, top-of-the-line Snapdragon processor, and an excellent camera system. The form factor is also a lot easier to manage and use with one hand, not to mention it has a retail price that's $300 cheaper. If you can live without the S Pen and are OK with a smaller phone, the Galaxy S20 is a phenomenal purchase.
If you absolutely need the S Pen but can live without the 120Hz refresh rate screen, last year's Galaxy Note 10+ is still sublime, and Samsung has committed to an extra year of software updates, so you don't have to feel rushed to buy a new phone anytime soon. At over $1000, it's still nowhere near a cheap phone, but the Note 10+ does come with double the base storage as the Note 20 Ultra, which is a weird brag.
Small phones aren't for everyone, however, so another great alternative is the OnePlus 8 Pro. It touts a 6.78-inch 120Hz screen, Snapdragon 865 chipset, excellent cameras, wireless charging, and 5G connectivity. It's also powered by OxygenOS, which is widely regarded as one of the best Android interfaces on the market. You don't get the S Pen or all of the software goodies found with One UI, but you're getting a phone that's every bit as capable as the Note for less money.
Finally, if you're getting ready to spend $1,300 on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, it may be worth spending a little bit more for the Galaxy Z Flip 5G. This is one of the best folding phones that's currently available, and while it touts plenty of impressive specs, the Z Flip also has a cool factor that you just don't get with any other "normal" smartphone. The Z Flip 5G looks like a typical Android phone at first glance, but when you're done using it, you can fold it up like a flip-phone for incredible portability. You make some technical compromises compared to the Note 20 Ultra, but if you're able to spend this kind of money on your next phone, you may want to consider getting something a tad more exciting.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Should you buy it?
Who it's for
- Current Galaxy Note owners
- Someone looking for an all-in-one smartphone
Who it's not for
- Fans of oversized phones
- Value shoppers
The Note 20 Ultra is big. It's expensive. It's niche. It does everything, yet Samsung's having an increasingly difficult time differentiating it from the Galaxy S series.
At this point in the smartphone game, buying a Note is either in your vocabulary or it's another language completely. Especially at this starting price, and with these compromises.
I've used the Galaxy S20+ more than any other phone this year; for me, it strikes the right balance for my needs. The Note 20 Ultra is a better phone, but it just may also be too much phone for me. I think by now we've all identified where we land on the spectrum of smartphone needs, and I'll just keep chipping away at S Pen mastery until it's part of my daily routine and I can finally say, without reservation, that I'm a Note person, too.
I have absolutely no reservations recommending such an extraordinary phone, but if you don't need 5G right now, you may want to wait a few months for the networks to improve — and for the Note 20 Ultra's first inevitable discount.
At a glance
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
If you're a loyal Galaxy Note buyer, the Note 20 Ultra is probably the best possible version you could have hoped for. Featuring a much-improved S Pen experience, a huge camera upgrade over previous Note versions, and every possible spec you could ask for, this $1300 monolith is worth the price of admission. You just have to know you need it.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Getting started with your new phone
It's safe to say that the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is a beastly phone, and whether you're brand new to the Note series or are coming form a model that's a few years old, chances are you'll need some help navigating through all of the phone's best features, and deciding which accessories to buy.
Cases and accessories
If you're in the market for a case, we've rounded up the best Galaxy Note 20 Ultra cases, and are updating our list weekly as more options become available. We also have a roundup of the best screen protectors for your Note 20 Ultra if the one that comes with your phone isn't enough.
As for accessories, we've rounded up the best wireless chargers for your new Note 20 as well as the best microSD cards so you can expand your storage.
Finally, if you're still not sure which Note 20 Ultra variant to buy, we have a guide to help you choose the best Galaxy Note 20 Ultra color options.
Features you should know
The Note 20 Ultra has an absolutely gorgeous AMOLED display, and while the stark white background of the user interface looks great during the day, it can be rather blinding at night. This is where dark mode comes into play, which replaces all of those white backgrounds with sleek black ones. It's easy on the eyes, looks fantastic, and can even help you conserve some battery life if you're in a pinch.
We also recommend setting up Samsung Pay on the phone. Samsung Pay is one of the most capable mobile payment solutions on the market, as it works with both NFC and MST technologies. In simpler terms, this basically means that you can use the Note 20 Ultra with Samsung Pay at virtually any store you go to. There are still plenty of retailers/shops in the U.S. that haven't adopted payment terminals with tap-and-pay technology, but Samsung Pay is still able to work at these places just fine.
Other features you'll want to explore are Samsung Health and Samsung DeX. The former is basically Samsung's alternative to the Fitbit app, giving you a platform for tracking your steps, exercise, and more. With DeX, you can plug your Note 20 Ultra into a computer monitor (or connect it wirelessly to a supported television), see a desktop-like interface, and use your phone as a mobile workstation that's designed to help you get as much work done as possible.
What about the Note 20?
While this review focuses on the larger and more expensive (and better, if we're being honest) Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, the Note 20 is also available now starting at $999.
There are a lot of differences between the two phones, but the main ones revolve around screen refresh rate, material use, and cameras.
While the Note 20 Ultra has a beautiful QHD+ 120Hz refresh rate AMOLED display, the Note 20 is limited to 1080p and 60Hz. Its glass is also flat as opposed to curved, which some may argue is a benefit — our reviewer, Hayato Huseman, agrees, giving the Note 20 a 4.5/5-star review.
The Note 20's back is plastic, though the frame is aluminum like its more expensive counterpart. Its camera setup is also very different — nearly identical to the Galaxy S20+ with a 12MP primary sensor, a 64MP 3x telephoto lens, and a 12MP ultrawide along with a 10MP front-facer.
And while it has a Snapdragon 865+, just like the Note 20 Ultra, the regular Note 20 is limited to 8GB of RAM. There's also 128GB of storage with no option of expansion.
While on paper the Note 20 doesn't seem all that impressive — especially for the $1000 price — we've now reviewed the Note 20 and came to the conclusion that it's a really good product and definitely worth your consideration.

As with any gacha game, the best Genshin Impact characters require a fair bit of luck and/or money to add to your team. Characters each have different rarity levels and belong to different tiers. Typically, the higher up the tier they are, the more powerful they are. So, which characters should you be hoping for and investing your resources in leveling up? We're here to help.
How many playable characters are there?
There are two dozen different playable characters in Genshin Impact. A handful are rewards for completing certain portions of the story, including the protagonist, but most are pulled in gacha style wishes. There are a few different types of wishes as well as a multitude of ways to earn the currencies to make those wishes. While buying the currency with real money is an option, even if you have a ton of money to sink into this game, you will still need some luck to pull the best characters. Let's just say you have unlimited access to all of the characters in the game. Knowing which are worth investing your time and resources into leveling up is also important.

Characters are ranked in this guide based on overall utility. While even the low ranked characters have certain areas where they excel, the higher a rank, the more places you'll be able to really get the most out of these characters. If you are playing FtP, the S and A rank characters are the ones you should hold out for in your rerolls.
S Rank Characters in Genshin Impact
The best of the best, if you are lucky enough to roll one of these characters, hold onto them and invest your resources and time into them. These characters all perform remarkably well in nearly every area of the game.
|Name & Rarity||Element||Weapon||About this character|
|5⭐ Venti||Ameno (Wind)||Bow||Easily one of the best characters in the game so far, with an Elemental burst capable of absorbing Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, and Electro power, and inflicting that damage on enemies, Venti is extremely versatile.|
|5⭐ Diluc||Pyro (Fire)||Claymore||Diluc is capable of breaking enemy shields and deflecting all but the largest of enemies' attacks.|
|5⭐ Qiqi||Cryo (Frost)||Sword||QiQi is extremely easy to use individually and with other characters. Her Cryo abilities freeze enemies in place and she's the best healer in the game.|
|4⭐ Fischl||Electro (Lightning)||Bow||With a Raven summon and the ability to deal ranged damage over a large area, Fischi can be a little tricky to handle but more than makes up for that with the amount of damage he inflicts.|
A Rank Characters in Genshin Impact
While S rank characters are the ideal, A Rank characters will absolutely get the job done. These characters are versatile and will get you through most of the game with relative ease.
|Name & Rarity||Element||Weapon||About this character|
|5⭐ Mona||Hydro (Water)||Catalyst||Mona's high speed and ease in setting up Elemental Reactions make her an excellent addition to any party. She is also capable of dashing across the water, but be careful when using this - if she runs out of stamina in the water, she will still drown.|
|4⭐ Barbara||Hydro (Water)||Catalyst||While not quite the healer that QiQi is, if you don't have QiQi, Barbara is a decent healer. She can also cover large areas with water, allowing easy set up for Elemental Reactions.|
|5⭐ Jean||Anemo (Wind)||Sword||Jean makes for a powerful main weapon and can gather enemies closer. Her Dandelion Breeze can both attack enemies and heal your party simultaneously. She also has an added 12% of doubling your cooking results.|
|5⭐ Keqing||Electro (Lighting)||Sword||Capable of dealing a lot of damage with Elemental Reactions, Keqing is easy to use and very solid for dungeon crawling. Despite being a sword user, she can do both melee and ranged attacks.|
|4⭐ Xiangling||Pyro (Fire)||Polearm||Xiangling is capable of summoning a fire breathing bear and her melee attacks are easy to pull off. She also gives a 12% chance of doubling cooking results when there is a red icon in the corner.|
B Rank Characters in Genshin Impact
Although B rank characters aren't worth getting excited over, they give solid performance across a number of areas in the game. Your first character, one of the Traveler twins falls in this rank. You can get through the game with a team of these characters, but you'll have to work harder and switch out more often.
|Name & Rarity||Element||Weapon||About this character|
|5⭐ Traveler (Anemo)||Anemo (Wind)||Sword||The main character of Genshin Impact, the twin you selected at the beginning of the game is capable of changing Elements throughout play. While not the best choice if you've done well in your gacha pulls, the Ameno Traveler is great for beginners. Their melee attacks are easy to pull off and they're capable of inflicting Wind damage over a large area and with their normal attacks. Pays to be an outlander!|
|5⭐ Traveler (Geo)||Geo (Earth)||Sword||When changed to Earth, the Traveler retains its ease for melee use and gains the ability to raise a pillar from the ground. Using this ability in conjuntion with your ranged fighters, the Traveler can put an archer up out of range of enemy attacks. They're also good for climbing puzzles.|
|4⭐ Razor||Electro (Lightning)||Claymore||While Razor is solid for close range, melee attacks, he doesn't work well for players who switch often and he has very limited Elemental Reaction potential. However, he is great to have in your party because of his passive ability that cuts stamina lost while sprinting by 20%.|
|4⭐ Chongyun||Cryo (Frost)||Claymore||As a Claymore user, Chongyun is slow, but hits hard. He's great for setting up Elemental Reactions, and can use rain or nearby water to freeze enemies. Because of his Elemental Skill, he can be used to quickly cross water without burning stamina by freezing the surface with his attacks.|
|4⭐ Xingqiu||Hydro (Water)||Sword||A great character for beginners, Xingqui is easy to use for close range attacks, but he has a very small range, requiring a lot of dashing to dodge attacks. His passive skill gives a chance of regaining materials while crafting, so he's definitely worth keeping around if only for that.|
|4⭐ Bennett||Pyro (Fire)||Sword||Although Bennet has a unique passive skill that reduces Expedition time by 25%, his strengths revolve around his fire alignment. Diluc and Xiangling perform better in these areas, but if you don't have either, Bennet is the next best Pyro character.|
C Rank Characters in Genshin Impact
C Rank characters are, generally speaking, worth re-rolling. There are definitely areas where they shine, but they're a lot more limited and there are much better characters in each of those areas. However, if you're 100% FtP, characters like Lisa and Noelle are easy to get and will bolster your team.
|Name & Rarity||Element||Weapon||About this character|
|4⭐ Kaeya||Cryo (Frost)||Sword||Kaeya is easy to use in close combat and though his Elemental Skill doesn't do a ton of damage, it recharges fast, allowing you to continually freeze enemies. He also has a passive talent that reduces the stamina used sprinting by 20%.|
|4⭐ Noelle||Geo (Earth)||Claymore||Noelle is guaranteed in the first draw of the Beginners' Wish pack. Her Elemental Skill puts up a shield to protect your party while also granting a chance at healing. She also provides a 12% chance of doubling the results while cooking defense boosting food.|
|4⭐ Ningguang||Geo (Earth)||Catalyst||Primarily defensive, Ningguang protects your party from ranged attacks. She can also inflict earth damage, setting up for the Crystalize Elemental Reaction. When farming for Ore, you'll want Ningguang in your party because her passive skill reveals ore deposits on the map.|
|4⭐ Lisa||Electro (Lightning)||Catalyst||Lisa can deal significantly more damage than some of the other welfare characters because of her wide area attacks. If you didn't get lucky in your gacha pulls, you'll want to invest in building her up. Her Catalyst weapon also allows her to deal Elemental damage with normal attacks, and she has a chance of regaining materials from crafting and potions.|
|4⭐ Beidou||Electro (Lightning)||Catalyst||Beidou is slow, like most claymore wielders, but her charged attacks can cancel out enemy attacks. Her biggest strength is the ability to reduce damage while charging her Elemental Skill. She also reduces the stamina burned when swimming by 20%.|
|4⭐ Sucrose||Anemo (Wind)||Catalyst||As a Catalyst wielder, Sucrose can deal elemental damage with her normal attacks and most of her attacks hit across a wide range, letting her excel in Time Trials. She also has a chance of regaining materials when crafting.|
D Rank Characters in Genshin Impact
There is currently only one D rank character and she's a freebie. She is the first playable character you meet after selecting your twin, and is largely how Genshin Impact teaches you to play multiple characters.
|Name & Rarity||Element||Weapon||About this character|
|4⭐ Amber||Pyro (Fire)||Bow||The very first party member you meet, Amber is definitely at the bottom of the pile. However, in the early game, she complements the Traveler quite well. She can target enemies from far and hit their weak spots, dealing extra damage and even stunning some enemies. She is also a welfare character and does fire elemental damage, so you can't complain too much, especially if you're FtP.|
Coming Soon Characters in Genshin Impact
Like any gacha game, Genshin Impact will continually release new characters to keep things fresh. While some characters were revealed during the closed beta tests who have yet to be released, others have been teased on Twitter or in the official manga. The following are all the characters we expect to see soon, as well as what we know about them:
|Name||Rarity||Element||Weapon||About this character|
|Xiao||Five Star||Ameno (Wind)||Polearm||Capable of flying, Xiao is great for exploration.|
|Klee||Five Star||Pyro (Fire)||Catalyst||Although Klee is not available yet, in the closed beta, she had a bomb attack that did damage over a large area and was capable of spreading Fire for Elemental Reactions.|
|Zhongli||Five Star||Geo (Earth)||Polearm||Unknown|
|Cyno||Unknown||Unknown||Polearm||Unknown|
|Childe||Five Star||Pyro (Fire), Polearm||Unknown||Unknown|
|Baizhu||Unknown||Dendro (Nature)||Unknown||Unknown|

- Blaston is a cross-platform $10 multiplayer dueling game for the Oculus Quest family and PC VR headsets.
- Blaston features 1v1 pistol duels with multiple weapons, all happening in slow-motion for maximum bullet-time effect.
- The Oculus Quest 2 version will feature enhanced graphics when compared to the Oculus Quest version in a later update.

This 1 vs 1 dueling game pits one player against the other in slow-motion gun battles, set up like an old fashioned pistol duel. The trick here is that Blaston's movements are all done in slow motion, with bullet-time on all the time, helping players to dodge bullets while they better strategize the winning shot. In a very good way, it's a bit reminiscent of Ironlights — just with guns instead of melee weapons.
Blaston launches on the Oculus Quest family of headsets today for $9.99, with a PC VR release via Steam and the Oculus Store soon. Folks picking up an Oculus Quest 2 will be happy to know that Resolution Games has created several graphical enhancements for the Quest 2's added horsepower, which will be available soon in an update. Blaston players on the Oculus Quest will be able to duel Oculus Quest 2 players, which should open up the playing field a bit. Resolution Games is probably best known for Angry Birds VR: Isle of Pigs and Cook-Out: A Sandwich Tale, although Blaston marks the 12th VR game release from the company.

Best Overall: Blue Snowball iCE
Blue is known for making some of the best affordable microphones for multiple use cases. It has some of the most unique looking options too. The Snowball iCE is no exception, with a retro feel to its spherical shape. This cardioid condenser microphone is perfect for recording almost anything to your computer. It is even Skype and Discord-certified due to its excellent voice pickup.
As a cardioid style microphone, the Snowball iCE has a forward-focused pickup pattern. That's why this style of mic is so great for anything voice focused. When making your video calls, there's a smaller chance for background noises likes kids, dogs, or the air conditioner to be heard by the microphone. Pair this with Blue's custom condenser capsule, and you'll get crystal clear audio, whether it's live or recorded.
With the Blue Snowball iCE, you get an adjustable tripod included, but the attachment point is a standard size ready for several accessories. Utilizing USB 2.0 for data and power transfer, you'll be able to plug this into your PC or Mac without any issues. Speaking of plugging into your computer, you'll need to use settings on your system to control things like mute and gain on the microphone because it's missing the on-device controls.

Runner-Up: Fifine K669B
Fifine K669B may have a more traditional look, but it still offers some fantastic features at a great price range. This USB 2.0 condenser microphone works on both PC and Mac without the need for extra software. This makes it simple to get started using it for YouTube, gaming, video chat, or other audio recording needs. Just be sure that your setup allows for the shorter cord that is built into the microphone.
As a condenser mic, it brings exceptional audio pickup to ensure accurate sound reproduction. Even though this is a cardioid polar pattern, the microphone encapsulation style still has a small bit of background pickup. This is due to the design of the microphone casing being open. You do get a tripod and stand that allows you to adjust your microphone to point exactly where you want to avoid background noises better.
There is a built-in volume knob to let you get just the right level when recording or speaking live. The knob also acts as a mute switch to turn off the microphone. When you're ready for your next audio session, just plug and play to get started.
Pros:
- Traditional design may work with more setups
- Built-in volume adjustment knob
- Sensitive condenser for accurate audio
Cons:

Fifine is better than fine
The plug-and-play setup on this modern looking microphone will have you sounding great in no time on PC or Mac.
Best Value: CMTECK CMG006
This highly adjustable and unique looking microphone brings some handy features along with its style. The CMTECK CMG006 has a small footprint on your desk with a base that has some blue LED lights if that's your thing, and a switch to turn them off if they aren't. The base also has a status light to tell you that you're connected, picking up audio, and muted — which can be done with the built-in switch. You just won't be able to control volume through the microphone.
As a condenser style microphone, you get accurate sound reproduction in a small package. Because this is an omnidirectional style mic, it works great for single audio pickup and for recording multiple people. Omnidirectional microphones can sometimes be seen as a negative because there is a higher chance for background noise to be heard, but that's not the case with the CMTECK CCS2.0 Smart Chip.
This built-in feature brings in noise-canceling technology to help eliminate echos and unwanted noise from being heard in your recordings. However, the noise-canceling isn't perfect and has to work extra hard because the microphone is very sensitive. As a plug-and-play device, it's ready for your Mac or PC audio needs right out of the box.
Pros:
- Small footprint and adjustable neck
- Built-in noise-canceling technology
- Great for group recordings
- Built-in mute switch
Cons:
- No volume control
- Mic design means there's no way to use a pop filter
- Almost too sensitive; picks up a lot of sounds

Bring the noise and the lights
You get excellent sound reproduction for the price, and the mic works great for recording multiple people at once.
Best Microphone with an Included Arm: Neewer NW-7000 USB
Anyone who is ready to start recording and doesn't want to worry about picking up accessories later should check out this setup from Neewer. It comes with the NW-7000 cardioid pickup pattern condenser style microphone that is great for all types of audio recording. Set that up with everything else in this package, and you are ready to go.
For those recording sessions when you want to get a bit of space between you and your computer setup, the NW-35 adjustable arm is there. This allows you to extend, swivel, raise, or lower the microphone to wherever you desire in a snap. It's worth noting though that when mounted on the arm the cord is relatively short so you can't get too far from your computer. The included shock mount will keep any random vibrations from affecting your recordings. Toss on the anti-wind foam cap and pop filter and your voice calls, gaming sessions, guitar-shredding nights are all set to sound crystal clear.
This USB-powered microphone is plug-and-play ready for your Mac or PC. It has a relatively limited pickup range and no built-in adjustments for volume or even to mute. However, as a budget-focused microphone in a great accessory kit, it should do excellent for most basic needs.
Pros:
- Included pop filter and windscreen are excellent
- Focused cardioid pattern for direct audio
- The adjustable arm saves desk space.
Cons:

The full package
Start your audio recording with a complete package of accessories, including a cardioid condenser mic, at a great price.
Best Complete Microphone Kit: TONOR TC30
For a desk setup that gets you a great set of accessories in addition to a solid cardioid condenser microphone, the TONORO TC30 is an excellent place to start. The microphone is a USB 2.0 model that's ready to go right out of the box with its USB-A to USB-C cable — hallelujah, no micro-USB. Using its cardioid pickup pattern that faces forward and a bit upward focused, it does a good job avoiding any unwanted noise.
You also get a well-built tripod that connects directly to the included shock mount. This helps to avoid vibrational sound pickup from a shaky desk or other small, unexpected bumps to the microphone. The lower microphone sensitivity could be part of the reason it doesn't pick up a lot of background noise, so you'll want to be intentional with your recording moments. To help aid in sound clarity, there is also a pop filter included that attaches via a solid steel arm to ensure proper placement.
This setup is fantastic for all sorts of vocal audio needs. From games on Twitch to Zoom calls for work, you'll get great audio here. However, without built-in volume, mute, or gain controls, it may not work well for something like recording a full band as that requires a more comprehensive frequency response range.

Cons:

No pop here
Expect clear vocals with this microphone. You get a pop filter and shock mount. The USB-C connection is a bonus.
Best Compact Microphone: Samson Go Mic
Whether you like to record on the go or just want to have less clutter in your desk space, the Samson Go Mic is an excellent choice. This small microphone has a built-in stand that can also clip to the top of your monitor to get entirely out of the way. Be aware that the stand is a bit small and if not perfectly set could fall over when using it, but the clip feature is wonderful. When you are done with your recording, you can fold it up and pack it away in a pocket.
This versatile condenser microphone lets you change between an omnidirectional microphone for group recordings or a cardioid pattern for a more direct audio capture moment. There's also the option to plug it in via USB to your Mac or PC as well as a 3.5mm jack for direct audio.
Of course, due to its compact design, there are going to be some concessions. There's no onboard controls like mute or gain control, and its audio frequency response will have a smaller range. However, as an improved microphone over a computer's built-in option, it's a great choice.
Pros:
- Compact size is great for on the go
- Offers both cardioid and omnidirectional recording
- Can use USB or 3.5mm for audio output
Cons:

For the road warrior
Not only does this mic offer flexibility for where you record but also how with its dual-pickup modes.

ExpressVPN is one of the longest standing virtual private network services out there and is widely regarded as one of the best VPN services. Based in the British Virgin Islands, the company started back in 2009 and prides itself on operating a no logging policy meaning data is kept super secure.
In 2017, one of the company's servers was used to delete information related to a Russian ambassador assasination. Despite the server being seized and searched, no information was found. The company used this as an example to show that its level of privacy was superb. It did recognise that it can be used negatively but also stated it still stands for our right to privacy and freedom online.
At the time of publishing ExpressVPN sports an impressive 3,000 servers that span 94 countries and 160 locations across the planet.
Pricing and plans
ExpressVPN keeps pricing pretty easy to understand with three tiers. It starts out with a month-to-month rate of $12.95 which requires no commitments. If you want to make a saving and are willing to commit to a longer term contract then you can pay for six months at $9.99 per month. This is billed every six months at $59.94.
The best savings comes from purchasing the annual plan, which comes in at $99.95 for the period. It's a one-time fee that gives you full access for the year, and using our special link you can actually drop that price down to just $6.67 per month and get three free months of access.
If you're not sure which to go for and that one month is too much then you can download the iOS or Android client and give it a seven day free trial. Of course if you do want to try that month even that's technically free as you have a 30-day money-back guarantee. You don't need a reason to cancel, there isn't any smallprint and all you need to do is tell ExpressVPN and you'll get your money back.
Testing and performance
One of the best ways to test a VPN is on performance, which means speed. This is easily done using a speed test site – even Google has one right there on its search site now. We used this and other speed test sites to assess just how fast the servers are running.
Our tests initially run across two locations – the U.S. and the UK. We then test other locations, like Asia, Australia and Africa, with benchmarking sites to see how fast they run over longer distances.
For the US we used a 400MB line and ran multiple tests using different locations. To start, we ran a speed test with no VPN enabled. That's the top result shown on the right. The second one is using the "Smart Server" location, and the third one was a server based in Singapore. As you can see, the speeds do drop off the further away the connections are, but they are still reasonable, and are actually some of the best we've experienced in our testing.
In the UK the testing line was a 75Mbps connection. The results were 60 to 65Mbps which was very impressive when you consider how near the top-end of that line's capacity this reached.
From the UK as a base, connecting to the likes of Hong Kong, India or Australia we were getting speeds of a decent 60Mbps. Go to Brazil or Kenya and the results suffered with the top-end hitting nearer to the 20Mbps mark.
Features
The mighty 3,000 servers of ExpressVPN, spanning those 94 countries and 160 locations worldwide mean you can appear to be from virtually anywhere you need. The key with this many server locations is that you should always be relatively close to one so you can enjoy a fast and consistent connection speed.
This VPN masking applies to lots of devices as well as locations. This is thanks to the clients available which span the likes of Mac, Windows, iOS, Linux, Android Chromebooks, Kindle Fire, PlayStation, Apple TV, Fire TV and more. You can also setup the VPN on a router using custom firmware. So, despite ExpressVPN limiting you to five devices used at one time, if one of them is a router that means you can connect as many devices to that as you need.
Getting the apps up and running is super easy. It takes just a few minutes to install ExpressVPN on your Android device. The interface is very simple to understand and makes it something you'll actually want to use regularly instead of something you uninstall quickly.
ExpressVPN uses all its own secure servers meaning you can enjoy that no-logging as well as encryption storage so your data is safe in transit too. The company's relatively new TrustedServer Technology uses RAM to process information meaning none of your data is stored on hard drives at any time, making it even more difficult to get hold of. Also, everytime you connect to a new network, that's not trusted, ExpressVPN will fire up automatically to offer protection. Connect to a secure network again and ExpressVPN will close down so you can get top speeds as your priority.
One of the most stand out ExpressVPN features is the 24/7 live chat support. This means you can get help with literally any issues you have – presuming it's ExpressVPN related, of course. Say you're trying to connect to Netflix while abroad but can't, the experts are there to help you find the best server so you not only get access but can enjoy the fastest speeds for what you're doing too.
Since you can access most locations, that means you can get to most content too. For streaming the likes of Netflix, Hulu or even BBC iPlayer, this is a really decent VPN. We even got the chance to test this while in China. Initially we struggled to get access to US Netflix so we got on the 24/7 live chat. We were told exactly what server to connect to and right away we were up and running at great speed.
Privacy and security
ExpressVPN runs an encryption service across its offerings meaning 4096-bit SHA-512 RAS certificate level cover. This uses AES-256-CBC to encrypt and HMAC protection too. There's also support for Perfect Forward Secrecy meaning you get a new secret key every time you connect.
All that is complicated tech-speak for a super encryption. It's as good as, if not better than most other VPN options out there with a few exceptions that offer double hop encryption for yet another layer of protection.
Another highlight is DNS support in the form of DNS leak protection to stop information leaking from the tunnel while in transit. Lots of VPNs offer this but ExpressVPN goes further by running its own zero-knowledge, 256-bit encrypted DNS on all of its servers too. That essentially means you don't have to worry about attackers getting to you or your data.
You also get a kill switch so, should you lose connection, you'll automatically be protected and hidden then too.
The clear lack of logging is also a great way to leave your mind at ease. The company clearly states on its site: "ExpressVPN does not and will never log traffic data, DNS queries, or anything that could be used to identify you."
The British Virgin Island location helps since, despite its small size, the country regulates its own affairs. That means the UK and US don't have jurisdiction to automatically compel ExpressVPN to release any data.
Should you sign up?
ExpressVPN has a lot to like. Beyond the wide spread servers across the world there are the layers and layers of security and encryption backed by a clear no logging policy which combine to give you peace of mind security, anonymity and safety when online.
The pricing is competitive, support is superb and performance speeds are excellent. The only downside is that you're limited to five devices, but with the ability to install this on routers that can be worked around.
This is a tough VPN to fault. If you want even more security there are other double hop options out there and some with more servers but it's hard to find a service with a track record like ExpressVPN. Keep an eye out on our best VPN deals post to ensure you're getting the best price when signing up.

ExpressVPN is a top pick in our eyes for many reasons. Sign up today and see how it works for yourself!
We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:
1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).
2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad.

Select which brand of smart light you want to set up. In this example, we will choose Philips Hue.
- After selecting Philips Hue, you will be prompted to "Connect your Philips Hue light to Alexa's built-in hub" if you have an Echo Plus device or Echo Studio.
- Tap on Discover Devices to connect to your Alexa hub.
- If you don't have an Amazon device with an Alexa built-in hub, you will be asked, "which hub are you using?" Many smart light manufacturers require a bridge or hub device to enable their lights to talk to your voice assistant. Make sure you have a hub if it's required for your smart bulb! Select your bridge device.
- Next, it will ask you to connect your Philips Hue light to Alexa by downloading the Philips Hue app and following the setup process.
- After you've connected your Philips Hue light to Alexa in both apps, you will be prompted to press Continue and enable the Philips Hue Alexa Skill. Again, this is common for many smart light manufacturers.
Tap Enable to Use in the skill, and you are good to go.
You've now successfully connected your smart light bulb to Alexa! Without taking any further steps, you can now ask Alexa to turn your bulb on/off or change the color.
However, if you want to do more with your smart lighting, like control entire rooms or set up themed mood lighting, continue reading.
How to set up and control a smart light group with Alexa
- From the Devices tab at the bottom right of the Alexa app, tap on the + symbol in the top right corner.
Tap on Add Group.
- Here you can select a pre-defined group name (e.g., per room), or add a Custom Name.
Tap Next, and then choose which devices (which light bulbs) you wish to add to the group, and then tap Save.
You can repeat this process to create as many groups as you like, and then ask Alexa to do things like "Alexa, turn on the lights in the Office" or "Alexa, change the Bedroom lights to blue." Pretty cool, right?
How to set up and control a smart light routine with Alexa
Setting up a routine is one of the most powerful things you can do with your Alexa-enabled smart home devices. Routines allow you to connect numerous tasks to one key phrase or trigger, which can then automate many important processes for you. For example, I have a routine set up for bedtime that turns off all of the lights and music and lowers the thermostat to 76 degrees when I say "goodnight Alexa."
- Open the Alexa app and tap on the More menu (three lines) in the bottom right corner.
- Tap on Routines.
From this screen, you can see any previous routines that you may have set up and choose from any featured routines that Amazon is promoting. To create a new routine, tap the + symbol in the top right corner.
- In the New Routine screen, you will first press the + sign next to Enter routine name and create a name for your routine.
- Next, you can select your trigger by tapping on When this happens and then selecting an action for that trigger.
- Here we'll choose Voice and type in a verbal command for Alexa to trigger our next action but you can also choose based on a schedule, a particular device action, leaving or arriving at a location, an alarm, or with the press of an Echo Button.
Next, tap Add Action, which will allow you to choose various responses to triggers, such as playing music, reading you the latest news, or turning on/off your smart lights in the Smart Home tab.
After you tap on the Smart Home tab, you will see a screen that says All Devices or Control group. If you select All Devices, you can choose which of your device(s) to add to the action. If you select Control group, you can choose which of your groups to add to the action.
How to set up and control your smart lights with Alexa Guard
Alexa Guard is a security service that utilizes the microphone array on any/all Echo devices to listen for signs of intrusion (broken glass) or smoke/carbon monoxide alarms when set to away mode. You can also connect Ring and ADT security systems to Alexa Guard for added convenience and security.
- Open the Alexa app and tap on the More menu (three lines) in the bottom right corner.
- Tap on Settings.
- From the Settings menu, scroll down and tap on Guard.
The Alexa Guard screen will come up. Tap on the gear icon in the top right corner.
- If you've already set up your smart lights per the previous sections, you can tap to enable Away Lighting.
This will allow Alexa to automatically turn connected lights on when Guard is set to away mode so that it appears that you are home - even if you are not.
Our top equipment picks
The Philips Hue series of lighting products have long been some of the most popular smart light devices on the market. We think that picking up a few of their smart bulbs along with a smart hub is a great place to get started.
Smart Bulbs
Philips Hue Single Premium Smart Bulb
Light up your life
Philips Hue bulbs set the standard for smart home lighting and are still considered among the best options out there. Paired with a hub, they will work with Alexa or the other voice assistants.
These bulbs allow you to chose from 16 million colors and combinations to change the look and feel of any room. You can purchase them individually or in multi-packs, and you can easily add more to your home over time.
Bridge the Divide
Philips Hue Smart Hub
Mission Control
The Philips Hue Smart Hub is mission control for all of your Philips Hue products and allows them to interface with Alexa or whatever smart assistant you prefer. Think of it like a translator between the language your bulbs speak and that which your smart assistant speaks!
Many smart device manufacturers use different protocols to communicate with their devices and thus need some sort of centralized hub to communicate with smart assistants. The Philips Hue Smart Hub has multi-device compatibility to make sure your Philips Hue devices work seamlessly with Alexa.
Additional Equipment
Not all smart lighting solutions require new lightbulbs, smart home hubs, device installation, or big purchases. There are some simple and inexpensive devices you can pick up to automate your lighting with Alexa, including the following:

But last year, Samsung diversified the series to include the budget segment as well, leading to devices like the Galaxy A10 and A20. Samsung streamlined its strategy here, and the Galaxy A series now caters to both the budget and mid-range categories.
One of the best phones to come out of the Galaxy A lineup last year was the Galaxy A70. It was the first Samsung phone to offer 25W wired charging, and offered decent specs in the form of a Snapdragon 675. The Galaxy A71 builds on that formula with updates to the camera and chipset, and it also sports an exciting new design with a smaller cutout.
Samsung hasn't changed too much here from last year, but the updates make the Galaxy A71 an enticing option in the mid-range category in 2020. I'm reviewing the 4G version of the phone, but Samsung also sells a 5G-enabled version of the Galaxy A71 that's now on sale in the U.S..
At a glance
Samsung Galaxy A71
Bottom line: The Galaxy A71 builds on the success of last year's A70 with upgraded internals and a new 64MP camera that takes great photos. The design has been refreshed for 2020, you get incredible battery life with 25W fast charging, and the 6.7-inch AMOLED panel is one of the best in this category. As an overall package, the Galaxy A71 is one of the best mid-range phones you'll find in 2020.
The Good
- Gorgeous design
- Vibrant AMOLED screen
- Excellent battery life with 25W fast charging
- Robust internal hardware
- 64MP camera takes great photos
- One UI 2.0 out of the box
The Bad
- Slow fingerprint sensor
- Macro camera is trash
Samsung Galaxy A71 Design and display
Samsung offered vibrant gradient designs last year across the Galaxy A series, and in 2020 it is making a few tweaks to the design. There's now a criss-cross pattern underneath the back that shows up as light reflects off the surface of the phone, and it is broken into quadrants. Each quadrant has a slightly different hue, and the overall effect is rather striking.
The Galaxy A71 has a gorgeous design that's backed up by robust internal hardware.
Of course, the phone is still sporting a polycarbonate back, but that isn't immediately evident. The gradient design combined with the glossy coating make the back look and feel like glass, but because it is made out of plastic, it doesn't add too much weight to the device. Even though there's a 4500mAh battery under the hood and a 6.7-inch screen, the Galaxy A71 comes in at a very decent 179g. There's also the fact that a polycarbonate back makes the phone just that little bit more durable.
Another design change at the back is the rectangular camera housing. As we've seen on the rest of Samsung's portfolio this year — including the Galaxy A51 and the Galaxy S10 Lite — Samsung is sticking to a unified design theme in this area, and that means using the same camera housing as the Galaxy S20 series.
The Galaxy A71 has razor-thin bezels at the front, and there's now a hole-punch cutout for the front camera. The cutout itself is large, but it isn't too distracting, and like most phones in the market today you get an in-screen fingerprint reader.
While Samsung abandoned the 3.5mm jack on its flagships, the analog port is still intact on the Galaxy A71. The power and volume buttons are located on the right side of the phone, and the positioning isn't too far up the side, allowing for easy access. There's a single speaker at the bottom on the other side of the USB-C charging port.
Overall, there's plenty to like when it comes to the design of the Galaxy A71. The polycarbonate doesn't diminish the vibrant hues and great in-hand feel, and the fit and finish is on par with the best that Samsung has to offer.
Dominating the front of the Galaxy A71 is a 6.7-inch FHD+ (2400 x 1080) Super AMOLED display. The panel itself is largely unchanged from the A70, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. You still get a screen with vibrant colors, excellent sunlight visibility, and great viewing angles. The panel is protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass 3, just like last year's A70.
Even though the Galaxy A71 has a massive 6.7-inch screen, it is surprisingly easy to use one-handed.
The flowing curves at the back combined with the thin bezels make it easy to use the Galaxy A71 — you just don't get the feeling that you're using a phone with a 6.7-inch screen. For some context, this is the second-largest display that Samsung currently offers; only the Galaxy S20 Ultra with its 6.9-inch panel has a bigger screen.
The screen on the Galaxy A71 has excellent colors out of the box, and you can also adjust the color balance by switching to the Vivid mode in the phone's settings. As is the case with every other Samsung phone, you get a lot of customizability around font and text scaling. There's no notification LED here, but you do get a full-featured Always On Display, giving you an easy overview of pending notifications without having to wake the screen.
Like the design aesthetic, the display on the Galaxy A71 holds up well in 2020 — this is one of the best screens you'll find in the mid-range category. Sure, it may not have a high refresh rate, but the panel quality itself makes up for that omission.
Samsung Galaxy A71 Hardware and battery
One of the reasons that made last year's Galaxy A70 stand out was the Snapdragon 675 chipset. The Galaxy A71 features updated internals in the form of the Snapdragon 730. Qualcomm's mid-range chipset is a stalwart in this category, and it is set to be the chipset of choice for Google's upcoming Pixel 4a.
|Specs||Samsung Galaxy A71|
|Software||One UI 2.0 based on Android 10|
|Display||6.7-inch (2400x1080) Super AMOLED|
|Chipset||2.20GHz Snapdragon 730|
|RAM||6GB/8GB|
|Storage||128GB|
|Rear Camera 1||64MP ƒ/1.8 (primary)|
|Rear Camera 2||12MP ƒ/2.2 (wide-angle)|
|Rear Camera 3||5MP ƒ/2.4 (macro)|
|Rear Camera 4||5MP ƒ/2.2 (portrait)|
|Front Camera 1||32MP ƒ/2.2|
|Connectivity||Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, BT5.0, NFC|
|Battery||4500mAh | 25W|
|Security||In-screen fingerprint|
|Colors||Prism Crush Black, Silver, Blue|
|Dimensions||163.6 x 76 x 7.7mm|
|Weight||179g|
The Snapdragon 730 debuted a year ago, and features two Cortex A76 cores clocked at 2.20GHz and six energy-efficient Cortex A55 cores that go up to 1.8GHz. It also has the Adreno 618 GPU, the Hexagon 688 DSP, and is built on the 8nm node. The node shrink to 8nm allows the Galaxy A71 to deliver better battery life from its predecessor, and you also get better performance, particularly when gaming.
I didn't see any slowdowns whatsoever on the Galaxy A71, and the phone handled visually demanding games just fine. The Snapdragon 730 is a known quantity at this point — with phones like the Mi 9T, POCO X2, Mi Note 10, and several others featuring the chipset. It delivers reliable performance in day-to-day tasks, and also doubles as a decent chipset for gaming.
The Galaxy A71 comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS 2.1 storage as standard, and there's also a variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. You get a MicroSD card that can slot in an SD card up to 1TB in size, and the global model comes with a dedicated dual SIM tray in addition to the MicroSD slot.
What's particularly interesting is that the Galaxy A71 variant sold in the U.S. is powered by the beefier Snapdragon 765 chipset. That's because of the fact that it has a built-in 5G modem, and with Samsung selling the device at carriers, it went with a 5G-enabled chipset. So if you are looking at buying the A71 in the U.S., know that you're getting a phone with outstanding performance.
While the Galaxy A71 has robust internals, one area where it falls short is the in-display fingerprint sensor. Although the phone uses an optical solution, it isn't quite as fast or reliable as other devices in this category. It usually takes around a second to unlock the phone, and I've had my fair share of errors when the sensor failed to recognize my fingerprint.
A standout feature on the Galaxy A71 is the battery life. With a 4500mAh battery under the hood, the phone easily manages to deliver over a day's worth of use consistently. I didn't have to worry about the phone running out of battery over the course of a day, and I routinely averaged over six hours of screen-on-time spread over 15 hours.
With reliable performance and outstanding battery life, the Galaxy A71 nails the basics.
And when you do need to charge the phone, there's 25W fast charging, with a 25W charger bundled in the box. You'll get up to a 50% charge from flat in just 30 minutes, and a full charge takes just over 80 minutes.
In terms of connectivity, the Galaxy A71 has Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 5.0 LE, A-GPS, and NFC. The phone has a Category 15 LTE modem with 3x carrier aggregation, and the global variant has the following LTE bands: 1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/20/28/38/40/41/66. I tested the phone in India, and it delivered rock-solid connectivity over Wi-Fi. I didn't face any issues with calls either, and when it comes to the basics, the Galaxy A71 has zero problems.
There's no wireless charging or water resistance here, but if you're looking for a reliable phone for day-to-day use, the Galaxy A71 is a great choice in 2020.
Samsung Galaxy A71 Camera
The Galaxy A71 has a 64MP primary lens that's joined by a 12MP wide-angle shooter, 5MP macro lens, and a 5MP portrait lens. Other than the 64MP camera, the lens arrangement is identical to the Galaxy A51. The 64MP camera relies on pixel binning to produce 16MP shots by default, and there's a 32MP camera at the front for selfies.
The camera interface itself is identical to what you get on the Galaxy S20 series, with the shooting modes laid out in a ribbon. You can add more modes to the ribbon for easy access, and on the other side you get toggles for timer, settings, AR Doodle, flash, and beautify effects.
Shots taken in daylight conditions come out with plenty of detail, offering great dynamic range and color vibrancy. There's little to no noise, highlights aren't blown out, and auto HDR does a great job bringing out detail in photos. The 12MP wide-angle camera does a decent job as well, producing shots with good detail — and more importantly — accurate colors. The A71 also takes great portrait shots in Live Focus mode.
As you can probably imagine, the Galaxy A71 doesn't fare so well in low-light conditions. This is a constant theme in the mid-range segment, and as far as this category has come in the last three years, there aren't many sub-$500 phones outside of the Pixel 3a series that can take good low-light shots. The A71 takes decent enough shots, but you'll find a lot of noise when viewing the resultant photos on a monitor. The dedicated Night Mode does little to fix this particular issue, but you do get better dynamic range and more detail.
Things so downhill from here. Like the Galaxy A51, the A71 has a 5MP macro lens that just isn't usable. It has a fixed focal length, so it is near-impossible to get it to focus on a subject. The effort that it takes is just not worth it when you consider that the few images that are actually in focus don't end up looking particularly great.
Samsung Galaxy A71 Software
The Galaxy A71 comes with One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 out of the box, and you get the same set of features as the Galaxy S20 series. As is usually the case on Samsung phones, there's more than enough customization on offer, and it usually takes an hour or so to set things up just the way you want.
The Galaxy A71 delivers a software experience that's identical to Samsung's flagships.
You get to pick between Android 10's navigation gestures and Samsung's own system, there's a built-in screen recorder, enhanced system-wide dark mode, Edge screen with configurable panels, Link to Windows, Samsung Pass, Game Booster, and so much more. There's also a software-assisted face unlock, but like the in-screen sensor it isn't quite as reliable as what you get on other devices.
The Galaxy A71 also delivers a full-fledged Samsung Pay experience. Samsung's mobile payments service continues to be the best around, and the fact that it works with NFC machines and older MST card readers gives it an edge. The Galaxy A71 wouldn't be a Samsung phone if it didn't have bloatware, and you find the usual Microsoft services, a social network that you've never heard of called Helo, DailyHunt, and others. The good news here is that you can easily uninstall all the bloatware.
With Samsung's new software commitment, the Galaxy A71 will receive three platform updates along with three years of security updates. It's fantastic to see Samsung make positive strides in this particular area, and it makes the A71 a much more enticing choice.
Samsung Galaxy A71 The competition
The obvious contender to the Galaxy A71 is the $350 Pixel 4a. The phone misses out on 5G connectivity and has modest hardware in comparison to the A71, but the camera on offer beats every other device in this segment. So if camera quality is a higher priority than a large screen or two-day battery life, the Pixel 4a is a better fit for your needs.
If you want a phone with 5G connectivity and high-end hardware, the $700 OnePlus 8 is a fantastic option right now. You get a 90Hz AMOLED display, the latest hardware available today, refined software, and fast updates — the phone is already running Android 11.
Samsung Galaxy A71 Should you buy?
You should buy this if ...
- You want a phone with a vibrant AMOLED screen and a modern design
- You're looking for a device with a large battery that lasts two days
- You want a phone that will get regular software updates
You should not buy this if ...
- You want a compact phone
Samsung didn't make a lot of changes with the A71, but it didn't need to. The Galaxy A70 continues to be a great phone, and by updating the internal hardware and adding a 64MP camera, Samsung has added enough differentiation to make the Galaxy A71 stand out in 2020.
The Galaxy A71 has everything you're looking for in a mid-range phone.
The Galaxy A71 5G is available in the U.S. for $500, making it a stellar option if you're in the market for a 5G-enabled device.
Overall, the Galaxy A71 offers fantastic value for what you end up paying for the phone. The Snapdragon 730 is a powerful mid-range chipset that will deliver a lag-free usage experience for several years, and the design should similarly hold up. You also get excellent battery life with 25W fast charging, One UI 2.0 with Android 10 and three guaranteed platform updates, and that 64MP camera isn't all that bad either.
The 4G-enabled variant of the Galaxy A71 is a great phone in its own right, but the Galaxy A71 5G takes things to the next level with beefier hardware and global 5G connectivity. If you're used to Samsung's phones and don't want to switch to a different brand, the Galaxy A71 will serve you well for several years.

Best Overall: AirThings Wave Plus
The AirThings Wave Plus is a circular device that has six sensors to detect for radon (a naturally occurring radioactive gas), VOCs (volatile organic compounds that can be found in everyday items like cleaning products, paint, and furniture), CO2, humidity, temperature, and barometric pressure. Access the AirThings Dashboard to get a comprehensive look at all of the data, including historical reports and tips for improving the air quality in your home.
Connect it to your smartphone via Bluetooth and download the AirThings app to get detailed insights. It can also connect to the AirThings Hub (sold separately). Additionally, you can literally wave your hand in front of the device to see a color-coded visual reading of the air quality: green means good, yellow is fair, and red is poor.
Mount it on your wall like you would a thermostat; it works with Alexa and Google Assistant for voice control as well as IFTTT for integrating it with other devices in the home to provide certain actions. You could, for example, have a smart air purifier turn on whenever the AirThings detects fair or poor air quality.
Operating on a pair of AA batteries that last for about 16 months, it's just 16 cm in diameter and comes with a 12-month warranty. Keep in mind that it will need about a week to adjust to your environment before it gives accurate readings.

Best for Purifying, Too: Dyson Pure Hot + Cool Air Purifier
Yes, technically this is an actual air purifier, not just an air quality monitor. But if you are concerned enough about the air quality in your home, chances are you are looking for a device that can keep it clean. So why not get it all in one shot? The Dyson purifier is worth including because you get really detailed air quality data with the handy Dyson Link app that works with it. This HEPA air purifier is also a space heater and fan that can use a backward airflow mode to purify a room without cooling or heating when you don't need either.
In the app, see details on ultrafine particles (PM2.5), allergens, VOCs, and nitrogen dioxide, and have the unit automatically kick in to clean the air when it senses that levels are too high; or manually control it through the button on the unit, the included magnetic remote, or the app.
The sealed HEPA filter captures 99.97% of allergens as small as 0.3 microns, and Air Multiplier Technology uses a powerful airflow along with 350-degree oscillation to direct airflow where you need it. The app shows real-time and historical reports and can be used to set schedules so you can keep the air continuously clean instead of just passively monitoring it.

You might suspect that the air quality might not be great inside your house, around your neighborhood, or in areas you frequent for your morning run, afternoon walks with the new baby, or patio lunches with colleagues. In this case, an air quality monitor is a great device to provide some insight before you delve full force into buying an air purifier or change your daily habits to avoid highly polluted outdoor areas.
There are plenty of options out there, but the AirThings Wave Plus is a great middle-of-the-road option that doesn't provide more than you need but has everything you would want. And it won't break the bank. It doesn't just track for one or two types of pollutants but has sensors for three, including radon, VOCs, and CO2. Plus, it also measures humidity, temperature, and barometric pressure which can also impact your health. Too much humidity can cause mold growth which, in turn, can lead to symptoms. Meanwhile, changes in barometric pressure can cause everything from headaches to joint pain and fatigue.
The unit can neatly mount to the wall and quietly do its thing as you go about your day. Use the app to get reports and real-time details or just wave your hand in front of the unit and check that it illuminates green to indicate that all is good. If you find that it's frequently in the red or even yellow "fair" range, it might be time to start thinking about getting an air purifier. All of the options here are suitable for various use cases, but in terms of checking the air quality at home and getting accurate details on all kinds of pollutants, this is the best option.

Luckily, right now you can get 15 months for the price of 12 with this promo that scores you three months free. It also happens to save you a cool 49% on the annual cost, making it just $6.67 per month.

Surfshark VPN
From $2.49 per month (81% off)
Bottom line: Surfshark VPN is a relative newcomer but has already earned a strong reputation. It's one of the most affordable options on the market and has a solid feature set, though its current low price expires soon. It has a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you should definitely give it a try today.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$12.95||0%||$12.95 at Surfshark|
|6 Months||$6.49||50%||$38.94 at Surfshark|
|12 Months + 12 Months Free||$2.49||81%||$59.76 at Surfshark|
Pros
- Servers worldwide
- No user logs (British Virgin Islands jurisdiction)
- Unlimited device connections
- Apps for all major platforms plus smart TV platforms
Cons
- Sparse support site
- Finicky kill switch
Surfshark VPN is a relatively new service, though it has quickly gained a solid reputation for itself thanks to its balance of features and affordability. It has 1,000+ servers in 60+ countries, strong encryption, and keeps no logs. There are apps for major platforms like Android, iOS, and Windows, as well as smart TV apps for Apple TV and Fire TV, games consoles, and more. You can also connect as many as you want with one subscription.
Surfshark is one of the most affordable VPNs out there offering 12 months free with its 12 month plan. That means you're only paying $2.49 per month over the course of the two years and saving a total of 81% versus paying per month for that length of time.
Surfshark VPN
Surfshark offers one of the best cheap VPN options already, but this discount makes it an even better value. It's hard to beat this deal, especially considering everything that Surfshark does already and how well it performs. The deal won't be around forever, though.
Private Internet Access
$2.59 per month (78% off)
Bottom line: Private Internet Access is really affordable at under $3 per month. It has lots of available servers and you can run it on 10 devices at once which is more than most other providers allow. It's got apps everywhere you'd expect, though there's no live chat for support, just an email ticket-based service.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$11.95||0%||$11.95 at PIA|
|12 Months||$4.16||49%||$49.95 at PIA|
|24 Months + 3 Months Free||$2.59||78%||$69.95 at PIA|
Pros
- 3,300+ servers in 32 countries
- Strong performance, unlimited bandwidth
- Apps for all major platforms
- 10 simultaneous connections
- Affordable pricing
Cons
- U.S.-based
- Email ticket support
Private Internet Access is pretty popular, partially thanks to its already-affordable pricing such as its 1-year plan that costs just $4.16 per month. But right now, you get an additional 3 months thrown in for free with the 2-year plan dropping the relative monthly cost to $2.59. It has over 3,000 servers, though they are spread across only 32 countries. It has apps for all of the major mobile and desktop platforms as well as browser extensions.
One downside of PIA is that it's based in the U.S. which means any information it has could be requested by intelligence agencies. That being said, PIA states it keeps no logs so there would be nothing to hand over, but it's still worth considering when you are looking around.
Private Internet Access
PIA is a U.S.-based VPN provider that gives you an unlimited amount of data to use each month and up to 10 simultaneous connections.
NordVPN
From $3.71 per month (68% off)
Bottom line: NordVPN is one of the best VPN providers out there. Its balance of features and pricing makes it a smart choice for those wanting to protect their privacy with a no-logs VPN. There's a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can try it out risk-free, too.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$11.95||0%||$11.95 at NordVPN|
|12 Months||$4.92||58%||$59 at NordVPN|
|24 Months + Up to 24 Months Free||$3.71||68%||$89 at NordVPN|
Pros
- Plenty of servers in many locations worldwide
- No user logs (Panama jurisdiction)
- Anonymous payment options
- Apps for all major platforms
- Lots of extra features
Cons
- Fluctuations in server performance
- Recent security concerns
NordVPN is one of the best virtual private network (VPN) providers out there, due to its lack of user logs, plenty of servers, and P2P connectivity. It has apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and, and you can use one subscription across six devices simultaneously.
With NordVPN, the longer you prepay the cheaper your monthly cost becomes. It goes from $11.95 per month down to just $4.92 per month when you commit to its 1-year plan, for example. However, the best NordVPN deal right now is on its 2-year plan. Not only do you save 68% by going for that option, dropping the monthly cost to just $3.71, but you will also win an additional month, year, or 2 years on top of the 2-year plan you bought. It's a random chance but you'll get some kind of freebie regardless as long as its Cyber Month promotion is live.
It's worth noting that NordVPN was the center of a security blunder previously. One of its hundreds of servers was accessed by an outside party, though Nord assures customers that nothing major was taken during the attack and that the security has been enhanced as a result. While it may not be a make or break point in your decision process, it's worth keeping in the back of your mind.
Be sure to always check for a NordVPN discount before signing up, though.
NordVPN
NordVPN is one of the most well-known VPN providers out there right now, and it's plans get extremely affordable when you commit to using it long-term. You can sign up and prepay for two years to ensure you are always connected and protected and get some extra time on top of that for free.
FastestVPN
$20 lifetime license (95% off)
Bottom line: FastestVPN's $20 lifetime plan ensures you have access to a VPN when you need it most without any recurring costs. It's a feature-rich service that's easy to use and even if you only use it a few times per year it's worth purchasing at this price.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|Lifetime||$20||95%||$20 at FastestVPN|
Pros
- Affordable one-time payment
- Works on 10 devices at same time
- Fast speeds with Smart Connect feature

That's a great feature for those who aren't super familiar with VPNs and want something that is easy to use. You can also pick the server you want, and Fastest VPN has them available in more than 30 countries around the world.
You can use it on a wide variety of devices, including phones, tablets, computers, routers, Fire TV sticks, and more.

IPVanish
From $3.25 per month (73% off)
Bottom line: With its current deal, IPVanish is fairly-priced for its average feature set. The added free cloud storage is a nice perk and it has a 30-day money-back guarantee just in case.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$5||59%||$5 at IPVanish|
|3 Months||$4.50||63%||$13.50 at IPVanish|
|12 Months||$3.25||73%||$39 at IPVanish|
Pros
- 1,300+ servers in 50+ countries
- Reliable, speedy service
- Apps for all major platforms
- 10 simultaneous connections
- Free cloud storage
Cons
- U.S.-based
IPVanish falls in the middle of the pack for features, server availability, and price. None of that is bad necessarily, as a fairly-priced and reliable VPN service is the kind of product you want to get behind. It offers unlimited P2P traffic, powerful apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and even Fire TV, as well as a speedy connection.
With its current promotion, you can snag the one-year plan at a 73% discount. Billed as $39 upfront, you're effectively paying just over $3 per month for the service in your first year. One neat addition to this current deal is the inclusion of 250GB of SugarSync cloud storage at no extra cost which is extremely handy for going back to school or for working from home.
IPVanish is also one of very few VPN providers to be discounting its monthly plan right now meaning you can snag one month for just $5, down from its usual $12 cost. IPVanish recently moved from a 7-day money-back guarantee to a 30-day guarantee, too.
IPVanish
The price is a bit higher than some of the others, but when you factor in the cloud storage that you are getting you quickly see how much value is actually provided here. Sign up today and try it out.
CyberGhost
From $2.25 per month (83% off)
Bottom line: CyberGhost's current deal offers huge savings with a longer-term plan. At just over $2 per month, it's one of the most affordable VPN services.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$12.99||0%||$12.99 at CyberGhost|
|12 Months||$3.99||69%||$47.88 at CyberGhost|
|24 Months||$3.49||73%||$49.50 at CyberGhost|
|36 Months + 3 Months Free||$2.25||83%||$87.75 at CyberGhost|
Pros
- 6,300+ servers in 90+ countries
- Automatic server matching for geo-restricted content unblocking
- Apps for all major platforms
Cons
- Connection speeds are slower than competition
CyberGhost has all of the basic features you want and need from your VPN provider plus a couple of added extras that make it worth considering, especially when it is offering such a big price cut.
One neat feature is the ability to help you find the right server from its list of over 6,000 depending on what task you're doing. You can simply select the geo-blocked service that you want from a list, such as Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, etc., and then CyberGhost shows you the best options so you can get straight to streaming.
The current best deal gives you 3 additional months for free when you go for the 3-year plan which means you're paying just $2.25 per month and saving 83% in the process. It's $87.75 upfront which renews every three years after your first 39 months. There's a 45-day money-back guarantee, one of the longest of any provider, in case you change your mind too.
CyberGhost
You'll get some stellar month-ton-month savings by going for CyberGhost's long-term plan as well as a few extra months thrown in for free in your first billing cycle. There's even a 45-day money-back guarantee so you can try it out risk-free.
PureVPN
From $1.65 per month (85% off)
Bottom line: PureVPN is offering some of the biggest savings, though it requires one of the longest commitments. It's 5-year plan is currently 85% off at $99 which means you're being paying the super-low price of just $1.65 per month for your VPN subscription. The service works on all major platforms, has tons of servers, and offers a 31-day money-back guarantee.
|Plan Length||Monthly Cost||Discount||Total Price|
|1 Month||$10.95||0%||$10.95 at PureVPN|
|12 Months||$5||54%||$59.95 at PureVPN|

Pros
- 2,000+ servers in 140+ countries
- No user logs (Hong Kong jurisdiction)
- Apps for all major platforms plus smart TVs and Wi-Fi routers
- 31-day money-back guarantee
Cons
- Slower speeds than competition
- 5 simultaneous connections
PureVPN is super affordable but reviewers have had some issues with its reliability and speed. It does have one of the broadest server availabilities with over 2,000 servers in 140 countries, so it may be worth trying out yourself to see if you experience any problems.
Its best savings are offered in the form of a 5-year plan that is down to $99 upfront. That's an 85% discount and means you're only paying $1.65 per month over that length of time. At this price, it's one of the most affordable VPN services on the market. Thankfully you can try it out without worrying too much about that commitment thanks to a 31-day money-back guarantee.
It's got apps for all the major platforms, plus add-ons for devices like Kodi, Fire TV, and Wi-Fi routers making it a good choice for those niche use cases. If you skip the 5-year savings, its price is pretty low with its 1-year plan going for just $5 per month.
PureVPN
The 85% savings are hard to pass up, especially if you know PureVPN is right for you. If you've been considering signing up, this may be just what you need to make the plunge and give one a shot right now.
More VPN Deals
We've mentioned our favorites above, but there are plenty of other VPN providers out there offering some great savings. Each company has a slightly different advantage, some offering better customer support, some have cheaper plans, and some even have free trials. Here are some more VPN deals in case you couldn't commit to one of the above.
TunnelBear
TunnelBear is ideal for VPN novices with super easy-to-use apps, 24/7 customer support, and a free trial for those wanting to test it out before buying. Opting for a 2-year plan will save you 58% off its regular price.

Namecheap VPN

hide.me VPN
Windscribe
Windscribe always offers a free VPN plan, but you have to jump through some hoops to get up to 15GB a month. Or you can pay to upgrade your account.
What is a VPN?
VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. A VPN takes your Internet connection and makes it more secure, by cloaking your internet activity in anonymity and stops you from being tracked across the web for advertising, having your traffic intercepted, or running into malicious sites. They are also great if you want to access content that is blocked in your region as you can use one to appear as if you are in another country.
VPN 101: What is it?
You can run a VPN on everything from your computer or phone, to devices like your smart TV, Wi-Fi router, games console, and more. They come in at all different price points, so you're likely going to want to find a great VPN deal or discount to take advantage of when signing up.
How do you pick the best VPN provider?
There's so much to consider when deciding which VPN provider is right for you. Of course, you want to ensure it is available on all of the devices you wish to run it on, but you should also think about things like the service's server variety (both in number and physical location) to ensure you have a reliable connection and speed, what data (if any) may be logged, strength of the encryption used, ease-of-use, and the quality of customer support. On top of all of that, price may be a huge factor in your decision-making.
Why is it important to use a VPN?
As with many things in life, you tend to get what you pay for with VPNs. That being said, most providers will have a free trial or a money-back guarantee so you can try them out without risking your money. We've gathered up the best VPN deals above with the most pertinent information to help you make an informed choice.
How to get the Best VPN Deals
VPN providers generally offer better discounts the longer you subscribe for, so opting for a 3-year or 2-year plan is usually going to save you the most money. The majority of services have money-back guarantees so you can try out the apps on your devices and cancel your subscription if it's doesn't work out for you. Be sure to read the terms when signing up.
A few VPN services have free plans but these are usually restricted in terms of bandwidth. However, it can serve as a useful way to dip your toe into the VPN waters with no financial commitment. That being said, there are sometimes privacy implications with totally free services. If you're not paying for their product, they have to make their money back somewhere so make sure you take an in-depth look at the privacy policy for such services so you know what you're getting yourself in for.
We keep this list updated with the latest offers from the most reputable VPN providers, so bookmark it and check back in whenever you're in the market for a new VPN service. If you're unsure of which to choose, we have also put together a comprehensive guide on the best VPN services in 2020. We've also got a separate roundup highlighting the Best Free VPN Deals that you might want to check out.
Are there any free VPNs?
The short answer here is yes. You can find some free VPN providers, but they may not be the best option for everyone. Often times you are trading off speed, reliability, data limits, and more to get a free VPN, which makes it ultimately more of a pain to actually use the service. With the costs mentioned above, you are better off spending a few bucks each month on your privacy instead of trying to make a free one work for you.
Some providers offer free trials, and some have money-back guarantees. If you aren't sure whether or not a VPN is right for you, this is a great way to test the waters.
Can you use a VPN on your phone and PC?
Most VPN providers allow you to have simultaneous connections, which means that you can connect up to a set amount of devices to the VPN service at the same time. Most companies offer up to five devices at once, though some are slightly lower or higher than that number. This allows you to keep it running on your phone, tablet, PC, and even streaming hardware without worrying about whether you need to disconnect another device to connect the new one or not. A neat way around this, if your provider of choice supports it, is running your VPN on your router so any device connected to your Wi-Fi network is automatically on the VPN while only using up 1 device slot!
We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:
1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service).
2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad.
We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services. Consuming pirated content that is paid-for is neither endorsed nor approved by Future Publishing.

- Oculus Quest is a standalone headset that works without a computer.
- It's getting hand tracking this week.
- Hand tracking will only work in menus and Oculus apps initially.
- Developers need to update their games to take advantage of the feature.
Updated December 12, 2019: Hand tracking went live on Oculus Quest on December 12. You have to plug in your headset and download the update by going into settings.
The Oculus Quest is a standalone virtual reality (VR) headset that has become quite popular in recent months. It allows you to experience the wonders of VR without attaching long cables connecting it to your computer.
The Quest relies on two controllers for inputs, but that's about to change very soon. Today, Oculus announced that hand tracking was coming to the headset this week. The press release Android Central received said that the team wanted to "share that we'll be rolling out an initial version of hand tracking as an early feature for consumers on Oculus Quest this week."
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
The initial release date was pegged in early 2020, but it's coming out sooner than expected. That's great news in my book because I've been wanting to try it out for a while now. Quest users will have to turn on this feature in the Experimental Features menu, then use their hands to navigate and interact within Quest's Home interfaces like Library and Store, plus in select first-party apps like the Oculus Browser and Oculus TV.
Luckily, if you don't like it, you can even switch between your hands and controllers with a new toggle within the Quest Home menu, as well as set the floor height for a stationary Guardian using only your hands. Keep in mind that developers will have to update their games to support hand tracking. It seems like this probably won't happen until 2020. Which games do you want to play with just your hands? Do you think it'll work well? Let us know.

Want the best Fitbit out there? Get the Fitbit Versa 3
Want a Fitbit but aren't sure which one is for you? Here's a guide to help make your decision a little easier.OnePlus manages to release some of the most exciting and interesting Android phones every year. The concept of getting flagship specs for considerably less money than the competition is what's helped OnePlus stand out from other brands, but as prices rise with each new release and that cost gap closes, OnePlus has had to further refine and improve its phones to help them still stand out.
For 2020, OnePlus is bringing two new handsets to the U.S. with the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro. The OnePlus 8 is a pretty minor update to 2019's OnePlus 7T, while OnePlus 8 Pro is where the company put all of its marbles to create its most premium smartphone to-date.
Whether you're interested in our review, full device specs, or a closer look at the OnePlus 8/8 Pro's best features, here's everything you need to know!
Done settling
OnePlus 8 Pro
OnePlus goes full flagship
The OnePlus 8 Pro marks a big shift in OnePlus as a company. While every device prior to this has cut some corner or feature, the 8 Pro does none of that. In addition to the beastly processor and RAM you've come to expect from OnePlus devices, the 8 Pro also delivers a stunning 120Hz AMOLED display, a 4,510 mAh battery, 30W wireless charging, an IP68 dust/water resistance rating, and 5G connectivity. Yes, it's expensive, but it's also one of the most fully-featured flagships on the market.
How much does the OnePlus 8 cost and where can I buy it?
OnePlus phones have long been seen as some of the best values in the Android space, and while the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro are cheaper than some of their direct competitors, the margin isn't as drastic as it used to be.
The OnePlus 8 starts at $699 for the 8GB RAM/128GB storage configuration, going up to $799 if you want 12GB RAM/256GB of storage. The OnePlus 8 Pro is even more expensive, starting at $899 and going all the way to $999 for the same configurations. That's a lot of money, especially considering that the OnePlus 7 Pro debuted with a $669 price last year.
There's an argument to be made that you're still getting a good deal when the Galaxy S20 Ultra costs at least $1,400, but even so, prices like this for OnePlus devices will take some getting used to.
Sales are open right now on OnePlus's website, and for the first time ever, Amazon.
While the OnePlus 8 Pro is only being sold as an unlocked device through those channels, the regular OnePlus 8 touts carrier availability through Verizon and T-Mobile.
Where to buy the OnePlus 8 & 8 Pro: Best Deals and Discounts in 2020
Did the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro get good reviews?
Yes! We've reviewed both phones here on Android Central, and each one has received high praise from our various writers.
Starting with the OnePlus 8, this is the baseline phone for OnePlus in the first half of 2020. The specs are about as solid as you could ask for, offering a Snapdragon 865 processor, up to 12GB of RAM, a 90Hz AMOLED display, 4,300 mAh battery, and OnePlus's excellent OxygenOS software that's based on Android 10.
It's a reliable all-around phone that just about anyone would be happy with, but the fact of the matter is that it's not much different from the OnePlus 7T. Plus, while the OnePlus 8 starts at $699 and it's pretty common these days to find the OnePlus 7T for $500, the 7T may continue to be the better purchase for folks looking to get the best dollar-for-dollar value.
As for the OnePlus 8 Pro, this is where OnePlus went all-out. The display is bumped up to a 120Hz refresh rate, more interesting cameras, an even bigger battery, and (finally) wireless charging.
There's no doubt that it's the most technically impressive phone OnePlus has ever created, but with a starting price of $899, it's also the most expensive by a considerable margin
OnePlus 8 Pro second opinion review: A great phone, but not a flawless one
Is stock for the OnePlus 8 limited right now?
If you're interested in buying a OnePlus 8 or 8 Pro, doing so is actually fairly difficult right now. The current health situation across the globe has resulted in inventory and manufacturing shortages everywhere you look, including smartphones.
Both Amazon and OnePlus's official website have struggled to keep ample inventory for a while now, and while things are better now than they used to be, it's still not an ideal situation to be in.
This is likely an issue we'll see across the entire industry for a while, so we'd recommend getting used to it.
How many OnePlus 8 models are there?
As mentioned above, you get two variants of the OnePlus 8 to choose from this year. While OnePlus did launch a OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro last year, only the 7 Pro was released in the United States. This time, however, you're able to buy both the 8 and 8 Pro.
The phones have a lot in common, such as the processor, RAM, storage, and the general design. If you choose to upgrade to the 8 Pro, you'll get that nicer display, wireless charging, etc.
Also shared between the phones is that they both support 5G connectivity. OnePlus launched a couple of different 5G-specific models in 2019 to go along with its main releases, but this year, 5G is a default feature.
What specs does the OnePlus 8 have?
Specs have always been the big draw to OnePlus phones, and that's no different for the OnePlus 8 series.
You'll find all of the latest and greatest specifications in these two phones, so if that's something you care about, OnePlus once again has you covered.
Here's a quick rundown of the most notable specs:

Should I upgrade to the OnePlus 8 from another OnePlus phone?
It's no secret that OnePlus crafted a duo of excellent Android phones with the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, but as you probably know, OnePlus creating solid products is nothing new.
Year after year, OnePlus has shown us that it's one of the better Android manufacturers in the business. And, because of that, its previous devices leading up to the OnePlus 8 series are still really darn good. If you have an older OnePlus phone and aren't sure if it's worth upgrading, we've made a couple of comparisons to help you out.
If you're rocking last year's OnePlus 7 Pro, you're probably fine to keep on using it for another year or two. While the OnePlus 8 Pro does give you that 120Hz display, wireless charging, better cameras, and 5G, not everyone needs those things. If you're still perfectly happy with your 7 Pro, throwing down a minimum of $900 for the 8 Pro isn't necessary.
The conversation shifts a bit when looking at the older OnePlus 6T. A lot about the 6T still holds up surprisingly well here in 2020, but given that the phone is running a two-year-old processor, only has a 60Hz display, and has considerably worse cameras, stepping up to a OnePlus 8 or 8 Pro isn't a bad idea.
How does the OnePlus 8 compare to other Androids?
On their own, there's no doubt that the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro bring a lot to the table. However, as you all know, that's not the world we live in. The Android space is filled with tons of different handsets, meaning the OnePlus 8 series is met with a great deal of competition.
One of the hottest Android phones on the market right now is the Galaxy S20. It has a 120Hz AMOLED display, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 processor, amazing cameras, and an official IP68 water/dust resistance rating. You get all of that in a genuinely compact form factor, making it one of the few flagship Android phones you can use with one hand. Almost everything about the S20 is great, but it also costs a lot more than the OnePlus 8 with a price of $1000.
Speaking of Samsung, there's also the behemoth that is the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. It's one of the largest and mose expensive smartphones of the year, but it also gives you one of the most premium Android experiences around. The Note 20 Ultra touts a gorgeous 120Hz AMOLED screen, Samsung's ultra-powerful One UI software, great cameras, and — of course — has the iconic S Pen. There's no doubt that the Note 20 Ultra is a fantastic device, but it's pretty impressive just how well the OnePlus 8 Pro is able to keep up with it in spite of that $400 price difference between them.
The Motorola Edge+ is an interesting alternative to the OnePlus 8 Pro, with its highlight feature being its waterfall display that flows over its frame. It's a truly remarkable design, and when you factor in things like a 3.5mm headphone jack and a 5,000 mAh battery, it becomes pretty intereseting. Unfortunately for Motorola, the Edge+'s 90Hz display and lack of an IP rating actually make it worse than the OnePlus 8 Pro in a few regards — despite having a higher starting price.
What are some OnePlus 8 tips/tricks?
There's a lot going on with the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, so we don't blame you if you buy either phone and feel a little intimidated by it. You have a lot to unpack if you want to get the most out of these devices, and rather than leaving you blind to find everything on your own, we're compiling a few how-to guides to ensure you can use your new OnePlus handset to its fullest potential.
For starters, did you know the OnePlus 8 comes with a screen recorder built into its software? This is something Google just got around to adding to Android with the Android 11 update, but you can use it right now on your OnePlus 8 running Android 10. We're also quite fond of the OnePlus 8's Reading Mode and Bedtime Mode features, which further help the phones stand out from the competition.
Battery life and performance should be absolutely killer on your OnePlus 8, but as you use it for weeks and months at a time, it's possible things may start to degrade a little bit. This is natural for any Android phone to some degree, but if things are getting especially wonky, there are a few things you can do yourself to address the issues.
If you find that your battery is draining faster than it should, check for any misbehaving apps that are using more of your phone's batttery than they should. It's also worth using Battery Saver and the dark mode, both of which can help squeeze out a bit more use time per charge. As for performance funk, doing something as simple as restarting your phone can help tremendously.
How can I get more out of the OnePlus 8's cameras?
If there's an Achilles heel for OnePlus phones, it's the camera. It's possible to take very good photos with a OnePlus device, but compared to the likes of Google, Apple, and Samsung this year with the S20 series, they always straggle behind in one way or another.
The OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro share the same 48MP primary camera of the 7T and 7 Pro, which is — good. OnePlus continues to use pixel-binning tech for a final result of a 12MP image, but you do have the option of taking legit 48MP shots for increased sharpness/detail. The sensor takes solid pictures, offering accurate colors, good HDR processing, and surprisingly good low-light performance. It should be more than good enough for most folks, but it doesn't get on the same level as a Pixel 4 or iPhone 11 Pro camera.
Both phones also have ultra-wide cameras, though the OnePlus 8's is a 16MP sensor while the 8 Pro gets a much higher 48MP one. Things get more interesting when looking at the third sensor, with the OnePlus 8 Pro having a fairly typical 8MP telephoto camera while the regular OnePlus 8 omits that for a 2MP macro camera.
Being able to get up close and personal with subjects with the macro camera is neat, but we can't help but shake the feeling that having a telephoto sensor like you get on the 8 Pro would be way more useful.
Does the OnePlus 8 support wireless charging?
With every OnePlus phone that's been released up until now, one feature that's been sorely missing is support for wireless charging. That changes this year, kind of. The regular OnePlus still doesn't have any wireless charging of any kind, but on the OnePlus 8 Pro, you get access to 30W wireless charging. Yes, it's just as impressive as it sounds.
With the new system OnePlus is calling "Warp Charge 30 Wireless," you can wirelessly charge the 8 Pro from 0 - 50% in just 30 minutes. You'll need the company's proprietary wireless charger in order to pull off these speeds, but it's very impressive regardless.
Furthermore, if you don't care about those speeds and just want a more convenient way to charge the 8 Pro, it's compatible with any Qi wireless charger you already have.
What OnePlus 8 colors are available?
With gorgeous colorways like Thunder Purple and Lava Red in its repertoire, OnePlus has become known for creating some truly gorgeous smartphone designs.
That same attention-to-detail prevails with the OnePlus 8 series, with OnePlus offering Interstellar Glow, Glacial Green, Ultramarine Blue, and Onyx Black this time around.
Interstellar Glow is extremely reflective and showcases shades of blue, pink, and gold depending on how the light hits it. In exchange for the shimmering design, you'll have to put up with a heap of fingerprints.
Glacial Green and Ultramarine Blue, on the other hand, favor a matte finish that's less susceptible to fingerprints while being more slippery. At the end of the day, however, all you need to know is that you can't go wrong with any of these colors.
Which color OnePlus 8 & 8 Pro should you buy?
Are there good OnePlus 8 accessories?
OnePlus did an excellent job designing the 8 and 8 Pro to look and feel great, but as with any smartphone, using it naked isn't always a good idea. Unless you want to end up with a shattered and broken mess after just one drop, we highly recommend picking up some accessories to go along with your new phone.
Cases and screen protectors are the most essential things you can buy, giving you an affordable way to safeguard your device from daily use and unwanted tumbles. We're building up lists of the best accessories currently available, and we'll keep adding more below as time goes on.
These are all the official OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro Cases you can buy

Should I wait for the OnePlus 8T?
As much as we love the OnePlus 8, we'd be remiss if we didn't remind you that the OnePlus 8T is expected to be here very soon. It'll likely sit somewhere in between the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, though there's a lot about the phone that remains unknown.
Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865+ processor seems likely, as does a 90 or 120Hz display, and the leaked render above suggests that we aren't getting a major design refresh. When it comes to things like cameras, battery life, and price, however, we're still left in the dark.
It's not a bad idea to hold out for the OnePlus 8T if you don't need a new phone this very second, but in that same breath, both the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro remain very strong purchases.

Keep the OnePlus 8T's display looking great with the best screen protectors
With the OnePlus 8T finally arriving, it's important that you find the right accessories for the device. There are already plenty of great cases to choose from, along with even more screen protectors. These are the best screen protectors for the OnePlus 8T that you can find today!Living 15 minutes from Walt Disney World, getting out and getting some fresh air wasn't much of an issue for me in 2019. The theme parks were open well into the evening, capacity was only an issue around major holidays — when you really don't want to be there, anyway — and so long as I had my trusty poncho and folding fan to deal with the storms and humidity of Florida, all I needed to go walk a few miles was to step away from my desk for a few hours.
Then 2020 came along, and things went pear-shaped. Like my butt.
I'm sure I'm not the only person who's spent most of 2020 cooped up inside. Between the theme parks being closed for four months and then teeming with tourists that don't really get that masks need to cover their mouth and their nose whenever possible, I haven't been making a real effort to get out and get my steps in.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
After weeks of seeing my pathetic Google Fit step counts on my TicWatch Pro 3, though, I started carving out dedicated chunks of time to get outside, get some sunshine and some significant steps in.
And while I'm not back to where I can walk 10 miles at the drop of a Mickey hat, just getting out and doing what I can has done me a world of good.
Google Fit might only be a pale imitation of a health app next to Fitbit and Apple Health, but as a rare Wear OS watch-wearer, it's the health app that I've got on my wrist, so I'll take it. I don't need a bazillion different workout types — all I ever do is walk and power-walk — I just need a step counter, a workout counter, and a estimation of miles walked. Google Fit does that and then stays out of my way, which is great.
Even a little effort can lead to big improvements.
Of course, staying out of the way doesn't exactly remind me to get up, get out there, and get after those goals. TicHealth's hourly movement reminders pick up that slack, thankfully, and give me regularly reminders to plan ahead and figure out when I should break for a walk in the park. Once I started taking my walks again though, making time wasn't hard, because these daily walks are helping me keep my energy up through the day, helping me fall asleep faster in the evenings, and are helping drive away the over feeling of malaise 2020's chaos has permeated everything with.
While there's a multi-billion dollar industry built around helping hapless people like me stay in shape, the most important fitness tool can't be bought. It's the willpower to get outside and do something, even when the world seems like it's conspiring to keep you from your task.
So do me a favor: take half an hour and go for a walk today. Doesn't matter how far you make it, doesn't matter how fast or slow your pace, just go walk for half an hour and see how you feel for the rest of the day.
Then do it tomorrow and see that it feels even better.
Getting back to the busy busy world of technology that's keeping me from walking ten miles a day around Walt Disney World:
- This was a big week for Chrome OS. We got the first Snapdragon-powered Chromebook in the Acer Chromebook Spin 513, and while that may not seem like big news at first glance, it's actually important because Qualcomm's cellular prowess will lead to much better LTE Chromebooks, which will lead to 5G Chromebooks in a couple years.
- Jerry got to test out the new Acer Chromebox CX14 and it'll be an excellent option for families and for schools next year. If you need a lightweight laptop right now, I have a glowing review of the Acer Chromebook Spin 311, which unlike the Lenovo C340-11 and ASUS C214 is actually easy to find and available at regular, non-gouged prices.
- We also reviewed the new Amazon Echo (4th Gen) this week, and if you're more interested in the compact and downright cuddly-looking Echo Dot Kids Edition, I'll be reviewing that next week, so stay tuned!
- The Department of Justice finally announced its antitrust lawsuit against Google this week, and while this is something that will take months if not years to make its way through courts and bring about any meaningful changes — assuming that we'll see meaningful change at all — but you should still read our FAQ so that you can get the skinny on what's going on without drowning in legalese like I almost did.
- There's a new Huawei phone out that features an iPod-like camera module, but without Google services it's still dead in the west.
And on a totally unrelated note, the election might not be for another week and a half, but there's no reason to wait that long! Go vote right now! It's fun, it's responsible, and if you don't vote, you don't get to complain about government for the next four years. Check out your local races, find your early voting place(s), and bring a snack in case the lines are long.

- The Roomba i3 and Roomba i3+ are the latest robot vacuums from iRobot with self-emptying capability.
- The Roomba i3 ships for $399 without a clean base, while the Roomba i3+ ships for $599 with a clean base.
- Both vacuums feature a stronger suction motor, a new cloth top, intelligent navigation, and iRobot Genius AI.
Up until now, self-emptying robot vacuums have been pretty darn expensive. iRobot aims to change all that with the introduction of the Roomba i3 and Roomba i3+, the company's first self-emptying robot vacuums that retail for under $600. Previously, the least expensive self-emptying robot vacuum you could get from the company was the Roomba i7+, which ships for $799 with the clean base required for the self-emptying process. iRobot will be offering the Roomba i3 by itself for $399, while the Roomba i3+ comes with the clean base for $599.
Customers can choose to pick up the Roomba i3 by itself and save some cash now, as a clean base can be purchased separately at a later time. The clean base acts as a charger and a self-emptying solution, as it features a large bag inside that's designed to hold up to 30 dustbins worth of debris from the vacuum. For many people, that bag will likely last several months before needing to be emptied. The Roomba i3 series is smart enough to know when its dustbin gets full while cleaning and can return to the clean base to empty it, top up the battery, and then resume cleaning without any user interaction.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
iRobot introduced the Roomba i7 with clean base 2 years ago and has expanded that self-emptying lineup to three robot vacuums with the introduction of the Roomba i3. The clean base features AllergenLock bags to keep dust and allergens out of the air, and the HEPA-rated filter in the vacuum traps 99% of pollen, mold, dust mites, and cat and dog dander. The Roomba i3 series features a camera on top and can intelligently navigate your home in a logical grid pattern, map out rooms, and enable iRobot Genius AI features within the iRobot home app.
All of the trademark iRobot features like compatibility with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and IFTTT are here, as well. Vacuuming is easier than ever when you simply ask Google or Alexa to vacuum the house for you, and you can even automate cleaning based on events like locking your August Wi-Fi Smart Lock, for instance. It's even got a snazzy new cloth top that's designed to attract less dust than those shiny plastic covers that most robot vacuums have.
Self-emptying, for less

Time to put that old vacuum away for good
The iRobot i3 is here to clean your home and even empty itself, releasing you from the burden of regular vacuuming.

Since the user has no access to saved rooms, you will have to rely on the Quest to remember for you, and often, you will have to remap the same room again.
- Untethered VR experience: Oculus Quest (From $399 on Amazon)
What's up with Oculus Quest's guardian system?
The Oculus Quest guardian system uses a unique passthrough system that lets you draw your playspace over your actual surroundings. During a new play session, the Quest is supposed to recognize the room you're in, and load the previous guardian space from that room. Some of this is still in progress, as it often will not recognize your room. This is likely because something has moved in your room that makes the Quest think it's a new space.
I have found it to be somewhat finicky regarding whether or not it pulls up the correct guardian when starting the Quest. I find the best use is, if you have one playspace you use often, and that room stays fairly consistent, it seems to have no problem bringing up the correct guardian.
Attempting to go from room to room with various guardians set up previously did not seem to work effortlessly. Due to the current inconsistency, it is difficult to determine if there is a maximum amount of rooms the Quest can remember.
The future of Oculus guardians and arena scale
Many of the details regarding the guardian system are still unknown. Specifically, what sort of mechanism is used to map and remember rooms. Oculus has big plans for future development for the Quest's tracking, including what they call arena scale. This is a tracking method that will allow a user to map a space of up to 4000 square feet. This will enable the Quest to be used in large-scale events with potentially many participants.
Their test cases involved large playspaces similar to a paintball arena. Time will tell where Oculus will go with this technology. Currently, even without full consistency of remembering rooms and guardians, the process to map your space is probably the least intrusive of all the VR headsets.

Get spooked with these great horror games for the PS4
Enjoy getting the pants scared clean off you? You might want to check out these horror games.The Cardinals are coming off Monday Night Football where they destroyed the Cowboys and made everyone in Texas pine for the return of quarterback Dak Prescott. In what is a well performing division, the Cardinals sit in second place in the NFC West behind the undefeated Seahawks.
There's not much to say about the Seahawks in this week seven matchup. Russell Wilson and the Seahawks have been perfect to-date and so they simply need to keep pushing all those offensive buttons to put the pressure on the other team. While Jamal Adams' return could have bolstered the defense, he's still not back to full health because of an injury that keeps on lingering.
Arizona on the other hand could really use the 2019 version of running back Kenyan Drake. Drake was amazing last year, but is failing to come up with the big plays in 2020. It will be interesting to see whether the 1,200 fans in the seats at University of Phoenix Stadium gives the home team a little kick in the pants or not.
Seattle Seahawks vs Arizona Cardinals: Where and when?
This battle of the birds kicks off Sunday, October 25 at 4:05 PM ET. The game will be shown on FOX and takes place in Arizona at University of Phoenix Stadium. There will be fans in the seats, but only around 1,200 of them.

There are affordable Android phones, and then there are Android Go phones. Android Go devices are designed to be as cheap as possible and run a special version of Android that's created specifically with lower-end specs in mind. These are the best Android Go phones, which can be great starter or backup phones, including the Ulefone Note 7 as our top overall pick.
- Best Overall: Ulefone Note 7
- Best for Carriers: Nokia 1.3
- Best for Photography: Alcatel 1
- Best Storage: Samsung Galaxy J2 Core
- Best Design: ZTE Blade L8
- Best in Europe: Nokia 1 Plus
1. Ulefone Note 7: Best Overall
The best Android Go phone is one you probably haven't heard of before, but we think it's the best overall choice, all things considered. It's the Ulefone Note 7, and it's a pretty impressive handset when you factor in the price tag.
Right off the bat, the Ulefone Note 7 stands out thanks to its design. Its 6.1-inch display has incredibly slim bezels and a waterdrop notch on the top for its 5MP selfie camera. Compared to the other phones on this list, it really is something. You'll also find an impressive array of three cameras on the back, allowing for a ton of shooting possibilities.
Specs-wise, the Ulefone Note 7 is offering a 3,500 mAh battery, 16GB of expandable storage (up to 64GB), 1GB of RAM, and dual SIM slots if you want to use two phone numbers at once. We also appreciate the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and face unlock functionality. Even better, you get a free case with the phone!
Pros:
- Modern waterdrop display
- Triple rear cameras
- Very generous 3,500 mAh battery
- Storage is expandable up to 64GB
- Comes with a free case
Cons:
Best Overall
Ulefone Note 7
This is the one to get
Overall, the Ulefone Note 7 stands out as the best Android Go phone. It has a modern design, a huge battery, and more.
2. Nokia 1.3: Best for Carriers
HMD Global hosts a lot of options if you're interested in the best cheap Android phone, and the Nokia 1.3 is a continuation of those efforts in the entry-level segment. The phone comes with Android 10 (Go Edition) out of the box, has a large 5.7-inch HD+ screen with a waterdrop cutout and slim bezels, and a generous 3,000mAh battery.
You also get an 8MP camera at the back, 1GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, a microSD slot that accommodates up to 400GB of storage, and the Qualcomm 215 platform delivers reliable performance. HMD says that the device is ready for Android 11, with an update rolling out once the Go edition of Android 11 becomes available.
The design itself follows Nokia's minimal industrial design aesthetic, and you get a 3.5mm headphone jack here. The best part about the Nokia 1.3 is that it is available officially in the U.S., and works with T-Mobile, AT&T, and a wide variety of MVNOs.
Pros:
- HD+ display with small bezels
- 16GB of internal storage
- All-day 3,000mAh battery
- Android 10 (Go Edition) out of the box
Cons:
Best for Carriers
Nokia 1.3
The ideal option for MVNOs
If you're on an MVNO or need an entry-level phone for use with a major carrier, the Nokia 1.3 is the ideal choice.
3. Alcatel 1: Best for Photography
Alcatel is also in the Android Go game, and its latest offering is the Alcatel 1. The 5-inch display is great for one-handed use, but compared to the Ulefone Note 7, the bezels are noticeably larger. You get 8GB of storage out of the box, and while it's excellent that Alcatel allows you to expand it with a microSD card, we wish it went beyond the 32GB maximum.
Although it may sound silly to say this for a phone that costs as little as the Alcatel 1 does, the real draw to this phone is its camera experience. You get a 5MP rear camera and 2MP selfie camera, and while there's nothing special about the sensors themselves, Alcatel's packed a ton of features into the phone's camera app. There's a Photo Booth mode that captures four pictures over three seconds in a photo booth-like setup. Also, there's an Instant Collage function that helps you easily create a collage of your photos and a One-Handed Mode that brings all of the camera's controls down to the bottom section of the display.
The Alcatel 1 is available in a trio of colors (Black, Blue, and Gold) and supports 4G LTE connectivity. Do keep in mind that this is an international device, meaning that it doesn't come with a warranty and might have some connection issues in rural areas or crowded buildings.
Pros:
- Modern 18:9 display
- Tons of camera features
- Expandable storage
- 4G LTE support
- Available in multiple colors
Cons:
Best for Photography
Alcatel 1
Take great photos on the cheap
The Alcatel 1 is loaded with all sorts of features and settings in its camera app, making it a great pick for shutterbugs.
4. Samsung Galaxy J2 Core: Best Storage
Samsung is one of the most popular phone makers out there, and it hasn't ignored the Android Go market. The Galaxy J2 Core is the Samsung-made Android Go phone we recommend you get, with its biggest perk being a large amount of expandable storage.
Similar to most Android Go devices, the Galaxy J2 Core only has 8GB of onboard storage. However, you can use a microSD card to expand it up to an impressive 256GB. That's more than enough space for all of your favorite movies, music, games, and more, making this an excellent choice for anyone that likes to store all of their files locally.
Outside of the excellent storage, the J2 Core also shines with its clean design, three available colors, and 2,600 mAh battery. As long as you don't mind the missing warranty and weaker LTE coverage in rural parts of the country, the Galaxy J2 Core is a robust Android Go option.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Storage
Samsung Galaxy J2 Core
Plenty of space for all your files
Need to save a lot of apps, games, and movies on your phone? The Galaxy J2 Core's expandable storage up to 256GB has you covered.
5. ZTE Blade L8: Best Design
ZTE creates a lot of low-cost Android phones, so it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that the company has an Android Go offering. The ZTE Blade L8 made its debut in April 2019, and it packs quite the punch.
The thing that helps the phone stand out the most is its design. While it is made out of plastic-like all of the other phones on this list, the reflective backside allows it to shimmer and shine when light hits it. It's also available in two colors, including a sleek black and gorgeous blue.
Powering the Blade L8 is a quad-core processor, 1GB of RAM, and a 2,000 mAh battery. You get 16GB of storage right out of the box, and if you need to, you can expand it up to 128GB with a microSD card. There's also an 8MP rear camera along with a 5MP front-facing camera for all of your selfies.
This is another international phone, and as previously mentioned, the biggest downside to this is the fact that the ZTE Blade L8 does not come with an official warranty in the U.S.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Design
ZTE Blade L8
An eye-catching option
Stand out of the crowd with the ZTE Blade L8, featuring a reflective back that's available in two gorgeous colors.
6. Nokia 1 Plus: Best in Europe
Last but certainly not least, we have the Nokia 1 Plus. It's a fantastic entry in the Android Go family, but unfortunately, you can't buy it in the U.S.
Should you happen to live in Europe or another market where the phone is sold, then you're in for a real treat. The Nokia 1 Plus delivers a large 5.45-inch display, an 8MP rear camera, and a "3D Nano-pattern polycarbonate shell" that looks outstanding.
Also offered with the phone is 1GB of RAM, 8GB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 128GB, and a 2,500 mAh battery. You're getting a lot of bang-for-your-buck, so if you're able to purchase the Nokia 1 Plus, it's definitely a phone worth checking out.
Pros:
- Textured plastic back
- Large 5.45-inch display
- Relatively slim bezels
- 8MP rear camera
- 2,500 mAh battery
Cons:
Best in Europe
Nokia 1 Plus
Live in Europe? Get this
If you happen to live in Europe, you owe it to yourself to check out the Nokia 1 Plus. This thing is an insane value.
Bottom line
We don't think you can go wrong with any of the phones on this list, but if we had to pick just one to recommend, it would be the Ulefone Note 7.
Compared to a lot of other Android Go phones out there, we have to give Ulefone a lot of credit for the Note 7's modern design. This does not look like a phone that costs as little as it does, and that's largely due to the bezel-lite display and three rear cameras on the back. Looks aren't everything, but they sure do help.
The Note 7 isn't packed with the most impressive specs in the world, but there's plenty here to ensure you have a reliable day-to-day experience. The 3,500 mAh battery should allow for excellent endurance, having a microSD card slot for expandable storage is always appreciated, and the fingerprint sensor makes it easy to log into your sensitive apps. For the price Ulefone is asking, the Note 7 is a smash hit.

- On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile officially completed its merger with Sprint.
- "The New T-Mobile," is the name of the joined brands, but it will continue to operate as "T-Mobile."
- John Legere is stepping down as CEO ahead of schedule, handing the reins over to Mike Sievert.
Back in June 2018, it was announced that T-Mobile and Sprint would be joining forces and come together as one carrier. It's been a long and bumpy ride since that initial announcement video, but now on April 1, 2020, the deal is finally completed.
The completion of the merger was confirmed in a press release on T-Mobile's blog, with the company saying:
T-Mobile US Inc. announced today that it has officially completed its merger with Sprint Corporation to create the New T-Mobile, a supercharged Un-carrier that will deliver a transformative 5G network.
Business will continue under the T-Mobile name we already have, along with the company's stock still trading as TMUS.
In addition to this merger finally going in the books as a done deal, today also marks John Legere's departure as CEO of T-Mobile. Legere announced he would be leaving the company on April 30, but with the merger now complete, he's taking off ahead of schedule. As expected, former COO Mike Sievert is T-Mobile's new CEO effective immediately.
Effective immediately, Sievert will assume the role of CEO of T-Mobile. Legere, who served as CEO of T-Mobile since 2012, built a culture around listening to employees, putting the customer first and shaking up the market with signature Un-carrier moves.
As you might expect, combining two of the nation's top wireless providers is a move that comes with a lot of money. As noted in today's press release:
The enhanced scale and financial strength of the combined company will drive a planned investment of $40 billion into its network, business and more over the next three years. Synergies achieved from the integration have the potential to unlock massive scale and unleash at least $43 billion in value for shareholders.
Seeing as how T-Mobile and Sprint were given a thumbs up by the feds back in February, today's announcement doesn't come as a surprise. That said, it still marks a major shift in the U.S. wireless space as we go from four top players down to three.
The coming months and years are bound to be immensely interesting, so buckle up.
Best T-Mobile Phones in 2020The release of a new Samsung phone is exciting for a few different reasons. Along with all of the new specs, features, and software updates, it's also a time for Samsung to show off its latest creations for new colors! The Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra continue this trend with a handful of new designs, and they look outstanding.
- Star of the show: Mystic Bronze
- Gorgeous green: Mystic Green
- The basic choice: Mystic Gray
- Hidden in plain sight: Mystic Black
- Pure as can be: Mystic White
Star of the show: Mystic Bronze
Mystic Bronze is Samsung's flagship color for the Note 20, offering it for both models and prominently featuring it in marketing materials. It's an incredibly striking aesthetic, giving the Note 20 a distinct look without being too gaudy or distracting. It strikes a great balance among all of the colors offered this year, and given that plus its wide availability, it's our color of choice for the series.
Gorgeous green: Mystic Green
If you prefer your phone colors to be more boastful, you'll want to turn your attention towards the Galaxy Note 20 in Mystic Green. This fun and playful hue is only available for the regular Note 20, meaning if you want the Ultra, you're out of luck. Mystic Green has a cool, refreshing essence to it that we absolutely love, and it's a wonderful alternative to the Glacial Green color for the OnePlus 8. More green phones, please!
The basic choice: Mystic Gray
On the complete opposite end of the color spectrum, we have Mystic Gray. Where Mystic Green is an attention-grabbing color that wants to be the star of the show, Mystic Gray is subdued by design and isn't particularly noteworthy. It's perfectly fine if you aren't a fan of super bright colors, and for that purpose, it's a great choice. Just be aware that it's only available for the Note 20.
Hidden in plain sight: Mystic Black
For those of you that want a basic color choice but would rather get the Ultra, we have Mystic Black. There's nothing very exciting or interesting about this color, but if you're someone that prefers sleek and subdued phones, it gets the job done. It looks professional, doesn't attract a lot of attention towards itself, and it's available for the Note 20 Ultra exclusively. There's not much else to say, and that's just fine.
Pure as can be: Mystic White
Bringing up the rear is Mystic White, a color that's available exclusively for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. White phones are nothing new, but we do have to give Samsung credit for making Mystic White as pure and stark of a white as you can get. Mystic White is a bit more interesting than the basic and boring Mystic Black, yet it's still more restrained than Mystic Bronze or Green. If you're looking for a nice middle ground, this is it.

Galaxy Note 20 in Mystic Bronze
Who is it for?
Mystic Bronze is the Note 20 color that Samsung is really pushing this year, and if you're looking to spruce up the look of your phone without going overboard, this is the one to get. Mystic Bronze manages to look ultra-sophisticated while also having a bit of fun, and of all the bronze colorways we've seen over the years, this is definitely one of the best.
What makes Mystic Bronze even better is the fact that you can get it for the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra. So, regardless of which phone you want, you can ensure it comes in a great-looking color.
Galaxy Note 20 in Mystic Green
Who is it for?
The other standout color this year is Mystic Green, which is every bit as gorgeous. Green phones aren't something we see all that often, so we're thrilled that Samsung is featuring the color here. It's a sort of minty/pastel shade of green, and the end result is a truly unique color that'll make sure you stand out from the crowd.
Unfortunately, Samsung only offers Mystic Green for the Note 20 and not the flagship Note 20 Ultra. That's a darn shame, because if you like colorful phones, Mystic Green is one of the nicest hues currently available.
Galaxy Note 20 in Mystic Gray
Who is it for?
Rounding out colors for the regular Galaxy Note 20, we have Mystic Gray. This is the color you get if Mystic Bronze and Green are too much to handle for your personal taste, and it's a nice way to round out the collection. The color itself isn't especially interesting, but we're glad that Samsung has it available for shoppers that are put off by the other choices.
You can only get Mystic Gray for the Note 20, and if you want the Note 20 Ultra in a more neutral color, our next pick is for you.
Galaxy Note 20 in Mystic Black
Who is it for?
There's not much to say about Mystic Black, other than the fact that it's a black phone. There aren't any fun colors for the buttons or S Pen — everything about the package is black. Some may call that boring, but for others, this may be exactly what you're looking for. The Mystic Black Note 20 is stealthy, discrete, and allows you to focus on the task at hand without being distracted by anything else.
If you want Mystic Black for yourself, keep in mind that it's only offered for the Note 20 Ultra.
Galaxy Note 20 in Mystic White
Who is it for?
Last but not least, we have Mystic White. It's not as intense as Mystic Bronze, but it's also not quite as bland as Mystic Black. It sits somewhere right in the middle, and for you, it could be the color to get. The sheer simplicity offered by Mystic White sure is unlike any of the other available colors, making it another great addition to the Note 20 family.
Similar to Mystic Black, however, Mystic White can only be had if you splurge for the more expensive Note 20 Ultra.

Samsung's Galaxy Note 20 is a mighty capable phone, giving you a Snapdragon 865+ processor, three rear cameras, a large battery, and the iconic S Pen. The phone also comes in a bunch of great colors, ranging from the sophisticated Mystic Bronze to the more colorful Mystic Green.

Dropping the Note 20 Ultra would be a disaster. Protect it with a case!
Whether you prefer a heavy-duty case or a thin and shiny variety that catches the light just right, there's a great Note 20 Ultra case out there for everyone.The Oculus Quest is a fantastic new way to play your favorite VR games. It's also a great way to play all your favorite PC games, even if that requires extra setup. There are several different apps that can be used to do the job, but we've highlighted two of our favorites. One is completely free, while the other offers an enhanced experience for a minor cost.
Products used in this guide
Note: By following our guide, you can create a gigantic digital display to enjoy all your favorite games on. However, Virtual Desktop does not support crossbuy between versions, so you have to make sure you purchase the Oculus Quest version of the app, which can be found here.
The best quality: Virtual Desktop
Virtual Desktop might cost money but it's, by far, the best way to play PC games on your Oculus Quest wirelessly. It's not just about compatibility or ease, but also overall quality. As of this writing, Virtual Desktop provides superior wireless quality when compared to anything else on the market.
First, you will need to purchase Virtual Desktop for your Oculus Quest. Make sure you buy this from the Quest store., and not the Rift store.
Next, download and install the Virtual Desktop Streamer on your desktop on the Virtual Desktop website.
- Make sure both your PC and your Quest are connected on the same Wi-Fi network.
- Open Virtual Desktop on your Quest.
- It will provide you with your Oculus username (if you didn't already have it handy).
- Open Virtual Desktop Streamer on your Desktop and it will prompt you for your Oculus username.
Enter your username.
Once you have Virtual Desktop Streamer running, your desktop will show up in the Virtual Desktop app on your Quest. Voila! You can now use your Quest as a humongous desktop screen.
If you've followed these steps, you will be able to enjoy all your favorite PC games through your Quest. Traditional flat-screen games will be played on a giant virtual monitor within the Virtual Desktop space, while PC VR games (on SteamVR or Oculus) will work exactly as you would expect in VR. Since Virtual Desktop works off of your local wifi, there is little to no lag, making it perfect for gaming.
Hosting your own room with Bigscreen Beta
Bigscreen Beta is the best way to experience gaming with friends, making it feel more like everyone is in the same room playing together. I've used Bigscreen on several occasions to host virtual LAN parties, which is a lot easier to organize than trying to get several adults in the same household just to game. To use your PC's desktop in Bigscreen on the Oculus Quest, you'll first need to start the Bigscreen in client mode on your PC.
Make sure Bigscreen is installed on your computer. If you don't have Bigscreen installed, you can find it on the Steam store or on the Oculus Store.
- Launch Steam or the Oculus desktop experience and find the Bigscreen Beta entry.
- Right click on the listing and select Run Remote Desktop steaming client.
On the Oculus Store, you may need to select the hamburger menu next to the Bigscreen Beta listing and then select Run desktop client mode.
- A dialog box will appear with the room information.
- Now you can put the Oculus Quest on your head
Open up Bigscreen from the Library portion of your Oculus Quest home screen.
- From your virtual couch, select the My Room tab at the bottom of the floating home menu.
Click Remote Desktop in the Tools & Toys section.
- Jot down the code you see here and enter it in the Room ID box on your desktop computer.
Click Connect when you're done. Be sure to send this code to any friends you want to join in and then put your Oculus Quest back on.
You'll now notice that Remote Desktop shows up as a participant in the Social portion of the home menu from within Bigscreen. That lets you know you're successfully connected to your desktop.
- Clicking Remote Desktop in the Social window will give you options to toggle desktop video, which hides your desktop from other viewers, as well as your microphone and your desktop's volume level.
- Selecting Remote Desktop under the Tools & Toys section will give you additional options for displaying your desktop to the other folks in the room.
The large TV in front of you in Bigscreen works exactly the same as the monitor hooked up to your PC. Your entire desktop computer is displayed here and can be navigated as you would normally navigate your PC. Use the pointer on your controller as you would a mouse on a PC. Once your friends are in the room, use this monitor to navigate your desktop and load up any videos or games you want to enjoy. It's like having a customizable, floating monitor for your computer right in front of your face!
Something for every situation
While both of these choices are fantastic, they each represent a different goal at the end of the day. Virtual Desktop aims to recreate the seated desktop experience in every way and, surprisingly, even offers the absolute best in wireless VR experiences. That means you can play PC VR games, like Half-Life: Alyx, wirelessly on your Oculus Quest. It provides the best experience, with no perceivable lag, excellent quality, and perfect compatibility with both SteamVR and the desktop Oculus experience.
Bigscreen is best when playing traditional flat-screen games with friends. It provides an amazing virtual space to make you feel like you're gaming together in the same room.

- Samsung's Galaxy Watch 3 will now be able to double as your ECG monitor.
- The company announced FDA approval at launch, and a new ECG Monitor app will roll out from today.
- It's also coming to the Galaxy Watch Active 2.
The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 is getting ECG support today, Samsung announced. The company had already said it planned on adding the feature later to its health-focused smartwatch at launch, and today's the day.
You'll be able to take readings through the new ECG Monitor app — accessible through the Samsung Health Monitor app on Galaxy phones only. You'll measure ECG readings right from your Galaxy Watch and have the Monitor app class them as either sinus rhythm or AFib. Samsung will also let you tack on additional notes top the readings via the Monitor app. If you're feeling dizzy and you get an AFib reading, for example, you may want to make a note of that for a doctor's appointment or similar.
Samsung is also rolling out the update to last year's Galaxy Watch Active 2, addressing a user pain point.
Reviewing the Galaxy Watch 3 in August, Android Central's Hayato Huseman concluded:
Put simply, if you're willing to shell out the cash, the Galaxy Watch 3 is the best smartwatch you can pair to an Android phone. It's equal parts gorgeous and functional, and its collection of health-focused features put it in direct competition with the likes of brands like Garmin and Apple. The rotating bezel is undoubtedly the best (and most fun) way to interact with a smartwatch without obfuscating the screen, and Samsung's Tizen OS is fluid, responsive, and well-tailored for the circular display.
The addition of ECG support today now makes it more appealing for the health-conscious.

To better track your health
Full of health-focused features, the Galaxy Watch 3 is primed to do its best to help you keep an eye on all of your personal wellness needs. From tracking basics like steps to automatic workout detection and ECG, you'll know just where you stand healthwise.

- Full Throttle is the 13th scene for Pistol Whip and features increased difficulty over past scenes.
- Scene Events are a new type of scripted even in Pistol Whip that future levels will be able to take advantage of.
- Two new modifiers, three new guns, as well as new skins and metal are also making an appearance in this update.
- Full Throttle will be featured in the upcoming Pistol Whip tournament.
A brand new scene is making its debut in the March update of Pistol Whip, and it's the most difficult scene yet to grace the theater walls in Pistol Whip. Lucky scene number 13 is entitled Full Throttle and takes some heavy inspiration from the Mad Max series; maybe a timely release given the current bleak times we live in. Full Throttle throws players into the desert amidst vehicular mayhem with the patented formula of shooting, dodging, and pistol-whipping any opponent that gets in their way.
But Full Throttle isn't just the most difficult scene Cloudhead Games has ever made for Pistol Whip, it's also the first scene to incorporate "scene events", which Cloudhead games describes as "a new way for us to add synchronized animations to scenes for spectacular flair." Aside from the brilliant new scene, Pistol Whip players can now utilize two new modifiers, Scavenger and One-and-Done, to change up the gameplay and make things more challenging for those returning playthroughs.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
The first, One-and-Done, makes things a bit easier on players by turning all enemies into one-shot kills, including enemies with armor. Scavenger, on the other hand, turns the tides and makes things a lot harder for players by requiring a pistol whip to reload. That means unless you're good at melee-killing enemies, you'll be running out of bullets in no time flat. The idea here is that pistol-whipping an enemy steals their ammo, helping better fill out the concept for the bonus points you get when pistol-whipping an enemy.
Lastly is the new Tac-Ops weapon collection, which adds three new pistols to the game. Pistols have always been cosmetic in Pistol Whip, and that doesn't change here, with five new wraps for guns, three new colors, and three new metals, including gold. There's even a new slappy sound effects option that's inspired by the pistol in Half-Life 2.
Full Throttle is the second update after Cloudhead Games announced they'd be delivering monthly updates for their best-selling VR title. There are two more free updates scheduled, one in April, and the last one in May. Presumably, after May, updates will be a paid-DLC type of program but no details have been announced regarding updates past May. Full Throttle will be making its way to this weekend's $10,000 prize-packed Pistol Whip tournament, which you can still sign up for and take part in at home.What you need to know
- Samsung will begin keeping its phones updated with three years of OS updates.
- Samsung's latest phones, the Galaxy S20 and Note 20 series, will get updated to Android 13.
- The process will begin with the Galaxy S10, ensuring that the 2019 models get Android 12.
At its virtual Unpacked event today, Samsung announced that it would begin offering "three generations" of updates to its Samsung Galaxy phones. This means that newer devices like the Galaxy S20 and Note 20 series will likely get updated to Android 11, Android 12, and Android 13, along with three years of accompanying monthly or quarterly security patches. The promise goes back one generation to the Galaxy S10 line, which will get updated to Android 12 (since it started its life on Android 9 Pie).
Currently, most Samsung flagship phones get two OS updates and two years of monthly security patches, moving to quarterly patches in the third year. We awarded the company a B- during our latest Update Report Card for that reason.

The Note 20 will ship with One UI 2.5 when it launches on August 21, a minor update over the existing One UI 2.1 that's currently on the S20 series. Among other features, it will also support Android gestures in third-party launchers.
It's not clear when Samsung will update its 2020 lineup to Android 11, but Google is expected to release it to Pixel devices on September 8. It usually takes a few months for Samsung to port over One UI to the new version; it took until January 2020 for the S10 and Note 10 lineup to receive Android 10, for instance.

Whether you are expanding an existing Google or Nest Wifi mesh or building one from scratch, Google Wifi is still a great choice, although if you have the cash we recommend going with Nest for faster speeds.
- True mesh Wifi: Google Wifi System ($99 at Amazon)
- Same family but faster: Nest Wifi ($168 at Amazon)
Why mesh?
The traditional way to get Wi-Fi in your home was to purchase a router, complete with long black antennas, then place it next to your modem. It was nearly impossible to get your coverage needs just right and it became even more challenging with modern 5GHz Wi-Fi, which is more susceptible to interference. A mesh system utilizes multiple smaller routers working in tandem to cover a greater area with Wi-Fi that can grow to fit any home's needs.
Google Wifi is a true mesh system. All its points communicate with one another to form a cohesive network instead of reporting back to one device that acts as the main router. Each Google Wifi router can cover up to 1,500 square feet. You can use a single Google Wifi device to set up a network for a small area like an apartment, but the system flourishes with multiple Google Wifi points. Each Google Wifi also has two Ethernet ports so you can still get your wired devices connected.
You can buy Google Wifi individually or in packs of three, depending on how large an area you need to cover. You're also free to add in more Google Wifi routers if you find you need more coverage down the road.
The Google advantage
Mesh systems need to work efficiently to provide a consistent Wi-Fi experience to all connected devices. One key part of the equation is the software and that is where Google shines. Google provides consistent and timely software updates that not only help connectivity but include fixes to possible security vulnerabilities when needed. This is all handled automatically so there's no need to jump into the app all the time.
Speaking of the app, you must use an Android or iOS device with the Google Home app to set up your mesh network. You will also need a Google Account which can be freely made. This is also how you can add additional routers to your mesh if you find the need down the line.
It's worth keeping in mind that the Google Wifi ecosystem also includes the Nest Wifi router and Nest Wifi point, which are newer and slightly faster components. If you are going to mix and match Nest Wifi and Google Wifi routers, you should have your faster Nest components more towards the center of your network with Google Wifi filling in lower priority areas.
The standard Google Wifi is a capable dual-band router with speeds up to AC1200. This is more than enough for most users but it's worth keeping in mind that the Nest Wifi router is faster at AC2200. This will mainly be a concern for people with a fast internet connection such as a gigabit fiber connection.
Wi-Fi 6 and futureproofing
Google Wifi is still quite capable but there's no getting around that it is one of the slower mesh systems on sale today. While many people will be well served since it should be more than capable of delivering ultra-fast web browsing and even 4K video. Download speeds will be compromised compared to other routers such as the Nest Wifi router.
Both of these systems only support the older 802.11ac or Wi-Fi 5 protocol.
Wi-Fi 6 is faster and more efficient than Wi-Fi 5, which makes it better equipped to handle the growing number of connected devices in our homes than the current standard. Most competing companies are already starting to offer Wi-Fi 6 based mesh systems and going with this newer technology will allow for higher speed but it comes at a significantly higher cost. For most people today, the speeds offered by Google Wifi or its big brother Nest Wifi will be more than enough for several more years.

- Untethered VR experience: Oculus Quest (From $399 on Amazon)
VR durability
The Oculus Quest will expose many new users to VR. As such, consumers should be aware of the limits of their new headsets in order to prevent damage. In many ways, VR headsets are designed to be quite durable. The outer shells are typically a durable plastic, which may collect dings and scratches, but will stand up to general accidents. In other ways, they can be extremely delicate.
In regards to the Quest, the headset is an all-in-one device instead of relying on a PC, so it may often be used in unfamiliar areas. It could be susceptible to more damage than a headset confined to your at-home playspace. This begs the question, can it survive a fall? If you dropped it off of a tall building, it most likely is not going to survive. But, let's take a look into more of the every-day accidents that a VR user might experience.
How far is too far?
Most damage a new user will likely inflict on the headset would be crashing into things. Sometimes getting into a virtual space can be very jarring to a new user, and you should expect some level of disorientation to begin. Since the device is not tethered, you will have a greatly increased range of motion compared to a headset tethered to a PC. This might even involve rolling or doing flips for the athletically inclined.
Considering other types of accidents, such as dropping the device while taking it out or putting it away, the major concern for the Quest is the cameras to track your controllers. The Quest relies on the Oculus Insight tracking system, which uses the four cameras on the sides to map your playspace and controllers. Since the cameras are exposed, it wouldn't take a lot to damage them. The camera spaces are recessed a bit, so these should keep them relatively safe from a direct drop, but if they hit a corner or something sharp, they could be damaged. To avoid this, be very careful while handling the device, and be sure it is properly strapped to your head when in use.
Another consideration is how a drop or impact could affect the internal components. A VR headset is essentially a delicate screen with equally delicate lenses in front of it, all encased in a plastic shell. While the screen and lenses are secured, it's always possible they could shake loose or become otherwise damaged if dropped hard enough. Like any piece of hardware, it should be treated carefully. Just because it could survive a drop, doesn't mean you should drop it.
Getting in touch with Oculus for repairs
Should you find yourself needing to repair your Quest, you can submit a support ticket here to get in touch with Oculus Support. Submitting the ticket takes just a couple of minutes, and once you send it off, Oculus says you can expect a response within one to two business days.

The next stage of VR
The Oculus Quest is the newest all-in-one VR device to take your gaming on the go. It requires no PC and no cables, so you are completely untethered! This is the first truly standalone VR gaming experience.

Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!Best Antivirus Software Android Central 2020
Here are nine of the best antivirus software solutions currently available. Bitdefender Antivirus Plus gets my top vote this year, but I've thoroughly tested and have no problems recommending each of these programs. The first time I tested the software five years ago, I was very impressed with how fast Bitdefender recognized malware and stopped it before it even had the chance to start downloading. Plus, rather than automatically placing them in quarantine, Bitdefender completely removes most threats from your system the moment they are recognized.
- Best Overall: Bitdefender Antivirus Plus
- Another Good Option: Kaspersky Total Security
- Best Basic Antivirus: VIPRE Advanced Security
- Best Free Antivirus: Avast Free Antivirus
- Best with a VPN: McAfee Total Security
- Best with ID Protection: Norton 360 with LifeLock
- Best for Banking: Trend Micro Antivirus + Security
- Best for Current Infections: Malwarebytes
- Best Computer Backup: Acronis True Image 2021
Best Antivirus Overall: Bitdefender Antivirus Plus
Bitdefender consistently earns high or perfect scores for malware protection from several third-party test labs and in my own tests. It deserves our top spot for the best antivirus software. It stops Trojans, rootkits, ransomware, and worms, and with the safe browser extension enabled, it'll prevent these threats from entering your computer through the internet. Bitdefender also recognizes phishing schemes and will warn you of them. With safe browsing enabled, it'll also tag search results as safe to click through or not. When I tested Bitdefender, it recognized websites known to harbor malicious files and links and would block the entire website from being accessed.
Even though Antivirus Plus is Bitdefender's basic solution, it still comes with a password manager and secure file shredder. It also has social network protections that keep an eye on activity on social media pages, letting you know if there is a malicious link that's been shared. Antivirus Plus also has a vulnerability scanner that looks for weak points in your entire system and helps you secure these against hackers and ransomware. Some of these vulnerabilities include corrupted drives and outdated software programs. Bitdefender gives you safe links where you can download patches and new versions of software, so you don't need to guess if links found online are legitimate or not.
The biggest tool not included with Bitdefender Antivirus Plus is a personal firewall. While your operating system likely comes with one, I've seen during testing that having a second layer of protection is vital. There are too many threats that make their way through standard firewalls, and those included with antivirus software just do an overall better job. Bitdefender's higher-tiered program, Bitdefender Total Security, does include a firewall, along with parental controls and a device optimizer.
The other setback of Bitdefender is how long it takes to complete scans, both vulnerability and virus scans. Where other programs take a few minutes, it's not uncommon for Bitdefender to take up to 40 minutes for some scans, 50-80% longer than most other antivirus software.

Bitdefender Antivirus Plus
Stopping attacks before they happen
Bitdefender stops malware before it has a chance to download and immediately scrubs it from your device.
Another Good Option: Kaspersky Total Security
Kaspersky Total Security is the program I have installed on my personal computer. It is so lightweight that I hardly remember I have it running in the background, and the protection I get is near perfect. I confidently browse the web and download files because I know if there is anything dangerous, Kaspersky will block the download or warn me not to continue. If something does get through, Kaspersky gathers it up and removes it from my system before it has a chance to infect it. If you are looking for a lightweight solution, Kaspersky is certainly one of the best antivirus software solutions.
One tool Kaspersky has that the other antivirus programs don't is a virtual keyboard. When active, this allows you to type anything and have it guarded against keyloggers, trackers, and snoops. If you type into a search bar, the information isn't recorded, and if you use this virtual keyboard when entering in login information or credit card numbers, these, too, will be shielded.
I'm also impressed with Kaspersky's parental controls for both computers and mobile devices. I can lock down devices remotely, block websites and apps, and set time limits for when my children can and can't be online. I can also decide how many hours a day they can be online, and when that limit is up, Kaspersky is the bad guy and blocks internet access on any device. Kaspersky Total Protection also includes an encrypted vault to secure files from ransomware and a firewall that keeps an eye on your internet connection and safe browsing that warns of dangerous websites and phishing schemes.
Many are uneasy about trusting Kaspersky because of accusations that it used its antivirus programs to gather classified information from U.S. government agencies and their workers' devices then funneled this information to the Russian government. While the U.S. government no longer uses Kaspersky security programs on its computers, it is safe for consumers to use it. In a move to show good faith, Kaspersky moved all operations out of Russia and into other countries, including the U.K., U.S., and Turkey, where they are subject to privacy laws and third-party inspections.

Quietly keeping guard for malware
Kaspersky works quickly to stop malware and doesn't use many resources, so you don't experience any slowdown.
Best Basic Antivirus: VIPRE Advanced Security
For a basic antivirus software program that doesn't use many resources or overwhelm with too many extra features, I recommend VIPRE. This program does a great job stopping malicious files during the download process and quarantining the threat before it has a chance to infect your computer. VIPRE also monitors your emails and will quarantine messages it suspects has malicious links or attachments. This allows you to open the messages safely and then decide to either keep or toss it.
Another reason I'm impressed with VIPRE is that it includes a firewall. This is the single most important tool after malware protection that should be included as part of your overall system security. VIPRE's firewall watches your internet connection and all the communications coming in and going out. This is an excellent way to keep hackers and other snoops from sneaking in, especially on public Wi-Fi that is less secure than home or work networks.
Because it is so basic, VIPRE doesn't use a lot of your resources. While testing VIPRE, I could easily keep surfing the web, watching online videos, playing games, downloading files, and sending emails without any noticeable slowdown.
VIPRE does require a little bit of learning to get the hang of navigating its dashboard. It isn't laid out like most other solutions, and some tools are difficult to locate. However, everything you need to enable can be done from the dashboard, including enabling safe browser extensions.

No frills, but powerful protection
VIPRE doesn't come with a lot, but protections against threats nearly perfectly and includes a vital firewall.
Best Free Antivirus: Avast Free Antivirus
Several antivirus programs offer free solutions, but Avast is by far the best in this area. Avast Free Antivirus is chalked full of extra features, like a password manager and home network security. It even includes a VPN to hide your online identity from adware and trackers. Avast's dashboard is easy to navigate, and it doesn't take long to figure out where each tool is and how to set them to your personal preferences.
My favorite feature of Avast, and the reason it's installed on some of my children's devices, is its automatic gamer mode. This tool recognizes when you visit an online gaming site and automatically redirects some resources away from non-critical functions so you can play without experiencing slowdown or being interrupted by popup notifications. Avast will still keep an eye on your computer and stop threats, and it will notify you if you attempt to download a game or visit a dangerous website.
While testing Avast, I observed that this program waits until malicious files are nearly downloaded before snatching the threat and quarantining it. This is different from Bitdefender and Kaspersky that doesn't allow the download process even to start, but it is still very efficient at blocking threats from attacking. Avast earns above-average scores for malware protection in both my book and from other third-party labs.
Because it is a free program, Avast does have several pop-up ads that will get in the way each time you start your computer, open the dashboard, and a few times in between. The only ways to avoid these ads are to either enable the gamer mode or purchase a paid program from Avast. Avast's Premium Security is just as good at stopping malware from infecting your computers but also extends this protection to other devices connected to your home network, including smart TVs, game consoles, and even your internet router. Premium Security also includes webcam monitoring.

Best with a VPN: McAfee Total Security
McAfee has worked hard over the last several years to overcome some significant setbacks. For many years it wasn't known as a great program. It used a ton of resources that created a frustrating lag. Now McAfee is so good it often finds itself in the top spot as one of the best, most efficient antivirus solutions. The last couple of years testing McAfee, I've seen McAfee earn perfect, or near-perfect, scores for malware protection every time. While it does create some slowdown, it isn't enough to interfere with most functions. There is noticeably more slowdown when installed on mobile devices compared to PC or Mac computers.
Everything you need to secure you and your family's devices is included with this program, including encrypted online storage and protections for cryptocurrency accounts. This antivirus program has a secured VPN that blocks your online identity, so it's more difficult for your online activities to be traced or for your digital identity stolen. It also includes a firewall and a system scanner that looks for vulnerabilities and ways to optimize your system, so it works faster.
McAfee Total Protection has a lot of tools that are helpful for families. The webcam monitoring ensures no person or program taps into your computer without permission. It also has excellent parental controls with content filters to make it easy to block inappropriate content. You can also set time controls that will boot your child off the internet after their screen time is up, or during critical times of the day like dinner time or when kids should be asleep.
Pros:
- Included VPN
- Parental controls
- Webcam monitoring
- Protections for cryptocurrency accounts
- Included firewall

Best with ID Protection: Norton 360 with LifeLock
Norton has been a staple in the antivirus industry for a very long time, so it isn't a surprise. It's listed among the best antivirus solutions. What makes Norton 360 invaluable is its partnership with LifeLock to help protect your identity. LifeLock keeps an eye on black markets and alerts you if your email address, birthdate, social security number, or even online account login credentials are illegally sold. It also looks at places not commonly associated with identity theft, such as medical and criminal records. If your identity is stolen, LifeLock will help you recover your identity, including helping you contact the IRS and credit reporting agencies,
Norton 360 has safe browsing tools that tag malicious sites known to have links and phishing schemes hidden on them. Even after a site is taken down, visiting the URL will sometimes trigger a malicious file to download. Norton is one of the few antivirus programs I tested that catches these threats.
This antivirus software comes with a VPN to help hide your online identity, including your devices' IP address and location. This cuts down on targeted ads because it shields you from adware and tracers. Norton also has special banking tools to ensure your personal and financial information is extra secure as your bank and shop online. For example, login credentials and credit card information are shielded from keyloggers.
The biggest reason I don't use Norton is that it caused a very noticeable slowdown on all the personal devices I downloaded it to. This didn't happen during lab tests where there weren't as many programs or apps installed, but on home computers and cell phones, the drag was painfully slow.

Best for Banking: Trend Micro Antivirus + Security
Trend Micro feels like a heavy program from the get-go and is the one program I found difficult to figure out how to use. However, once it was installed and the tools were located, Trend Micro proved to be a very good antivirus solution. This is the one program, through all my years of testing antivirus software, that has scored 100% each time in my tests. While it does create slowdown, it isn't enough for me not to add to my list of the best antivirus software.
This antivirus software has web reputation technology, so it immediately picks up on a legitimate or fake website. If you click a link meant to redirect you to a site made to look like a legitimate one, Trend Micro will block it and warn you of its malicious intent. Trend Micro is also very good at recognizing phishing schemes and dangerous websites.
One of the best tools here is its Pay Guard. This is specifically designed to protect your personal, financial, and account information while you bank and shop online. Pay Guard stores your credit card and bank account numbers in a secured vault, so you don't have to pull out and enter this information during check out. But Pay Guard puts extra protections around your browser, so this information can't be captured or stolen.

Best for Current Infections: Malwarebytes
Sometimes it feels like installing an antivirus program is too much work or costs more than you're willing to invest. While your iOS likely has some antivirus protections included, they aren't foolproof, and viruses and other threats can, and do, sneak in to attack your system. If your computer is running slower, closes browsers and programs without notice, or redirects you to webpages you aren't trying to reach, you're most likely infected. Malware is smart enough to recognize antivirus programs and try to avoid letting you download a good portion of them. However, Malwarebytes is a program that is specifically designed to outsmart viruses and allow you to download it.
Malwarebytes doesn't cost you anything, and the minute it's installed, it starts looking for any threats on your system. Unlike other programs with free malware locating tools on their websites, Malwarebytes doesn't just find threats then leave the removal up to you. Malwarebytes also rounds up the threats, quarantines them, and will permanently remove them, so you don't have to do any of the dirty work.
This program doesn't have real-time protection, so it can't stop future threats. For this, you will need to purchase an antivirus program like Bitdefender. Also, Malwarebytes doesn't recognize, nor stop, most ransomware infections. But overall, it is the best solution for getting rid of threats already downloaded and recking havoc on your computer.

Best Computer Backup: Acronis True Image 2021
Acronis has been well-known for several years as a good solution for storing critical files and information in the cloud. This makes it more difficult for ransomware to lock down your files and hold them until you pay the ransom. Instead, you can reset or scrub your system, then reinstall all your folders and files from Acronis, and your computer will run as though nothing had happened to it. This is also a handy tool to have if your computer crashes because you can install your information to a new one without missing a beat.
Acronis True Image 2021 includes additional cybersecurity features, including virus protection. True Image blocks malware attempting to hide on your computer and will quarantine threats quickly. It recognizes dangerous websites and will warn you about lurking dangers there, too. Third-party testing labs, like AV-Test and AV-Comparatives, don't regularly test how accurate Acronis is at stopping malware, so there isn't a good history to depend on. In my own tests, I was able to see Acronis stop most threats without a problem and round up some hidden on my computers. It also did well blocking malicious websites now to harbor phishing schemes or tainted downloads.
There are some drawbacks to be aware of if you choose to use Acronis. First, though it is cloud-based, it will still use some of your computer's resources to deploy some local tools. While I was still able to work just fine while running Acronis, it did cause just enough lag to notice when navigating to web pages and waiting for videos to load. This wouldn't be a good solution for gamers who need to avoid drag during playtime. Also, a full system scan will take hours to complete. I appreciate how thorough Acronis is, and I didn't experience any more slowdown during the scan. It's just a bummer that it took so long to complete.
Pros:
Cons:
- Not tested as often as other antivirus programs
- Create a little slowdown
- System scans take hours to complete

Here's why Bitdefender is the best
Overall Bitdefender Antivirus Plus is the best antivirus software program because of how quickly and thoroughly it blocks malware. It stops malicious files from even starting the download process. And it marks dangerous websites, blocks phishing schemes, and comes with several extra security tools like a VPN and social media protections that warn of malware links and downloads posted to social media pages.
Bitdefender is also a good value, giving you several user licenses for around the same cost of one from other antivirus programs. It also works on several different devices, so you can use a single program to secure computers and cell phones. Bitdefender's basic antivirus program doesn't come with a firewall, and all its virus scans take a long time to complete. However, because this program doesn't guzzle resources, you can still work on your device during scans without experiencing a slowdown.
Antivirus and data sharing
Avast admitted to capturing and sharing, or even selling, user information with its partners and other consumer companies. It has since discontinued this program, but information gathering is still used by Avast. In fact, every antivirus program, whether it's on PC, Mac, or a mobile device, asks as part of its initial installation and setup process for permission to collect your data and participate in some sort of data sharing program. This doesn't sit well with most people, especially coming from a company that is supposed to secure your information.
The biggest reason for data collection through antivirus programs is to collect information on new and emerging viruses. This information is used to stop new threats that haven't been identified and cataloged in malware databases to be stopped quickly before they can infect more computers. This is a vital part of keeping malicious threats, especially ransomware, from getting out of hand. It also helps antivirus programs "learn" common behaviors so they can stop new threats, also known as zero-day threats, before they can infect a computer. If everyone opted out of data sharing, it wouldn't take long for malware to run rampant.
Another reason for data collecting is for research purposes. The antivirus industry is pretty competitive, with several excellent solutions. As antivirus software collects information about its users, it can create better versions that better fit and serve consumers. Unfortunately, there will always be companies that sell this information for profit. The good thing with antivirus programs is you do have the option not to participate.

We may earn a commission for purchases using our links. Learn more.With every phone launch, OnePlus tries to rebrand itself just a little bit. With the OnePlus 6, it was "The speed you need." The 6T told us to "Unlock the speed." The 7 Pro tried to "Go beyond speed," and the 7T, the company's most recent release, offered us an experience that was "Smooth like never before." This is a company that's always emphasized the tactile advantage of speed and smoothness over all other tenets of using a phone, and has built a veritable movement of highly-loyal and engaged core users as a result.
But the underlying story for OnePlus, the one that was buried below the lede, was about price. Six years ago, the OnePlus One debuted for just $299, a price that surely lost money on each unit for a company whose goal was to build a user base. And it worked — through consistent and predictable price increases over generations, we reached a starting price of $669 for the OnePlus 7 Pro last year, and most people barely blinked. It was still so much less expensive than everything else out there, the value was clear.
The OnePlus 8 Pro is not $669, nor is it $699 or even $799. The cheapest OnePlus 8 Pro is $899, a 34% year-over-year increase over the same phone from a year ago, and puts itself out of the budget category by a wide margin. Instead, OnePlus is trying to flip its traditional narrative on its head, positioning its Pro model as an "ultra-premium" version of the phone — the $699 OnePlus 8 — that most people should, and will, buy.
So that's where we are. The OnePlus 8 Pro now has all the features you expect from an Android phone in the premium space, including a massive primary camera sensor, full IP68 waterproofing, and finally, finally, wireless charging. And in this context, it's still cheaper than the Galaxy S20+ and much better value than the Pixel 4 XL.
Does that mean you should eschew all other phones, pony up the $900 (or $1,000 for the 12GB model) and leave the old days of OnePlus behind? Let's take a look.
Update, April 29: This review was originally published on April 14, but we're updating and circulating it because the OnePlus 8 Pro is now on sale in many countries around the world.
At a glance
OnePlus 8 Pro
Bottom line: The OnePlus 8 Pro is an impressive and well-designed Android smartphone that doesn't upend the traditional OnePlus formula so much as extend it to its logical place in the 2020 canon — more features, higher price. With the addition of an impressive primary camera, waterproofing, and wireless charging, though, OnePlus has finally checked all of the boxes on its spec sheet.
Pros
- Large, beautiful 120Hz display
- Greatly improved main and wide-angle cameras
- Excellent battery life
- OxygenOS is best-in-class Android software
- Wireless charging / IP68 rating now available
Cons
- Much more expensive than before
- Limited 5G compatibility in the U.S.
- Telephoto camera isn't good
- Some software and camera bugs still present
OnePlus 8 Pro Design and display
This phone looks familiar, not just because it resembles the OnePlus 7 Pro from almost every angle, but because it resembles pretty much every major Android phone released this year. The sides of the 6.78-inch AMOLED display slope severely, though no more so than phones from Samsung, Huawei, OPPO, and others. Indeed, even the smaller OnePlus 8 has curved edges this time around, breaking with the flat sides of its ostensible predecessor, the OnePlus 7T.
Perhaps the most notable change on the 8 Pro's front is the addition of the left-oriented hole punch selfie camera cutout, another increasingly common occurrence in phones released in the past few months. The decision is understandable — whereas the 7 Pro's motorized selfie camera was visually awesome and technically impressive, its presence added weight, thickness, and inevitable customer service overhead that OnePlus just didn't want to maintain. Removing it allowed OnePlus to lighten the phone by seven grams while adding a significantly bigger battery that actually makes a difference in day-to-day use. More on that a bit later.

We've already seen all the accolades heralded at the OnePlus 8 Pro's "A+, record-breaking" display. It's bright, it's color-accurate, and it offers never-before-seen low reflectivity levels on an AMOLED display of this size and luminosity. Indeed, using the phone outdoors is a dream. But there's a clear pink hue that shows up when shifting a few degrees off-center, and it's occasionally distracting. That's about the only criticism I have of the screen, though: in every other way, it's practically perfect. It even supports QHD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate — something that Samsung can't, or refuses to, offer.
Let's talk about that 120Hz refresh rate for a minute. This is now the third phone I've used, after the ROG Phone II and the Galaxy S20+, that clocks a refresh rate double that of the industry standard, and it's indeed glorious. OnePlus has an edge here mainly because its OxygenOS already feels faster than every other version of Android out there, so this just takes things to the next level. Going back to a phone with a 60Hz panel feels like a handicap, like your eyes are playing tricks on you. It's really that significant. The difference is even obvious next to the OnePlus 7 Pro's 90Hz panel, though not nearly to the same extent.
I keep having to remember that I've used almost all of the phones released over the past couple of years (yes, I'm incredibly privileged) and that while the upgrade to high-refresh rate screens is still wonderful, a bit of air has escaped the balloon. If you're coming from any phone pre-2019, where this technology was all but impossible to find, you're in for a real treat, and it's one of the main reasons to update to the OnePlus 8 Pro.
Of course, the 8 Pro is also just an objectively nice-looking phone from all sides. There are three colors available here, and two of them — Ultramarine Blue and Glacial Green — have a brushed, matte finish. It's still a slippery phone, but there's an elegance and maturity that's a parcel with a design decision like this. The green hue is striking and new, and that's why I like it; the blue is dark and rich, fading into a deep indigo in the right light. You'll like it. The black model is glossy, and while I haven't seen it in person, it's likely as magnetic to fingerprints as it sounds.
OnePlus stuck to its traditional button layout here, and it works as well today as it did five years ago with the OnePlus 2. The right-side power button sits below a three-tier volume switch — silent, vibrate, and normal — and it's still the best way to easily silence a phone you don't want annoying you during the workday.
What does work so well is the sloped display, a trend even Samsung curbed with its latest Galaxy S20 series. It's not that I'm inherently against waterfall edges, but that severe a curve makes it more difficult to perform repetitive tasks like swiping to go back, or getting Android to recognize a pause to open a menu.
OnePlus phones don't have great palm rejection, either, so I often find myself having to repeat a tap or gesture because the flat part of my palm found itself resting on the right edge of the screen and the OS mistakes that for an intentional tap. The sloped edge also results in inevitable color shifts in the AMOLED display that undermine the display's other superb qualities.
Basically what I'm saying here is that less is more when it comes to curved displays, and I found myself missing the flat edges of the OnePlus 7T while enjoying the hell of out OxygenOS.
Elsewhere, the OnePlus 8 Pro has an improved optical fingerprint sensor, courtesy of Goodix, that's both fast and reliable. Unlike the Galaxy S20, I don't need to dwell too long on it — it just works — and that's all that should be necessary to say about a fingerprint sensor.
Also still great are the phone's haptics, though I noticed a slightly regression in the quality compared to the 7 Pro. OnePlus told me that the 8 Pro actually has a bigger and more powerful haptic motor than its predecessor, but the actuation feels more hollow and buzzy than before, perhaps due to the placement within the chassis. It's not bad by any means, but it's not as precise as a Pixel 4 or Galaxy S20.
Before we move on, though, I think it's important to bring up something: while this does indeed look like a natural successor to the OnePlus 7T Pro — same button layout, same sloping display, same middle-aligned camera module — it also resembles in many ways a product that most North Americans will never get to try, the OPPO Find X2 Pro. Both OnePlus and OPPO are owned by a nebulous parent called BBK Electronics (which also owns Vivo, Realme, and IQOO), and while OnePlus has gained considerable momentum in North America and Europe, OPPO has yet to make the same push (though with the Find X2 Pro it's beginning that slow climb).
The two phones share a number of internal components and design tenets, likely for purposes of scale, but it's worth pointing out that OnePlus is likely hamstrung by a number of decisions made outside the brand itself that, for scale purposes, trickle down to the comparatively smaller company. Why's this important? Because if you're frustrated by the presence of that holepunch selfie cutout, impressed by the large primary camera sensor, or vexed by the increased cost associated with buying the 8 Pro, some of that blame can be directed elsewhere.
Another thing the OnePlus 8 Pro shares with the Find X2 Pro is an IP68 water and dust resistance rating. Yes, this is the first time a OnePlus phone has been so designated, though, like the OnePlus 8, the last couple of generations have been water resistant without the fanfare. (Strangely, the OnePlus 8 models sold at carriers are IP68-rated, but they cost more as a result.) Even though I know that the OnePlus 8, and even likely the OnePlus 7 Pro, is equally resistant, it's no less reassuring knowing that this phone has gone through the process. Still, it's wild to think it took until 2020 for the company to announce its first phone with an IP rating, and that it comes with such a steep price bump.
OnePlus 8 Pro Software, performance, and battery life
As with all OnePlus phones, the experience of using the OnePlus 8 Pro is sublime. Over the past couple of years, the company has turned OxygenOS into the perfect balance of easy-to-use intuitiveness and granular tweak-friendliness and that hasn't changed in 2020.
Off the bat, you'll find that the launcher now integrates Google's Discover feed instead of OnePlus's Shelf, which could be construed as the company acquiescing to Google's demands — or acknowledging that the Shelf was a promising experiment unfulfilled. I never really understood its purpose other than a widget depot, most of which would be better on one of the primary home screens.
Of course, the OnePlus 8 Pro has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chip inside of it, replete with at least 8GB of RAM — up from 6GB in the OnePlus 7 Pro base model — and 128GB of RAM. An extra $100 — yes, that brings the price to a cool grand — gets you 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which is about standard for a OnePlus upgrade, but given there's no microSD slot to speak of, it would have been nice to get a free bump to 512GB at that price. (This is also a dual-SIM phone, but the second SIM is disabled for North American users right now; a future software update will enable it.)
While OnePlus is making a big deal of the fact that the OnePlus 8 Pro uses LPDDR5 RAM, we already saw the faster and more-efficient upgrade come to the Galaxy S20 lineup earlier this year, and it seems likely that most high-end phones running a Snapdragon 865 will follow suit. The upside is a fairly significant decrease in latency compared to LPDDR4 —15-30% depending on the situation — and a 10-15% increase in power efficiency, which contributes to the OnePlus 8 Pro's excellent battery life.
Using the OnePlus 8 Pro offers one of the best Android experiences out there right now.
I won't couch it: with its 120Hz display, highly-optimized OxygenOS software, and plenty of under-the-hood tweaks, the OnePlus 8 Pro feels like the fastest phone I've ever used. Yes, it's a subjective feeling, but I don't think anyone would dispute it, even if the Galaxy S20 feels similarly speedy. We're talking split-second differences, but they all add up.
OnePlus hasn't cleared all of the phone's software cobwebs yet, though. Despite a software update issued about a week ago, which should match what customers get when they receive their phones in late April, I found the phone intermittently glitchy and slow. Every once in a while, the keyboard would get too laggy to type on.
Occasionally, it would just freak out and force me to restart the phone. I'm chalking these up to growing pains with the new platform, since OnePlus has been running Android 10 for months on older phones, but I'll report back if these bugs persist after the phone is released publicly.
One thing that's working really well this year is battery life. The OnePlus 8 Pro has a 4510mAh battery, some 12% larger than the 7 Pro's, but the battery life is more than 12% better. In my nearly two weeks testing the OnePlus 8 Pro, I didn't have to recharge once during the day (though I occasionally did because the phone now supports wireless charging). Most days, I ended with around 20% left in the tank, though the occasional lighter day would leave with me more.
Now, disclaimer: I, like you, am stuck at home, using the phone's cellular connection sparingly, and using it a little differently than I would if I were able to visit friends and family, and regularly leave to do fancy things like eat at restaurants or go to a movie. While I'm using my phone more during the day than ever (just like you, admit it), being on Wi-Fi for most of it isn't a realistic fascimile of what life is (eventually going to be) like for the average person.
Battery life has been outstanding, but I'm not leaving the house enough to simulate real-world usage.
To mitigate some of this work-from-home bias, I set reminders on the phone to disable Wi-Fi for periods of time during the day, and ensured that my test procedures, including listening to music and podcasts, playing games, and other activities I would do while walking or taking public transit, mimicked my old routines as much as possible.
Anyway, battery life is great, and you'll be happy with it. Even greater is the addition of wireless charging, yet another seriously, you waited 'til 2020 for this? addition to the 8 Pro. But as snarky as I want to be about this late addition to a technology that has been essential to my workflow for years, OnePlus did it right.
The company's CEO, Pete Lau, has said again and again that he didn't want to offer wireless charging on OnePlus phones until the company could solve the speed problem, and with Warp Charge 30 Wireless, that's not an issue. With a specialized $70 charging stand, the OnePlus 8 Pro goes from dead to 50% in 30 minutes, and to full in just over an hour. It's only a few minutes slower than the 30W wired charging the company's been offering since last year, though the phone is compatible with standard Qi chargers up to 10 watts.
A high-speed wireless charger also means heat, so there's a fan on the back to dissipate any excess. OnePlus knows that when you don't have a need for speed — say charging the phone overnight next to your bed — it slows down the process, keeping the battery safe and your ears undisturbed (the fan is actually pretty loud in a quiet room).
One more performance caveat to note: like all phones with the Snapdragon 865, the OnePlus 8 Pro supports 5G, but in the U.S., it only works on T-Mobile and Sprint (which are now one company). That means it works on low- and mid-band spectrum, but not on the high-frequency millimeter-wave signals that Verizon is touting as essential to the future of the ecosystem. There will be a separate version of the smaller OnePlus 8 for Verizon, but that phone will only work with millimeter-wave and not the other, easier-to-find low-band spectrum. (Also of note: while the OnePlus 8 Pro technically supports AT&T's mid-band 5G spectrum, it's not certified to work on the network so you'll only get LTE.)
Basically, the 5G rollout in the U.S. is still a mess. If you want a phone that works on all of the 5G bands in the country, get a Samsung Galaxy S20+ or S20 Ultra. But that honestly shouldn't be a priority right now. If you get 5G, great, but don't buy this phone because you think 5G will change your life. Eventually, once T-Mobile and Sprint have combined their networks and 5G signals are both fast and everywhere, then you can and should care.
OnePlus 8 Pro Cameras
I'll be blunt: the OnePlus 8 Pro has a great set of cameras, but they're still not on the same level as the best of the best. That doesn't mean the improvements aren't meaningful, though; if you've been avoiding OnePlus phones because of their cameras, this will probably change your mind.
The primary sensor is where things have changed the most. The Sony IMX689 sensor is 35% larger than the one in the 7 series, bringing in more light to each of the 48 megapixels. That does wonders for low light, as we'll see later, but mainly it gives OnePlus a lot more breathing room in almost every shooting situation. Couple this with major improvements to multi-frame stacking via the Snapdragon 865's image signal processor and you have a camera that shoots well in every environment.
As we saw with the Galaxy S20 Ultra and Huawei P40 Pro, though, a larger sensor makes for photos with a shallower depth of field, offering natural, rolled-off bokeh, but in turn it makes it trickier for you, the photographer, to obtain and keep focus. OnePlus employs both phase-detection and laser autofocus here, but I still found a few photos that didn't acquire, or maintain, sharpness when I tapped the shutter button.
While the new sensor puts you at a physics-based advantage over previous OnePlus phones, the company's typical chromatic characteristics haven't changed much. Colors are natural and muted compared to identical photos from a Samsung phone, and HDR is very good at bringing out highlights in shadows while preventing blown-out skies, but it still doesn't do as good a a job as a Galaxy, iPhone or Pixel.
OnePlus 8 Pro regular / telephoto / wide (top) | Galaxy S20+ regular / telephoto / wide (bottom)
And despite the larger sensor, photos taken indoors are very noisy, though it's because OnePlus is actually doing what I've asked other companies to do forever: detect motion and ramp up shutter speed to prevent blur. I ended up with a lot more usable photos of my daughter from the OnePlus 8 Pro than my Galaxy S20+ mainly because OnePlus understands that parents don't really mind grain as long as they can distinguish facial features.
The problem is that OnePlus employs a similar, though not as severe, form of facial smoothing as Samsung, so indoors you're left with photos that aren't necessarily blurry, but lack any life or energy.
OnePlus 8 Pro (left) | Galaxy S20+ (middle) | Huawei P40 Pro (right)
Low-light and night mode photos fare better than ever before, but once again OnePlus is trounced by its immediate competitors. The company's made huge strides in Nightscape processing, for sure, and most shots I took in the dark turned out nicely, but compared to the Galaxy S20+ and P40 Pro, the OnePlus turns in dead last.
I also encountered a very strange bug in a few of the photos I took, where it looks like the multi-frame stacking failed, causing a weird halo around the subject. I'd say this happened in one of every 10 photos I took, but the results were both eery and frustrating, marring a number of otherwise-great pictures. I'm sure this is something OnePlus can fix with a software update, though.
Another bug cropped out when shooting 4K30 video: the beginning of nearly every video would drop a few frames until it caught up with itself and continued capturing otherwise-beautiful and well-stabilized footage.
The other two (well three) sensors are a mixed bag. The 48MP wide-angle sensor was appropriated from the 7 Pro's main one, so it's very good, and the quality improvement shows. Colors are rich and lush, and there's a degree of detail that's just missing from other competing phones. OnePlus has also made the transition between the lenses comparatively fluid, which is appreciated.
The OnePlus 8 Pro has fantastic primary and wide-angle cameras, but the telephoto is a let-down.
Then there's the 3x telephoto solution. This continues to be OnePlus's Achilles' Heel, and it's a real disappointment. It's the exact same sensor/lens combo as on the 7 Pro, which takes a 12MP shot and crops it to 8MP for a "lossless" 3x zoom, but photos are often poorly exposed, lifeless, and lack fine detail. The telephoto does, however, provide depth data for the much-improved portrait mode on this year's phone, so at least there's that.
On the plus side, OnePlus retained the excellent Super Macro mode from the 7T here, using the wide-angle's autofocus to get tantalizingly close to subjects. And unlike the OnePlus 8, which uses a separate low-quality 2MP macro camera, you get all 48 megapixels to work with here. Given that it's early spring here in Toronto, taking macro photos of blooming flowers has been one of the few respites from the mundanity of quarantine life. (Will people scoff at that sentence a year from now? We'll see.)
Finally, OnePlus has added what it calls a 5MP 'Color Filter' camera to pad out the spec sheet, which is about all I can say about this strange augmentation. Unlike what it sounds like, it doesn't impact the colors of photos taken with the main sensor. Instead, it requires a toggle inside the camera app to switch over to it, whereby you can take photos in 'Matte', 'Vivid', 'Black & White', and something called 'Photocron'. While I can appreciate that OnePlus gave us a hardware solution for a traditional software problem, its value is not clear, especially if the entire camera experience is stuck behind a toggle that, on other phones, merely employ filter overlays.
Overall, I think the upgrade to the primary OnePlus 8 Pro sensor justifies the price of admission alone — the improved wide-angle and macro modes are a bonus. Given the bump in price, an improved camera is just about the most important upgrade you can expect, and OnePlus delivered — for the most part. And while I hate putting stock in "future software updates bring camera improvements," OnePlus is fairly dependable in this regard.
OnePlus 8 Pro The Competition
There's no question that OnePlus put itself in an awkward position this time around, ramping up the base price of its best phone to a hair under $900. In the OnePlus world, that's unheard of, and could alienate a subset of its long-time fan base. Flipping the script and calling the 8 Pro an "ultrapremium" offering may be nice spin, but most people are going to see a linear bump of $230 between last year's phone and this year's. Period.
It also puts the OnePlus 8 Pro in a weird position of not being significantly cheaper, at least out of the gate, than its competition. The Galaxy S20+, its closest spec-for-spec and, increasingly, audience-for-audience rival is currently $1000, $200 off its MSRP. The smaller Galaxy S20 is just $800.
The LG V60, which isn't sold unlocked in the U.S., costs between $800 and $900 depending on the carrier, and comes with a dual-screen accessory and a headphone jack, if that's your thing. The Pixel 4 XL is currently $600, which, if your priority is photo quality, is an outstanding deal.
Then there are the older OnePlus phones. The company says it will continue to sell the 7 Pro and 7T for as long as there is stock, and that means deep discounts – right now both phones are $499 brand new — on phones that will continue to receive updates for at least a couple more years.
OnePlus 8 Pro Bottom line
If you're buying a phone right now, you have to make a lot of considerations. The first is whether you need to spend upwards of a thousand dollars on one — the Moto G Stylus that comes out this week costs just $299, and the rumoured Pixel 4a will likely be under $400. Increasingly, buying an expensive phone isn't about nailing the basics but about adding bulk to what is already a pretty good foundation.
The second is how you're going to buy it. OnePlus doesn't plan on selling the 8 Pro through any U.S. carriers, which is in stark contrast to the cheaper and less feature-rich OnePlus 8, which will be available through T-Mobile and Verizon. OnePlus offers generous trade-in and return policies, as well as financing options, but carriers are still how most people buy phones in North America.
The third is whether the OnePlus 8 Pro is the right phone for you. That part I can help you answer: even at $899, it offers better value than the Galaxy S20+, and most other flagship phones released this year, for that matter. It may not be perfect in every category, but it's close in many, and the additions of fast wireless charging and IP68 certification, an upgraded camera, significantly better battery, a stunning 120Hz AMOLED panel, and a considerable number of other quality-of-life improvements, do more than enough to justify the price bump.
No strings attached
OnePlus 8 Pro
More expensive, more capable.
The OnePlus 8 Pro is an impressive and well-designed Android smartphone that doesn't upend the traditional OnePlus formula so much as extend it to its logical place in the 2020 canon — more features, higher price. With the addition of an impressive primary camera, waterproofing, and wireless charging, though, OnePlus has finally checked all of the boxes on its spec sheet.

Eero Beacon
Can work alone
Google Wifi
Google Wifi has one significant advantage over the Eero Beacon in that it can operate as a standalone router. If you're looking to build an Eero mesh network from scratch, you'll first need to have an Eero or Eero Pro router. If you're just looking to expand your existing mesh, the Eero Beacon makes it as easy as possible with a simple plug-in design and a night light that makes it the perfect addition to a hallway. The Google Wifi needs a bit more space but it can be easily integrated into most rooms with a spare outlet and a little space on a shelf or table.
Filling in the gaps
One of the best reasons to go with a mesh network over a traditional wireless router is its ability to expand to fit any home. While a powerful antenna-laden router can brute force a wireless signal to most of a house, it takes up a lot of space and should be placed in the center of everything. Regardless of your router, things like HVAC systems, large appliances, or even thick walls can cut your signal down. Mesh systems can work around these problems by increasing the signal as needed with a great deal of modularity.
If you already have a mesh system in place, your expansion options will be limited to the same family as your existing infrastructure. If you're planning your mesh, it's worth noting that Eero has a greater variety and the Eero Beacon can give your network a boost without running wires or needing somewhere to store or mount it. Google Wifi acts in much the same way when used as a node but it is designed to sit on a flat surface, making it a poor fit for a hallway or tight area.

Wireless speed
How much Wi-Fi speed do you need before you start getting diminishing returns? If you're looking to max out a gigabit fiber connection, neither of these routers are going to be able to deliver that full speed. The main question is how much speed you need on your wireless device.
4K video streams rarely need more than 25Mbps, which either of these nodes will be able to deliver without breaking a sweat. One area where you might feel the speed limitations is in large file download such as downloading a new video game. If you need gigabit speeds, it will be worth it to set up a wired network. These mesh systems are geared more towards mobile devices like a tablet, phone, or notebook computer.
Eero doesn't disclose the exact speeds of its products, but in our testing of the similarly configured third-generation eero, we found speeds over 400Mbps. Google Wifi has a higher theoretical max with a combined 1,200Mbps but real-world performance will more than likely be lower.
Selection and coverage
The Eero Beacon can cover up to 1,500 square feet but it will need to be paired with either an Eero or Eero Pro router. If you're planning your mesh network, the Beacon is a good fit for adding strength to your mesh without taking up much space. It's worth remembering it will need to connect to your Eero router's signal to be effective.
For an Eero mesh, the Eero Pro will have the greatest coverage and speed thanks to it's tri-band Wi-Fi. The standard eero matches the Beacon's dual-band Wi-Fi but has Ethernet ports on the back for an internet uplink and wired device. If you need a faster network, you can start it with the Eero Pro and use the Eero or Eero Beacon to fill in areas that don't need as much speed. The Eero matches the Beacon's 1,500 square feet of coverage while the Eero Pro can manage a bit more up to 1,750 square feet.
Google Wifi can work in tandem with other Google Wifi units or Nest Wifi routers. Nest Wifi routers offer greater coverage at up to 2,200 square feet and a higher Wi-Fi speed at AC2200 versus Google Wifi's AC1200 speed. If you were going to set up a network with both routers, the Nest Wifi should be connected directly to the modem to keep things as fast as possible.
To set up your mesh you will need to make an account with Eero or Google. For eero, you will need the Eero app available on Android or iOS. For Google Wifi you will need to use the Google Home app, also available on Android or iOS
Which makes the most sense for you?
If you already have an Eero or Google Wifi mesh in your home, you need to stick with the same brand for expansion. Google Wifi is a great start to a mesh network but if you need more speed, the Nest Wifi is worth a look with its improved speed and coverage. If you are planning your mesh, you should remember that Eero has the Beacon as well as the standard Eero and Eero Pro which can fill different roles in your network depending on how much space is available. For expansion, the Eero Beacon is one of the most compact and convenient mesh nodes on any system and it even has a night light.

- Sprint customers are beginning to reap the benefits of the T-Mobile merger.
- Shared 5G and LTE networks mean Sprint devices like the Samsung Galaxy S20 5G now have better connectivity for more mobile users.
- T-Mobile is also expanding its 5G coverage around the U.S., as well as bringing mid-band spectrum to areas like New York and Philadelphia.
T-Mobile has begun accelerating the rate of 5G adoption in the U.S. just weeks after it successfully completed its merger with Sprint.
The carrier is expanding its 5G base with Detroit, St. Louis, and Columbus, Ohio getting access to the next-gen standard.
For regions that already have 5G access, it'll be improving the service. It has now brought 2.5 GHz mid-band spectrum to parts of Philadelphia with parts of New York City slated for later. The benefits of this to customers as an increase in speed as well as an increase in network capacity. T-Mobile says that the mid-band spectrum will "boost average 5G speeds for customers nationwide up to eight times faster than current LTE in just a few years, and 15 times faster than current LTE over the next six years."

To access T-Mobile's 5G, you'll be able to do so with a 5G capable smartphone like the Galaxy S20. T-Mobile says that this includes Sprint Galaxy S20 5G models as well. To be clear, both 5G and LTE Sprint phones will be able to take advantage of T-Mobile's LTE and 5G networks. T-Mobile will be adding the OnePlus 8 as part of its supported devices when it becomes available from April 29, and the company expects 5G to become more ubiquitous as more devices debut with the standard over the year.
"Connectivity is more important than ever today, and the challenging time we're all facing shows just how critical 5G for All is," said Neville Ray, T-Mobile President of Technology. "While our amazing team safely works to keep people across the country connected to work, school and family, we aren't slowing down on building out the broad and deep network that only this combined company can deliver."

- Akuma is the second new scene since Pistol Whip's launch at the end of 2019.
- This update lays the groundwork for scheduled monthly updates, which include a free new scene each month.
- Monthly updates are scheduled to occur until E3 2020, which takes place in June.
A second big update for Pistol Whip, the hit VR rhythm shooter that's been making legs and backs sore since its launch in late 2019. Titled Akuma, the twelfth scene takes place in a Neo-Tokyo themed environment and is inspired by anime classics like Akira and Ghost in the Shell. Developer Cloudhead Games describes this as a rhythm-heavy scene set in a cyberpunk Japan, with futuristic streets and alleys all rendered in the beautiful, colorful style of Pistol Whip.
While the new scene is sure to excite Pistol Whip players, who have been salivating for more content since the game launched, the most exciting part about today's announcement is that Cloudhead Games plans to add a free new scene to the game every month from now until E3 2020, which takes place in June. Without them directly giving a number, that should mean we're looking at 4 new scenes coming out between now and June, not including today's Akuma update.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
These monthly updates aren't just going to include new scenes though, as Cloudhead Games is said to be working on a number of new features in time for the title's version 1.0 release. As of the High Priestess update, the game was at version 0.6. The Akuma update also fixes some major bugs that occurred on PC platforms still running Windows 7, which is a bit unexpected since Microsoft no longer officially supports that OS. Users who were experiencing single eye / double vision issues on both AMD or Nvidia cards should also find those problems fixed in this patch.
Pistol Whip is available on Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift, and SteamVR headsets, and takes part in the Oculus cross-buy program, so users who have both a Rift and a Quest headset can buy it once and play it wherever they are. The PlayStation VR (PSVR) version is still on the roster for future release, according to Cloudhead Games.

Google Pixelbook
Flashy new upgrade
Google Pixelbook Go
Google makes the best in bleeding edge, ultra-premium Chromebooks, but when you look at the Pixelbook and the new Pixelbook Go side-by-side, it's not as easy a choice as you'd think. One is shinier, newer, and more affordable, but the other is more adaptable and arguably more powerful, if a bit long in the tooth in 2019.
The Go vs the OG: a battle of Pixelbooks
The Pixelbook Go's design is dramatically different than the Pixelbook, all soft curves and easy angles compared to the original's boxy look. The Pixelbook Go is also a narrower Chromebook; the switch to a 16:9 screen means you don't have to put up with the absolutely massive palm rests that the Pixelbook's 3:2 screen necessitated, nor do you have to deal with black bars whenever you're watching YouTube or Netflix.
Some users argue the 3:2 screen size is better for productivity, but honestly, the 13.3-inch 16:9 display split-screens Chrome tabs (or apps) better than the 12.3-inch 3:2 screen on the OG Pixelbook. Where the Pixelbook does take the edge for productivity is the 2-in-1 hinge that allows it to fold back into a tablet when you don't need the keyboard. The Pixelbook Go has a less forgiving clamshell lid, and it lacks support for the $100 add-on Pixelbook Pen, so artists and other content creators may want the older model instead.
Getting past those shiny metal cases — painted magnesium, in the Go's case — both the new and old generation of Pixelbooks are remarkably similar on the inside. Both can come with either 8 or 16GB of storage, and most of the configurations include Intel i5 or i7 processors. The Pixelbook Go can come with a less powerful — and less expensive — Intel M3 processor, and the original Pixelbook can come with 512GB of storage as opposed to the top size of 256GB on the Go.

One of the biggest differences between the Pixelbook Go and Pixelbook on paper is the price: Google still charges you $1,000 for a Pixelbook whereas you can get a Pixelbook Go for $649. Unfortunately, this comparison isn't as clear cut as it seems. The $649 Go comes with an M3 processor, which is enough for most non-coding, non-Linux-using folks, but if you want an i5, that price difference shrinks considerably.
The i5 Pixelbook Go was initially $850, whereas the i5 Pixelbook launched at $900 on Amazon. Both come with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, but the Go is an 8th gen i5 over the Pixelbook's 7th gen i5.
At that point, the question becomes whether you want a 16:9 screen or a 3:2 screened 2-in-1. I use stand mode on my Pixelbook all the time when it's docked on my standing desk, but the clamshell Pixelbook Go is still easy to use and should bend back far enough for when you're working with it on the couch.
The price argument also gets even murkier once you realize that as a two-year-old laptop, the original Pixelbook is much more prone to sales than the brand-new Pixelbook Go. Last Black Friday, you could get the Pixelbook for $700 and I wouldn't be shocked to see similar sales this year as retailers clear out stock of the older model. You can also get a refurbished Pixelbook from the Google Store, complete with a one-year warranty, for just $749, which may be the best option if you prefer the 3:2 screen or 2-in-1 form factor.
Should you upgrade?
Nope. The Pixelbook is more functional and about as powerful as the Pixelbook Go, so unless you like Not Pink, there's literally no reason to spend as much money on the new model as you paid for the original two years ago.
If you're buying a Pixelbook for the first time, there are arguments for getting the newer processors and cuddlier design, but if you already own a Pixelbook, you'll be happier with what you've got.

Last year's model still rules for some.
The OG might be the best bet for you if you prefer a 3:2 screen over 16:9 or want the convenience of a 2-in-1 that can fold into tent or tablet mode. Sales are more frequent for this older model, and there are higher storage options available.
Flashy new upgrade

Different priorities for a fresher laptop.
Google's newest laptop is a rounder, cuddlier affair that sports a more media-friendly 16:9 touchscreen, and if you go for the M3 model, you can find significant savings for a brand-new laptop.

Why choose CyberGhost VPN
CyberGhost is a competitively priced VPN with anonymous payment options and solid security. It collects no logs, it's compatible with a variety of platforms, and it has plenty of servers available worldwide.

Pros
- 45-day refund period and one-day free trial
- Competitive long-term pricing
- Minimal logs kept
- Strong 256-bit AES encryption
- Plenty of servers around the world
Cons
- Performance not consistent
- Buying per month is expensive
CyberGhost VPN began in Germany in 2011 before moving to Bucharest, Romania from which it now operates. Romania is a part of the European Union, but it has lax data retention laws and isn't a part of any surveillance collective. This allows CyberGhost to keep on hand as little information about its users as possible.
Nine years after its founding, CyberGhost claims to have more than 30 million users. It has more than 5,700 servers spread out over 112 locations in 89 countries.
Pricing and plans
Like most VPN services, CyberGhost has a set number of subscription plans to choose from, ranging from one month up to three years. If you'd just like to give CyberGhost a try, there's a 24-hour trial with no credit card or payment required. This is strictly a paid VPN service with no long-term free option available.
To get the most for your money, the three-year subscription is where you'll want to turn. You're billed $99 once every three years, which equals out to about $2.75 per month with two months free.
A long-term plan to CyberGhost will save you the most money, but you can pay monthly if you prefer.
If you'd rather not commit to such a long subscription — don't forget there is a 45-day money back guarantee — there's also a two-year deal billed once at about $89, a one-year deal billed once at about $72, or a one-month deal billed once at about $13. Considering the three-year deal is only $10 more than a two-year deal and $17 more than a one-year deal, you can see CyberGhost is trying hard to sign people up for the long haul.
Nothing out of the ordinary here, and in general you're going to pay less than popular competitors like ExpressVPN and NordVPN for the long-term plans. For the short-term monthly plan, you will pay more here.
Testing and performance
VPN security is extremely important, but if your internet speed suffers greatly, you might ask if it's really worth it. Testing a VPN's performance comes down to connecting to multiple VPN servers, running speed tests, and comparing the results to a non-VPN connection.
For the first round of tests I used a Windows 10 PC connected wirelessly to my router. Most of the time a connection to the VPN server was established within seconds, though there were a few times where it took a bit longer — around 20 to 30 seconds — to connect.

When connected with a Windows 10 PC, there's hardly any slowdown across regular and specialized CyberGhost VPN servers. Note that the torrenting servers are accessible only from the desktop app. The Android app displays just regular and streaming servers.
Unfortunately, the same performance wasn't evident when using the Android app. For the following tests I used a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 connected wirelessly to my router.

|CyberGhost Recommended (Streaming)||77ms||28.9Mbps||13.5Mbps|
As you can see, speeds are significantly hit when connected with a mobile device. To check these results, I tested with a different VPN service I subscribe to. Like usual, I was able to hit upwards of 100Mbps download speeds when using recommended servers.
It's not guaranteed you'll see the same slowdown based on where you're located and the hardware you're using, but you'll no doubt want to test things out short term if you plan on primarily using CyberGhost with a mobile device.
Features
CyberGhost is rather generous with its offered VPN servers. At the time of writing this review, there are 5,733 servers in 112 locations, spread out over 89 countries. Some are hosted physically within those countries, while others are hosted virtually. Many servers are dedicated to peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and torrenting, while others are dedicated to streaming on popular services, like YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, and more. CyberGhost does not limit bandwidth, nor does it put a cap on data. You're free to switch between servers as much as you want, and you won't be held to a maximum amount of traffic.
Thanks to compatibility with plenty of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Apple TV, CyberGhost should fit the needs of most homes. It can be used on up to seven devices at once, plus you can configure a router with CyberGhost VPN for a blanketed approach that essentially removes the per-device limit. Dedicated IP addresses are available for those who need them, for example anyone who can't have a new IP address each time they connect to a VPN server.
I primarily tested CyberGhost with the Windows 10 and Android apps. While you're going to be able to set up a connection on either, the desktop app understandably allows for a lot more tweaking. Both platforms offer an ad blocker, data compression tool, Wi-Fi protection, and tracker blocker, but if you want to go deeper with exceptions, kill switch, and VPN protocols, you'll want to stick with the desktop app. In any case, the apps are laid out well and even complete beginners to a VPN should be able to easily navigate the setup.
Connecting from Canada, I can confirm that CyberGhost unblocks Netflix and similar streaming services in other countries. It also removes geo-restrictions from sites like YouTube, allowing you to watch content that would normally be blocked in your country. Not all VPNs offer these features, so score some points for CyberGhost.
I submitted a rather basic support ticket to test the 24/7 customer service, but I didn't receive an email back. I then turned to the live chat option, and it only took about a minute to begin the support process. If you're in even more immediate need of assistance, there are a bunch of pre-written articles available.
Privacy and security
CyberGhost offers OpenVPN, L2TP/IPsec, IKEv2, WireGuard, and PPTP protocols to connect, which helps open it up to so many different devices. You get 256-bit AES encryption with a 4,096-bit key for exchanges. That's basically the norm these days, though some VPN providers up things to an 8,192-bit key. In any case, you should feel secure with the level of encryption from CyberGhost. To help keep your browsing private, CyberGhost includes an automatic kill switch that cuts your internet connection if the VPN goes down, as well as DNS leak protection.
A VPN's log-keeping policy should be a top concern when shopping around, and CyberGhost scores well. Operating out of Bucharest, Romania, CyberGhost has no legal obligation to log user activity. It also resides outside of 5 Eyes, 9 Eyes, and 14 Eyes intelligence alliances. CyberGhost makes it clear that some information is kept, but only in order to keep your service running. The email address you use to sign up, payment information, and cookie preferences are logged. Keep in mind that you can pay anonymously with Bitcoin and use a burner email address to protect your privacy.
To help keep users at ease, CyberGhost releases a transparency report every three months that details DMCA complaints, police and agency information requests, and statistics about how CyberGhost operates.
Should you sign up?
CyberGhost VPN brings a lot to the table, especially when you consider the competitive long-term pricing. There are functional apps and wide compatibility with many platforms, and the service can be used for streaming and P2P sharing thanks to dedicated servers. There are thousands of servers spread out over 89 countries.
Performance was stellar on a Windows 10 PC, and establishing a connection was — if not for a rare hiccup — a speedy process. Unfortunately, using the CyberGhost VPN Android app did not result in the same performance. If you're shopping for a VPN service to use primarily with a mobile device, you might want to look elsewhere at some of our other best VPN options.
Still, CyberGhost brings solid security in the form of 256-bit AES encryption, and it offers plenty of extra features to keep your browsing habits private. Minimal logs are kept, and CyberGhost releases a transparency report every three months. There's quick customer support through the live chat option, and there are plenty of prewritten articles available to help VPN beginners get things up and running.
Long-term pricing will net you the best deal, but check out our best VPN deals roundup to ensure you're getting the absolute best price when you feel it's time to sign up.

What's a VPN?
If you need to maintain your privacy and security on the internet a bit more, look into using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). It's a network that moves your data from your PC to a specific server, where it is encrypted before going out into the internet.
When considering a VPN service to use, one factor to consider is how many servers it has throughout the world. Also, you should look for apps the company may provide that can help you to easily access its network from your PC or mobile device, along with any extra security measures (such as unique server features, functions in its apps, and company policies).
NordVPN is regarded as a top choice, although ExpressVPN is another contender. Which comes out on top? To help you decide, we compare their differences and similarities.

ExpressVPN vs. NordVPN: Do they keep logs?
It's strongly advised that you only sign up for a VPN that says it doesn't retain logs. Otherwise, an outside party could possibly get hold of those logs. With this in mind, you should also note the country where the VPN company's offices are located. The law enforcement of many governments may not respect people's privacy online, to put it gently.
Fortunately, both NordVPN and ExpressVPN say they do not keep logs. Here is what ExpressVPN states on its site about its policy regarding this matter:
ExpressVPN does not see or record which websites you visit. We never log the destination or contents of your traffic, and we run our own private, zero-knowledge DNS on every VPN server for added privacy and anonymity. ExpressVPN never logs connection timestamps, session duration, your source IP address, or the ExpressVPN IP address that your computer assumes when connected to the VPN.
ExpressVPN is based in the British Virgin Islands. Presently, this country has no formal laws that regulate data protection.
This is NordVPN's no-logging policy:
We do not track the time or duration of any online session, and neither do we keep logs of IP addresses or servers used, websites visited or files downloaded. In other words, none of your private and secure data is logged and gathered at any time.
NordVPN's office is based in Panama, which has no law requiring a company like it to retain data.
Between the two companies, both appear to be on equal level when it comes to its no-logging rule.
ExpressVPN vs. NordVPN: Servers and locations
You should typically consider a VPN service that has a lot of servers. This choice increases the likelihood that you can get a solid and fast connection. Also, if you want to connect to servers in specific countries, look for how many countries that the VPN has servers in. This makes your PC look like it's located in a country that's not the one where you're actually located.
ExpressVPN has more than 3,000 servers in over 94 countries. Most are in Europe, followed by Asia. Some are virtual servers: If you connect to a server located in a country where the internet is not fast or secure enough, your data will be routed first to a server in another, nearby country (where the speed and security of the internet are better) before it arrives at the slower or less secure server. ExpressVN has 41 so-called virtual servers.
NordVPN has over 5.500 servers spread over 59 countries. Most are in Europe. Countries in North America, Central America, and South American altogether house the second most number of NordVPN servers. Some of its servers feature double VPN or are specifically configured for P2P file sharing. If you need a dedicated IP address while using NordVPN, you can pay $70 for one. You can choose from one that's located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, U.K. or U.S.
In terms of pure numbers, NordVPN wins with nearly double the number of servers over ExpressVPN's network.
ExpressVPN vs. NordVPN: Overall performance
Before you pay for a VPN, make sure the company has a money-back guarantee. This can let you try out a service to see if you will be happy with it long-term, but there's another reason why: Generally speaking, the performance of any VPN service depends on where you are in the world, where its server that you connect to is located, and how much traffic there is running through that server at the time you connect to it.
We already pre-select VPNs that appear to have similar network performance in order to focus on their other features to determine the best deal. We tested NordVPN and ExpressVPN at various times throughout the day, and the performance of each was comparable to the other.
NordVPN vs. ExpressVPN: Number of devices
You may have several devices that you'd like to connect to a VPN: For example, you have a PC, smart TV, and home security network. Many VPN services let you keep more than one device connected to their networks at the same time.
You can connect up to five of your devices to ExpressVPN's network simultaneously. NordVPN wins on this factor but by just a hair, with up to six devices at once. (Keep in mind that a router counts as one device. Thus, if you connect your router to a VPN, and then your devices connect to this router, the internet traffic running from each device will go through the VPN.) The difference here between ExpressVPN and NordVPN is negligible.
NordVPN vs. ExpressVPN: Bandwidth limits
Many cheap VPNs or free VPN services have bandwidth limits. This is separate from your bandwidth usage on your regular ISP. In such a case, you're allowed a certain amount of bandwidth that travels between your PC or other device and the VPN's servers.
The good news is that neither ExpressVPN or NordVPN have bandwidth limits as you experience the internet through their networks.
NordVPN vs. ExpressVPN: Apps
A capable and worthy VPN provider has apps that help you connect your PC, smartphone, or other device to its network and maintain your online security conveniently.
ExpressVPN has apps for all the major OSes — Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows. The company also provides apps that are specifically for Amazon Kindle and Nook HD e-readers, and Amazon Fire tablets. And it has apps for smart TVs that run Android TV, and for the Amazon streaming devices (Fire Stick, Fire TV, Fire TV Cube). You can even use ExpressVPN through a browser extension for Chrome or Firefox, and firmware customized for use on the ExpressVPN network that can be installed on 11 router models by ASUS, Linksys and Netgear.
NordVPN has apps for Android, Android TV, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and extensions for Chrome and Firefox.
ExpressVPN wins this category for supporting the most OSes and platforms with apps.
NordVPN vs. ExpressVPN: Features
ExpressVPN's apps include a "kill switch" that will block the internet connection to your device if the VPN goes down for some reason. This helps to ensure that your private information, such as your actual IP address, doesn't become exposed. The Android, macOS and Windows apps, and browser extensions feature split tunneling, which enables you to choose which apps or devices should access the internet through the VPN while letting the internet traffic of other apps or devices to go normally through your internet service provider.
Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN's apps can also cut off access to your device if its connection to the NordVPN network drops. They can also block ads and malicious sites. Their other features include accessing the Onion network and servers optimized for P2P file sharing, double VPN, and quick connecting to video streaming services that are region-blocked. Split tunneling is supported through the Chrome and Firefox extensions. Overall, it just has more features than ExpressVPN.
ExpressVPN vs. NordVPN: P2P and Onion
Most VPNs generally support the use of P2P on their networks, but ExpressVPN doesn't list servers that are set up specifically for this purpose. It also doesn't have servers to handle traffic through the Onion network. You'll have to use The Onion Router ("Tor") browser, which is how you usually access the internet through this secure network.
NordVPN lets you use P2P through certain servers on its network. If you connect to a P2P server using the NordVPN app, you don't need to choose a server because your connection will be automatically secured for P2P. It also has specific servers that route your traffic through the Onion network, so you don't need to use the Tor browser.
ExpressVPN vs. NordVPN: Pricing and plans
Like most providers, there are plenty of VPN deals to choose from with ExpressVPN and NordVPN. You can choose from three plans with ExpressVPN. Pay in advance for one year of service and this breaks down to $6.67 per month and right now you get an extra three months of service for free. A six-month plan makes the per month amount $9.99. And if you prefer to go month-to-month, the cost is $12.95. All plans have a 30-day money-back guarantee if you are not satisfied.
NordVPN sells four plans with a 30-day money-back guarantee. A three-year plan is the best deal, breaking down to $3.49 per month. The two-year plan is $4.99 per month. The one-year plan is $6.99 per month. Paying month-to-month is $11.95.
Between the two, NordVPN offers the best prices and most plan choices.
Which VPN should you use?
If you have an e-reader, such as a Kindle or Nook HD, or Amazon streaming device, take a look at ExpressVPN for its apps that support these platforms. Most of ExpressVPN's apps support split tunneling.
Looking for the widest security tools in a VPN? It's hard to beat NordVPN. It includes double VPN, Onion network access, and servers that are configured for P2P file sharing. On top of these, it has the most servers throughout the world and lowest plan prices.
Both of these options top our best Android VPN list, so you can't realy go wrong either way.

So far, we're already seeing an early -2 point favorite given to the Steelers, but the Titans and Derrick Henry are a tough test for any defense. Here's how to watch it live wherever you are in the world.
The Steelers are 5-0 and could be one of if not the best team in football so far this season. However, they haven't faced a team like the Tennessee Titans (also 5-0) that are 1st in the league for time of possession. The Titans take the ball away often, don't give it back, and keep it forever with that ground-and-pound run game led by Derrick Henry.
If you're looking at the stat sheet these teams are so evenly matched you can almost guarantee it'll be a great game. They're both 12th in the league in PPG, 12th in yards per game, both 5th in interceptions, and close in every other important category. Essentially, this is an excellent matchup and frankly we're surprised it's in the early time slot on Sunday instead of being the game of the week.
Every team is dealing with injuries or COVID, especially the Titans, and last week the team lost Pro Bowl left tackle Taylor Lewan with a torn ACL. This just makes each possession even more important.
The Steelers are no stranger to injury either, who lost QB Ben Roethlisberger last year. That said, he's back and looking better than ever here in 2020. It doesn't hurt that he has a great o-line and an emerging superstar WR in rookie Chase Claypool.
But ok, enough talk, read on as we explain below how to get a Pittsburgh Steelers vs Tennessee Titans live stream for Sunday's game.
Pittsburgh Steelers vs Tennessee Titans: Where and when?
These two undefeated teams will battle for the top spot at Nissan Stadium in Tennessee during the early morning slot on Sunday. The game officially kicks off at 1pm ET / 10am PT on CBS.

The Linksys AX6000 is the latest Wi-Fi 6 router from the storied home router company, and it offers great coverage, better speeds, and plenty of modern features to boot. It even meshes well with other Linksys routers and can be used as part of a greater mesh network, making this one incredibly well-rounded router.
A solid place to start
Linksys AX6000
Bottom line: The Linksys AX6000 is a Wi-Fi 6 router built with speed and range in mind. One router will cover an entire 3,000 square feet house, in many cases, and will probably even reach your basement. Devices that support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) will get even better coverage and speed, and even Ethernet devices will enjoy a full gigabit connection. While Linksys mesh technology means easy pairing of routers, the lack of 2-factor authentication on the remote management app brings up security concerns we wouldn't expect from a router company in 2020.
Pros:
- Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax Gigabit wireless)
- WPA3 support
- Can easily add mesh points to expand network
- Built-in parental controls and device prioritization
- Excellent range and speed
- Gigabit Ethernet ports
- Alexa integration
Cons:
- Expensive
- No 2-factor authentication for remote management
- Lack of historical usage data for individual devices
- Probably won't go with your home decor
- No Google Assistant or Siri/HomeKit support
Linksys AX6000 Traditional form-factor
The idea of a sophisticated, modern router encompasses more than just the looks, it also includes the software behind the shell. While Linksys has certainly included some brilliant smarts underneath that familiar plastic shell, it opted for a more traditional router design for the Linksys AX6000.
One of the many reasons manufacturers have changed the look of their routers is to encourage users to keep them out in the open, which allows for better Wi-Fi coverage throughout the home. While Linksys is sure to remind you to do this in the setup, it's likely that everyone won't be happy leaving this one on a shelf somewhere in the living room.
While it's pretty boring to look at, the Linksys AX6000 was clearly built with form in mind before function. That powerful quad-core CPU inside is well-ventilated thanks to the domed plastic mesh top, and the four antennas can all be adjusted to enhance signal propagation throughout your home. On the back, you'll find four gigabit Ethernet ports to ensure you can still connect those devices that don't support wireless connectivity (like a Philips Hue bridge).
Linksys AX6000 Coverage, speed, and a meshy future
While looks and connectivity are certainly important features in a router, it's the speed and coverage that'll bring on the biggest buyer's remorse. In the case of the AX6000, I found that it adequately covered all my needs, including strong signal propagation in my basement office. Over the past year, I found that mesh systems typically are the only types of routers that can provide a strong enough signal to be usable in the basement, but the Linksys AX6000 more than did the job.
My basement office is typically the place where wireless signals go to die. It's located on the other side of my house from the router, and a full floor level below where the router resides. Despite this, however, I had no issues with signal strength or speed from the Linksys AX6000. It's well worth noting, of course, that my devices automatically selected the 2.4GHz channel because of the signal strength. That's just the nature of 2.4GHz vs. 5GHz when it comes to range and material penetration.
In the test above, I compared the Linksys AX6000 with the Nest Wifi, a popular mesh router. What I found are fairly comparable speeds, even though I only had a single Linksys AX6000 in my home. The slowest point was, predictably, in my concrete-clad basement where devices had to use the slower 2.4GHz channel to get sufficient Wi-Fi signal for a quality connection. What we see above is mainly the top of Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) performance from common devices. A Wi-Fi 6-powered device will perform much better, and that's ultimately what will make the purchase of a Linksys AX6000 make the most sense.
With Wi-Fi 6 devices, this router really gets a chance to shine.
Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is a different beast altogether and will work quite a bit better than existing Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac). This is because of the fact that the Linksys AX6000 utilizes a total of four channels for the Wi-Fi 6 signal, and can even adjust channels and other factors to keep the signal strong. Linksys put a quad-core processor inside the AX6000 router to help calculate the best frequencies to use for individual devices to help avoid congestion; something that's a big problem in apartments and other housing that's close together.
You'll also find that adding in mesh access points is super easy, thanks to Linksys Intelligent Mesh Technology. Any Linksys mesh router that supports Intelligent Mesh Technology can easily pair with the Linksys AX6000 and create a mesh network. Yes, that even includes routers with slower wireless speeds like 802.11n, so you could easily pick up a few less expensive ones to service your back yard or a room with a deadzone.
Linksys AX6000 Easy remote management, huge security risk
Remember when you got a new router and had to navigate to 192.168.0.1 in your browser just to set it up? Remember all the confusing terms, the jargon that seems like a foreign language, and the cumbersome arrangement of menus? You'll never have to deal with any of that nonsense with the Linksys AX6000, which makes setup ultra-simple thanks to a well-designed app that you install on your smartphone.
The mandatory app experience is actually pretty good.
In fact, Linksys is so confident in its app-based management approach that it won't let you use the router at all until you've set it up from the app. While this seems a bit heavy-handed at first, I think it's actually a genius move on Linksys' part to ensure that users of the router get things set up correctly the first time. You can even natively connect it to Alexa, enabling simple voice commands for parental controls and device prioritization. It's by far the easiest way you'll ever configure a home router.
It not only makes normal day-to-day administration a simple task, but it also makes more advanced configuration far easier than the web interface that older routers used. Need to change your router's subnet? Head to Local Network Settings under the advanced section. How about parental controls? Those are right on the front screen. You can even prioritize device traffic to help with gaming or streaming without much fuss.
Now this isn't a new app, per say, but it's likely new to anyone who hasn't purchased a Linksys router in the last two years. It also makes remote configuration simple, as router management can all be done from the app no matter where you're located in the world. If you prefer a more detailed dashboard experience, you can also log in to the Linksys SmartWiFi dashboard from any computer.
While all of this is a great improvement over the past, there's one huge problem: the Linksys SmartWiFi account you have to create doesn't support any kind of two-factor authentication. That means the account that grants administrative access to your home router is only protected by a simple username and password combination, opening you up to vulnerabilities that simply shouldn't exist in 2020.
The lack of two-factor authentication for the administrative panel is completely inexcusable in 2020.
As a home Internet security product, it's absolutely inexcusible that Linksys wouldn't offer such protections. As it stands, no matter how nice this remote Linksys SmartWiFi service might be, it should not be used until Linksys adds 2FA. Period. I disabled it on mine as soon as I was done with the review because it's simply too big of a security risk to keep enabled.
On the bright side, the Linksys app and all of its features can be used while your phone or device is on the Wi-Fi network hosted by the Linksys AX6000. That means the app isn't totally useless, but it's certainly more limited than it should be. I also was hoping for a little more in the way of usage statistics and historical data from devices than is available. As it stands, products like Nest WiFi and Ubiquiti Networks routers offer historical data for each connected device for at least the past 30 days. That could be the key to finding the bandwidth hog in your house and squelching the problem.
Linksys AX6000 Competition
The competition in the router space is pretty fierce, by any standard. Take the TP-Link Archer AX6000 (pictured above) which is one of the best wireless routers. It sells for $100 less than the Linksys AX6000, offers the same theoretical 6Gbps Wi-Fi 6 bandwidth, and even doubles the number of gigabit Ethernet ports to eight. The downsides? It's not easily expandable like the Linksys AX6000 is (meaning you can't just add a bunch of similar routers and make a mesh network), and the TP-Link Tether smartphone app also doesn't support 2-factor authentication (just as Linksys doesn't).
For $50 more, you can get an Orbi Premium 2-pack. That extra $50 nets you a full mesh system that includes the base router and one mesh connection point. That means better coverage and speed throughout your home. It's also got three gigabit Ethernet ports on the main router and two on the extender, for a total of 5 gigabit Ethernet ports, and the more attractive design means you'll probably be happier with how it looks in your house. On top of that, the Orbi app is not only more robust but also offers better security thanks to 2-factor authentication for your account. The downside? The AX4200-rated Wi-Fi 6 antennas max out at a theoretical 4.2Gbps of wireless speed.
Linksys AX6000 Should you buy it?
Who it's for
- If you've already got Linksys routers and want to add Wi-Fi 6 to your mesh network
Who it's not for
- Extra-large homes (need to buy additional products for a mesh network)
- Anyone security-minded that wants remote router management
The Linksys AX6000 has two major problems that, ultimately, keep it from being a recommended buy. First up is the price, which is a bit on the high side, even for a Wi-Fi 6 router. All the additional tech that has to go into a Wi-Fi 6 router inherently makes it more expensive, but there are plenty of other name brand routers that come in with similar (or better) features and a lower price. There are even several mesh Wi-Fi 6 routers that cost the same or less and will give you better coverage for the price.
Second, the lack of 2-factor authentication on the remote management app makes it unusable in this day and age. It's been proven time and time again that a username and password to protect your account is simply not enough. Even a strong password can be compromised with modern tools, and a 2-factor (or greater) method of authentication is the best line of defense against hackers who want to get ahold of your information and your home network.
It's important to know that you don't need to use remote management and can actually opt out of the feature entirely, choosing to only make network changes while on your home Wi-Fi network. The price will come down eventually, solving one of the issues, but it's going to take some work for the Linksys app to increase its security and features to match the competition. Linksys Intelligent Mesh Technology certainly bodes well for homes that have existing Linksys routers and just want to add Wi-Fi 6 to their home network, which is likely the best-case scenario for a purchase of an AX6000.

The Power Delivery standard has paved the way for a new wave of the best USB-C battery packs that are both powerful and portable. While there are some massive power banks aimed more at charging laptops or powering devices through long camping trips, I much prefer the lighter chargers that can quickly charge a phone while sitting down for lunch or in my pocket during long days out and about. Whether you prefer your power banks big or small, these are the best ones around!
- Charge your way: Aukey Wireless Power Bank with 18W PD (10,000mAh)
- Small and swift: RAVPower 10,000mAh Power Bank
- Charge everything you own: Anker PowerCore III Elite 25,600mAh 60W Portable Charger Bundle
- Tiny mighty charger: Zendure SuperMini (10,000mAh)
- Big power for less: RAVPower 60W PD Pioneer Power Bank (20,000mAh)
- Mini-purse power: Xcentz USB-C Power Bank 5000 PD
- Colorful chargers: Anker PowerCore Slim 10,000mAh PD
- Best for Galaxy: Samsung 25W Wireless Portable Battery (10,000mAh)
- Great for travel: Aukey USB-C Power Bank 26,800mAh
Charge your way: Aukey Wireless Power Bank with 18W PD (10,000mAh)
Not only does this power bank have 18W Power Delivery charging through its USB-C port, it still has a USB-A port and a Qi wireless charging coil so that you can charge however you like.
Small and swift: RAVPower 10,000mAh Power Bank
This candy bar-sized power bank is powerful enough to charge most phones from dead to full twice or more. Available in black or white, this charger comes with a USB-C cable and a travel pouch.
Charge everything you own: Anker PowerCore III Elite 25,600mAh 60W Portable Charger Bundle
This beefy portable charger can charge most laptops at a decent speed — or at top speed — and it comes with a 65W Power Deliver wall charger to top it back up in three hours.
Tiny mighty charger: Zendure SuperMini (10,000mAh)
The SuperMini is the size of a credit card and rugged as all get-out, but it can also charge your phone at 18W whether you use USB-C or USB-A. It comes in black and silver, but also metallic blue with a nice gradient.
Big power for less: RAVPower 60W PD Pioneer Power Bank (20,000mAh)
This case isn't much bigger than a Note 20 Ultra with an OtterBox on, yet it'll charge a phone four times over. It can also charge your laptop thanks to the ability to output 60W through Power Delivery.
Mini-purse power: Xcentz USB-C Power Bank 5000 PD
Your power bank doesn't do you any good if you left it at home, but this bank is about the size of a fun-size Halloween candy, so you can carry it every day! Its 5,000mAh capacity still means it can recharge your phone fully.
Colorful chargers: Anker PowerCore Slim 10,000mAh PD
Anker's phone-sized power bank now comes in six colors and I for one am thrilled. The Terracotta Rose might not be for everyone, but the Deep-Sea Indigo and Dark Olive are universal and understated.
Best for Galaxy: Samsung 25W Wireless Portable Battery (10,000mAh)
While most recent Galaxy phones don't actually get 18W charging with most portable charges despite supporting PD, this one will charge Samsung phones at 25W using "Super Fast Charge."
Great for travel: Aukey USB-C Power Bank 26,800mAh
While sporting the same capacity as the Anker, the Sprint Ultra bank has two USB-C ports instead of one, meaning you can fast charge a phone and laptop at the same time and still have a USB-A port free.
Small and sturdy makes for the best USB-C portable charger
Again, I far prefer smaller portable batteries that actually live up to the name "portable," which is why the phone-sized Aukey 10,000mAh Battery Pack and the credit-card sized Zendure SuperMini are two of our favorites. They're easy to fit in a pocket or purse, and they'll give your phone another 10-20 hours. The Aukey is more affordable and its shape makes it easier to accommodate, but some prefer the smaller, thicker size of the Zendure.
Turning to more beefy models, while Anker's bundle is of the highest quality, it's also of the highest price, so unless you already lack a USB-C wall charger, you're probably better off buying the RAVPower 60W PD Pioneer Power Bank, which is less than half the price but charges just as fast. Aukey's 26,800mAh Power Bank is also a nice balance of ports and pricing.

This rating means the phone has protection against dust and a water submersion of up to three feet for up to 30 minutes.
- High five: Google Pixel 5 ($699 at Amazon)
Is the Google Pixel 5 water-resistant?
While some sort of protection from the elements should be a given on our expensive portable electronics, that isn't always the case, and you might wonder, is the Google Pixel 5 water resistant? Thankfully, Google sprung for the added parts and testing to get the device certified at IP68.
If you are unsure, IP68 indicates the level of water and dust protection for a device. The IP stands for ingress protection, and the 68 describes how protected the device is. The first number is for solid particle protection; in this case, the 6 means it's dust-tight. The second number, 8, tells us the level of protection from liquids. Eight means that the phone is rated to withstand water ingress pressure of 1 meter, generally tested for 30 minutes.
All of this means that your Pixel 5 should be just fine if a drink spills on it, you accidentally drop it in the shallow end of the pool, or dreadfully drop it in the toilet. In any of these situations, you would want to give your phone a good cleaning with proper supplies. This not only helps to kill any germs that may be on it but also contaminants like chlorine or "toilet stuff."
Since Google decided to go with a unibody design and make it from metal, the Pixel 5 has a bit more durability than the glass devices from previous generations. The screen is still glass though, so it's still a good idea to pick up a case and screen protector.
Five alive

Smart to the core
Our phone goes everywhere with us, so it needs to able to survive those unexpected times where the elements come in to play. With IP68 dust and water resistance rating, your Google Pixel 5 can handle a splash here and there.

At one time, it was the biggest phone Samsung made, and it continues to influence the series to this day. While you may not be considering purchasing one at this stage, it's still a serviceable workhorse for many, even several years after it was released.
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Price and availability
The Note 8 was very clearly the top-end device in Samsung's flagship lineup when it was released in August of 2017. It initially retailed for around $950, give or take, depending on the market and carrier. These days you can find it for much cheaper, whether you're purchasing one previously owned or as new.
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Reviews
If you want to revisit what we thought of the Galaxy Note 8 when it debuted, you'll want to check out or original full video review. If you want to dive even deeper into our initial coverage of the phone, you can read our complete Note 8 review as well! We also looked at the Galaxy Note 8 three months after release to see how it held up after some time and discussed if it's worth buying a Note 8 in 2020.

Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Size
"Galaxy Note" has always been synonymous with "big phone," and that's still very much true today. Taking on the Galaxy S8's proportions of being tall and skinny, but applying them to a 6.3-inch display, the Note 8 is very tall indeed. At 162.5 mm, it's notably taller than the LG V30 (151.7 mm) and iPhone 8 Plus (158.4 mm) — all while also being wider and heavier as well.
The Note 8 is huge. There's no way to get around it.
Even with very small bezels around the screen, that big footprint makes it rather tough to reach the top of the display or even reach across for a slide-in gesture from the edge. In many cases, you'll have to awkwardly shift your hand or just wait until you have both hands available to get everything done. In a pinch, you can use the one-handed mode, which shrinks the screen down to the corner so you can actually use it without fear of dropping the phone.
Some people love the big screen — that is, after all, often why they bought a Note in the first place. But if you aren't committed to it and think you may be able to figure it out in the future, consider getting a smaller phone.
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Comparisons
Many reviews at the time commented on how the Galaxy Note 8 was extremely similar to the Galaxy S8+. The Note 8 is just a couple millimeters larger in its overall external dimensions, and its 6.3-inch display is barely larger than the 6.2-inch of the GS8+ — though the Note 8's display does get a bit brighter. Internally, the only change is the Note 8's extra RAM, now up to 6GB from 4GB, and its smaller battery at 3300mAh to the GS8+'s 3500mAh. Of course, there are two rear cameras on the Note 8 — but we already covered that.
Everything else is identical. The materials and build quality, while excellent, are unchanged. The Galaxy Note 8 has a bit sharper corners that give it a more blocky look, but that's pretty minor. The charging technology, ports, speaker, and call quality are all the same.
There were a lot of great smartphones to choose from in late 2017, and the Galaxy Note 8 was certainly one of the best. Several other large flagships certainly competed with the Note 8 for the title of best smartphone of 2017, including Google's Pixel 2 XL and Apple's iPhone 8 Plus.
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Cameras
Part of what you got for the added size of the Note 8 was two rear cameras rather than one. Samsung used the then-popular formula of two sensors with the same resolution behind lenses of different focal lengths — one "standard" field of view and another roughly twice the length with a narrower field of view. They aren't the same sensor, though, and the longer lens has a narrower aperture of f/2.4 to the main camera's f/1.7 — that means it lets in less light.
Two cameras ... and not quite twice the capabilities.
In practice, the second camera offers you an extra shooting option and some more utility. As you zoom in, whether you're shooting photos or video, the software will automatically switch to the longer lens, so you don't lose resolution. The result? Better photos and video with less noise. You can also just tap the "2X" button to switch to the long lens, giving you a narrower field of view and an altogether different look from a "normal" smartphone shot. It works particularly well for macros, provided you have enough light.
Samsung also developed a "Live Focus" mode that lets you take photos with both cameras at once and use that extra data to blur the background artificially... or at least, what the camera thinks is the background. It doesn't always get that calculation right, and when it misses the mark, it looks kind of funny. Thankfully the camera also saves the standard photo from the main camera every time you take a Live Focus shot — an escape hatch, of sorts. Live Focus is worth trying out, and it's capable of excellent results sometimes provided the conditions are all right. Still, this feature alone isn't enough to differentiate this camera from the Galaxy S8+'s single sensor and lens.
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Colors
The Galaxy Note 8 was offered in four different gorgeous colors: midnight black, orchid grey, maple gold, and deep-sea blue. But unfortunately, you didn't have your choice of all four in all areas around the world. The U.S., for example, only had the black and grey models available at carrier stores — while Best Buy was the exclusive retailer for the deep sea blue variant for AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and the unlocked model. If you were to head up to Canada, you could get the black and blue ... but not the other two. Internationally you had a better shot at choosing between more colors, but you, unfortunately, couldn't always count on having all four.
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 FAQs
Below are answers to some of the more frequently asked questions that we received regarding the Galaxy Note 8.
What were the new S Pen features?
Several generations in, the existence of the S Pen nestled inside the phone is what gives the Galaxy Note its name. Of course, this was the best and most capable S Pen of its time — but it wasn't much different from what we saw debut on the Note 7, nor was it dramatically different from the Note 5's.
The S Pen is fantastic if that's the sort of tool you need.
The Note 8's S Pen has a sensitivity of 4096 levels, which is fantastic when paired with the very fine 0.7 mm stylus tip. Together, you continue to have a very accurate instrument for writing and drawing. The S Pen-focused software is basically the same as far as the core features of Samsung Notes, Screen write, Smart select, and Translate go. It comes with a "Live message" feature that lets you write out and send animated gifs, and the "Screen off memo" feature has been improved, but that's about it.
All work and no play makes for a dull user. As awesome as the S Pen is for signing documents or annotating notes, it's also a great way to unwind. While there are plenty of coloring book apps in the Play Store, Samsung has included its own (hidden) coloring feature on the Galaxy Note 8. Once you've finished your masterpiece, it can be downloaded to either serve as a wallpaper or to be stuck on the refrigerator where it belongs.
How was the battery life?
For all of that massive size, the Note 8's battery capacity is rather conservative at 3300mAh. As noted, that's actually smaller than the Galaxy S8+ and Note 7 (ahem), and the same size as smaller phones at the time, such as the LG G6 and OnePlus 5. With a super-efficient processor and display, the Note 8's battery life was good; but it wasn't necessarily great.
In our testing as part of our review, we found the Note 8 could get you through a full day, even with pretty heavy use, but it wouldn't have anything left in the tank in doing so. Getting upwards of 16 hours of use out of the phone with just a 3300mAh battery is quite good, and probably enough for most people given their typical usage. But not getting exceptional battery life out of a Note, something the line's long been known for.
What about Bixby?
Bixby was a bit of a mixed bag when it debuted on the Galaxy S8, but it has grown up since then. Rather than compete with Google Assistant with cloud knowledge, Bixby is geared more towards local interactions on the phone itself. This ranges from mundane tasks like toggling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and off to setting up elaborate chain reactions rivaling Tasker. Those who don't like Bixby, fear not: the Bixby button can now be completely disabled.
What about DeX?
Another feature announced with the Galaxy S8 was DeX: Hook the DeX dock up to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, then plop the Galaxy phone into the dock, and a full desktop interface will show up on the monitor. The feature was not intended to replace your desktop and shouldn't replace your laptop, but it's there if you want it. Later, Samsung announced that DeX would be improving in a huge way: full-blown Linux. The Linux on Galaxy app promised to let developers use whatever build of Linux they'd like within DeX.
Should I get the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 instead?
The Galaxy Note 8 continues to be an excellent phone, but even so, you should be aware that its latest successor is already here. Samsung announced the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra in August 2020, and we've already been using both for months.
As you might expect, there are some significant differences between the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra. The Note 20 is made of premium plastic, while the Note 20 Ultra is all metal and class. The Note 20 is smaller and has a lower refresh rate, while the larger Note 20 Ultra has a 120 Hz refresh rate. The larger model also has more RAM, an SD card slot, and a larger battery. The Note 20 comes in a beautiful Mystic Green, while both are offered in a fabulous Mystic Bronze color.

Inflatable pools and accessories for kids, families, pets and even adults
Public pool parties may not be an option for a while, but that doesn't mean you should give up on soaking in the sun. There are plenty of inflatable pools, large enough for families or tiny enough for babies, to cool down your hot summers, but start your search with these picks. Plus, make sure you have the accessories you'll need to keep your pool water clean and healthy.There's plenty of new toys in the Android 11 to play with, but one of my favorites this year is without a doubt the addition of smart home controls to Android 11's power menu, allowing me to quickly adjust my smart lights or Nest thermostat without having to dig into an app or rattle off a Google Assistant command. These quick controls can work as on-off toggles for smart lights — and for Android TV devices, though not for Chromecast devices — and offer a quicker way to adjust your smart thermostat.
By default, the new controls will auto-populate according to which ones you use the most — thermostats and a variety of smart lights for most of us — but you can change which controls are shown and what order they're available. If there's a limit on how many controls you can have, I didn't hit it with every single light, thermostat, and Android TV in my home.

How to add new smart home controls to Android 11's power menu
- Long-press the power button to open the power menu.
- Tap the three-dot menu icon to the right of your smart home name.
- Tap Add controls.
- Check or uncheck individual smart home controls to add or remove them from the controls list.
Once you have the devices you want, tap Save.
Upon returning to the power menu, your new devices will be added to the bottom of the current list. If you want to re-arrange the order of the controls, maybe put the most-used controls at the bottom so you don't have to reach as far for them, you can do that, too!
How to edit your smart home controls in Android 11's power menu
- Long-press the power button to open the power menu.
- Tap the three-dot menu icon to the right of your smart home name.
Tap Edit controls.
- To remove a current control, tap the unwanted toggle to uncheck it.
- Drag and drop a smart control to re-order the toggles.
Once the controls are in the desired order, tap Save.
I prefer keeping the thermostat at the bottom of the list so they're closer to the bottom — and my smaller thumbs — but you can arrange your controls by device type or room if that makes things easier for you to remember.

The best USB-C battery packs you can buy
One of the most convenient ways to keep your phone charged on the go is with a reliable battery pack. These are the best USB-C battery packs you should consider.Best microSD Cards for Galaxy S10 Android Central 2020
The base storage for the Samsung Galaxy S10 lineup is 128GB — which is pretty decent for a two year old phone. However, these days with downloading movies and recording 4K super slow-mos, 128GB doesn't go as far as it used to. This is where microSD cards come in, and these are the best microSD cards to use in your Galaxy S10.
- Reliability is key: Samsung EVO Select 128GB
- 4K ready: PNY Elite-X 128GB
- Value pick: SanDisk Ultra 64GB
- Big size, low price: SP Silicon Power Superior 256GB
- Go big or go home!: Lexar High-Performance 633x 512GB
- Name brand quality: SanDisk Extreme 512GB
Reliability is key: Samsung EVO Select 128GB
This is my favorite microSD card on the market and is the card sitting in my own Galaxy S10. This is the second (or maybe third) phone that I've used it in because it doubles your S10's base storage.
4K ready: PNY Elite-X 128GB
PNY's 128GB card is arguably the best value you'll find for a name-brand microSD of this capacity. I've had PNY cards last the better part of five years, so chances are this card will outlive your Galaxy S10.
Value pick: SanDisk Ultra 64GB
If you just need a little extra space and don't want to spend big bucks on a card you're not likely to fill up, this 64GB card will increase your storage by 50% for the price of a pizza.
Big size, low price: SP Silicon Power Superior 256GB
256GB should take you a long while to fill up even with 4K video and hundreds of games, and it's still a pretty affordable high-capacity card before we get into digital hoarder territory.
Go big or go home!: Lexar High-Performance 633x 512GB
If you need to download enough movies, TV, and music for a month-long trip, 512GB should be more than enough. Lexar's V30 card is fast enough for playing 4K movies.
Name brand quality: SanDisk Extreme 512GB
SanDisk is one of the most trusted names in external (and internal) storage, and while this series also offers a jaw-dropping 1TB size, 512GB is the maximum capacity card that the S10 series is rated for.
How much storage is enough storage for you?
I'm of the firm opinion that you shouldn't buy a microSD card that's smaller than the storage already on your phone, but you also don't need to go too far overboard. For users who aren't what I lovingly call "digital hoarders" — people who download as much of their digital library as possible so they have everything they own always available — you probably only need a 128GB card like the Samsung EVO Select.
128GB should still be enough to download dozens of HD films for that two-day drive to Walt Disney World — yeah, I listen to Disney movies while I drive, I treat them like podcasts — or holding tens of thousands of photos from your two-week cruise with room to spare. After all, 128GB + 128GB = 256GB, which should take quite a while to fill even if you have 300 apps installed.
For the digital hoarders I mentioned a moment ago, you'll want to go as big as you can and 512GB is the max on an S10. The Lexar 633x is about as price-conscious as a name-brand card gets in this size bracket, and it is still powerful enough for shooting burst photos and videos to.
While you're grabbing a new microSD card for your phone, you might also want to consider retiring your current, grimy case and with a new Galaxy S10 case to keep your phone protected.
What all those symbols on a microSD card mean — and why they don't always matter
Manufacturers cover just about every space centimeter of a microSD card in classifications and certifications, and these symbols can be useful in ruling out slow cards quickly. However, looking at those symbols should never be the end of your research into a microSD card.
- Video Speed Class — Indicated by a stylized V followed by numbers from 6 to 90, this class is one of the newer classification systems and was developed specifically for shooting ultra-high-definition video. V30 starts at 30MB/s write speed, V60 starts at 60MB/s write speed, and V90 starts at 90MB/s, but unless your phone somehow shoots 8K video, you probably don't need a V90 card.
- UHS Speed Class — Indicated by a 1, 2, or 3 inside a U, this class is still used on most cards today. U1 starts at 10MB/s write speed, U3 starts at 30MB/s write speed, and both are perfectly adequate for most Android phones.
- Speed Class — Indicated by a number inside of a C, this was the original classification system for SD cards. Class 10 was as high as this class went, 10 MB/s write speed, and practically every card worth buying today is well beyond this speed at this point, so it's not as helpful an indicator of power/quality these days.
Notice that those specifications focus on write speed, which is the lower of the two speeds a card will have. Read speed is almost always faster than write speed, so if you see a card that only mentions "transfer speed" of 100 MB/s but is a V30 card, we can infer that the read speed is 100 MB/s and the write speed is at least 30 MB/s.
It's essential to look beyond the symbols and see what the write and read speeds are supposed to be. U3/V30 cards can have actual write speeds above some V60 cards if a V60 card has a listed write speed of 80 MB/s, there are some V30 cards out there with 90 MB/s write speeds. So read the specs!

- A next-gen wireless mesh: Google Nest Wifi Router
- No hub required: Philips Hue White And Color 2-Pack
- See who comes knocking: Ring Video Doorbell Pro
- Ring for renters: Ring Peephole Cam
- Smarter power starts here: Belkin Wemo Insight Switch

A next-gen wireless mesh: Google Nest Wifi Router
When it comes to supporting a smart home, a good wireless network is arguably the most important foundation. Google Nest Wifi, the latest iteration of Google Wifi, provides that and more. Stylish, attractive, and powerful, Nest Wifi is easy to configure and install, and although it's pricy, you get what you pay for. As an added bonus, Nest Wifi's network extenders double as smart speakers.
No hub required: Philips Hue White And Color 2-Pack
Philips Hue remains one of the most popular smart lighting brands on the market, and with the company's recent announcement that it added Bluetooth compatibility to all its bulbs, you don't even need a Hue Bridge anymore to get started. Just pick the lights up, plug them in, download the app, and you're good to go. The bulbs are also fully-compatible with Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Apple HomeKit.
See who comes knocking: Ring Video Doorbell Pro
'Tis the season for stolen packages and presents. The Ring Pro might not stop package thieves outright, but it can' help you keep an eye on your porch and track down ne'erdowells. It also doubles as a doorbell and draws power from your home's wiring.
Ring for renters: Ring Peephole Cam
For those friends who live in an apartment complex or a property where they aren't allowed to make big changes to their property, you can pick up the Ring Peephole Cam. A smart video doorbell with a minimal footprint, it can be installed in minutes and includes two-way talk and voice controls. It also features adjustable motion detection and full theft protection courtesy of Ring.
Smarter power starts here: Belkin Wemo Insight Switch
You might not expect there to be a lot to a smart plug but in the case of Belkin, you'd be wrong. The Wemo Insight Switch is pretty much the best of its kind, with an app that's easy to use and includes energy monitoring and scheduling functionality. It's also compatible with Apple HomeKit, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa.
Assistant on display: Google Nest Hub
The Nest Hub is one of our favorite products of the year, and one of the best smart displays on the market. It's compact, attractive, and is a smart speaker in addition to its other functionality. This includes acting as an alarm clock, playing YouTube videos, and controlling the rest of your connected home with its high-quality touch display.
Automation on lock: August Smart Lock and Connect Bundle
A smart lock is a great gift for your security-minded friends, and the August Smart Lock is one of the best you can get. It can automatically lock the door behind you when you leave and unlock it when you return. For multi-user homes, it also keeps track of who unlocks the door and when, allowing you to give out temporary access. Plus, with the Connect Wi-Fi bridge, the lock can be configured with voice control via Google Home or Amazon Alexa.
Hot and cold: Nest Learning Thermostat
A lower heating bill is the gift that keeps on giving. Nest's Learning Thermostat monitors your temperature preferences and automatically builds out a heating (and cooling) schedule that's personalized for your habits. It can turn off the heat when you leave the house, and kick it right back on when you get back — or stay in Eco Mode for the most efficient usage.
All-in-one for beginners: Samsung F-MN US-2 Home Monitoring Kit
If you'd prefer to take a kitchen sink approach to your smart home focused gift giving, Samsung's got you covered with the Home Monitoring Kit. Compatible with a huge range of smart home appliances and devices, the kit includes a hub, two multipurpose sensors, a motion sensor, and a smart outlet. These components can also each be purchased individually.
'Tis the season for cool tech
Not everybody will have a need for every product on this list, but most people can enjoy at least one of them, and they all amount to a more connected home. We'd recommend starting with the Google Nest Wifi Router so there's a strong foundation for adding more smart tech.
If that's not quite your cup of tea, Philips Hue's smart lights are always an awesome choice. They add a ton of cool flair to any room they're installed in, and are great for parties, especially paired with a smart speaker or smart display like the Google Nest Hub. Finally, if your aim is to give some smart home functionality on the cheap, the Belkin Wemo Insight Light Switch is the way to go.
At the end of the day, we're sure your loved ones will enjoy whatever you buy them. If they don't, that just means more tech for you.

The 10 Best Chromebooks in 2020

Why are good Chromebooks so hard to find right now?
Chromebooks are great little laptops, especially for students and for anyone who's not interested in the more intensive upkeep required for Windows laptops, but this year demand for Chromebooks absolutely exploded. When lockdowns first started to sweep through the US and Europe, millions of people soon realized that they needed another computer to let their kids distance learn while Mom and Dad worked on their own laptops. Millions more people realized that old and aging laptops were too weak to handle sustained video conferencing in this work from home era, and so they set out to find a lightweight, affordable laptop to fit their needs.
Combine millions of users needing a new laptop ASAP with component shortages from manufacturing shutdowns in China around the beginning of the year and you have today's Chromebook market: great Chromebooks sell out in a matter of hours, price gougers are out in full force, and even the biggest Chromebook makers are completely sold out for the next several months.
When you look at Chromebooks on Amazon you'll notice that many of the top listings don't have a price next to them. These are Chromebooks that Amazon has temporarily sold out of, but don't worry, there are still great Chromebooks to be bought without giving resellers the satisfaction of paying overinflated prices.
Check back early and often. Retailers restock the second they get new inventory in, not just Monday morning, so come back and go through the different retailer links in order to ensure that you're getting the Chromebook you want at the price you deserve.
Here's our detailed list of the best Chromebooks you can buy, though you might have to check back every few days to catch them in stock.
1. Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5: Best Chromebook Overall
Bottom line: With a powerful 10th Gen Intel Core i3 chip, a beautiful 13-inch 1080p touchscreen, backlit keyboard and remarkably reasonable price, the Flex 5 is a great Chromebook for just about everyone. Despite a slim and lightweight build, the Flex 5 has a 360-degree hinge for easy conversion to tent or tablet mode, along with upward-firing stereo speakers, and support for both USI Stylus and Wi-Fi 6 for power-users.
Display size: 13.3-inch 1080p IPS touchscreen | CPU: Intel Celeron 5205U / Intel Core i3 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32-128GB | Battery life: 10 hours | Ports: 2x USB-C, 1x USB-A, microSD, audio combo jack | Weight: 3 lbs | Colors: Graphite Grey | Other features: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, 720p camera, 45W charger | Auto Update Expiration date: June 2028
|Processor||Storage||RAM||Vendor|
|Intel Core i3||64GB||4GB||$410 at Amazon|
We recommend the Intel Core i3 version version of the Flex 5 for its additional power and long-term value.
Pros
Cons
The best Chromebook you can buy isn't necessarily the most powerful or the most expensive. It combines a number of features into a compact body that will appeal to almost all Chromebook users, from novices to experts, students to professionals. If your next laptop is here to work hard (and play harder), check out our new favorite Chromebook on the market today, the Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook. This laptop shares much of its design and feel with the previous overall pick, the Lenovo C340-11, and indeed it's barely an inch bigger than the 11.6-inch laptop despite having a bright 13.3-inch touchscreen inside it.
The bezels around the Flex 5's 1080p screen are quite slim — just enough for you to grip when flipping between laptop, stand, and tablet modes. That means you'll get a compact laptop with a big-enough screen for quite comfortable split-screening. You'll also get a backlit keyboard that's comfortable enough to type on for 10 hours a day — it's what I'm using to write this right now — and sitting on either side of the keyboard are speakers that will get nice and loud (though a bit tinny when you start blaring).
This version comes with Intel's latest 10th Generation i3 processor — there's also a version with a Celeron available, but it's well worth upgrading to the i3 — along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which is plenty of power for today's complex business tasks. Like many of the newer Chromebooks on this list, the Flex 5 comes with two USB 3.1 Type-C ports and a single legacy USB-A port, as well as a microSD slot for expandable storage and a headphone jack. You get Wi-Fi 6 for faster, more reliable connectivity — and Bluetooth 5.0, so your headset won't drop out as often — and the 45W charging brick in the box tops the 52.5Whr battery in just 90 minutes.
Chrome OS was built to run well on modest hardware, so on the Flex 5's mid-range hardware, things are smooth and stable. While we're not thrilled there aren't larger storage and memory sizes — would it kill Lenovo to offer 8GB models?! — there's very little to otherwise complain about here. 4GB has been enough for all the work I've done, even when I've had multiple windows and Android apps open.
When I initially agreed to review the Flex 5, it didn't seem all that amazing on paper, especially compared to the Project Athena Chromebooks that have came out this year. Once I'd spent a few days with it, though, the Flex 5 had completely won me over. It's more than the sum of its parts — and way more than its modest price tag would have you believe.
Best Chromebook Overall: Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5
Lenovo already knows how to make a great small Chromebook, and with just a few small upgrades, it makes a Chromebook that can please just about everybody.
2. Acer Chromebook 713
Best Chromebook for Gaming & Performance
Bottom line: If you need performance and power in your Chromebook, you'll want to look at a Project Athena Chromebook so that you know it's powerful, fast, and secure. This 13.5-inch 2-in-1 outdoes the rest of the current Project Athena crop in ports, durability, and value, giving you a robust laptop for hundreds less than its competitors. There's even an HDMI port built-in, for professionals that are constantly hooking up to external monitors or the projector in the conference room.
Display size: 13.5-inch 2256x1504px 3:2 touchscreen | CPU: Intel Core i3 / i5 / i7 | RAM: 8-16GB | Storage: 64-256GB | Battery life: 10 hours | Ports: 1x USB-A, 2x USB-C, HDMI, microSD, audio combo jack | Weight: 3 lbs | Colors: Silver | Other features: Project Athena certified, backlit keyboard, 720p webcam, 45W charger | Auto Update Expiration date: June 2028
|Processor||Storage||RAM||Vendor|
|Intel Core i5||128GB||8GB||$630 at Best Buy|
Pros
Cons
Like the Acer Spin 13 before it, the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is one of the most powerful Chromebooks out there that doesn't just go completely overboard in terms of price. Project Athena is a program stated by Intel working with manufacturers to produce laptops that will be fast, powerful, and reliable. So, as a Project Athena Chromebook, there's an expectation of speed and power that the Spin 713 absolutely delivers on.
Even with dozens of tabs open and a couple of Android apps, this Chromebook keeps chugging along, though the fan may kick on from time to time — yes, an Intel Core i3, i5, or i7 requires a fan to keep it cool once you really get it going. The bottom of the laptop doesn't heat up too much, so you can still use it in your lap pretty easily, but you will hear the fan every now and then.
Acer differed the Chromebook Spin 713 from the first two Project Athena Chromebooks in two ways. Firstly, you actually have more than the USB-C ports; there's a USB-A port and an HDMI port on the 713, which means that you aren't scrambling for a USB-C hub immediately. Secondly, while there are some more pricey configurations if you want an i7, the standard i5/8GB/128GB model is a completely reasonable price.
If you want to game on a Chromebook — beyond Android apps and web-based games — there's still not much support yet beyond Stadia, but we know that Google is working to increase the Steam compatibility on Chromebooks through Chrome OS's Linux capabilities. Since the Spin 713 is Project Athena certified, it's going to be one of the Chromebooks with the best chance to actually take real advantage of it once Google and Steam have things where they want it.
In the meantime, this is still the best bang for your buck on a high-performance Chromebook, and that 3:2 aspect ratio on the screen is something many professionals swear by on their work machines. That aspect ratio isn't as fun for watching movies, but it's great for seeing more data on your screen at a time, especially while split-screening, and the 2K resolution gives you a more crisp image.
Best Chromebook for Gaming & Performance: Acer Chromebook Spin 713
If you're someone who loves a 3:2 screen and a beefy, beefy processor to power it, this Project Athena Chromebook is for you.
3. Lenovo Chromebook Duet
Best Chromebook Tablet
Bottom line: If you want a tablet that offers up the best of Google's services and software without instantly falling behind on software updates the way Android tablets do, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is the perfect couch companion that can pull double-duty as a light-duty laptop while your kids co-opt the family desktop.
Display size: 10.1-inch 400 nits 1920x1200px touchscreen | CPU: Mediatek Helio P60T | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 64-128GB | Battery life: 10 hours | Ports: 1x USB-C (USB 2.0 + DP) | Weight: 0.94 lb (tablet only) / 2.03 lbs (with cover & keyboard) | Colors: Two-tone Ice Blue and Iron Grey | Other features: USI Stylus compatibility, Included kickstand and detachable keyboard, 10W charger (max charging speed 18W) | Auto Update Expiration date: June 2028
|Storage||RAM||Vendor|
|64GB||4GB||$249 at Walmart|
|128GB||4GB||$299 at Best Buy|
Pros
Cons
Lenovo first debuted the Duet at CES and it gave us hope that we might see a Chromebook tablet finally done right. The Lenovo Chromebook Duet has a battery that goes on and on and on, especially if you're just doing some reading and casual games, and the screen is nice and bright for videos and comics. The specs say the battery lasts 10 hours, but I've averaged 10-12 hours on an average charge.
The detachable keyboard can feel cramped if you're using it for hours and hours on end — if you have larger hands, you'll probably want to invest in a full-size keyboard for your desk to use instead for stationary use — but as a companion device or a couch computer, the Duet is perfect. The screen is bright, videos are crisp, and comics look lovely. The speakers are a bit on the quiet side, but as a slim 10-inch tablet, I'm fine with pairing headphones or a Bluetooth speaker to it for YouTube binges.
Since the day pre-orders opened, the Duet has been very, very hard to find in stock, so if this seems like the Chromebook for you, you'll want to check back early and often to see if the stock has just been refreshed. It's worth the wait for a Chromebook tablet that's affordable, reliable, and fully-accessorized out of the box, having learned from the Google Pixel Slate's mistakes.
There's only one port on the Duet, one single USB-C port, so you'll want to use Bluetooth for headphones and leave the port free for charging. The lack of a headphone jack is not a huge loss, but some will be turned off by it; I'm more disappointed there isn't a USB-C port of both sides the way that basically every Chromebook released in the last two years has.
It's worth mentioning that the charger in the box here is a piddly little 10W USB-A charger — Hey, Lenovo had to cut costs somewhere — so you'll likely want to swap that out for an 18W Power Delivery charger instead. The Duet still charges in less than 90 minutes, but I do wish it at least had 30W charging instead of the same 18W charging that most phones use.
Since there's no microSD slot for expanding the internal storage, do yourself a favor and buy the 128GB version if you're intending to download lots of videos and comics for those holiday trips home to see the family.
Best Chromebook Tablet: Lenovo Chromebook Duet
The Duet finally gives us the kind of Google tablet we've wanted for a decade. It comes with a keyboard for when you need it, but it works well all on its own.
4. Acer Chromebook Spin 311 (CP311-3H): Best Compact Chromebook
Bottom line: 11.6-inch Chromebooks still make up a massive section of the Chromebook market, and the best blend of power, portability, and price to be found right now is the latest generation of the Acer Chromebook Spin 311. It sheds ports in exchange for a lighter weight and battery that will go all day and then some.
Display size: 11.6-inch 1366x768px IPS touchscreen | CPU: Mediatek MT8183C | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32-64GB | Battery life: 14 hours | Ports: 1x USB-C, 1x USB-A, audio combo jack | Weight: 2.65 lbs | Colors: Pure Silver | Other features: 720p camera, 45W charger | Auto Update Expiration date: Jun 2028
|Storage||RAM||Vendor|
|32GB||4GB||$300 at Target|
|64GB||4GB||$330 at Walmart|
We highly recommend purchasing the 64GB configuration due to the lack of microSD slot.
Pros
Cons
Normally when you're shopping for a new laptop, it's easy to get caught up in specs and end up buying the biggest, most powerful laptop you can afford. However, for Chromebooks, that isn't necessarily going to get you a better experience. Big screens and fancy features are all well and good, but most of the time when I leave my apartment to go do some writing in a brighter and more fun atmosphere, I bring a lightweight 11.6-inch Chromebook like the Acer Chromebook Spin 311.
Acer slimmed down the sides of the 311 and pared down on ports while it was at it, but you still get a USB-C port for 45W Power Delivery charging as well as using hubs, adapters, and external monitors, a USB-A port for legacy peripherals like wired keyboards and old flash drives, and a 3.5mm audio combo jack. You may have noticed that list did not include a microSD slot, a rarity for a Chromebook in this price range, and yeah it's weird that we don't have one. At least we have a 64GB version if you care about storage.
This new model is also slated for almost eight years of Chrome OS updates, with an AUE date of June 2028. It's lightweight and highly portable, easy to slide into a bag as you move from meeting to meeting and quick to wake back up once you get where you're going. The bezels around the screen are large, but they come in handy when you flip it over into tablet mode, and the keyboard is easy to type on for hours at a time.
Speaking of hours at a time, Acer says that this Chromebook can last up to 16 hours in its spec sheet, and with real work use, I usually get 12-14 hours on a single charge depending on how much I crank up the screen brightness.

While light on ports, the next-gen 311 still has enough power and storage in a night, lightweight package.
5. ASUS Chromebook Flip C434: Best Balanced Chromebook
Bottom line: The ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 is essentially a 14-inch Chromebook in a 13-inch shell, offering you a bigger screen while still being portable. Between its thin, solid construction, excellent battery life, and options for higher RAM and storage, the C434 is a Chromebook that can do it all. One of the few Chromebooks to offer a backlit keyboard, it's perfect for long nights and dim offices.
Display size: 14-inch 1080p IPS touchscreen | CPU: Intel Core m3 / i3 / i5 | RAM: 4-16GB | Storage: 64-512GB | Battery life: 10 hours | Ports: 1x USB-A, 2x USB-C, microSD, audio combo jack | Weight: 3.30 lbs | Colors: Spangle Silver | Other features: Backlit keyboard, 720p camera, 45W charger | Auto Update Expiration date: June 2026
|Processor||Storage||RAM||Vendor|
|Intel Core m3||64GB||4GB||$570 at Amazon|
|Intel Core m3||64GB||8GB||$594 at Amazon|
We recommend the Intel Core m3 version with 8GB of RAM as it is the best balance of performance and value.
Pros
Cons
ASUS is one of the most well-known Chromebook manufacturers, and has been since day one. What sets the company apart from the competition is a focus on creating a premium hardware experience in as compact a shell as possible. With the the Chromebook Flip C434, ASUS crammed what is essentially a 14-inch Chromebook into a 13-inch body.
ASUS focuses on the fundamentals here, including a really high-quality 1080p LCD touch panel surrounded by slim bezels, along with an oversized precision trackpad, a backlit keyboard — a rarity at this price point — and a tapered aluminum design that's reminiscent of the MacBook Air.
The hinge flips 360-degrees, which lets you set the Chromebook up in traditional, "tent", and tablet modes — hence the Flip in the name — all in a body under three pounds. The included Intel Core m3-8100y processor isn't the fastest one available, but it's more than good enough for daily usage, especially when paired with the optional 8GB of RAM — which you should get if you intend to do a lot of multi-tasking during video calls. There's also a model with an i5 processor and 128GB of storage, but those are so hard to find now that you're better off getting the newer C436 instead.
As for inputs, you get two USB-C ports and a single USB-A port along with a microSD card slot. The laptop advertises eight to 10 hours of battery, and that's around what we usually got, too. Ports are one of the reasons why I'm still recommended the C434 over the newer ASUS Chromebook Flip C436; the C436 only has USB-C ports and microSD, no USB-A port. Yes, USB-C hubs are plentiful, but having at least one USB-A port on a laptop is very useful, especially for a laptop this big.
The other reason I recommend the C434 over the C436 is that the C434 has more consistent battery life — though the C436's battery has improved after the launch bugs were quashed — and the price. As the newer, shinier, more premium version of C434 with beefier processors, upgraded RAM and SSD storage over eMMC storage, the C436 is hundreds more than last year's model while offering a performance boost that most people will never be able to really take advantage of. The C434 is like an Audi while the C436 is like an Alfa Romeo: there's premium and then there's more-money-than-sense.

The 14-inch touchscreen excels at multitasking, and the backlit keyboard is easy to type on late into the night.
5. ASUS Chromebook Flip C214
Best Chromebook for Students
Bottom line: Lightweight and portable, the ASUS Chromebook Flip C214 is one of the most versatile Chromebooks out there. It's got a spill-resistant keyboard and has been Mil-STD 810G certified, which means a drop from a bag or table won't hurt it, making it perfect for a student of any age. Plus, the included stylus makes it school-friendly!
Display size: 11.6-inch 1366x768px touchscreen | CPU: Intel Celeron N4000 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB | Battery life: 12 hours | Ports: 2x USB-C, 1x USB-A, microSD, Audio combo jack | Weight: 2.6 lbs | Colors: Black | Other features: 720p camera, 45W charger, optional built-in stylus | Auto Update Expiration date: June 2026
|Storage||RAM||Stylus||Vendor|
|32GB||4GB||🚫||$400 at Amazon|
|32GB||4GB||✅||$450 at Amazon|
Pros
- Durable, drop-resistant build
- Spill-resistant keyboard
- Built-in stylus (on some models)
- 360-degree hinge
Cons
The 11.6-inch ASUS Chromebook Flip C214 folds completely flat into a tablet with a high-strength zinc alloy hinge that shouldn't wear out no matter how hard your kid — or you — are on it. With a channeled, spill-resistant keyboard, dropping a drink on it shouldn't immediately send you to a repair store, just to the kitchen for a cloth.
ASUS has a number of student-friendly features on the C214, including a fully-articulating hinge, a built-in stylus on the premium model, and plenty of ports for plugging in accessories. The main draw here, though, is how portable the laptop is: it can fit in the smallest of backpacks, making it perfect for kids starting out bringing a laptop to school.
You're also going to get a very school-friendly battery life of around 12 hours of use, which should get most people through a full day. Even better, ASUS has thought of every use case, adding a rubberized grip to the edges of the C214, ensuring that clumsy hands won't drop it while toting it around the classroom, and the anti-scratch coating should keep it from looking too scuffed after months and years of constant attention.
There's only 4GB of RAM, which should be just fine for everyday homework and research. I would try to keep the amount of tab-switching while on video calls under control, but 4GB should be enough for most kids' workloads. 8GB would be better, but there's no option for it on this generation. Maybe on the next version.
The other problem facing the C214 isn't a product issue, it's a market issue. This year's surge in distance learning and working from home led to a run on education-grade Chromebooks, so while you can find the C214 pretty easily, chances are the price will be marked up about $50-$100 by resellers. It's a captive market and resellers are taking full advantage, but I wouldn't go higher than $450 for the non-stylus version or $500 for the stylus version.

This version of the C214 improves on the 2017 model in about every way: slimmer, more powerful, and better optimized.
7. HP Chromebook x360 14c Best Business Chromebook
Bottom line: While there are flashier Chromebooks out there, if you want an understated business laptop that won't make you pay hundreds for a Chrome Enterprise upgrade or security features, HP has you covered with the HP Chromebook x360 14c. Just do yourself a favor and get either the Intel Core i3 or i5 models.
Display size: 14-inch 1920x1080px IPS touchscreen | CPU: Intel Pentium Gold / Intel Core i3 / Intel Core i5 | RAM: 4-8GB | Storage: 64-128GB | Battery life: 13.5 hours | Ports: 2x USB-C, 1x USB-A, microSD slot, audio combo jack | Weight: 3.6 lbs | Colors: Mineral Grey | Other features: Wi-Fi 6, BT 5.0, backlit keyboard, fingerprint sensor, USI stylus support | Auto Update Expiration date: June 2028
|Processor||Storage||RAM||Vendor|
|Intel Pentium Gold||64GB||4GB||$399 at Walmart|
|Intel Core i3||64GB||8GB||$629 at Best Buy|
|Intel Core i5||128GB||8GB||$750 at HP|
We recommend the i3/8GB configuration for the best balance of power and pricing, as well as having extra RAM for extended multi-tasking while on video conferences.
Pros
- Solid build and performance
- Large 2-in-1 Chromebook
- Ample configuration options
- Security features like fingerprint sensor, kill switch
Cons
One of the segments Chromebooks built their reputation on was enterprise because Chromebooks are affordable, reliable, and so drop-dead easy to deploy and manage. The deployment benefits aren't all that useful to the everyday consumer, but the durability and ever-increasing amount of power and longevity that has been coming to business Chromebooks — especially in the last two years — is. Take the HP Chromebook x360 14c, for example. This isn't the beefiest of HP's business Chromebooks, but it offers a great amount of power and versatility while staying affordable for those working from home or at a BYOD (bring your own device) company.
Like many of the Project Athena and Enterprise Chromebooks that have arrived in 2020, the HP Chromebook x360 14c has a fingerprint sensor for easier log-ins after you've unlocked your Chromebook once earlier in the day. You also have a physical kill switch on the side of the laptop that disables the camera, not just some flimsy plastic slider that can get stuck or slide open at the slightest jostle.
HP gives you a choice of processors on the x360 14c, but unless you absolutely have a hard limit to your budget, I recommend skipping the Pentium Gold models and instead grabbing the i3 or i5 models so that you have a little more power for your multi-window sessions and any Linux apps you might use. The i3 and i5 models are also the only models that come with 8GB of RAM, which you should absolutely spring for if this is intended to be a full-time working laptop.
The 2-in-1 form factor might not seem like it's all that useful for a laptop this big — and yeah, a 14-inch tablet is a bit much — but being able to flip it back into stand mode is wonderful if you have a workstation at work with an extra monitor or a mechanical keyboard. Stand mode allows you to get that nice big touchscreen closer to your hands so that it's easier to tap on while hard at work, and after hours, you can kick it into stand mode again to keep the keyboard out of the way while you're watching movies in bed, or playing Freecell while you wait for the next meeting to roll around.

From the premium finishes to the hardware and software focus on privacy, to the performance and specs, the x360 14c is great for work (and play).
8. Google Pixelbook Go: Best Chromebook for New Features
Bottom line: Google's own Chromebook, the Pixelbook Go, is a traditional clamshell laptop with one of the best keyboards and trackpads we've ever used. It also has excellent integration with Google Assistant, and may get new Chrome OS features before other Chromebooks. The magnesium body is light and strong, and even the entry-level model comes with 8GB of RAM for plenty of tab-hopping.
Display size: 13.3-inch 1080p touchscreen / 13.3-inch 4K touchscreen | CPU: Intel 8th Gen Core m3 / i5 / i7 | RAM: 8-16GB | Storage: 64-256GB | Battery life: 12 hours | Ports: 2x USB-C, audio combo jack | Weight: 2.3-2.4 lbs | Colors: Just Black or Not Pink | Other features: 1080p camera, 45W charger, Titan security chip | Auto Update Expiration date: June 2026
|Processor||Storage||RAM||Vendor|
|Intel Core m3||64GB||8GB||$649 at Amazon|
|Intel Core i5||128GB||8GB||$849 at Amazon|
|Intel Core i5||128GB||16GB||$999 at Amazon|
|Intel Core i7||256GB||16GB||$1248 at Amazon|
Pros
Cons
While the 3:2 form factor of the original Pixelbook certainly had its fans, I'm pleased as punch that the Go uses a far more sensible 16:9 aspect ratio, which is better for split-screening and better for in-flight movies. The Pixelbook Go can't fold back into tablet mode like the Pixelbook — and most other Chromebooks on the market — but that also means it didn't need huge grippable bezels around the screen, allowing it to squeeze down into a slim footprint. This laptop, despite a spacious 13.3-inch display, only weighs 2.3 pounds.
Another great feature of the Go is a more functional design that's still luxurious. The Go has rounded edges and a wavy ridged bottom that increases grip and stability. The Pixelbook Go also has two colors — Not Pink and Just Black — quiet keys that are among the best we've ever typed on, and a lightweight magnesium body similar to that used by the Microsoft Surface line.
If you live for having the latest features, the Pixelbook Go is for you because, as Google's branded Chromebook, this shiny baby gets all the new toys before anyone else does, especially once you hop onto the Beta or Dev channels. You'll also want to invest in some USB-C hubs, as the Pixelbook Go only has three ports: a USB-C port on either side of the laptop and a headphone jack.
While Google charges a premium for this Pixelbook compared to our other top picks, the Pixelbook Go is one of our favorite traditional laptop designs. Every aspect of the design has been considered, from the quiet-close magnetic latch to the high-quality 1080p camera, so important in our current environment.
Thankfully, if you're willing to spend a bit more, Google offers premium Pixelbook Go options that go up to a Core i7 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage — though we recommend sticking with the Core i5 version that has a generous 8GB of RAM and 128GB storage.
Best Chromebook for New Features: Google Pixelbook Go
While not a 2-in-1, the Pixelbook Go is a powerful, premium clamshell Chromebook with a magnificent magnesium shell.
9. Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Best 4K Chromebook
Bottom line: If you want the absolute best screen you can get on a Chromebook, you know it's got to be a Samsung. The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook is not only beautiful, it is powerful, with a 10th Gen i5 processor and 256GB SSD storage. This is a super-thin, fanless laptop with an i5, so just keep in mind this laptop will get hot during longer sessions.
Display size: 13.3-inch 3840x2160px (4K) AMOLED touchscreen | CPU: 10th Gen Intel Core i5 | RAM: 8GB | Storage: 256GB | Battery life: 8 hours | Ports: 2x USB-C, microSD, audio combo jack | Weight: 2.29 lbs | Colors: Fiesta Red or Mercury Grey | Other features: Project Athena certified, backlit keyboard, fingerprint sensor, fanless, built-in stylus, front and rear cameras, 45W charger | Auto Update Expiration date: June 2028
|Color||Storage||RAM||Vendor|
|Fiesta Red||256GB||8GB||$999 at Amazon|
|Mercury Grey||256GB||8GB||$999 at Amazon|
Pros
Cons
Chromebooks with 4K screens are still a relatively small and elite group, and if you want a 4K Chromebook that's actually light enough to carry around all day without having to blow an entire month's rent, Samsung's latest and greatest Chromebook is the one for you. The Galaxy Chromebook features a 4K screen, a 10th gen i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. This is the brass ring, folks.
As a Project Athena Chromebook, it is powerful and secure, offering a fingerprint sensor in the top right corner of the keyboard and Chrome OS's sandboxed system for apps. The Galaxy also comes with a built-in, pressure-sensitive pen — similar to the ones we find on the Note series — and it's a 2-in-1 so that you can turn it into a drawing tablet or prop it up in bed for a movie marathon.
The only downside to the Galaxy Chromebook — apart from that price tag — is that its thin profile means that the bottom of the Chromebook can get warm during intensive sessions. Battery also is also a bit lower than we'd expect, but Google and Samsung are working on some optimizations to help bring it back up to the 8 hours we expect from a Chromebook.

Whether you want the latest specs for your work or the best screen around for watching movies, this gives you both.
10. Acer Chromebook 715 Best Budget Workhorse
Bottom line: If you want a big screen for less, Acer offers up an understated Chromebook with an i3 processor and plenty of storage and a 15-inch touchscreen without breaking the bank. This is a Chromebook that's made to get things done, especially with its number pad keyboard for entering grades and other figures.
Display size: 15.6-inch 1920x1080px IPS (optional touchscreen) | CPU:Intel Pentium 4417U / Intel Core i3 / i5 | RAM: 4-16GB | Storage: 32-128GB | Battery life: 10 hours | Ports: 1x USB-A, 2x USB-C, microSD, audio combo jack | Weight: 4.3 lbs | Colors: Grey | Other features: Full-size keyboard with numpad, 720p webcam, 45W charger | Auto Update Expiration date: June 2025
|Processor||Storage||RAM||Vendor|
|Intel Core i3||128GB||4GB||$389 at Walmart|
|Intel Core i5||64GB||16GB||$746 at B&H|
Pros
Cons
While the Acer Chromebook 715 is "just okay" in a few areas — the screen is adequate but not stellar, speakers are tinny at times — it adds up to a reliable option if you want a big screen but not a big price. There aren't many 15-inch Chromebooks in this price range these days — and even fewer with touchscreens — so that helps the overall unimposing 715 stand out in the rather crowded Chromebook lineup that Acer keeps cranking out.
A touchscreen on a clamshell laptop may seem superfluous, but I'm happy it's here. The fold-flat hinge here is sturdy enough that while you can open it with one hand, I almost always took the precaution of using two. I'm grateful for that rigidity; the lid wouldn't flop flat or slam shut when I pick it up off my lap the way some 2-in-1s do. Battery is likewise
As they say, "beauty lies within", and the power underneath the unassuming aluminum chassis is what should draw you to the Acer 715. The Intel i3 is a powerful processor perfect for professionals and power users. I wish it was paired with 8GB of RAM, but 4GB has been enough in my limited time with my review model so far. Like the Lenovo C340-15, the 715 comes with a Numpad on its keyboard, another benefit for number-crunchers and teachers with dozens of grades to enter.
There is an even more powerful configuration available, but given the exorbitant asking price, I don't think the 16GB RAM is worth it. The standard i5/4GB/128GB model offers extra storage for downloaded videos/apps while still being powerful enough to get your work done, and it's the price performer.
Best Budget Workhorse: Acer Chromebook 715
Build quality is solid on the powerful but understated Acer Chromebook 715, which makes it great for office work but a bit big for travel.
What are the best Chromebooks you can buy today?
The beauty of the Chromebook market is that there are so many options to choose from. If you want something specifically for portability and battery life, there are numerous great choices. Similarly, if you don't plan to move it from a desk and would prefer a big, beautiful display and plenty of CPU power to back it up, there are lots of options for you, too.
Our top pick is the Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook, which hits all of the right markets when it comes to a laptop, including build quality, performance, battery life, and longevity, all for a very fair price. The only problems with the Flex 5 were that it's been selling out very quickly the last several months — but supply seems to have stabilized — and that it doesn't have an 8GB RAM option for those who are more demanding on their system.
If you want an 8GB Chromebook that looks fabulous and won't break the bank, grab the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, which will run you a little more money but comes with a brighter 2K screen in a 3:2 aspect ratio. As a Project Athena Chromebook, the Spin 713 is powerful enough for gaming and running virtualization software like Parallels. Not everyone will need it, but if you do, this is the one to beat.
On the more compact and lightweight side of the things, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is an excellent companion device while the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 is a good 11.6-inch Chromebook for students and light on-the-go work.
How to pick the best Chromebook for you
Chromebooks might get pegged as only being for students and salarymen. Still, there truly is a Chromebook for everybody these days, whether you're just browsing email and social media or getting down and dirty with Linux apps and coding IDEs. While there are a lot of great Chromebook manufacturers out there, Lenovo and ASUS's models seem to go harder and last longer than the competition, though Samsung, Dell, and HP can make some pretty premium Chromebooks when they put their minds to it.
Choosing your Chromebook is slightly different than picking a Windows or Mac laptop due to the standardized, cloud-centric nature of Chrome OS. Because Google controls the software look and update schedule for every Chromebook model, a Chromebook built by Lenovo should act the same as a Chromebook from Dell or Samsung. So what does that mean?
It means you can focus a little less on those core specs and focus more on what you want to do with the machine you choose. This process may seem slightly out of order, but trust me on this one:
1. Get one with a touchscreen — a 2-in-1 if you can
Touchscreens may be a luxury for other laptop systems, but on Chromebooks, I consider it a requirement. Chrome OS's touch optimization is getting better every month, and since most of the Android apps Chromebooks can install via Google Play are optimized for touch, treat yourself to a touchscreen model!
Touchscreen models usually aren't that much more expensive for Chromebooks in 2019 — many Chromebook models don't even bother with non-touchscreen versions these days — but if you see a Chromebook that says it's non-touch, walk away and don't look back. It's a beautiful thing to be able to tap on the screen when scrolling through Amazon, and after playing Solitaire on a touchscreen, you'll never go back to using a mouse.
That touchscreen comes in even handier on 2-in-1s, the best form factor I've seen for Chromebooks yet. Being able to prop up your Chromebook in Tent mode for a movie, or fold it flat into Tablet mode for some in-bed browsing while down with the flu is amazing, but having a 360-degree hinge is excellent for everyday productivity, too. You can bend your Chromebook back to more angles when working in awkwardly-lit offices with weird light glare or propped in your lap at a ballgame because you didn't forget those quarterly expense reports that were due tomorrow and refuse to skip the game for that.
2. Decide on the other features you want
Chrome OS is almost entirely the same on every device from a software perspective, which means that standout hardware features become paramount, and figuring out which of those features you want or need in a machine can help narrow the field and steer you to your perfect Chromebook.
As mentioned before, you want a touchscreen Chromebook — a 2-in-1 if you can swing it — but if you tend to do a lot of movie-watching, you may want a high-quality screen, or loud, front-facing speakers.
If you're looking to be more productive with a multitude of open tabs and multi-window screens, you might want a 3:2 display that's more suited to split-screening and a more powerful processor/memory configuration. Productivity-minded users should also pay special mind to the port configurations on their prospective Chromebooks, as USB-C starts to replace most other ports on more premium Chromebooks like the Pixelbook while more grounded models keep USB-A ports around alongside new USB-C charging ports.
Families with younger kids — or travelers that are prone to slips, spills, and accidents — might want to look to the growing number of Chromebooks with military-grade MIL-STD 810G durability or spill-resistant keyboards.
3. Pick your size
Chromebooks come in a variety of sizes, but they tend to gravitate to four sizes in general:
- 11.6-inch models are portable and affordable. At their smaller size, their screens can look good, even if they're less than 1080p native resolution — though screen resolution is handled a bit differently on Chrome OS; we'll get to that a little later. Depending on the bezels on the screen, 11.6-inch Chromebooks can either have full-sized keys or slightly shrunken keys, though most manufacturers use full-size keys on 11.6-inch models.
- 12.3-12.5-inch models are becoming more and more popular, especially with detachables and 2-in-1s like the HP Chromebook X2, Microsoft's Surface Pro line, and the Google Pixel Slate. These models often have a 3:2 aspect ratio, which makes them more useful for split-screening windows, multitasking, and sketch/photography apps.
- 14-inch models sit at the high margin for the portable category. Still, with thin bezels and proper engineering, these can be almost as portable and manageable as 13-inch laptops with 7-9 hour battery lives. If you need to display your text at a larger font — and yes, Chrome OS has a separate font scale independent of the display zoom — a 14-inch model is your best bet for a productive Chromebook that won't strain your eyes, especially as most 14-inch models start at 1080p.
- 15.6-inch models are made for desks and dining room tables. I lovingly refer to these as LINOs — Laptop in name only — because while you can shove them into larger laptop backpacks for a vacation, these Chromebooks aren't made for laps and tray tables, they are made for a standard office environment where they usually live in peace. These larger laptops are great for productivity because you can see more at one time, but they tend to have shorter battery lives and higher weights, which dissuade them from being dragged around daily.
In general, the bigger the size of your Chromebook, the more you can potentially fit on the screen, but it will also be less portable and shorter in battery life. The smaller it is, the less heavy and (usually) less expensive it will be. Still, smaller models can also suffer from lower resolution screens, though Chrome OS's display zoom and font adjustments can somewhat offset it.
4. Memory and storage — what do you really need?
RAM — Random Access Memory — is a critical spec for computers of all sizes and shapes, from phones and tablets to desktops and laptops. It's used by your computer's processor(s) to hold your current tabs, apps, and execute the commands, clicks, and operations that make your Chromebook work.
So how much RAM do I need? 4 GB of RAM in a Chromebook is fine today. 8 GB is better, and high-end Chromebooks can come with 16 GB or more, but 4 GB of RAM is more than enough to run Chrome OS with a couple of apps and a dozen Chrome tabs.
If you're a long-time Windows user — or a long-time computer user of any kind — looking at the storage on most Chromebooks will seem confusing at first because it's not going to sound like enough. Chrome OS is based around cloud storage — Google Drive is integrated directly into the Files app — but local storage is still essential for things like Android apps from Google Play, offline documents and downloaded music/movies for those horrible Wi-Fi-less flights.
You can also expand the storage on many Chromebooks with an SD or microSD card, but there's no beating proper local storage to start with. 32 GB of storage is workable, but I'd recommend going with a model with at least 64 GB of storage. Finding 128 GB or more is usually reserved for premium Chromebooks with heftier price tags, but 64 GB Chromebooks are pretty widely available and offer more than enough storage for some Drive offline syncing and some emergency entertainment.
5. Always check the expiration date!
Chrome OS is developed, managed and updated by Google for all Chromebooks, but Google doesn't want to be stuck supporting every random budget chipset and driver set forever, so each Chromebook has a shelf life and an expiration date, just like the milk in your fridge! This is the Auto Update Expiration date, and it can be found for every single model on this handy dandy support page, which I have bookmarked because I am a freak and you should check often while you're shopping for Chromebooks.
Now, a Chromebook doesn't turn into a pumpkin on its AUE date — assuming your Chromebook lasts three to six years until that date — but it does stop receiving those system updates every Chromebook gets every four to six weeks that contain bug fixes, security patches, and new features. If your Chromebook is still running decently at that time, you're a champ, and with a teeny bit of know-how, you can reformat it to run one of a dozen Linux distros instead.
That said, four to six years is a long time for any laptop and chances are yours will be getting long in the tooth by then, but right now, when shopping, always check the AUE to see how long your Chromebook will get updates. Some Chromebooks have shorter lifetimes than others if they're built on the same platform as a previous Chromebook — AUE is based on the hardware platform, not individual model, which is also why many Chromebooks have the same AUE dates — so it's something you'll always want to check before buying, even if the model itself is brand-new.
What is Chrome OS?
Chromebooks run Chrome OS, the Google-managed version of Chromium OS, a free Linux distribution that is open-source, lightweight, and web-centric. Chrome OS does not allow you to install regular applications and programs the way you would on Windows PCs; instead, Chromebooks rely on web-based applications, Android applications installed and managed via Google Play, and Linux apps, which are slowly rolling out to more and more Chromebook models.
Chrome OS's biggest strength lies in its lightweight stability and reliability. On computers with specs that barely support other operating systems, Chrome OS runs adequately and often excellently, meaning that for lower-end laptops, Chromebooks rule! That said, Chrome can take advantage of the most potent components available — from latest-gen multi-core processors to 4K displays — to create a super-smooth, super-powered premium experience.
Chrome OS is designed in large part for education and enterprise, which means the system is hard-to-break, easy-to-manage — all updates are handled in the background by the system itself — and wonderfully secure, with a lucrative bounty program, including a huge standing bounty for anyone who finds ways to compromise Chrome OS in its extra-locked-down Guest mode.
In short, Chrome OS is a lightweight, high-security system that's great for users with any level of technical know-how. Chromebooks are easy enough for school children to use and powerful enough for bigshot businesspeople, which means that they're great for everyone that doesn't need system-specific high-intensity programs like video editors, CAD rendering, and PC gaming — and even that's coming to Chromebooks soon with Stadia.
What are the best Chromebooks for students?
For students — and younger users in general — you'll want to look for a rugged machine a portable size. 11.6-inch Chromebooks are 10-inch Chromebook tablets dominate the space, with slightly older/lower specs to help offset their robust requirements and cut-throat pricing.
You should check out our full rundown on the best Chromebooks for students, but these are our favorites:
ASUS Chromebook Flip C214 ($480 at Amazon)
This new model improves on the C213 in just about every way: the secondary camera is in a better position, the rugged body is slightly slimmer, and the performance and battery are still rock solid.
Dell Chromebook 3100 2-in-1 (From $369 from Dell)
Two USB-A and USB-C ports, rugged body, and a keyboard that can withstand 12 ounces of liquid, and configurations available for 8GB of RAM or 64GB of storage make this a pricier Chromebook, but one that's built to last. Dell's got it backordered through February, though...
Lenovo Chromebook Duet ($299 at Best Buy)
For younger users that are consuming content more than writing it, this Chromebook tablet with its detachable keyboard is perfect for watching videos, drawing in art apps, and easing children into Chrome OS before they start using regular Chromebooks in school.
Acer Chromebook Spin 311 (3H) ($329 at Walmart (64GB))
This Chromebook doesn't have the same rugged rating as the rest of these education-minded Chromebooks, but it does have a great price and a bright look.
Acer Chromebook 715 ($410 at Walmart)
Does your kid prefer a bigger screen for split-screening their homework and Twitch? This Chromebook offers a nice big touchscreen with a number pad for easily inputting math answers.
Once you've got your priorities straight and pick the Chromebook that's perfect for you, you're ready to enter a new world of light, secure computing with the handy productivity of Chrome and Android apps from Google Play. Welcome to the club, and enjoy!

Fortunately, since the Oculus Quest runs a version of Android, you can sideload apps onto it, including the Android version of Netflix that supports downloading content. When you open the correct version of Netflix in your Oculus Quest, it runs in a VR theater that has a gigantic virtual screen.
Getting the correct version of Netflix
It's important that you sideload the correct version of Netflix onto your Oculus Quest. The latest version of the application looks like it's working, and even allows you to download content, but won't allow you to view any content, offline or otherwise.
In my testing, version 4.16.0 of Netflix works perfectly. It can stream content and view downloaded content when the headset is disconnected from Wi-Fi. You might run into a prompt to update to a newer version, but you should skip that as it might prevent Netflix from being able to view content on your Oculus Quest.
Sideloading apps onto your Oculus Quest
Sideloading apps onto the Oculus Quest is relatively easy thanks to SideQuest. You can check out our full guide to sideloading apps on the Oculus Quest or read the relevant steps for sideloading Netflix onto the Oculus Quest below.
The first thing that you need to do with your Oculus Quest to sideload apps is enable developer mode. This is done through the Oculus app on your phone.
- Open the Oculus app.
- Select Settings.
Select your Oculus Quest headset.
- Select more settings.
- Select developer mode.
Toggle the developer mode setting to on.
- This opens a website (unless you've unlocked developer options on an Oculus device before).
- Scroll down and select the link below create an organization.
- Log in to your Oculus account
- Enter the name of your "organization" (this can be anything).
- Select submit
- Agree to the terms of agreement.
- Open the Oculus app again.
- Select Settings.
- Select your Oculus Quest headset.
- Select more settings.
- Select developer mode.
- Toggle the developer mode setting to on if it isn't already switched on.
How to set up SideQuest on your PC
Next, you'll need to get SideQuest ready on your PC. You'll have to download SideQuest from GitHub and install it. It's an executable file so if you've used those before it should work as any other. You can download it on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process on Windows.
- Go to SideQuest's Github page.
- Download the version appropriate for your device.
- Click on the downloaded file.
- You'll get a pop-up from Windows that says "Windows protected your PC." Select more info.
Click Run anyway.
- Click extract.
- Open the folder that you extracted it to.
- Find the folder SideQuest-win32-x64.
- Double click SideQuest.exe.
How to connect your Oculus Quest and SideQuest
To set up SideQuest and to install any applications, you'll need to connect your Oculus Quest and your PC.
- Connect your Oculus Quest to your PC using a USB-C cable.
- Select Connect Device in SideQuest
- Put on your headset and select Allow USB debugging.
- Make sure to check Always allow from this computer.
- Install the App Launcher by selecting Install App Launcher on SideQuest on your PC.
The app launcher creates an Unknown Sources folder in your Oculus Quest's library so you can easily find apps and games that you've sideloaded. You can now install APKs onto your Oculus Quest.
How to install apps through SideQuest
SideQuest has a library of apps available directly through the app, but the version of Netflix you need isn't one of them. Instead, you can install it through SideQuest with just a few steps.
- Download version 4.16.0 of Netflix.
- Select Repos in SideQuest.
Drag and drop the Netflix APK file over the SideQuest Window.
That's it! You now have the Android version of Netflix on your Oculus Quest. To open it, just go to Unknown Sources in your Oculus Quest libary and find Netflix through the SideQuest-TV section.

The best VR Prime Day deals from this reality
Prime Day is upon us, so stock up on these great VR accessories and hardware while the deals last!When times get dark, we need bright light to see our way out — and the brightest LED smart bulbs make it that much better. A high-lumen (unit for measuring the quantity of light) bulb can do the trick in a small or large room. Adding in some smarts to that bulb gives it the flexibility to control from your favorite smart speaker or phone. Whether you want a standard A19 E26 bulb or the BR30 for recessed lighting, there's a bulb for you. The Feit Electric OM100 is our top pick for its incredibly high lumen rating and hubless smart controls, which means it only needs Wi-Fi and your phone to control.
- Best Overall: Feit Electric OM100 - RGBW
- Runner-up: Novostella 13W RGBCW
- Best Budget: Wyze Bulb four-pack
- Best BR30 Style: LIFX BR30 Multi Colored
- Runner-up BR30: TECKIN Smart Light
- Best Overall Standard Style (Hub): Sengled Smart LED Extra Bright Soft White A19 Bulb
- Runner-up (Hub): Philips Hue White A19 Starter Kit
Best Overall: Feit Electric OM100 - RGBW
While Feit Electric may not be the well known smart bulbs, but it's been innovating and creating high-quality lighting solutions since 1978 — and the OM100 RGBW bulb continues that trend. Since this bulb doesn't require extra hardware such as a hub, this Wi-Fi-enabled smart LED bulb is simple to set up. It has a peak output of 1,600 lumens making it these brightest LED smart bulbs on the list, which is equal to a traditional 100W incandescent bulb — that's some serious light. You'll get a tunable white with a color temperature range from 2700K soft white to 6500K daylight, along with millions of RGB colors to pick from.
Feit Electric not only created an ultra-bright LED bulb here, but it also made it so that integration with Alexa, SmartThings, and Google Assistant is a snap. The inclusion of 2.4GHz Wi-Fi means all you need is to connect it to your Wi-Fi, and you're up and running. Feit Electric also has an app that is compatible with iOS and Android, so if you don't have a smart speaker or prefer not to use voice commands, you have that option.
Within the app, you can set the brightness of your bulb(s) as well as tune the colors. There are also some scenes and schedules that you can configure to automate your lighting. This bulb's connectivity features allow you to take full advantage of its very high brightness to illuminate your darkest spaces best.
Pros:
Cons:
- The app can be finicky
- Brightest setting only applies to white color tone
- Limited preset scenes in the app
Best Overall
Feit Electric OM100 - RGBW
It's so bright
Feit Electric OM100 is the brightest LED smart bulb that is also hubless. Meaning you all you need is Wi-Fi to get it just right.
Runner-up: Novostella 13W RGBCW
Novostella's 13W standard smart bulb may have landed in second place due to its lower lumen count, but it still has plenty of great features. At 1300LM, it also has plenty of light to brighten up most spaces quite well.
It utilizes an RGBCW LED array to net you a tunable white color range from 2700K to 6500K, while still garnering 16 million colors of fun as well. By using specific warm and cool white LEDs, Novostella's bulb produces some of the most accurate white ranges of all the bulbs on this list.
In terms of smarts, Novostella included 2.4GHz Wi-Fi so you can use the bulb with an Android or iOS app without the need for separate hardware. Through the Smart Life app, you can group lights, control brightness and colors, set up schedules, and even use some preset scenes. Luckily, the bulb is also compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, SmartThings, and even IFTTT so integrating it into your smart home is simple.
Pros:
- Great brightness with 1300LM
- Accurate whites
- Works with multiple smart home platforms
- App lets you control lights
Cons:
Runner-up
Novostella 13W RGBCW
Twice as white
This bulb is not only very bright but also has very accurate whites due to the dual white LEDs in addition to the RGB colors.
Best Budget: Wyze Bulb
You may know Wyze for its low-cost Wi-Fi cameras, but the company also makes some pretty great smart LED bulbs too. Aside from being a good quality bulb, you can also get them at a great price.
Sticking with what Wyze does best, which according to the company is to "make quality smart home technology accessible to everyone," the Wyze Bulb provides a good level of brightness and smart features without breaking the bank. At 800LM, this bulb is on the lower end of the spectrum when compared to the other options on this list, but it comes with a white color range of 2700K to 6500K. The bulb provides a good level of brightness for most rooms, and being able to set the color temperature is a great bonus.
Because these bulbs don't require a hub, pairing the light up to your Wi-Fi and phone is a simple process, and once complete, you can control brightness, color temperature, as well as set up schedules. Wyze Bulb is also compatible with Google Assistant and Alexa for added voice controls. Wyze also makes some smart sensors called Wyze Sense that can be used to extend the Wyze Bulbs features further.
Pros:
- Low cost of entry
- Tunable white colors
- Solid connectivity
- Can control through app or with smart assistants
- Wyze Sense adds more features
Cons:
Best Budget
Wyze Bulb four-pack
A bright buy
Wyze Bulb is a low cost tunable white Wi-Fi bulb, no RGB here. While not the brightest bulb, it gets the job done with flair.
Best BR30 Style: LIFX BR30 Multi Colored
When it comes to finding a recessed style smart light that is not only the brightest LED smart bulbs around but also has vibrant and rich colors, look no further than LIFX BR30 bulbs (the A19 standard bulbs are just as bright and vibrant). Bulbs from LIFX can be interwoven with your smart home without the need to add additional hardware to control the light. Since the bulbs are Wi-Fi enabled, simply connect them to your network using the LIFX app, and you're ready to go.
The LIFX app is robust and full of preset scenes, effects, schedules, and more. For further controls, these bulbs are also compatible with popular smart assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as Apple HomeKit and Samsung SmartThings. These integrations allow for voice commands and creating more customized actions by linking to other services within your smart home set up.
The bulb itself is designed to floodlight across surfaces, which is why it works wonderfully in recessed lighting fixtures built into ceilings and the like. Pumping out white color temps from warm 2500K to super-cool 9000K with up to 1100LM — these bulbs are bright. Aside from excellent brightness and an excellent range of whites, LIFX is known for some of the best color saturation with their bulbs. They also produce brilliant reds, blues, and greens to combine into millions of combinations to give you just the right vibe.
Pros:
- Amazing color vibrancy
- Easy to connect with existing smart home
- Extensive range of whites
- Robust app
Cons:
Best BR30 Style
LIFX BR30 Multi Colored
All the pretty colors
LIFX is known for its brightness and ultra-saturated colors for its Wi-Fi-only bulb with an app packed with features.
Best Value BR30: TECKIN Smart Light
TECKIN makes a very bright BR30 bulb at 1100LM, just like the LIFX bulb, but at a much lower price. However, if that were the only difference, then TECKIN would be sitting at the top of the BR30 list. This bulb deserves a spot on the list because of its high lumen output and wide range of connectivity options.
With over 16 million colors to choose from, you'll be able to find the perfect shade to get the mood just right. While it offers the same broad spectrum of colors, the color brightness and saturation just don't match that of the LIFX bulb. Nor, does the range of whites coming in with a warm setting of 2700K and cool temp of 6500K.
TECKIN does include 2.4GHz Wi-Fi to connect to the Smart Life app, which allows you to control colors and brightness as well as set up some scheduling and scenes. Along with app control, you can also connect the bulb to your Alexa devices, or Google Assistant-enabled speakers. IFTTT is another service that will work with TECKIN bulbs for some more smart home automation, but not Apple HomeKit.
Pros:
Cons:
Runner-up BR30
TECKIN Smart Light
Low cost lumens
TECKIN offers a bright bulb with good colors, in a Wi-Fi-only budget bulb. The app is lacking, but simple functions are there.
Best Overall Standard Style (Hub): Sengled Smart LED Extra Bright Soft White A19 Bulb
Sengled gave this smart LED bulb the moniker Extra Bright for a good reason since it cranks out up to 1500LM of brightness. That number puts these bulbs at number two for overall brightness on this list. The biggest drawback of this bulb is the color though — let me explain.
Sengled gave this bulb extra brightness but took away the ability to tune the color temperature. You are locked at 2700K, a softer and warmer light, which is fine in most situations. The upside is there is no question as to what setting the light needs to be at to ensure you can take full advantage of the full 1500LM of brightness.
In terms of smart controls, you get all of the scenes and routines that you can expect from a smart light when pairing with the Sengled Smart Hub. You can set up the Sengled bulb with hubs like SmartThings, Wink, and Zigbee enabled Amazon Echo devices. You can also enable to use of voice controls for Alexa or Google Assistant, but a hub must be connected to the bulb. So if you are good with a bulb that offers fantastic brightness in only a single color, then this is the bulb for you.
Pros:
Cons:
Best Overall Standard Style (Hub)
Sengled Smart LED Extra Bright Soft White A19 Bulb
Warm and bright
This bright bulb from Sengled is locked to a single color temp, which is fine, is easily set up on its hub for smart controls.
Runner-up (Hub): Philips Hue
Philips is one of the most popular smart light brands and for good reason. Its bulbs offer reliability, multiple form factors, and great connectivity. All of these come together to offer one of the best smart bulb experiences at 840LM. With so many of the smart LED lights out there offering 840LM, the experience must be top-notch — and with Philips Hue it is.
Philips Hue has built a catalog of smart bulbs that consists of light bars, A19 standard bulbs, BR30 style, and many others that offer some of the best smart features. Using the Philips Hue Hub brings a wide range of preset scenes, color and brightness controls, as well as scheduling — also smart assistant integration. One of the best features that come with Philips Hue is the ability to set a Power-on Behavior. That lets you determine what happens when the power comes back on — like resume a previous state —when the bulb loses power.
At 800LM, Philips Hue isn't the brightest bulb, but you won't be straining to see either. Philips offers a tunable white, color ambiance, and a single-color bulb that all have a peak brightness of 840LM. If you stick with the single-color white bulb, then getting started isn't too expensive. When you start adding colored bulbs and other form factors, the price can go up quickly. Also, the newer Philips Hue bulb offers Bluetooth controls so you can go hubless, just with fewer features.
Pros:
Cons:
Runner-up (Hub)
Philips Hue White A19 Starter Kit
There when you need it
Philips Hue makes up for its lack of brightness with rock-solid connectivity, great integrations, and wonderful app features.
What is a hub?
Hubs have both good and bad sides to them. On one hand, the hub is an extra piece of hardware to set up and manage. On the other, the hub creates a more solid connection to the devices it manages. The hub acts just as the name implies, a central place for all the bulbs to meet up. Using a hub also takes the strain off of your Wi-Fi network but taking all of those bulbs and talking to them directly via a language such as Zigbee or Z-Wave.
If you want to go the hub route, whether because your Wi-Fi may be spotty or the features the hub can offer, the brightest one on the block is the Sengled Smart LED Extra Bright Soft White A19 Bulb. At 1500LM, this bulb has plenty of brightness to go around. It's set to only one color and temperature, but 2700K is a good middle ground to be on.
Come to the light
Studies have shown that spending extended periods in the dark or low light areas can have adverse effects on a person's mental and physical health. This doesn't mean that your space has to be lit up like Time's Square, but a good light source is a great start. Using a high lumen smart bulb is a fantastic way to give you not only a well-lit area but also the ability to customize how the light can make you feel.
The easiest way to get started is with a bulb that doesn't require a hub to control its smart features, and not only does the Feit Electric OM100 RGBW bulb offer just that — it's also very very bright. Coming in at 1600LM, it's sure to illuminate almost any space you're in — while at the same time offering a full range of whites and millions of other colors. Offering simple set up using only your phone and your Wi-Fi to allow for complete control of all of those darkness killing lumens.
Regardless of which of these smart LED bulbs you decide to go with, know that all of these lights have the brightness to get your space from feeling dark and gloomy to bright and cheery in no time.

These are the best smart LED light bulbs that work with Google Home
The best Alexa-compatible smart lights
Amazon's Echo ecosystem of smart speakers is great for controlling smart bulbs from brands like LIFX and Philips Hue. The only trick is choosing the right bulb.
The best smart lights that work with the Google Assistant
Smart lights are essential for any smart home — especially ones that work with the Google Assistant. Need some help deciding what to buy? We're here to help!Google announced its second-generation wireless router just a few weeks back, and now the Nest Wifi is available at all your favorite retail destinations. Nest Wifi comes in three different colors to better match your home's decor: Sand, Snow, and Mist. While Google isn't yet supporting the new Wi-Fi 6 standard on its routers, it does have a much faster 4x4 5GHz radio setup and support for AC2200 speeds.
Now, a router isn't necessarily a cut-and-dry purchase. There are a few variables you should consider, and we're here to help with that. Folks with smaller homes or apartments (read: anything under 2,200 square feet) can comfortably pick up just the Nest Wifi router by itself, which will set you back $169.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
Sometimes your home is just a bit too big for a single router, either because of the square footage or because of a multi-floor design. Basements, too, often have trouble with Wifi signals because of their tendency to be built with wireless signal-killing blocks. In these cases, grabbing a Nest Wifi router and a Point extender pack is the best way to guarantee you're going to get the extra coverage you need. B&H sells combos with one or more Point extenders, depending on how much coverage you need.
That Point wireless extender even doubles as a killer Google Assistant-powered speaker for issuing commands for your router, such as turning the Wifi off on your kids' devices at bedtime, or for setting simple timers and other Google searches. Being a speaker, it's another great addition to the other Google Assistant-powered devices in your home and can add music to whatever room it's in via Google's whole-home audio options in the Google Home app.
While Amazon does not currently sell the Point range extender because of its seemingly never-ending feud with Google, it is selling a rather interesting package that no one else is currently offering. This 2-pack of Nest Wifi routers is $299, or $30 more expensive than the package with a router and a Point. While you'll be losing the speaker functionality that the Point gives, what you'll be gaining is pure speed.
Here's the deal: the Nest Wifi Router features a 4x4 5GHz radio configuration inside, while the Point range extender only features a 2x2 configuration. This means that devices connected to the Point will effectively see half the speed on the 5GHz network that they would if they were connected to the Nest Wifi Router itself. As such, folks with a need for speed that also need the extra range available from a mesh system can just pair two Nest Wifi routers together, making this the best possible package for those wanting the best of both worlds.
So what will it be? Extra speed by using two Nest Wifi routers, or an extra Google Assistant speaker wherever a Nest Wifi Point is installed? Either way, this is the best Wifi system from Google Nest you're going to find.
Speaker or speed, the choice is yours
Nest Wifi
One, two, three, or four?
B&H and Amazon are your two best places to get Nest Wifi, but each website has different bundles. Amazon features the router by itself, or a router 2-pack for the best speeds possible in large homes. B&H offers bundles with one or more Points, which are range extenders that feature a Google Assistant-powered speaker built-in.
Nest Wifi vs. Google Wifi: Which should you buy?

- When deactivating or deleting a Facebook account, users are warned that their purchased Oculus content is also affected.
- Since users have to log into an Oculus device with a Facebook account, purchased apps and games would also be inaccessible.
- Other companies like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have the same policies for deleted accounts.
Beginning October 1, 2020, Facebook required all new Oculus users and all Oculus Quest 2 users to log in with a Facebook account before using their Oculus headset. Existing Oculus users are able to merge their Oculus account with their Facebook account, thus bringing all existing purchases over to their Facebook around. As a result, deactivating or deleting a Facebook account with Oculus purchases makes it impossible to access those purchases. This appears to be a similar result as having your Facebook account banned.
Twitter was all atwitter today when folks realized that, indeed deactivating their Facebook account would cause players to lose access to their content. A significant number of folks tweeting about the situation were incensed or otherwise affronted by the idea that deleting a person's Facebook account could result in losing access to content. It seems, from the wording, that deactivating your account just makes your content inaccessible until it is active again.
Some of Black Friday's best deals are already live right now so don't miss out!
On the other hand, deleting your linked Facebook account makes it impossible to get a refund for purchased items, and also deletes any store credit you might have had. It's not clear at this time whether or not it's possible to recover access or transfer purchases. We reached out to Facebook and here's what a Facebook spokesperson had to say:
If a user with a merged Facebook and Oculus account decides to delete their Facebook account, they also delete their Oculus content. This is similar to how deleting an Oculus account previously worked. The Facebook deletion process explicitly calls this out to make sure the person is aware before they delete their Facebook account.
In the event that someone accidentally deletes their account or changes their mind, they can cancel the account deletion if it's been less than 30 days -- this would also allow them to restore their Oculus content. To cancel an account deletion, simply log into your Facebook account within 30 days and click "Cancel Deletion."
Facebook Spokesperson
So, while deletion is a permanent thing, users have 30 days to reverse the process. In addition to this, Facebook says that it's working on multi-user logins for the Quest family. That's fantastic news for anyone who might share their Oculus Quest with other folks, either in their homes or otherwise.
It's not currently possible to transfer or share Oculus purchases to another Facebook account, but as indicated in our Help Center FAQ, we're working on multi-user login and will share more details on this later.
Facebook Spokesperson
Looking around at the rest of the gaming industry, however, reveals that this is a common practice. But it's not just the gaming industry that follows this logic though — it's any company that generally deals in digital purchases handled through a digital account. See, your digital account is your digital identity. Without an identity to verify your, well, identity, it's impossible for a company to grant you access to a purchased digital library. Reading the terms of service on Xbox accounts from Microsoft, PlayStation accounts from Sony, or Nintendo accounts will also yield similar language to what Facebook uses on the deactivation page.

PS5
Get your hands on it before it sells out
PS5 is the place to be for exclusives like Spider-Man and Horizon Forbidden West. Get yours before they sell out. The standard PS5 boasts a disc drive so that you can play 4K Blue-ray DVDs and use your physical PS4 games through backward combability. This comes at a higher price tag than the Digital Edition.
All-digital
PS5 Digital Edition
Get your hands on it before it sells out
Cheaper than the standard PS5 but lacking a disc drive, the PS5 Digital Edition can still deliver the very best exclusives entirely digitally. You may not be able to play physical games, but the future is digital anyway. The PS5 Digital Edition features an 825GB SSD.
Where can I buy a PS5?
There are several retailers currently taking pre-orders so you can buy a PS5 like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, GameStop, and more. The PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition are selling out fast so you'll want to buy as soon as possible. Stores are looking to get more shipments in, but it's never a guarantee.
Only seven markets will see the PS5 on November 12 — U.S., Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea — while the rest of the world, including Europe, Middle East, South America, Asia, and South Africa, will need to wait until November 19.
What will the PS5 cost and when will it release?
Sony has confirmed that the PS5 will cost $499 ($629.99 CAD) and the PS5 Digital Edition will cost $399 ($499.99 CAD). Microsoft has also revealed that its cheaper Xbox Series S will be $299 and the Xbox Series X will be $499.
The PS5 will release on November 12, 2020. This will be a few days later than the release of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on November 10. There have been no publicly revealed delays due to COVID-19 as of yet.
Early hands-on impressions of the PS5
Japanese journalists and YouTuber recently got to go hands-on with the PS5 and walked away with some early impressions. Among what we learned is that the PS5 fan appears to be quiet, the DualSense can indicate whether you are player 1, 2, 3, or 4, and there's a weird nut in the casing that may be used to take the shell off.
In a preview of Astro's Playroom, we said that the DualSense controller is a game changer, and "intricate haptics and adaptive triggers are going to be a big focal point for PS5 games moving forward."
Other early impressions indicate that the DualSense is a standout accessory to accompany the PS5. While the console itself is fairly large, especially compared to other consoles like the Xbox Series X, it still goes well with most people's entertainment setups.
When's the next PS5 event?
Sony held a PS5 games showcase on September 16 where we learned more about upcoming launch games like Demon's Souls and Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Final Fantasy 16 and Hogwarts Legacy were also announced, alongside the much-anticipated announcement of the PS5 price and release date.
Sony has yet to announce another event that may take place afterward, but we expect to hear about the PS5's software and features before it launches in November.
What will the PS5 design look like?
Sony has revealed the official design of the PS5, and it's looking futuristic and sleek. I'm not exactly sure what it resembles, but I can say I like it a lot more than the Xbox Series X. I can appreciate what Microsoft is offering, but a big, blocky console isn't all that eye-catching.
In terms of size, the PS5 is 15.4in x 4.1in x 10.2in. It's a chonky boy.
PS5 teardown
Sony released an official teardown of the PS5 showing us exactly what's inside the upcoming console. Most interestingly, we learned that the PS5 uses a liquid metal TIM (thermal interface material) to deliver "long-term stable high cooling" performance in conjunction with its fan and heatsink.
We also got to see how easy it was to remove the side paneling on the PS5, which people had already speculated were removable. After doing so, you can easily upgrade the internal storage by adding an NVMe SSD.
Does the PS5 have an all-digital edition?
Yes. Like the Xbox One X all-digital edition, Sony is getting in on the fun with an all-digital edition of the PlayStation 5, dubbed the PS5 Digital Edition, that will not accept discs of any kind. If you want to play games, you'll need to download them directly to the console.
What are the PS5's specs?
Sony spoke exclusively with Wired about what fans can expect from the upcoming next-generation PS5.

PS5 CPU
According to PlayStation,, the CPU will be based on AMD's third-generation Ryzen line, with eight cores of the new 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture. It will also apparently include a custom unit for 3D audio.
PS5 GPU
The GPU, which is a custom variant of Radeon's Navi family, will support ray tracing, which is a huge win for Sony. Ray tracing is a rendering technique that models how light travels and interacts with virtual objects. Wired notes that this is something Hollywood employs in big-budget movies, but it has not made its way to any video games consoles yet (although it's becoming more common with PC games).
PS5 Ray tracing
To clarify whether or not ray tracing would be achieved on a software level or through built-in hardware integration, Sony confirmed the latter. "There is ray tracing acceleration in the GPU hardware," he said, "which I believe is the statement that people were looking for."
Ray tracing doesn't just deliver visual benefits, though, according to PlayStation. "If you wanted to run tests to see if the player can hear certain audio sources or if the enemies can hear the players' footsteps, ray tracing is useful for that," he said. "It's all the same thing as taking a ray through the environment."
PS5 Solid-state drive
The crème de la crème is that the PS5 will come packed with a solid-state drive (SSD) as opposed to an hard-disk drive (HDD). SSDs are historically more powerful, faster, and make for a much better gaming experience. Sony demonstrated what took 15 seconds to fast travel in Spider-Man on PS4 took only 0.8 seconds on a next-gen devkit. It will even support 8K graphics, though most people will likely have TVs that only deliver up to 4K resolution.
Because more simplified game data is possible through the use of an SSD, the way that game downloads work will differ from the PlayStation 4. On the PS5, downloads will be more configurable, and parts even removable. "Rather than treating games like a big block of data," PlayStation said, "we're allowing finer-grained access to the data."
This means that players could choose to download either the single-player or multiplayer portion of a game depending on what they wanted to play, or they could download the entire game and delete one part of it, like the single-player.
PS5 Specs compared to Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PS4 Pro

Is PS5 backward compatible?
PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan has stated that the PlayStation 5 will be backward compatible. Ryan even went so far as to see that the company plans to offer cross-generational play, where players can start a game on PS4, pick up where they left off on PS5, and hop back to PS4 if they wish. This feature has not been fully detailed by the company as of yet.
"Whether it's backwards compatibility or the possibility of cross-generational play, we'll be able to transition that community to next-gen," Ryan said. "It won't be a binary choice about whether you have to be either on PlayStation 4 or next-gen to continue your friendship."
Sony confirmed that only the 10 following PS4 titles won't be backward compatible on PS5:
- DWVR
- Afro Samurai 2 Revenge of Kuma Volume One
- TT Isle of Man - Ride on the Edge 2
- Just Deal With It!
- Shadow Complex Remastered
- Robinson: The Journey
- We Sing
- Hitman Go: Definitive Edition

What is the new PS5 DualSense controller?
The next-generation PlayStation controller is officially called the DualSense. Sony revealed its design in a post on its blog. It features haptic feedback technology, adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone array, and a new Create button to replace the Share button.
To that end, there are two key innovations with the PlayStation 5's new controller. First, we're adopting haptic feedback to replace the "rumble" technology found in controllers since the 5th generation of consoles. With haptics, you truly feel a broader range of feedback, so crashing into a wall in a race car feels much different than making a tackle on the football field. You can even get a sense for a variety of textures when running through fields of grass or plodding through mud.
The second innovation is something we call adaptive triggers, which have been incorporated into the trigger buttons (L2/R2). Developers can program the resistance of the triggers so that you feel the tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain. In combination with the haptics, this can produce a powerful experience that better simulates various actions.
Geoff Keighley went hands-on with the DualSense during the Summer Game Fest and gave us our first look at the controller in action. As you can see in the above image, taken by Keighley, the DualSense appears to be slightly larger than the DualShock 4. Keighley also noted that it feels heavier as well, but this added weight still feels fine to hold.
Will the PS5 support virtual reality?
Though you shouldn't expect a new VR headset to launch alongside the PlayStation 5, Sony has big plans for virtual reality going forward. Sony Global Head of R&D for PlayStation Dominic Mallinson wants the next headset to be lighter, easier to put on, and have fewer cables. A fully wireless headset is difficult to put on the market right now because it would be more expensive for consumers, but he believes that is the way the market is trending.
Mallinson is excited about the possibilities of eye-tracking, and stated that he expects the resolution to almost double in future VR headsets, with FOV increased to over 120 degrees.
PlayStation System Architect Mark Cerny has also said, "VR is very important to us and that the current PSVR headset is compatible with the new console."
Sony has patented a new, wireless VR headset however you should still not expect this headset at launch alongside the PlayStation 5.
What will the PS5 user interface look like?
The user interface on the PlayStation 4 is fast and works well, but it's also static and can not provide a ton of information. The PS5 is set to change this. Ahead of its release, Sony gave us our first look at the PlayStation 5 UI. As the company already indicated, it is a lot more dynamic than ever before. Some of its biggest, most notable new features include a Control Center, Activities cards, Game Help, and changes to the way parties work.
With the press of the PS button, you'll bring up the Control Center while whatever game you are playing continues to run in the background. This is the one stop shop for everything you'll need to immediately access on your console, including your settings, downloads, friends list, and much more.
The PS5 User interface is much more dynamic.
Activities show up as cards above the Control Center, allowing players to jump into a specific level or point in a game they're playing. "Activities enables you to discover new gameplay opportunities, go back to things you missed, jump directly into levels or challenges you want to play, and much more. Some Activity cards can be put in picture-in-picture mode, so you can view them without having to leave the game," according to Sony.
Game Help is a benefit for PlayStation Plus members that allows them to view tips and walkthroughs for certain games. The example shown in the video is a level in Sackboy where it provides hints as to where to complete an objective. This ensures that you aren't being spoiled and are getting exactly what you're looking for. Game Help will not be enabled for all games.
Another big change comes to its party system. Players will now be able to Screen Share games they are playing with other members in their party, which those people can then open in a picture-in-picture view or on the side of their own screen.

6. Linksys Velop MX5
The best Wi-Fi 6 mesh system
Bottom line: If you're going into building your Wi-Fi 6 system with mesh by default, you're going to be well served by the incredible Linksys MX5, which bundled in a two-pack go by the MX10. Just be warned, all that performance and reliability comes at a cost: this is among the most expensive routers on our list.
- Top speeds: 2400Mbps @ 5Ghz, 1147Mbps @ 2.4Ghz
- Top features: Tri-band, 3,000 sq ft. coverage, mesh capable, 4x Ethernet ports, 1x USB port
Pros:
- One of the fastest mesh systems we've tested
- Slim, tall profile
- Easy to set up
Cons:
- Can't be easily hidden due to shape
- Expensive
The Linksys Velop MX5 is a very capable router all by itself with AX5300 tri-band Wi-Fi and four Ethernet ports. With its three bands coming in at 1147Mbps, 2402Mbps, and 1733Mbps, there's plenty of speed for any task. Around back, it also has a USB 3.0 port sitting above the vertically oriented Ethernet ports.
Of course, the killer feature of the MX5 is that it was designed to be part of a mesh so it has the right hardware to create a flawless experience. Paired with another MX5, the tri-band Wi-Fi will be able to keep data speeds high even if you're connected to one of the satellite nodes. Linksys makes it easy to expand thanks to compatibility with the entire Velop range and a few mesh-enabled Linksys routers. Of course, you'll want the fastest router serving as the main routers.
The MX5 has no exposed antennas opting for a somewhat large rectangular case measuring at 9.6 inches tall and 4.5 inches wide. Some people won't love the vertically stacked Ethernet ports but it's nice to see a mesh system with this many Ethernet ports.
If you think you'll need the coverage, Velop MX10 comes with two MX5 routers and makes a great mesh. Velop MX5 is easy to set up with the Linksys App which allows you to control guest access and parental controls. You also get a three-year warranty that comes with three years of tech support if you run into any issues.
Linksys Velop MX5
The Linksys Velop MX5 is a great start to a Wi-Fi 6 mesh system with tri-band AX5300 speeds and great backward compatibility.
7. Netgear Nighthawk MK62
The best value mesh Wi-Fi 6 system
Bottom line: While not quite as performant as the Linksys MX5, Netgear's superb Nighthawk MK62 will fill your home with fast, reliable mesh Wi-Fi 6 signal for just under $200.
- Top speeds: 1200Mbps @ 5Ghz, 600Mbps @ 2.4Ghz
- Top features: 1x Ethernet ports, compact size
Pros:
- Small nodes are easy to conceal
- AX1800 provides enough speed for most usage
- Easy Nighthawk app setup
- Compact housing
Cons:
- Dual-band Wi-Fi isn't the best option for mesh
- Only one Ethernet port per node
The Netgear Nighthawk MK62 is a mesh system capable of covering up to 3,000 sq ft with its two nodes. With dual-band speeds up to AX1800, this system should be fast enough for most standard browsing and even 4K streaming with a good connection. The Wi-Fi speeds break down to 600Mbps at 2.4GHz and 1200Mbps at 5GHz. Tri-band connections will always be better for mesh systems but the speeds offered here should be enough for most people.
On the back of the primary router, you get a WAN port to connect to your modem as well as a single Ethernet port for wired devices. The satellite node only has one open Ethernet port as well which could be an issue if you have several wired devices that need to be connected. You can add a wired switch if you need though. With a small housing measuring just 4.8 inches deep and wide, these nodes can fit in just about anywhere which allows you to make sure you've got it positioned with great signal.
Netgear's Nighthawk app makes setup a breeze and allows you to easily add more satellite units to your mesh. You can also subscribe to Netgear Armor to add more advanced security from Bitdefender to your network as well as more control for each connected device.

9. ASUS ROG Rapture AX11000 Router
The best Wi-Fi 6 router for gaming
Bottom line: Large and imposing, ASUS's ROG Rapture AX11000 is ultra-fast, insanely spec'd, and just plain over-the-top in every way. But it's also the fastest router we've ever tested.
- Top speeds: 4800Mbps @ 5Ghz, 1148Mbps @ 2.4Ghz
- Top features: Tri-band, 4x Ethernet ports, 1x USB port, gaming optimizations, RGB lighting
Pros:
- One of the fastest routers we've tested
- Built-in gaming features
- Free VPN built-in
Cons:
- Massive and very divisive design
The ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 from Asus is designed to look like a hardcore router for hardcore gamers. In the spec department, it doesn't disappoint. This router boasts AX11000 speeds from its 12 stream tri-band setup delivering 4804Mbps on the 5GHz channels and 1148Mbps at 2.4GHz. A 2.5Gbps Ethernet port connects this router to your network or fiber internet connection without compromise.
Coverage should be no trouble even in a very large home thanks to eight massive antennas. If you find you need even more coverage, you can expand your network with AiMesh. This allows you to use any other Asus router with AiMesh software as a remote node to add more coverage to your home under a single Wi-Fi name.
Four Ethernet ports around the back allow you to connect your gaming PC or console and keep the pings low. Asus' software makes it easy to add game-specific settings such as port forwarding easily as well as easy quality of service options. AiProtection is also included allowing for antivirus protection from Trend Micro.
One interesting function called VPN Fusion allows you to connect with a VPN most of the time but allows game traffic to pass by to keep ping times down. You also get adaptive QoS and wtfast software. Gamers care more about ping times and packet loss than looks for the most part but that didn't stop Asus from giving this router full RGB controls and an aggressive angular appearance. It will look right at home next to your gaming hardware.

10. NETGEAR Orbi Whole Home Mesh (RBK752)
The best Wi-Fi 6 router for advanced mesh needs
Bottom line: The Netgear Orbi RBK752 is another massive, imposing Wi-Fi 6 router that delivers top speeds across huge homes.
- Top speeds: 1200Mbps @ 5Ghz, 600Mbps @ 2.4Ghz
- Top features: Tri-band, 5,000 sq ft. coverage, 3x + 2x Ethernet ports, dedicated 5Ghz backhaul, easy setup
Pros:
- Reliable mesh speeds
- Satellite included in the box
- Support for Netgear ecosystem
- Excellent value
Cons:
- Boring design
Netgear's Orbi line was a great introduction to mesh for many people but Netgear has managed to keep growing with its Wi-Fi 6 Orbi systems. The RBK752 comes with one router and one satellite both with tri-band AX4200 speeds. Orbi does things a little differently than some with a dedicated 2400Mbps 5GHz Wi-Fi band to link the routers together. What remains is a more modest 2.4GHz and 5GHz duo at 600Mbps and 1200Mbps respectively for devices.
This Mesh System will cover up to 5,000 square feet in the home, along with providing access to up to 60 devices at once without slowing down. The primary router comes with three Ethernet ports available to devices and the satellite has two. With this system's strong and dedicated backhaul, adding a satellite to a home office or entertainment system can be a great way to get wired devices online at great speeds.
Netgear kept the design simple with a two-tone gray and matte white housing sitting 7.2 inches wide and 9.1 inches tall. While it is a bit large, it's only 2.8 inches deep making it easy to tuck on the back of a desk or shelf.
Netgear's Orbi app allows for easy setup and access to software updates. You can quickly and easily add additional satellites as needed. You can also use the software to view your traffic usage as well as control internet access to all connected devices. There is an optional Netgear Armor subscription that can add antivirus protection powered by BitDefender as well as additional device controls.

The Orbi RBK752 has plenty of speed with a fast dedicated backhaul. Plenty of Ethernet ports are open to wired devices.
Bottom line
While many people are looking to Wi-Fi 6 to make sure they have as much speed as possible, prices have finally come down even to the point that mesh systems are possible. While many of the best wireless routers do have Wi-Fi 6, some still get quite a lot done with the older Wi-Fi 5 tech. Mesh with Wi-Fi 6 makes a lot of sense for people looking for stability and coverage thanks to its improved handling of multiple connections. Wi-Fi 6 is coming to more devices and there are upgrades already available to desktops and laptops. Still, it will be some time before it's fully supported so it's good that all of these routers are backward compatible with older Wi-Fi standards.
Lately, Wi-Fi 6 has made its way into a wide range of routers from hyper-fast multi-gig gaming monsters into the sort of thing most people would buy. Thanks to this, it's possible for someone to get a great Wi-Fi 6 enabled router at most price points. If you want to get ahead of the curve and future-proof your home, you won't find a much better value than the TP-Link Archer AX6000 with its fast speeds and robust wired options.
Should you buy a mesh Wi-Fi 6 solution?
Mesh Wi-Fi is a great way to increase coverage but it offers a bit more than just square footage. Carefully placed mesh nodes can build a strong network even in challenging conditions such as a home with concrete walls or around an HVAC system that causes interference. A mesh with Wi-Fi 6 can have a stronger connection to each node with less of a chance for interference.
Still, a lot of people don't need a mesh system at all depending on the size of their homes. If you do find that a single router just doesn't cut it, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh system will be more capable than one based on Wi-Fi 5. Still, starting with a mesh capable router gives you the option to expand down the road.
Is it worth paying a premium for Wi-Fi 6 right now?
Wi-Fi 5 routers have gotten pretty fast and for most people today and the next couple of years, there won't be a huge improvement in the user experience getting a Wi-fi 6 router. The main reason to go to Wi-Fi 6 with your new router is to ensure it will work as well as possible with new devices over the next few years.
If you have a fast Wi-Fi 5 router that isn't slowing you down, there isn't much reason to ditch it just yet. If you do need a new router today, a Wi-Fi 6 compatible device will keep speeds high and interference low much further into the future.
