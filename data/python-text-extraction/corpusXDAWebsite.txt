Android Pay is scheduled to enter the Taiwanese market on June 1, according a Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN) report. Initially, Google's mobile payment service will be supported by three local banks. Nevertheless, support for additional banks should expand in time according to the report.
Currently, customers in Taiwan can use Apple Pay for mobile wireless...Vivo recently unveiled its latest flagship series, Vivo X50, in China. Succeeding the Vivo X30 and X30 Pro that launched in December last year, the new X50 series brings many notable updates to the table, ranging from a new gimbal camera system to higher refresh display panels.
We have opened XDA Forums for all three devices...HMS Core on Android is Huawei’s alternative to Google Play Services
The Huawei Mate 30 Pro is objectively one of the best hardware releases of this year, featuring practically every meaningful innovation in the phone world so far, and introducing a fair few of its own. However, despite offering one of the best sets of features available on an Android smartphone, it cannot be recommended to a large swathe of users. And the blame for such an exclusion lies solely on the political situation between Huawei and the USA, which has forced the company to release an otherwise-excellent piece of hardware without the most crucial bit of functional Android: Google Play Services. The world could do nothing but watch as an Android giant attempted to figure out its way in a Google-less world. Huawei needed functional and reliable alternatives for itself and its users, and it needed them yesterday.
Thankfully, Huawei had the foresight to work on some of its own solutions long before the unfolding of any trade politics. The Huawei AppGallery offered end-users and app developers an alternative to the Google Play Store, functioning as a medium to distribute and maintain Android apps. But distributing apps solves only part of the equation. The other major factor that also needed to be addressed is the fact that a lot of Android apps, including Google Apps, rely on a closed set of APIs to function — APIs that separated AOSP’s Android from Google’s Android, coming in the form of Google Mobile Services and Google Play Services. While Huawei could still continue using Android because of the open-sourced nature of AOSP, it couldn’t use the proprietary Google Mobile Services (GMS), and by extension, Google Play Services on the Huawei Mate 30 Pro. This meant that developers who exclusively relied on GMS for functionality within their apps lost access to the tools that made those functions possible on future Huawei devices. For affected users, this meant that several of their apps would remain broken until the trade situation was resolved, or the app developers explored alternatives, or the user explored alternative apps. Two of those three situations are to the detriment of the app developer, and exploring an alternative to reduce the over-reliance on GMS might be in the better business interest of the developer.
In this article, we will be exploring the second arm of Huawei’s alternative solutions. Meet Huawei’s HMS Core, the alternative to Google Play Services on Android.
Google Mobile Services, GMS Core and Google Play Services
Before we attempt to answer what Huawei’s alternative does, we need to take a step back and look at what Google’s solution did for Android.
While Android can be classified as an “open source” OS thanks to the existence of AOSP (Android Open Source Project), most users around the world have never really experienced AOSP in its purest sense. Most smartphones sold across the world, except in certain regions like China, come with Google’s Android, which is AOSP plus Google Mobile Services.
Google Mobile Services consists of regular user-facing apps such as the Google app, Play Store, Chrome, Maps, YouTube, Gmail, Photos and more; as well as APKs for core background services such as GoogleOneTimeInitializer, SetupWizard, GooglePackageInstaller, and of course, the GMSCore, and more. GMS Core is what we commonly refer to as Google Play Services.
Google Play Services evolved as a means to solve some of the severe fragmentation issues that Google had been facing in the early days of Android. While Google was punctual with delivering Android updates with new functionalities that app developers could leverage in their own apps, the same functions would not be available across the whole Android universe for quite a few years because of the lack of updates from OEMs. Google responded by shifting key API solutions over to the Play Services platform, over which it had much greater control and which could be updated independently of the Android OS.
This allowed app developers to build experiences that would function in the same manner across different Android versions. The migration did help with Android’s fragmentation woes, but it also has led to a monopolistic universe where the exclusion of Google Play Services could handicap the entire experience of an Android smartphone.
GMS is only available through a license with Google and delivers a holistic set of popular apps and cloud-based services.
GMS, and by inclusion Google Play Services, is only available to smartphone OEMs through a license with Google, which OEMs need to apply for once they pass the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) and Google Test Suite (GTS) on a per-device basis. Since the inclusion of GMS and GMS Core is behind a license, and practically all major apps have grown to be reliant on Play Services and its APIs for many of their core functions, Google retains complete control of the Android ecosystem despite Android being open-sourced as an OS. It is likely that, as an Android user, you cannot practically use Android without Google, given that you would lose out on the following APIs:
- Google Sign-in: Hate having to create a new account for every new service you’re interested in? If the service supports Google Sign-in, then you can quickly sign-up using your Google Account.
- Fused Location Provider: Rather than having a bunch of different apps running in the background at different times to poll the location, Google Play Services can provide the location data in a relatively battery-efficient way.
- Maps: Google Maps is by far the most popular maps and navigation apps for users. With the Maps SDK, developers can use Google Maps data in their own apps. It isn’t free to use, which is why a lot of smaller indie apps won’t use this SDK, but you’ll see it in a lot of apps from bigger businesses.
- Google Play Games: A lot of games, especially those from indie game developers, rely on Google Play Games Services. For example, it’s possible (but not for much longer) to build an entirely free real-time or turn-based multiplayer game using Play Games Services.
- Firebase Cloud Messaging: Do you like getting instant notifications from your apps? Wouldn’t it be annoying if a bunch of different apps had their own push notification servers all sending you notifications independently, constantly waking your phone and draining its battery? That’s the reason behind Firebase Cloud Messaging—just let Google Play Services handle push notifications! There’s no benefit in implementing an alternative because recent Android versions ensure they won’t stay alive in the background.
- Google Play In-App Billing: Google requires that all apps and games with in-app purchases (IAP) that are distributed through the Google Play Store use this API and only this API to handle IAP, mandating a 30% cut to Google for all transactions.
- AdMob: A lot of free apps use advertisements to generate some revenue when users view or interact with them. Who better to turn to for advertisements than Google? There are certainly alternative advertising platforms—and developers are encouraged to diversify their advertising sources—but few feel compelled to use them.
- Google Cast: Own a Google Chromecast, Google Home smart speaker, Google Nest Hub, or any other smart device that supports the Google Assistant ecosystem? In order to cast video or audio to supported devices, apps use the Google Cast SDK provided by Google Play Services.
- SafetyNet: SafetyNet is most known for its Attestation API which banking apps and online games use to detect if a device has been tampered with.
This overarching control has largely been ignored by most of us. Most OEMs have played well with Google’s decisions made through the GMS Core, though we do not know if this cooperation was out of their free will or because they had no real choice. When news surfaced of Huawei’s political situation, the focus shifted back again to how central Google Play Services is to the Android experience, and how Huawei would make up for the deficit.
Huawei Mobile Services and HMS Core
Huawei Mobile Services, or HMS, is Huawei’s alternative to GMS, consisting of user-facing apps as well as core background services. The idea behind HMS is the same as that of GMS — to provide an experience that is consistent across devices and independent of the platform update. Much like how GMS is made up of app elements and core elements, the HMS ecosystem comprises of HMS Apps, the HMS Core, and the HMS Capabilities that the Core enables through its available APIs.
HMS Ecosystem has seen its monthly average users increase from 420 Million globally in July 2018 to a huge 530 Million by July 2019, while developers registered on this platform grew from 450,000 to 910,000 in the same time period, and HMS Core app integration grew from 20,000 apps to 43,000 apps. Google does not release figures for its GMS integrations, so getting scale here is difficult against the #1 player, but these are still impressive figures in absolute terms. According to additional figures revealed by Huawei, HMS Core has a global reach of 530 Million users in more than 170 countries (including China), while still providing features such as cost-effectiveness, a unified portal for one-stop integration, and precise user targeting through multiple promotion channels. Huawei also claims to be compliant with international security and privacy standards, including GAPP, GDPR, and local regulations within its ambit.
All of this will merely remain marketing points if HMS Core does not incorporate the APIs that GMS Core provides. In order to be a replacement for GMS Core, HMS Core needs to provide similar, if not better, functionality to developers, if it wishes to persuade them to consider itself as a valid option and migrate over from using GMS Core. HMS Ecosystem is currently limited only to Huawei devices, but even on its own, this is a massive subset of Android devices. Huawei alone has shipped over 200 Million smartphones this year so far, which is a substantially large number for app developers to take notice. As an app developer, it becomes essential to adapt to these devices as well as other Huawei devices that may not ship with GMS in the future. Even if GMS makes a return to Huawei, HMS continues to be part of Huawei’s larger ecosystem strategy, where the smartphone becomes the central focal point that is used to control connected IoT devices. So adapting your app to play well with the HMS Ecosystem does make a compelling business argument. You don’t want to make the same mistakes that Snapchat did when it ignored its Android userbase for years and only woke up to pay attention to them very recently.
To offer more detail on the APIs that HMS Core provides to developers, here is a brief overview:
Account Kit
HMS Core’s Account Kit is the answer to Play Service’s Google Sign-In, allowing developers to use an existing Huawei account as a valid option for signing into their app. This alleviates user fatigue by not requiring them to create a new account just for that app, and skip steps like email address verification, mobile number verification, and inputting other credentials; and overall helping the developer with the user onboarding process and lowering the user churn rate during registration and login.
Account Kit boasts of the following features:
- Secure login
- One-click authorization
- Integration with different use cases: smartphones, tablets, large displays, in-vehicle infotainment
- Support for Two-Factor authentication
- Data encryption in the entire process
- Compliant with GDPR specifications for user privacy
- Global coverage within the HMS ecosystem and with support for 79 languages
Location Kit
HMS Core’s Location Kit is the answer to Play Service’s Fused Location Provider, essentially providing developers with access to accurate location data for use within apps. Much like Fused Location Provider, Location Kit adopts a hybrid positioning mode using data from GPS plus WiFi plus Bluetooth plus Network Base Station. This allows it to provide an easy-to-use, precise positioning interface for app developers, letting them quickly and accurately obtain user location information.
Location Kit boasts of the following features:
- High location success rate: Huawei claims that the offline + online location success rate reaches 99%
- Fast positioning
- High positioning accuracy: The hybrid positioning mode allows for high accuracy
- Low power consumption
Location Kit also has more features in the pipeline:
- Low-power geo-fencing
- Location semantics
- Integrated IP positioning
- High-precision indoor positioning
- Location awareness
Map Kit
HMS Core’s Map Kit aims to be equivalent to Google’s Maps SDK, providing developers with convenient and powerful map capabilities that can help improve the map experience within apps.
Map Kit provides developers access to a personalized map display with rich map elements and multiple interaction modes. Map Kit also comes with its own geolocation data, with a claimed 100 Million+ information on points of interest, 150 Million+ information on addresses, as well as input prompts for sites and its own geocoding API. Map Kit covers 150+ countries and 40+ languages, and provides access to 25 APIs in total.
Drive Kit
HMS Core’s Drive Kit aims to enable the functionalities that Google can enable through the Google Drive REST API within an Android app.
With Drive Kit, developers can create applications that can read, write, and synchronize files with Huawei Cloud.
Some of its key features include:
Drive Kit is also planning to introduce more functionality in the future, such as file sharing, team collaboration, and intelligent search.
To the best of our understanding, Drive Kit is different from Android’s Auto Backup for Apps API, in that it does not support backing up the settings of an app to the cloud yet. Huawei mentions that the feature is coming by December 2019, which should substantially improve the utility of this API.
Game Service
HMS Core’s Game Service aims to be the equivalent of Google Play Games. Game Services provides an easy way for players to sign-in and track achievements and related ranking. In addition to this, game developers can also utilize the APIs related to gift packages, rewarding users with in-game rewards upon completing achievements.
Other APIs planned for the future for Game Service include tracking player data and statistics such as game duration, login time, frequency, activity ranking, payment limit ranking, and purchase quantity; and game event reporting.
Push Kit
HMS Core’s Push Kit is the equivalent of Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging, essentially allowing app developers to send messages from the cloud to your users. Push Kit establishes itself as a reliable, real-time push message platform with global coverage, spreading over 200+ countries. App developers can take advantage of the precise targeting features it offers to promote the usability of the app to the users and promote interactions and transactions with the app by increasing the app’s page views and unique visitors.
Analytics Kit
HMS Core’s Analytics Kit is equivalent to Google’s Firebase Analytics. The basic goal of the Analytics Kit is to provide app developers with an easy way to measure different metrics within the app and provide analysis on the basis of those metrics. With Analytics Kit, Huawei claims that developers will be able to collect as many as 500 types of behavior data, presenting a very wide potential for gaining insight into the user, their interactions and habits within the app. Consequently, the app developers can then formulate optimization policies as needed, in order to drive engagement and user retention within the app.
Analytics Kit claims to provide:
- Simple and efficient access, with predefined events, customized events, and online debugging
- Secure data service with anonymous user identities, encrypted transmission, and multi-tenant isolation
- Customizable dashboard with rich analysis features such as:Funnel conversion and retention analysis: Identify the characteristics of event churn to formulate targeted user operation policiesEvent analysisAudience analysisReal-time analysis: Analyze currently hot events in real-time and adjust operation policies
- Online debugging, with quick second-level response
In-App Purchases
HMS Core’s In-App Purchases is the equivalent of Google Play In-App Billing, and perhaps the most important of all APIs as far as app developers are concerned. Without a robust monetization medium in place, there will be little incentive for a developer to actually dive into the HMS ecosystem. With In-App Purchases, developers should be able to realize monetization globally. HMS’s In-App Purchases covers five broad APIs in two categories: Product Management Service, Subscription Service, Order Service, Sandbox Test Service, and Merchant Management Service.
Subscription service, as the name implies, is to monetize users who are tied loyally to the service and can be considered as a more stable form of revenue. This part of In-App Purchases boasts of the following features:
- Supports customized free trial use and preferential promotion
- Supports global automatic pricing
- Supports adjusting subscription price on a per-country basis
- All-round notification management
- Subscription reports
Order service is for the single-transaction non-recurring form of purchases, and it boasts of the following features:
- Simplify the payment access process
- Manage payment orders for developers
- Simple access and interaction logic
Ads Kit
HMS Core’s Ads Kit is the equivalent to Google AdMob, and forms the second leg of monetization for the Huawei Mobile Services ecosystem. Ads Kit provides unique device-level ad identifies and advertisement-conversion tracking capabilities to build an advertisement ecosystem.
As part of the changes introduced in Android 10, apps must have privileged permission to request the phone’s IMEI, which essentially clamps down on the use of this non-resettable identifier for marketing and advertising purposes. Huawei’s Ads Kit thus relies on an OAID (Open Advertising ID) solution as a non-permanent advertisement identifier, allowing developers to balance user privacy while still providing personalized advertisements and accurately tracking advertisement effects.
Every HMS device has a unique OAID which is generated immediately after the device is started for the first time. Users also retain the option to reset the OAID as well as opt-out of personalized advertisements. OAID thus converges digital identity with privacy by removing the connection between the device identifier and the user information.
Concluding Note
Huawei’s HMS Core is a doughty attempt by Huawei, one that shows their perseverance in retaining their competitive edge in the smartphone hardware and software ecosystem. Most other Android OEMs would have collapsed without Google’s support, as none (perhaps with the exception of Samsung) are in any position to offer such a robust set of alternative APIs that could realistically provide a similar set of functionalities to developers and users.
HMS Core turned out to be Huawei’s secret weapon, one that was hidden in plain sight, being brought to the foreground when the company really needed to adapt. With the company’s political situation remaining unresolved for far too long, HMS Core remains the solution that developers need to turn to if they intend to retain their Huawei audience. Huawei hasn’t quit the smartphone market after the trade ban — far from it actually, as the company registered 63% YoY growth in the Chinese market and a 29% growth in the global market, despite the trade ban. The company still intends to move ahead and the consumers will find it hard to resist excellent hardware like the Huawei Mate 30 Pro.
With Huawei’s current momentum, alternative software solutions are bound to come up thanks to the law of demand and supply. So the only question to you as an app developer remains: do you have the foresight to adapt, too?

There are only so many ways you can do something uniquely; after a point, you’re bound to make a repetition that could cause your product to start resembling some of the key characteristics for that established product segment. Smartphones are rectangular glass slabs, laptops are slabs with keyboards, and truly wireless earbuds are either circular or have a stem on them. So when a product comes along that strays away from the established order, we’re bound to take note. That’s precisely what is happening with the
Galaxy Beans Galaxy Buds Live.
When the Buds Live first leaked in their stemless, kidney-bean design, I was more than intrigued. I had so many questions: How do they fit in the ear? How big are they? How do they fit in the case, and how do they stay in there? How easily do they fall out? Will they be uncomfortable? How would they noise isolate? And would they feature noise cancellation? While Samsung’s official launch and accompanying marketing and advertisements have answered a fair few of these questions, I hope to bring some of my own perspectives after having used the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live, alongside the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ and the Sony WF-1000XM3.

Samsung Galaxy Buds Live — Design and Build
While the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are pretty much the same as the original Galaxy Buds, the Galaxy Buds Live are unlike anything you have seen in the market. The shape has a stark resemblance to kidney beans, and Samsung wanted to call them Beans at some point too. It is a unique design for sure, with the exterior surface of the Bean-like earbud coming in with a glossy finish, and the interior surface having a more muted matte-finish. The Mystic Black color variant that I have does get some fingerprints onto the shiny surface, but they aren’t prominently visible. The matte finish alleviates some of that cheaper-feel that was much more apparent on the Buds+, and that’s good because these earphones aren’t cheap.
There is a specific way that you need to wear the Galaxy Buds Live. Most earphones are quite intuitive in this regard, but the Buds Live have such a unique form factor that you do need some assistance to figure it out. For larger ears, the Buds Live needs to settle at the very bottom of your ear, almost running parallel to the ground (but not entirely). This way, the two speaker grilles are the deepest and closest to your ear’s auditory canal. There is a protruding wing tip towards the top of the matte side, which along with the bean-shape, press the Buds Live flush against your pinna (if you want to be more specific, at the bottom of the concha in your auricle). Samsung includes another larger pair of wingtips, but I found that the default was the better fit for me and the larger ones were quicker to cause discomfort. For smaller ears, the Buds Live settle into a more upright position.
With the way that the Buds Live are shaped and how they sit and press, it does present a sensation of underconfidence if you are wearing them wrong — it feels like they will fall out if you move around too much. If you do it correctly (and depending on the shape and size of your ears), the Buds Live will sit in almost flush, and the underconfidence will vanish. In my usage, once I figured out how they need to be put in, the Buds Live never actually fell out. They are snug to the point that I have gone on small runs without them falling out. But your mileage may vary simply because of how different our bodies can be at an individual level.
As far as comfort is concerned, I do feel comfortable wearing the earphones for about 4 hours at best. Beyond this time point, the snug fit on the pinna starts causing soreness and discomfort. The Buds Live only has rubber elements on the wingtips, and the rest of the body is hard plastic, so all the tolerance needs to come from your body. If you have smaller ears, I can see this being a problem, even though Samsung claims that it has extensively tested the Buds Live and its design on a wide variety of ear shapes and sizes. To Samsung’s credit, the Buds Live are lightweight, with a weight lower than even the Buds+, so you don’t feel any heaviness in your ears.
The Buds Live comes in a rounded-square case, which is easily pocketable. The resting cradle for the Buds Live within the case is not very deep, but the earbuds do not fall off because the magnets do a good enough job at it. The magnets for keeping the lid shut are stronger than those holding the buds in place — just a curious observation. Continuing my nitpick, the magnetic snapping action when putting the earbuds back into the case is stronger than it was on the Buds+ but still underwhelming compared to the Sony WF-1000XM3, but I concede that this is just a personal nitpick. I prefer the pill-shaped case for the Buds+ over the jewelry-box-like case of the Buds Live, but there is nothing that is fundamentally wrong with the Buds Live’s case shape, so both the options are correct. What I would wish for Samsung to change is the glossy finish, as it does not do justice to a premium product and makes it feel cheaper than what it can punch.
The Galaxy Buds Live case has an LED indicator on the inside to indicate the charging status of the earbuds, and another LED indicator on the outside to indicate the charging status of the case. There is an indentation/gap that runs around the case separating the two halves, so you can easily open the case without needing to hold it in any specific way. The USB Type-C port exists below the hinge on the outside. You can use the port for charging the case, or you can choose to charge using a Qi-certified wireless charger. Samsung includes a short USB Type-A to Type-C cable in the box, so you have the means to charge them up right out of the box.
The Buds Live continues with the IPX2 rating from the predecessor, meaning it can resist light splashes of water. So that is light sweat, but that’s about it. You don’t want to take them out when it’s raining. I hope Samsung considers making the next generation better in terms of water resistance, considering how much it rains in my region.
To wrap up the section, the Galaxy Buds Live have a unique design, one that does set it apart and ensures that no one mistakes them for an AirPod or any other TWS on the market. The design works out for short and medium wear durations for me. But because the TWS are so different, the comfort and the fit does boil down to the individual and the shape and size of their ear. It’s difficult to label it “good” or “bad”; it’s just “different” with no real mainstream comparison. Samsung wanted to give the earbuds its own identity, and they have been pretty successful to that end.
Samsung Galaxy Buds Live — Features
Easy Pair
The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live shares a lot of its software features with the Galaxy Buds+. The first pairing process is super simple: You have to open the lid, and the Galaxy Buds Live are already in pairing mode, meaning that you do not need to undertake any complicated pairing gestures or actions to use them with your first device. From that point, you can enter in manual pairing mode by placing the buds back into the case and reopening the lid (you don’t need to take out the Buds). You can also touch and hold both earbuds for three seconds to enter pairing mode if you don’t want to place them back into the case.
If you have a Samsung smartphone with the Samsung SmartThings app installed, the pairing process is even more straightforward. The Galaxy Buds Live also does not support Google’s Fast Pair. Note that you can use either of the earbuds individually for playback, too.
Multi-device Switching
Much like the Galaxy Buds+ (post their updates), the Galaxy Buds Live are capable of multi-device switching. It’s not as seamless as Bluetooth multipoint that can shift audio focus intelligently. Still, it’s a lot less friction against entirely unpairing/disconnecting from one device to connect to another. Presuming that you have connected with the devices once before, you can tap on the Buds Live entry on the desired device, and the Buds Live will receive their audio input from them. Just to be clear, there’s definite room for improvement, but if you are hopping around a few devices through the day, at least you won’t have to pair your Buds multiple times throughout the day. I definitely wish to see Bluetooth multipoint in the next generation, though.
Controls
The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live have a touch sensor located on the top part, but I found that touching squarely around the middle guaranteed a response. There’s no clear demarcation for the touch area, but since the buds aren’t too large by themselves, you will confidently get touch inputs correct unless you make an active effort to touch the top edges only. Like the Galaxy Buds+, a single tap on either bud plays and pauses tracks. A double-tap will play the next track, and a triple tap will play the previous track. If a call is incoming, you can double-tap to accept. And once accepted, you can double-tap to end the call. Touch and hold lets you decline calls.
The Samsung Wearable app lets you reconfigure the single touch and hold command on the left and right earbud individually to any of the following four options: Voice command, Active Noise Cancellation, Spotify, or Volume Control (Right earbud for Volume Up, Left earbud for Volume Down). Note that the Galaxy Buds Live, like the Buds+, do not have auto-pause on removal/auto-play on insertion, even though they can detect when they are removed. On the flip side, you can’t really not touch the touchpad while removing or inserting the earbud.
You can lock the touch controls too. But unlike the Buds+, there is no “Double Tap Earbud Edge” feature here. I don’t really miss its absence either way, but just something to note if you are invested in it.
Connectivity
The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live support Bluetooth 5.0 for connecting to devices. For codecs, the Buds Live, the Buds+, and the Buds support SBC, AAC, and the scalable Samsung codec (proprietary). You can only take advantage of the Samsung scalable codec on Samsung’s devices, and as mentioned before, an ecosystem lock-in becomes crucial to experience the best sound out of these earbuds.
For wireless range, I can get an uninterrupted connection for around 10 meters. Performance on this end is at par with other truly wireless solutions. Latency is also an issue with the Buds Live, and I get about a 150ms delay in sounds. You can live with it if you are just casually watching videos, but perhaps not so much for live gaming as you are likely to be at a small disadvantage. I’ve found that turning off Active Noise Cancellation helps improve the latency marginally, bringing it down to about a ballpark of 120ms. There is no Gaming Mode to be found on non-Samsung devices, so keep that in mind too.
On Samsung devices (like the Samsung Galaxy M31s that I tested these on), you do get a Gaming Mode that claims to minimize audio delay, and that lets me get it down to under 100ms with ANC and even lower without ANC.
Galaxy Wearable App
The Galaxy Wearable app is a recommended download for unlocking certain customizations on Samsung’s wearables, but you don’t necessarily need it for basic functions and controls. A lot of these features overlap with what is experienced with the Buds+ too.
The app is primarily used when you need to read a precise measurement of the battery level on the individual buds and the case. You also need it to download and install firmware updates for the TWS. With past earbuds, some of these updates brought along useful functions, so I do recommend keeping the app installed and checking it regularly. You can also reset the earbuds from within the app.
There is also an equalizer within the app with a few presets. However, you cannot fine-tune the settings or create a custom profile, which continues to be a major oversight on Samsung’s hearables. There are third-party apps that can do this, though. Further, you can also have the Galaxy Buds Live read your notifications aloud to you. This can be done either in a summary format (just the name of the app) or in detail (with the notification content). You can set the feature up on a per-app basis, too. The Galaxy Wearable app also has a Find My Earbuds feature which plays a loud beep on the earphones. Frankly, if you have actually lost your earbud, the feature is practically useless as you can barely hear the sound unless the earbud is within 10cm of your ears. You can also switch on Ambient Sound mode to relieve some pressure in your ears, but the effect is weak, as I mention in the next section.
Active Noise Cancellation
One of the highlight features on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live is that they finally bring Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) to Samsung’s most popular hearable lineup. While the Buds+ featured a toggle within the Galaxy Wearable app for toggling Ambient Sound, the Buds Live replaces this toggle with one for ANC.
Active Noise Cancellation on the Buds Live does work, technically speaking. When you pop in the earbuds and toggle the ANC, you get the signature pop in your ears, bringing about a feeling of change in pressure. However, because of the Buds Live’s unique design that doesn’t completely seal the ear, there is very little noise isolation that they can experientially offer. As a result, the ANC’s net effect feels weak — the pop is weaker, and the degree to which noise is canceled is significantly weak.
In comparison, the Sony WF-1000XM3 continues to be my personal benchmark for the right combination of passive noise isolation and hard-working active noise cancellation. I have an overhead fan at my desk, and with the Sony’s, I can barely hear it at about 10% of the noise it makes, while still keeping the audio volume on the lower end. With the Galaxy Buds+ at a moderate volume setting, I can drown out some of the noise because of the noise isolation alone and hear about 60-70% of the noise it makes. With the Galaxy Buds Live at a moderate volume setting, I can still hear the fan at a good 50-60%. The Active Noise Cancellation does a good job, but it’s just not enough to really make a difference compared to shipping just an effective noise isolation system. The gains as against the Galaxy Buds+ are marginal at best. Switching off ANC on the Buds Live brings the fan back into focus with as much as 90% of its noise being audible. ANC is doing some heavy lifting, but it also needs its buddy, noise isolation, to truly deliver a stellar experience. As it currently stands, the Buds Live are not very good at muting your surroundings.
Samsung is on the right path, though, and I look forward to an audio accessory that incorporates both noise isolation and active noise cancellation. Perhaps they can incorporate noise isolation within this unique design for the next generation? A man can hope.
Samsung Galaxy Buds Live — Sound Quality and Voice Quality
The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live feature a 12mm driver tuned by AKG. I still consider myself an amateur in audio assessment. To my “average consumer” audio perception, the Galaxy Buds Live does a good job but do get held back because of the lack of perceptible noise isolation.
Using this thread from the Head-Fi forums as a reference, the sub-bass on the Buds Live come off better than they did on the Buds+. The same audio from the Halo theme that I previously commented on being not as majestic on the Buds+ now sounds punchier on the Buds Live. The bass kicks on the Dogfighter theme have a decent kick to them, but nothing that gets a bass lover excited. The sub-bass is also more substantial, like on the Cowboy Bebop theme, but not enough to overpower the vocals. These are improvements over the Buds+, but not class-defining for the TWS category as the Buds+ had a lot of ground to cover. Other areas are closer to the Buds +’s excellent performance, namely vocals, mids, and highs. The Buds Live handles them very well, so overall, sound quality by itself is an upgrade over the Buds+. However, the lack of noise isolation can be felt throughout, so you should enjoy your music in a relatively quiet environment.
The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live continue on the legacy from the Buds+ when it comes to mic performance. My experience with voice calls has been great on the Buds Live, as it did on the Buds+ too. Samsung has figured out voice call quality much better than Sony and a lot of others have, and the Buds Live gets a thumbs up as well. They’re pretty good for talking on the phone without needing to touch your phone.
Samsung Galaxy Buds Live — Battery Life
The Galaxy Buds Live claim to offer a battery life of up to 6 hours on a single charge with ANC turned on, and the claim seem to be holding up. I can wear the Galaxy Buds for a maximum of 4 hours and some minutes before the discomfort forces me to pop them back in, and I usually end up with over 25% battery in the Buds Live left at that stage — the math checks out. The case adds in another two and a half cycles (claimed 20 hours in total). The net battery backup is marginally better on the Buds Live than it was on the Buds+. To compare, the Buds+ lasted longer without needing to be put back into the case, but the case itself had lower battery capacity compared to that on the Buds Live.
Once you run out of juice on the case, you can charge it up through the USB Type-C port or through a Qi-compatible wireless charger. Wireless charging is a nice touch for a TWS accessory, and it works out well if you are invested in the wireless charging ecosystem.
Samsung Galaxy Buds Live — Concluding Note
When I concluded my Galaxy Buds+ review, I noted how I missed the Sony WF-1000XM3’s sweet active noise cancellation. That set high hopes for the Galaxy Buds Live and its active noise cancellation as the highlighting feature. When looked at through this myopic lens, the Buds Live are underwhelming, and you’d be disappointed if you bought them only to experience ANC in its glory. The sound quality is good, but the lack of noise isolation is a regular speed breaker in your journey of tranquility.
What the Galaxy Buds Live does well is stand out from the crowd of AirPod-clones and Buds-wannabes. The main focus of the Buds Live is its design — it’s funny to look at, but it works well enough to the point of genuine surprise. They always feel like they will fall off your ears, but they don’t — and that’s a testimony to Samsung’s engineering behind this new design. The kidney bean-like shape (rajma, as it is called in Hindi) is a good conversation starter, and every friend that has seen these in my ears has requested a closer look and to wear them too, much to my annoyance in this COVID world.
Are the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live a good upgrade over the Galaxy Buds+? I say no. Not because the Buds Live are bad per se, but because the Buds+ are still pretty darn good. The Galaxy Buds+ have now fallen in price in India, retailing at ₹10,490 (~$142) while the USA still gets them for $150. The Galaxy Buds Live, on the other hand, are more expensive at ₹14,990 (~$204) in India and $170 in the USA. Based on my experiences with both, the Buds+ are easier to recommend to just about every average consumer. They are a better value purchase and much more evergreen in that sense. The Buds Live are for the consumer who values bleeding-edge design and isn’t afraid of taking risks, and that isn’t every consumer.

Where does Samsung go from here? There’s one direction that makes sense to me, and that is figuring out that sweet spot of Active Noise Cancellation alongside Passive Noise Isolation. Whether that comes with adding an in-ear rubber tip, or by migrating to a new design, or by packing in ANC in the Buds+ design — that is something to watch out for in 2021.Netflix to host 2-day free trial StreamFest event in India
Over the last few months, Netflix has tried a couple of things to get more users to subscribe to its service. The company launched a new affordable mobile-only plan in India, tested a Mobile+ plan with PC support and HD streaming, and even offered a few original shows for free. While these new plans and offers may or may not have attracted new subscribers, Netflix doesn’t seem to be stopping with such promotions anytime soon. As first discovered by XDA’s own Mishaal Rahman and confirmed by Netflix themselves (via Protocol), the company is now planning to host a 2-day free trial event in India to promote its service.
Evidence of this new promotional event was first spotted in the latest version of the Netflix app for Android, which included mentions of an event scheduled for December 4th called StreamFest. During the company’s Q3 2020 earnings call, COO Greg Peters then shed more light on the event and said:
“We think that giving everyone in a country access to Netflix for free for a weekend could be a great way to expose a bunch of new people to the amazing stories we have…Really creating an event, and hopefully getting a bunch of those folks to sign up.”
A Netflix spokesperson has since confirmed the company’s plans to Protocol and added that “We’re always looking at different marketing promotions to attract new members and give them a great Netflix experience.” If the event proceeds as teased in the app’s code, Netflix StreamFest will be available for all users in India across all supported devices. And users won’t have to enter their credit card details to access free streaming. But anyone who wishes to watch after the two-day event will have to sign up for a regular account.
An in-app text string notes that “Netflix StreamFest is at capacity,” which suggests that there might be a limitation on the number of people able to access the platform during the promotion. Since Netflix regularly tests new features with a small subset of users, limiting access could be a way to compare StreamFest metrics against other forms of promotion. Based on the event’s popularity during its initial run, Netflix may host similar events in other regions as well.Google Assistant now supports shortcuts for third-party apps and new features on Smart Displays
At its Assistant Developer day on Thursday, Google introduced exciting new features for Google Assistant, the company’s virtual assistant service. One of the new features is deeper integration with third-party apps on Android, allowing users to open and search apps and also complete more complex tasks, including playing music, starting a run, or posting on social media.
The new feature is already available today on all Assistant-enabled Android phones, and it works with more than 30 of the top apps on Google Play, with more app support coming soon. According to Droid-Life, the current list of apps that supports shortcuts include: Citi, Dunkin, Paypal, Wayfair, Wish, Uber, Yahoo! Mail, Nike Adapt, Nike Run Club, Spotify, Postmates, Grubhub, MyFitnessPal, Mint, Discord, Walmart, Etsy, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, Google Maps, Instagram, Twitch, and Best Buy.
As part of the deeper integration, Google Assistant is also gaining support for shortcuts with third-party apps. “So instead of saying ‘Hey Google, tighten my shoes with Nike Adapt, you can create a shortcut to just say, ‘Hey Google, lace it.’” If that’s not a glimpse into the future, I don’t know what is.
Developers can add built-in integrations to their apps with App Actions, allowing users to search within apps and also open specific pages within those apps. “Starting today, you can use the GET_THING intent to search within apps and the OPEN_APP_FEATURE intent to open specific pages in apps,” Google announced on a blog post. Developers will have the tools to implement one of the built-in intents or a custom intent; you can get started today by declaring support for one or more of these common intents in your Actions.xml file. For even deeper integration, you can create a vertical-specific built-in intent (BII) to let the Google Assistant handle the Natural Language Understanding (NLU). There are now over 60 intents across 10 verticals, including “new categories like Social, Games, Travel & Local, Productivity, Shopping and Communications,” Google said.
To improve discoverability and ease-of-use, Google designed suggestions and shortcuts to help users learn about Android apps that support App Actions. To see what shortcuts are available, users can simply say, “Hey Google, shortcuts,” to set up and explore suggested shortcuts in settings. Users are required to add shortcuts to Google Assistant before using them. Google will provide shortcut suggestions proactively as a chip in Assistant search results, or alternatively, users can enable shortcuts on an app-by-app basis.
Improvements to Google Assistant on Smart Displays
Google is also improving Assistant on smart displays by introducing improved voices and trusted voices for payments. Google says there are two new voices which are designed to sound more natural. Developers will be able to use the new voices by changing the model in the Actions console. You can give one of the voices a listen right here.
As for trusted voices for payments, it’s exactly what it sounds like. Google will allow users to purchase things directly from their smart display, and because Google knows the sound of your voice, only authorized users will be allowed to initiate payments. You’ll be able to make a payment just by asking, and soon Google will introduce on-display CVC entry for an extra layer of security.
In addition, Google is also expanding Interactive Canvas to Actions in the education and storytelling verticals, introducing the Actions Testing API as a programmatic way to test critical user journeys, offering a new DialogFlow migration tool inside the Actions Console to automate moving projects to the new platform, and launching a new resource hub for game developers. To learn more about the other changes coming to Google Assistant on smart displays, visit Google’s developer blog post.The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are Official – Here’s what to Expect
After months of anticipation and a lot of leaks, Google has officially revealed both the Pixel 2 as well as the Pixel 2 XL to the world. Thanks to the leaks, we basically knew what to expect from Google with both of these devices but many were still holding onto hope for a handful of features. The wait is over and Google has said they’re accepting pre-orders today and that they will begin shipping devices on later this year with prices starting at $650 for the Pixel 2 and $850 for the Pixel 2 XL.
This marks the second year in the row that Google is releasing their own smartphones. A lot of work is still being done by the manufacturing partner, but the company says they have more control over the design and manufacturing process of the Pixel phones than they ever had with the Nexus smartphones and tablets. Along with these phones, the company has also revealed a new, smaller version of the Google Home as well as a new Chrome OS device called the Pixelbook.
Google Pixel 2 Specs
- 5″ 1080p AMOLED 16:9 Display
- 2.5D Corning® Gorilla® Glass 5
- 95% DCI-P3 coverage
- Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC
- 4GB of RAM
- 64GB and 128GB internal storage options
- 8MP 1.4μm front-facing camera
- 12.2MP 1.4μm rear-facing camera
- 2,700 mAh capacity battery
- IP67 water and dust resistant
Google Pixel 2 XL Specs
- 6″ pOLED QHD+ (2880 x 1440) 18:9 display
- 3D Corning® Gorilla® Glass 5
- 100% DCI-P3 coverage
- Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC
- 4GB of RAM
- 64GB and 128GB internal storage options
- 8MP 1.4μm front-facing camera
- 12.2MP 1.4μm rear-facing camera
- 3,520 mAh capacity battery
- IP67 water and dust resistant
So as we can see here, these specs are what we have been seen leaked over the last few months. With such a highly anticipated device, it’s incredibly hard for a company to keep it a secret these days (no Ultra Pixel here!). We were missing some details such as the front-facing camera, display tech for the Pixel 2 and the battery capacity, but overall we have known what these devices were going to be for a while. There has even been a number of renders released that gave us a close-up look at them.
Google Pixel 2 Software Features
At the launch event, Google also announced some new features that were coming to the company’s two new flagship smartphones. Just as we previously covered, the company has redesigned the Pixel Launcher to make the Google search bar more accessible and including a Google Assistant widget at the top. The camera application now features a “Portrait Mode” and uses software algorithms to keep the main subject in focus while blurring out the background.
Expanding on the camera application itself, Google is doubling down on the features that it currently has with a couple that we have seen used by other OEMs. Again, this is something we have covered in past leaks, and today the company confirmed that its camera application has both a Face Retouching feature as well as a Motion Photo mode. Face Retouching is self explanatory as it will attempt to cover up blemishes and other imperfections from your skin. The Motion Photo mode can be equated to Apple’s Live Photos where it will capture some video before and after taking a still photo.
Something that will instantly be controversial is a new Now Playing feature that enables the phones to listen for music and then display details about it on the lock screen. This feature isn’t forced on anyone though and you can disable it in the settings at any time. Google says this Now Playing feature works offline and never sends songs or conversations to Google. As reported, the company is even expanding their Ambient Display feature to include always-on display functionality that takes advantage of the OLED panels used in both the Google Pixel 2 as well as the Google Pixel 2 XL (you can try it out now).
Finally, Google’s website states the following in regards to software updates and support: “Pixel’s software and security updates for three years”. This could mean that either we’ll see the standard minimum of two years of OS updates and one extra year of security patches, or three years of both OS updates and security patches. We hope it implies the latter, as that seems to be what this specific wording alludes to.
Google Pixel 2 Pricing and Release Date
Just as expected, the Pixel 2 pricing will start at $650 for the 64GB option and go up to $750 for those who prefer the 128GB internal storage option. Alternatively, the Pixel 2 XL pricing will start at $850 and will go up to $950 for those who want the larger storage capacity variant. Google says both variants of the Pixel 2 will ship by October 17th but Pixel 2 XL and you can pre-order your device right now, with a free Google Home Mini with your Pixel 2 pre-order.

Reddit: /u/TheDogstarLPForums for the Realme X50 Pro, OPPO Find X2, OPPO Reno3 Pro, and iQOO 3 are now open
The industry’s biggest smartphone event was called off on account of the COVID-19 outbreak, but companies have gone ahead with their launches through online events or scheduled them for a later date. The message is clear — MWC or no MWC, the show must go on. Keeping up the with spirit, we recently created forums for the Huawei MatePad Pro, Huawei Mate XS, Sony Xperia 1 II and Sony Xperia 10 II, and we have now created forums for the Realme X50 Pro, OPPO Find X2, OPPO Reno3 Pro, and iQOO 3.
Realme X50 Pro
Realme has already launched the Realme X50 Pro in India and Europe, and you can read our thoughts on this new 5G flagship from Realme in our first impressions article.

OPPO Reno3 Pro
The OPPO Reno3 Pro was launched in China at the end of last year. Now, OPPO is looking to bring the device to more markets in the coming month, albeit in a different form sans the 5G capabilities for markets that are not 5G-ready yet. The Reno3 Pro 4G is launching in India on 2nd March 2020, and we look forward to seeing what OPPO has in store.

OPPO Find X2
The OPPO Find X2 was to come at MWC 2020, but OPPO has now rescheduled its launch to March 6, 2020. The Find X2 will accompany the Find X2 Pro in all likeliness, and both will likely be the next flagships from OPPO.

The race for rolling out 5G is now in full steam, but AT&T got in a bit of a controversy for, well, trying to cheat. The carrier launched what they called their “5GE” network, which is essentially just rebranded 4G LTE and not 5G at all. This, evidently, misled a number of users into thinking they actually had 5G on their phones when they actually didn’t. Nonetheless, AT&T is planning to roll out a real 5G network and this roll-out is set to happen as soon as next month.
The flagship phone that is set to carry AT&T’s 5G torch? The Galaxy Note 10+ 5G. The carrier will begin selling the 5G-enabled device for a $1,300 price tag next month. The device will work with the company’s 5G network, which will initially be offered in 5 US cities: Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Providence, Rochester, and San Diego. The service will then be rolled out to 10 other cities “soon after” according to AT&T, while nation-wide coverage is set to come during the first half of 2020.
Galaxy Note 10+ XDA Forums
We should keep in mind, though, that this rollout will not include mmWave 5G connections, but rather “low-band” LTE, with speeds expected to be comparable to LTE Advanced. mmWave 5G, which AT&T brands as “5G+”, is already available in parts of 21 US cities, with planned expansions for 2020.
Unlike the differences found between the Galaxy S10 5G and the Galaxy S10+, which included a quad rear camera and a 3D face recognition system, the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G is mostly identical to the regular Galaxy Note 10+ with the only differences being that the former supports 5G while the latter doesn’t. So if you like the Galaxy Note 10+, your experience will be completely identical for the 5G-enabled model.
Are you looking forward to 5G service on AT&T?
Source: The Verge
Update: Available today
AT&T didn’t share specific launch dates last month, but now we know the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G is available today. The company’s 5G network is now live in 10 markets (Birmingham, Ala., Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Providence, R.I., Rochester, N.Y., San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose, Calif.) and the Note 10+ 5G, which went up for pre-order a couple of weeks ago, is now shipping. The device is available in stores today for an outright price of $1,300 or $350 with AT&T Next or $43.34 per month with financing.
Source: AT&T | Via: Android Police[Update: Available] Onida launches a smart TV in India with Amazon’s Fire TV software
Onida, formally known as MIRC Electronics, is an Indian TV brand that was very popular in the 1990s and early 2000s for its CRT televisions. After plummeting initially to the wave of Plasma TVs, and eventually LCD and LED TVs, and competition from international brands like Samsung, Sony, and LG, Onida has transitioned into a smart TV brand and now has a decent portfolio of Android TVs. In partnership with Amazon India, Onida has now launched two new smart TVs, bringing a Fire TV software experience to these TVs and skipping the requirement to buy an Amazon Fire TV Stick separately.
The new range of smart TVs launched by Onida and Amazon includes a 32-inch HD TV and a 43-inch Full HD TV. Running the Amazon Fire TV software, the Onida smart TVs support OTT video platforms such as Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstar, YouTube, Zee5, Sony LIV, Sun Nxt, and others, out of the box. The remote bundled with the TV has an inbuilt microphone that can be used to interact with Amazon’s voice assistant, Alexa. The remote also features dedicated buttons for Netflix, Prime Video, Zee5, Sony LIV. The screen supports a contrast ratio of 1200:1 and has a claimed brightness of 300 nits.
In terms of audio, the Onida TVs with Amazon Fire TV interface use a dual speaker setup with a combined audio output of 16 watts. They also feature DTS TruSurround and Dolby Digital Plus for sound enhancement.
Each of these Onida TVs comes with dual-band SISO Wi-Fi, three HDMI ports, one Ethernet, and one USB port. Additionally, they support input via composite video along with analog audio cables, TOSLINK aka optical audio, and output through a 3.5mm headphone jack. The Onida TVs audio-out capabilities via Bluetooth 5.0. The TVs can also be paired to and controlled using an Amazon Echo device with the help of an Alexa skill.
The Onida smart TV lineup with Amazon Fire TV interface will be available in India starting December 20th exclusively via Amazon. The 32-inch model will be available for ₹12,999 while the 43-inch Full HD variant will come for ₹21,999.
Update: Onida Fire TV is now available for purchase
The Onida Fire TV is now available for purchase from Amazon.in. As is common practice with TVs sold online, Onida will contact the customer within 48 hours of delivery to schedule an installation free-of-cost. However, keep in mind that often in such scenarios, any additional equipment needed in the installation (such as a wall mount) might be separately chargeable.

Bridging the gap between Android OEMs and the aftermarket development scene is part of what we do on the XDA Portal. Our initiative with Xiaomi for the POCO F1, for instance, played a significant role in the rise of the vibrant modding community around the smartphone. Device seeding also helped boost the popularity of the POCO X2 and the Redmi Note 8 Pro on our forums and among enthusiasts. Apart from Xiaomi, Realme and ASUS have also collaborated with us in the past with similar device seeding efforts. Now, ASUS is taking another step towards boosting their developer-friendliness by sending the newly launched ASUS ROG Phone 3 to select custom ROM and kernel developers.
ASUS ROG Phone 3 XDA Forums
The ROG Phone 3 has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus chip, a 6.59-inch 144Hz high refresh rate AMOLED display, up to 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a massive 6,000mAh battery with passthrough charging support, dual front-facing stereo speakers, an in-display fingerprint sensor, and a whole lot of goodies packed inside a gamer-centric chassis. On the software side, the device offers a pretty polished user experience through the latest ZenUI 7/ROG UI skin on top of Android 10.
ASUS ROG Phone 3 XDA Review: The King of Gaming Smartphones is back
The Taiwanese OEM has already released an official bootloader unlock tool and continues to publish up-to-date kernel source code for the device, which should be useful in getting the ball rolling on making custom ROMs, kernels, and other modifications. In addition, with the company shipping devices to developers, we expect third-party development to switch to high gear on our forums.
List of developers who will get the ROG Phone 3
Here is the list of developers that were selected to receive the ASUS ROG Phone 3.

|Captain_Throwback||TWRP||TWRP developer for multiple HTC devices|
Some of the developers in the list have already received their devices, which is why we are already seeing some releases such as an early TWRP build and custom kernels like Kirisakura Kernel and CleanSlate Kernel. The CleanSlate developer in particular is having a bit of fun with the device, with tweaks to the notification LED and more actions for the AirTriggers squeeze feature.
Porting AOSP takes a bit more time, especially since there are always unforseen issues with pairing the AOSP framework with vendor binaries (the under-display fingerprint sensor is a common issue for AOSP builds, for example, because there is no standard implementation for it). The listed custom ROM developers who have already received their devices are working diligently to fix these and other issues, so keep an eye out on our forums for when the builds are stable enough for public use.
If you’re wondering about Google Camera ports, the latest builds by Wichaya support the ROG Phone 3. With the Google Camera port, you can use all 4 camera lenses and even capture 64MP unbinned images with HDR+ enhanced enabled. While you don’t need to root your phone to use a Google Camera port, there are other benefits to rooting, such as being able to enable VoLTE on T-Mobile in the U.S.
In our ROG Phone 3 and ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro reviews, we noted how ZenUI/ROG UI offers welcome customization options without significantly altering the stock Android look and feel that we have all grown to love. From our conversations with ASUS, it’s clear their software development team values giving users as much choice as possible. However, there are only so many features the OEM can officially support, but there are no restraints on what third-party custom ROM and kernel developers can cook up. With physical devices in their hands, these developers will be in a better position to contribute to projects that offer more choice to end-users and eventually help extend the life of the phone. We hope to see more OEMs recognize the potential of an active development community and follow in the footsteps of ASUS.
If you’re interested in purchasing the ROG Phone 3, you can grab it from the ASUS Store in Europe or Taiwan. The 8GB RAM + 256GB Strix Edition costs €799, but it features the Snapdragon 865 rather than the 865 Plus. The Snapdragon 865 Plus is found in the higher-end 12 + 512 and 16 + 512 models costing €999 and €1,099 respectively. The phone has been confirmed to launch in the U.S., but ASUS has not announced a launch date yet.
Device seeding is also planned for the ROG Phone 3’s sibling device, the ZenFone 7 series, but no devices have been shipped yet and/or the list has not been finalized. Once we can confirm those details, we’ll follow up with a separate article.The TCL TAB is a $199 8″ Android tablet available from Verizon
At IFA 2020 early last month, TCL unveiled two new Android tablets — the TCL 10 TabMax and TCL 10 TabMid. Out of the two, the cheaper TCL 10 TabMid featured an 8-inch FHD+ display, Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon 665 SoC, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. The company has now launched a tablet with similar specifications in the US, called the TCL TAB.

The new TCL TAB features the same overall design as the TCL TabMid, with an 8-inch FHD+ display on the front surrounded by chunky bezels. However, over on the back, the TCL TAB features a plain black finish with Verizon branding, instead of the dark blue finish we saw on the TabMid. The company has also made some minor changes to the specifications, and the TCL TAB only packs in 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. But on the bright side, it includes a larger 5,500mAh battery.
Other than these changes, the TCL TAB is largely the same as the TCL TabMid. It is also powered by the Snapdragon 665 chipset, it features a single camera module on the back with an 8MP sensor, and it packs in a 5MP selfie shooter. Other features include a USB Type-C port for charging and data syncing, 802.11 b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 5.0. In terms of software, the TCL TAB runs Android 10. The company has also promised at least one major OS update and quarterly security patches for a minimum of two years for the device.
Pricing & Availability
The TCL TAB will be available exclusively on Verizon in the US, which means that it comes with a host of preloaded Verizon apps. These include Digital Secure, Ignite, My Verizon, Verizon Cloud, and Verizon Messages+. The tablet is priced at $199.99, and it will be available for purchase at Verizon stores and other online retailers starting today. As mentioned earlier, the tablet will be available in a single Suede Black color variant.Why Is Sony Going under and How Can It Save Itself?
One of the most iconic names in the mobile industry has always been the Japanese giant, Sony. Over the years, we have seen this company going from an icon, to an evil empire going after poor developers (yeah, yeah… different division), to one of the most friendly giants a developer could hope to have as a friend. Over the last couple of years, Sony has shown the developer world (and really the entire world) that being a ginormous global corporation should not prevent you from keeping in touch with the people who have helped to make you big in the first place. You can be friendly with lesser groups (us :p) and you can also do simple things like play by the rules (ie following GPL as they should). However, it seems that the old saying “good guys finish last” does hold some truth to it. Unfortunately, a few days ago, a report came out stating that Sony is considering selling their phone division. This comes out not long after Sony’s sale of their laptop computer division. So, it seems that Sony is trying to trim down the fat in order to survive. But, is this the right way of surviving?
According to various reports floating around on the web, Sony will have lost roughly US$1.9 billion dollars this coming March, which is a ridiculously large amount for any company trying to make a living by selling… well, anything. Now, Sony is a company that has branched out into so many areas that “Jack of all Trades” falls short in comparison. They do have some rather profitable areas such as their Playstation division as well as their cameras. When it comes to TV’s, they are getting their behinds handed over to them in a silver platter, courtesy of Samsung and LG. And of course, you have other areas such as Sony Music, which will keep the brand alive for the foreseeable future. However, this alone is not enough to keep the entire company afloat.
As mentioned earlier, they axed their Vaio division not too long ago due mainly to dismal sales and increase in competition in markets where they had some levels of dominance. Acer, Asus, Lenovo and others began pushing out cheaper products, which basically pushed Sony into a corner. On top of all this, the former Ericsson division, which was completely acquired a couple of years ago by Sony, has been currently trying their hardest to look alive. Multiple device releases per year with a yearly flagship, new innovative tech (submersible devices, screen tech, and more) have been paramount for them since the introduction of the Z line (and even a little before). Despite all their efforts, the company seems to be giving up as it simply cannot win against the likes of Apple and Samsung, both of which dominate the markets worldwide with vast percentages.
Focusing solely on their phone division, it is actually not hard to see why they are where they are right now. After quickly browsing through the 4 major US carrier’s websites, one can tell what is going on. Out of the 4, only two of them offered Sony devices (T-Mobile and Verizon). Each one of them offered 1 device (each) – the Xperia Z3 (and Z3v for Verizon) whereas they offered about 9 variants of Galaxy devices and 6 others of iPhones (and a slew of other brands including HTC, LG, etc). They have 0 penetration in the US markets as their only other outlet would be to sell unlocked directly from Sony stores or via other venues such as Amazon, eBay, etc. And yes, we do realize that the US is not the only nor the largest mobile market in the world, but it does represent a very large portion of it.
The other issue with Sony’s model revolves around their support structure. This, as it is always the case, is a typical scenario for ymmv (your mileage may vary). Some people hate them and you do also get the mixed stories about successful repairs with minimal to no hassle. However, if anyone browses through their support forum, they will quickly realize that they are not exactly all that great. And since there is never a second without a third, you have the issue (which beautifully magnifies the effect of the support issues) of build quality concerns. Point and case, did you know that the first generation Xperia Z‘s processor heated up so much that it warped the glass back and unset the glue holding it together? Well, whether Sony admitted it or not, the issue was there with lots of reports and they flat out denied it.
So, Sony… you have the trifecta of death unfortunately: low sales, poor customer support, and quality issues. How to fix this? Well, obviously marketing would do you wonders mainly because people cannot buy your product if they do not know it exists. You are in the money losing wagon at this point and I don’t believe you will outbudget Samsung or Apple in marketing dollars. But, as a last resort, I would try one final push, going out through the big door, going all out, etc, etc. You have to somehow convince the people that you have better bang for their buck, which brings me to my next point… price. Most of your devices (newer ones) hit the shelves grossly overpriced (when compared to your competitor’s flagships for instance). Stop doing this! There is no worse buyer’s repellent than overpriced hardware. Also, own up to possible mistakes. You’ll look better in the end by admitting that there may be something wrong than trying to deny the existence of a sheet with over 700 entries of people reporting the same issue. And no, water cannot get past a water indicator without activating it (true story btw, I actually got this from Sony techs after sending my Xperia Z in for water damage which had gotten in through the warped glass in the back, which they graciously denied to repair or replace).
I am not sure if you will be able to save the phone division, but taking the steps above might throw you a line to survive a bit longer. Who knows? You might even be able to beat HTC or even LG by bringing some of your mid range devices into the US market as well, thus breathing some life into those deep red numbers of yours.
If you were in Sony’s shoes, what would you do? We’d love to hear your thoughts.You can now opt out of having your Samsung Pay data sold
In the internet age, privacy is a big topic. How much privacy we should have, how to keep our data private, how should companies be able to take and sell our data? It’s all very important to talk about and have control over. Companies are just now starting to give us more control over what data we allow for them to take and sell. Samsung is late to this trend but is finally allowing users to stop Samsung Pay from selling their data.
In the latest Samsung Pay update in the United States, I noticed a pop-up on the main screen of Samsung Pay asking me to review my privacy settings. This was interesting because I’ve never actually seen any privacy settings in Samsung Pay, even though I’ve used it since the Galaxy S8 almost 3 years ago. This pop-up leads to a new Privacy Controls setting in Samsung Pay. These settings allow you to control your data and flip the “Do Not Sell” switch to stop Samsung from selling this data to “Samsung Pay partners.”
I am a long-time Samsung Pay user and I was honestly shocked to see Samsung was selling my Samsung Pay data. Companies like Google are pretty open about the amount of data they track and sell and how they sell it. Samsung isn’t as open about the amount of data they track or sell. The reason Samsung added this “Do Not Sell” is because of the CCPA, or the “California Consumer Privacy Act.” According to Samsung’s privacy page about the CCPA, the act gives California residents three basic rights. These rights are access to your personal information, deletion of your personal information, and the ability to stop Samsung, or other companies, from selling your personal information.
Samsung and other companies are not required to approve these requests or even show the options to residents outside the state of California. I’m not a resident of California and still have the settings, so it seems like Samsung might be allowing anyone in the United States access to stop their data from being sold. This leaves the downside of losing some personalized features, but if you’re concerned about privacy, this is a great option.Amazon Fire 7 (5th and 7th gen) can now be unlocked and rooted
Unlike some OEMs out there, Amazon isn’t a fan of letting their owners unlock the bootloader of their devices. Still, this limitation hasn’t stopped the Amazon Fire tablet series from becoming huge sellers for the company. This also doesn’t stop our enthusiast user base from hacking into these devices either. A couple of months ago the Amazon Fire HD 8 had been unlocked and rooted and now the same thing is possible on both the 5th generation and 7th generation of the Amazon Fire 7 tablets.
Amazon Fire XDA Forum
In the guide linked below, XDA Senior Member k4y0z thanks a handful of people for helping along with this process. From answering questions to testing the process, we often see great things come from these types of collaborations. To complete this unlock and root method though, you will need a Linux installation or live-system and a micro USB cable. Also, if your tablet has a “newer preloader-version” such as the 7th generation devices, then you may also need to open the device and use something conductive (such as a paperclip or tweezers).

Via: LiliputingSamsung Galaxy Note 10 Display Analysis: The Most Vibrant and Brightest, but Not the Most Accurate
Samsung and Apple are the two back-to-back contenders for “best smartphone display”, and the title is sometimes thought to belong to the company who’s released the latest phone. However, since both companies source their displays from Samsung Display, many believe that it is Samsung’s smartphones that must have the better displays. This belief is flawed since Samsung Display is actually a separate company from Samsung Mobile, who assembles the Galaxy smartphones, and who are also a client to Samsung Display. And just like any other client, the OEM is ultimately responsible for the color calibration qualities shipped on their phones’ displays, and the latest panels don’t necessarily mean the best-calibrated. In this review, we take an extensive look at panel qualities of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and how well it has been calibrated according to industry standards.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Display Specifications
The Note lineup has previously been thought of as giant phones with extra-large displays, but Samsung switched it up with the Galaxy Note 10 to be more in-line in size with their S-series phones. The regular Galaxy Note 10 is very similar in size to the Galaxy S10, only slightly larger — the display is about 0.2 inches wider and 0.1 inches taller. The front-facing camera is housed in a small cut-out circle at the top-center of the display, which was previously at the top-right on the S10. I personally think that it looks goofier in the middle than on the right, but it is actually more out-of-the-way when using the phone since nothing is usually in the middle of the status bar anyway, and it doesn’t shove the system icons awkwardly to the left.
The panel is coined “Dynamic AMOLED” by Samsung, which they mainly attribute to its HDR10+ capability and its reduction in harmful blue light. This is the most Apple move Samsung has made in a while, in my opinion. The display has a native resolution of 2280×1080 pixels over its 6.3-inch display, or 401 pixels-per-inch. This pixel density is absolutely mediocre for a $950 phone, especially when Samsung’s “mid-range” S10e has a higher pixel density, and its S10 counterpart has a 1440p screen. The lower density is immediately noticeable to me when reading text, and 1080p videos definitely do not look as sharp as 1440p videos do on the S10. Samsung has been indecisive between rendering at 1080p or 1440p, as suggested by their 1080p render resolution on their 1440p panels. It would seem that Samsung would benefit from taking Apple’s approach of targetting a specific pixel density in-between, and custom-manufacture panels with resolutions for that pixel density for both sizes of their smartphones. Apple targets 458 pixels-per-inch for their OLED iPhones, which is between 1080p and 1440p for their respective sizes, and, in my opinion, is the sweet-spot between pixel density and power consumption without the need to downsample. However, I imagine that manufacturing panels at these specific resolutions is actually more costly than just using the mass-produced 1440p fabrication process.
Samsung boasts that their displays, starting from the S10, help against eye fatigue by reducing the amount of blue light within the “harmful range.” They achieve this by shifting the wavelength of their blue OLED a little further up the visible spectrum, and it is not a screen “filter” that some may have been lead to believe. Because adjusting the wavelength of a light source changes the color of its light, Samsung needed to have completely recalibrated their panels for the new OLED. At a glance, Samsung seems to have done a good job of color-matching it to their previous OLEDs as indicated by their similar (warm) white point, but I can’t help but wonder if it’s a reason for why they’re still calibrated so warm.
Display Profiles & Color Gamut
The Galaxy Note 10 maintains the two standard color profiles, Natural and Vivid, for Android devices adopting Google’s color management system.
The Natural profile was the default display profile set on my US Snapdragon variant, and if Samsung is to follow the same trend as on the S10, it is the default profile for the US and Europe, while Vivid is the default for Asia. It is the color-accurate display profile, employing color management to render content in their intended color space, and defaults to targeting sRGB, the standard color space for the entire Internet, for non-contexted colors. The adoption of color management in Android apps is still very low, but Samsung’s Gallery app and Google Photos both support viewing wide-color images. As seen in the Color Gamut figure, the profile doesn’t seem to reach the full saturation for blue, and it is slightly warmer than standard.
The Vivid profile expands the color saturation of colors on the screen and modifies the white point to be colder, which can be further adjusted by the available color temperature slider. Its color gamut is about 54% larger, with 22% increased reds, 38% increased greens, and 28% increased blues relative to its Natural profile. And while the profile does expand saturation, its greens and blues are both shifted towards cyan. This may be undesirable to those that want to use a profile that just expands color saturation but not the originally intended hue of colors. The profile also does not support Android’s color management system, which is detrimental to content retaining the same relative artistic intent (if apps supported it). There are phones that provide both a color saturation-expanding profile and color management, like the OnePlus 7 Pro, which improves the viability of color saturation-expanding profiles.
Brightness: A
When it comes to display brightness, Samsung’s mobile OLEDs have always typically been the brightest. Peak display brightness is a quality that pretty much all comes from the provided panel and its rated power efficacy. This is where Samsung shines (!) since their group affiliation with Samsung Display can nag them first-in-line for their latest schematics and panels. Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro phones, however, did not release too-long after, and also use the same-generation panels as the S10 and Note 10.
In its Natural profile, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10’s manual brightness ranges from 1.85 nits at its minimum up to 377 nits at its maximum. This is measured at 100% APL, which is a fullscreen white image and when OLEDs are typically the dimmest. At 100% APL, the power management of the display driver is at its maximum for its specific white level (if any), and no brightness boosting is applied. The Natural profile does not employ any brightness boosting, and it does not seem to have much brightness decay due to power management — in fact, the display brightness seems to slightly increase with higher APL, the inverse of what’s expected of OLED displays. However, as revealed later from our grayscale measurements, there actually is brightness decay with increased APL for lower color intensities, and Samsung must be applying some sort of boosting to keep 100%-intensity white brightness readings similar (and slightly higher).
For the Vivid profile, the manual brightness ranges from 1.85 nits to 380 nits at 100% APL. Unlike in the Natural profile, Samsung squeezes as much brightness as they can out of the Vivid profile, boosting up to 7% in brightness per 100 nits average display luminance. As a result, the Vivid profile can boost up to 420 nits at 50% APL, peaking at 480 nits at a low <1% APL.
Under intense ambient light, the Galaxy Note 10 enters high brightness mode in which the panel draws additional power, boosting up to about 790 nits for 100% APL for both display profiles. Additional boosting is also enabled for both profiles at lower content pixel levels under high ambient light (where this boosting is usually disabled for the Natural profile), further boosting up to 915 nits for 50% APL, and capping out at 1115 nits for a tiny lit region of the screen.
Color Accuracy & Balance: B
Preface:
Smartphone displays are getting good. Really good. The displays on some of the latest smartphones seem to be acing tests in color accuracy. However, when they are pitted against reference-grade monitors, they may be far from it. ΔE values from low-breadth patterns don’t tell the whole story. Display assessments must be improved to better reflect the nuanced performance of a display and to be able to better distinguish the calibration characteristics between very good displays.
We have moved on to a new objective color difference metric, ΔETP (ITU-R BT.2124), which is an overall better measure for color differences than ΔE00 that is used in my previous reviews and is still currently being used in many other sites’ display reviews. Those that are still using ΔE00 for color error reporting are encouraged to use ΔEITP, as will be detailed in a session from the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) and Portrait Displays (owner of CalMan).
ΔETP values are roughly 3× the magnitude of ΔE00 values for the same color. The metric assumes the most critically-adapted viewing condition for the observer, and a measured ΔETP color difference value of 1.0 denotes a just-noticeable-difference for the color, and a value less than 1.0 signifies that the measured color is indistinguishable from perfect. For our reviews, a ΔETP value of less than 3.0 is an acceptable level of accuracy for a reference display (suggested from ITU-R BT.2124 Annex 4.2), and a ΔETP value greater than 8.0 is noticeable at a glance (tested empirically, and the value (8.0) also nicely lines up with roughly a 10% change in luminance, which is generally the change in percentage needed to notice a difference in brightness at a glance).
We also curated a more-exhaustive set of testing patterns to better assess total color accuracy covering more conditions. For these reasons, the ΔE values we present for this review cannot be directly compared to ΔE values reported in previous reviews since both the metric and the testing patterns differ, with our newer assessments reporting larger overall ΔE values. The methodology and test patterns are explained in a previous section.
As is Samsung tradition, the white point is calibrated too warm, with a correlated color temperature of about 6215 K for 100% white. Considering that OLED displays are subject to metameric failure and appear warmer for the same color measurements than their transmissive LCD counterparts, measuring too warm puts the Galaxy displays even further from the industry-standard white point. An inaccurate, warm white point is a detriment to the whole color gamut of the Note 10, shifting all colors towards red and decreasing color accuracy. Some may suggest that this is due to Samsung’s adaptive white point that was part of their old Adaptive display profile, but that does not apply to the Natural profile (nor does it seem to exist in the Vivid profile), and the Note 10 was measured in a near-pitch-black room.
Given Samsung’s supposed supremacy in display color accuracy, our evaluation of the Galaxy Note 10’s color accuracy for sRGB in its Natural profile is actually slightly disappointing. The profile has an average color difference ΔETP of 4.5 for sRGB, with a standard deviation of 4.6 throughout its intensity range. This means that, on average, sRGB colors on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 are imperfect and above reference tolerance, though many are unlikely to be noticed besides the outliers. The high standard deviation of 4.6 is due to those outliers with high errors, and this puts colors that are indistinguishable from perfect and color errors that are noticeable at a glance all within one standard deviation from the average.
The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is most accurate at maximum current intensity, with an average color difference ΔETP of 3.4, yet it slightly undersaturates its reds and blues. As color intensity reduces, so does the color accuracy of the Galaxy Note 10. High-saturation reds become radically oversaturated, and at the lowest intensities, the whole gamut is oversaturated. For very-low 4% intensities the profile has an average color difference ΔETP of 10.3, which may appear unpleasant at minimum display brightness levels and with low-intensity scenes in general. The Note 10’s Natural profile has a very high maximum error of 30 for low-intensity, max-saturation sRGB red. The overall average does not include the ΔETP value for this very-low intensity since color accuracy at these luminance levels is not as important and are often off-mark on OLED displays.
Click here for a link to the smartphone color accuracy reference chart. Note that the measurements in this list use the old methodology, and the Note 10* is scaled accordingly.
Fortunately, the Galaxy Note 10 does slightly better reproducing P3 colors in its Natural profile than sRGB colors, although sRGB gamut accuracy is definitely more important. Saturation targets are tracked quite nicely for P3 colors, and there are no gross oversaturations at lower intensities. Blues, however, are still shifted in hue and slightly oversaturated at lower intensities, just like they are for sRGB colors. Samsung seems to have an issue with color mixing at lower intensities, and color primaries approach that of the display’s native gamut as current intensity is reduced. The Natural profile has an overall average ΔETP of 4.2 for P3 colors, with a much lower standard deviation of 2.9.
The RGB drive balance for both the Natural profile and the Vivid profile remain consistent throughout its intensity range. The three color channels remain within 10% of its maximum intensity, so the color of white and gray does not noticeably drift too far. In regards to color shifting at varying APL, the Note 10’s panel behavior has increasing reds and blues and slightly-decreasing greens as display emission increases. This results in a panel that shifts toward magenta at higher APLs, becoming more severe the higher the display brightness.
Contrast & Tone Response: B
An average pixel level (APL) of 50% is a typical pixel level for many apps and their content. At 50% APL, the Note 10 has a higher gamma than the standard of 2.20, measuring at about 2.35 for both the Natural and Vivid profiles. This results in the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 usually displaying a picture with higher contrast than standard. For low APL, which correspond to dark scenes and dark-mode apps, the display gamma on both profiles is closer to the 2.20 standard, though it’s still slightly high. However, this is offset by low APL content usually being viewed in low/dark ambient lighting, at which a display gamma closer to 2.40 is usually desired. For low display brightness and low content APL, the Note 10 boosts its shadows, resulting in a gamma of about 2.06 for those super-dim conditions where the panel may have difficulties rendering dark shades. Nevertheless, the display gamma should ideally remain consistent and independent from content APL, and should only be modified by either a change in ambient lighting or by external tone mapping.
Both profiles have the same target transfer function, which is responsible for the display’s intended contrast and gamma. In reality, the actual gamma is different between the two profiles because the Vivid profile boosts its brightness with lower content APL, while the Natural profile does not. In theory, the brightness boost of the Vivid profile means that its display gamma and contrast should increase with display brightness relative to the Natural profile, which it does. However, when averaging the Galaxy Note 10’s gamma throughout its brightness range, the two profiles actually average out to be very similar to one another. This is a bit unusual since the Natural profile is meant to have nearly no variance in luminance with APL, yet the profile has a considerable discrepancy in contrast between low 1% APL and medium 50% APL. So while the Natural profile has no brightness boost, it is still subject to luminance decay from increased display emission, and low-intensity shades are affected the most. This results in the Natural profile’s increased display gamma at higher display emissions.
Overall, the gamma and contrast of the Natural profile aren’t too accurate and are also quite inconsistent. They vary significantly with brightness and APL, ranging from 2.06 for low-brightness at low-APL up to 2.47 for medium-brightness at 50% APL. Although the Vivid profile isn’t to be seriously evaluated for accuracy, a display profile should maintain a consistent gamma, if not following a color appearance model.
On the Exynos Galaxy S10 I previously reviewed, I noticed that its display strangely followed the sRGB transfer function instead of a straight gamma power. However, I then found that the Snapdragon variant normally followed a straight 2.20 gamma power and that the two panels had different calibrations. The Galaxy Note 10 I’m reviewing is a Snapdragon variant, and while I do not own an Exynos Note 10, I believe that Samsung may still be targeting the sRGB transfer function for certain variants. DisplayMate’s intensity scale for their Note 10+ precisely matches the intensity scale for my Exynos S10 and the sRGB transfer function, with the same reported gamma. My guess is that Samsung is now natively decoding RGB triplets with the sRGB transfer function for the Natural profile in the Exynos display pipeline.
With the Exynos S10, I thought that Samsung may have finally fixed their issues with black clipping. While the sRGB transfer function isn’t as punchy and doesn’t provide as much contrast as a straight gamma power, it did have the benefit of cheating around black crush by significantly lifting near-black shades. With the Snapdragon Galaxy Note 10, the panel still exhibits the same amount of black clipping as all previous Samsung Galaxy displays (apart from the cheating Exynos variants). Samsung continues to fail to render its first 5 steps of its 8-bit intensities, and there’s absolutely no reason for it at this point besides negligence.
High brightness mode on my previous Exynos S10 would also adjust the display gamma for high ambient lighting, significantly reducing the contrast and lightening screen colors to improve sunlight legibility and perceived color accuracy. It looks like this is no longer the case for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, unless that feature is also unique to the Exynos variants. If it is, it would be a welcome addition to Snapdragon devices.
HDR Video Playback: D
With the release of the Galaxy S10, Samsung began to make a push for HDR10+, boasting its latest phones’ capabilities to both capture and playback videos in the new format. It’s actually quite remarkable that phones are now able to support it. But just how accurate can a smartphone reproduce HDR content? For our assessment, we will only be staging 8-bit colors and static metadata.
The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 doesn’t seem to reproduce the absolute Perceptual Quantizer all that well, unfortunately. Shadows start off too dark, and it jumps up too high in brightness, overexposing the entire scene. The peak brightness of 1000 nits for 20% APL is great, however, and Samsung does correctly roll off into it instead of clipping like the Sony Xperia 1. The Note 10 also doesn’t do too well at reproducing HDR color, missing a large chunk of the red and orange hues within the HDR sRGB gamut. Orange, pink, and purple hues are completely off-mark in the HDR P3 gamut, likely from overshooting the base PQ curve. The color error for these reference colors are quite high, and they don’t even cover a significant portion of the total color volume of the BT2100 color space.
Final Thoughts
Even though the Galaxy Note 10 is only meant to be a minuscule update to the Galaxy S10, I’m a little disappointed in the direction (or lack thereof) that Samsung seems to be heading. The resolution downgrade to 1080p on the “base” Note 10, for example, is uncalled for. There are many people, including me, that can absolutely resolve the Note 10’s 401 pixels-per-inch. OnePlus had constantly been under fire for maintaining the same 401 pixels-per-inch in their displays, and Samsung should not be held sanctuary. That pixel density hovers within most people’s visual acuity at typical smartphone-viewing distances, and it needs to clear it a good-leap further to comfortably appear perfectly sharp for more people.
Color accuracy and its intricacies are a very niche matter. Most people don’t necessarily care for perfect color reproduction, which is why I tend to weigh it lower in my overall grade. But those that genuinely do care for color accuracy need to know the full extent of its calibration qualities. This is where the Note 10 — and Samsung’s calibrations in general — doesn’t perform as great as most outlets lead them on to be. DisplayMate is generally to be acknowledged for that since Samsung seems to time-after-time ace DisplayMate’s color accuracy tests. Most don’t question it, because it does require a lot of knowledge of the subject to understand what you’re looking at when you’re reading color accuracy measurements. One of the issues is that DisplayMate only measures 41 colors on the display at its maximum brightness. This is not enough measurements at enough display conditions to form a metric that accurately describes the general accuracy of a display. Because, as shown in my measurements, the color accuracy of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 rapidly deteriorates at lower color intensities. Many intricate details about the panel calibration are left out, including black clipping, drive variance, and properly-averaged gamma (since gamma also changes with total emission). All of these are very important characteristics of a reference monitor, and a display review should bring light to these issues.
Given the ever-rising ubiquity of smartphones and their utility, there should really be more independent testing of smartphone displays that can hold them to these higher standards.
But for those that don’t care about color accuracy, it’s just another brighter panel, with no other improvements, and a reduction in pixels. However, other panels are getting just as bright, and many displays are also already rather accurate, with quite a number of them being more accurate than the Galaxy Note 10. Then there are those that are now including higher refresh rate panels, which provide an actually-noticeable umph to the smartphone display experience — an umph that hasn’t been felt (or seen) in newer display feature additions in a while. And these factors, in my modest judgment, now blur the line that props up the Galaxy lineup as a leader in smartphone displays. Which is fine, because it is a result of the latest smartphone displays just becoming that good, and they need this additional scrutiny to be able to differentiate them.

- 1080p/401 PPI panel on a $950 device is mediocre
- White point in Natural profile too warm
- Low-intensity colors are oversaturated
- HDR10 playback needs improvement
- No improvements in black clipping

Beyond this, the OPPO Find X2 Pro also supports dual-frequency GNSS, and has been certified as an Android Enterprise Recommended smartphone, as well as a Youtube Signature Device. Kernel sources for the devices is also available. OPPO has also promised to bring the Android 11 Beta 1 to the device series later this month, so that is something to look forward to as well.
Pricing and Availability in India
The OPPO Find X2 will be available in India for ₹64,990 (~$853) for the 12GB + 256GB variant, in Ceramic Black and Ocean Glass colors. The device will be available for purchase from June 27, 2020.

Amazon and Google have been the two major players in the smart speaker market, but it was Amazon who enjoyed a big lead through most of this time. Data released last month showed that Google was actually able to beat Amazon in overall sales for Q1 2018. This was the first time that had happened and it seems like it has put Amazon on the defensive. Today, the company has announced a new product called the Amazon Fire TV Cube, which combines the Amazon Echo smart speaker, the Amazon Fire TV streaming set-top box, and a universal remote.
This is actually an interesting device and it finally allows Amazon to compete with the various Android TV set-top boxes and smart TVs. While it makes little sense to put this specific device all throughout the house, it can replace a smart speaker in any room with a TV. So just like Amazon Echo devices, it offers hands-free access to Alexa and you get all of the features that are currently offered by the Amazon Fire TV boxes and dongles.
The Amazon Fire TV Cube even supports 4K Ultra HD content up to 60 frames per second, HDR, and Dolby Atmos. The box will be priced at $120 when it launches and pre-orders will begin later today. If you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber you can get $30 off the price (bringing it down to $90) if you place your order today or tomorrow. This seems like a short window for a pre-order discount, but Amazon is known to put their Alexa and Fire TV devices on sale quite often, so look for them to discount this a number of times throughout the year.
The official ship date for the Amazon Fire TV Cube will begin on June 21st, and as of right now, the product is only available to customers in the United States.

The Galaxy S11 series is set to be the next big flagship release from Samsung. These phones will be officially announced in the next few months, but in the meantime, we’re already seeing leaks. So far, we’ve seen the Galaxy S11+, Galaxy S11, and Galaxy S11e in renders. We’ve also heard about some rumored features. So, while we wait for more, let’s open the forums!

Samsung Galaxy S11e XDA Forums
So what do we know so far? The Galaxy S11 and Galaxy S11+ both have five cameras on the back. They are oriented differently, though, and the S11+ is said to have a larger 108MP camera. The Galaxy S11e features a triple camera setup in a similar shape as the Galaxy S11. So all three models will have plenty of cameras, but the S11+ will be a step above.
Another big differentiator will be screen size. The Galaxy S11e is the smallest coming in at 6.3-inches. The Galaxy S11 is next up with a 6.7-inch display. You guessed it, the Galaxy S11+ has the biggest display at 6.9-inches. All of these will be curved Dynamic AMOLED screens and we could see 120Hz refresh rate support as well. Some of the other features that have been rumored include at least 25W charging and 8K video recording.

They will surely be very popular devices for 2020.When it comes to the highly competitive voice assistant market, Amazon isn't playing around.

Needless to say, the...Alexa Cast is Amazon’s answer to the Chromecast Audio, but it only works with Amazon Music
One of the many great features you get with owning a Chromecast is the ability to cast pretty much any media you want. You can stream Netflix, YouTube, Spotify – even Amazon Music – directly to it. You can use an Amazon Alexa device as an audio-based Chromecast, but there’s a catch – it only works with Amazon Music. That means you can’t stream any of your favorite music services directly to your Echo device and you’re locked into Amazon’s offerings. What’s more, you need a subscription which Amazon Music to do that. It’s called Alexa Cast, and it’s rolling out now.
Of course, its abilities lie in its ease of use. You can simply connect to your Echo device and start playing music. We can only imagine that it will be expanded to support other services at a later date, but for now, it’s a bit limited. Not everybody wants to pay for an Amazon Music subscription, especially when services like Spotify already dominate the market. We can see it eventually flourishing into a full-blown Google Chromecast competitor once it grows. Alexa Cast even allows you to play music on multiple devices at the same time, great for a house party if you’ve got more than one device.
Alexa Cast works with any Alexa-enabled device. That means it supports Echo speakers, third-party Alexa products, and some of the Fire devices that you can get today. It’s not exactly a revolutionary, never-before-seen feature, but it’s one that helps the company compete with Google’s offerings. Still, if it continues to offer only exclusive services then that will deem the feature irrelevant for many. While an Amazon Prime subscription does include the company’s Music service, most people have all of their playlists on other services. We’ll see how Alexa Cast is expanded in the future, but it’s going to require a lot of work on Amazon’s part to make it fully competitive.

Besides the next-gen Google Assistant, one of the coolest new features for Android 10 that Google showed off at I/O this year was Live Caption. It’s part of Google’s push to make Android more accessible for users with disabilities like hearing impairment, and what it does is transcribes audio that’s playing on the device into captions that float on the screen. It works offline and with most apps that play audio on your phone, including videos and podcasts. Google demoed the feature in a pre-recorded video played at I/O, but rather than making it immediately available like Live Transcribe, they’ll be rolling it out to “select phones running Android Q later this year.” Thanks to an unreleased APK we obtained from the Pixel 4 XL, we managed to get Live Caption working ahead of the feature’s general availability. Here’s our first look at the new feature.
Thanks to Nextrift, we got our hands on a treasure trove of APKs from the Pixel 4, including the Motion Sense APK and the new live wallpapers. One of the APKs they also sent us is an unreleased version of “Device Personalization Services.” This app is responsible for showing app shortcuts in the recent apps overview and Pixel Launcher app drawer, and it’s also what allows Pixel owners to select text and images in the recent apps overview. Version 1.6.255525616 of the app is technically older than what’s publicly available—the latest on APKMirror is version 2.0.268948072—but it’s never been publicly released. With this APK installed on my Pixel 2 XL and some other tweaks, I was able to get Live Caption to show up in Android 10’s settings.
As you can see in the first screenshot on the left shown below, the main settings page for Live Caption has 3 options. The first option is to change the language, though it’s currently limited to English since that’s the only supported language at launch. There aren’t any hints about what other languages might be supported in the future, sadly. Next, we can see a toggle to mask profanity. This will replace curse words with asterisks in the caption. Finally, there’s an option to show a Live Caption toggle in the volume panel. Besides these three toggles, there’s also a short video demo of the feature and text on the bottom explaining how it works.
You’ll see a dialog appear when the feature detects audio is being played for the first time. You can stop captioning by swiping down the notification panel, expanding the “Live Caption” notification, then tapping on the “stop” button. You can also drag the caption down to dismiss it like you can with picture-in-picture windows or bubbles.
By default, the captions appear in the middle of the screen in portrait mode and slightly above the bottom in landscape mode. You can tap and drag the caption up or down to reposition it, or you can double tap the caption to expand it.
I tested the feature in YouTube, Google Podcasts, Google Photos, Amazon Prime Video, and Netflix, and it worked in all these apps. It was accurate enough for me to understand what was being said without having to turn the volume up, but I don’t want to fully review or test the feature until it’s officially released.
Live Caption doesn’t work in phone calls, voice calls, or video calls because of a limitation in the API that is used by this feature. This same API is what allows for internal audio to be recorded in Android 10, though since Device Personalization Services is a system app, it has fewer limitations than screen recording apps.
Here’s a screen recording showing off the feature working on my Pixel 2 XL. As you can see, it generally captures what TK is saying in his OnePlus 7T unboxing video, though there are a few errors here and there.
Google says Live Caption will be available for “select, higher-end devices” due to memory and space constraints. The company planned to release a list of devices that will support the feature as we got close to the stable Android 10 release, but that obviously never happened. I’m betting that Google will debut the feature on the Pixel 4, but it’s strange that they’ve been advertising it on the official webpage for Android 10 when no devices have the feature yet. Once the feature does roll out for users, we’ll let you know.Google Duplex is letting some users book haircut appointments in the U.S.
At Google I/O 2018, Google Duplex was one of the most exciting announcements. The service uses Google’s AI to call real establishments and talk to real people to book appointments for the user. Since its announcement, the service has rolled out to Android users in 48 U.S. states and the UK, Canada, and Australia. More than two years later, the feature can now book haircut appointments for some users at select salons in the U.S.
According to VentureBeat, users with supported devices are now able to instruct Google Assistant to make an appointment at barbershops and hair salons. The main highlight is users aren’t required to speak with another human, making the feature incredibly convenient for people who don’t have the time to call themselves.
When Google first demonstrated Duplex, booking a haircut was one of the uses the company chose to highlight. Unfortunately, booking haircut appointments may have been difficult to implement, which might explain why it hasn’t shown up until now. Meanwhile, Duplex users have been able to make reservations at restaurants on their phone or buy movie tickets on the web.
Once you set your preferences Google Duplex will do the rest. Screenshots: VentureBeat
To use Google Duplex to book a haircut, you’ll have to search for a nearby business. Once you find the place you want, tap on the “Request an Appointment” button, which will then bring up three options: men’s haircut, women’s haircut, and general haircut. Once you select your haircut preference, you can enter a date, time, and time range.
VentureBeat said users will have the option to enter in a stylist’s name if they’ve been to that business before, and they’ll also be required to enter contact information, such as name, phone number, and email address. If all goes according to plan, Google Duplex should be able to make an appointment without users having to intervene. Google Duplex makes it clear to call recipients that they will be recorded, and if they object to that, the call will be handed off to an operator, who will then make the appointment for you.
When Duplex was first introduced, it received mixed reactions. As convenient as the feature was, some people felt uncomfortable with how human Duplex sounded, prompting Google to test several disclosure methods to call recipients so they were fully aware they were talking to Google Assistant and not a human.Google adds election information about where to vote in Search, Assistant and Maps
With the 2020 U.S. election just a few weeks away, finding accurate information about voting is incredibly important. That’s why Google is adding election features to Assistant and Google Search, making it easy for users to get information on how and where to vote.
Starting today, users can ask, “Hey Google, where do I vote?” and Google Assistant will show details on where to vote nearby. The new feature will work on your smartphone, smart speaker, and Smart Display.
Google is also adding information to Search and Maps. You can search for things like “early voting locations” or “ballot drop boxes near me” and Google will return results where you can vote in person and drop off your mail-in ballot. Google said results will also remind people to complete their ballot and properly seal it.
During an election year, and especially during a pandemic, getting accurate information is critical. That’s why Google partnered with the Voting Information Project to source voting information.
Google said it plans to list over 200,000 voting locations across the U.S., and in areas where voting locations aren’t yet available, it’ll surface state and local election websites. As the election gets closer, Google will continue to add more information in Search, Assistant, and Maps.
When you type in “where to vote” in Search, you’ll be prompted to type in your full address. Once you do that, Google will show you nearby locations where you can vote early, return a mail-in ballot, and also vote on election day.
Google has been actively making changes over the last few months in the lead up to this year’s election. In addition to providing voting information, the company has worked to limit the spread of misinformation on platforms like YouTube, particularly when it comes to mail-in voting.Google Pay 2.118 confirms the old app will be replaced by the Flutter one
Last week, the Google Pay team announced that the Google Pay for India app (formerly called “Tez”) is getting a major design rewrite with Flutter, Google’s open-source UI development kit. Google currently maintains two versions of the Pay app: one for global users and one for Indians. In the blog post, Google said they were “looking forward to launching Google Pay on Flutter to everyone across the world on iOS and Android.” Some took that to mean that the existing app for global users will be rebuilt with Flutter, while others took it to mean that the old app will be killed off. Tonight, Google Pay version 2.118 rolled out on the Play Store, and it confirms that the latter will happen.
The new Google Pay app built with Flutter.
Strings within the APK state that there will be a “deprecation prompt” that will inform users to download the new version of the app.
<string name="deprecation_prompt_get_gp3">Get the new GPay</string> <string name="deprecation_prompt_install_gp3">Download the new Google Pay</string> <string name="deprecation_prompt_open_gp3">Open the new GPay</string> <string name="deprecation_prompt_switch_to_gp3">Use the latest Google Pay</string>
There’s also a new Activity with more details on the app migration. The screen tells users that they’ll “still find [their] favorite features, plus track spending, get helpful insights, earn unique rewards, and more!” If you tap the “Get the new GPay” button at the bottom, the Play Store listing for the former Google Pay for India app will be launched. Currently, the new app is still regionally restricted, so I am unable to directly download it from the Play Store onto my own device.

It’s been less than a month since Google launched its latest Pixel devices, but we’ve been able to share most of the new apps from the Pixel 5. Over the last few days, we’ve released APKs for Google Recorder 2.0, Google Camera 8.0, and the updated Google Pixel Launcher. XDA Recognized Developer Pranav Pandey also managed to port the two new live wallpapers for all Android phones.
In our original post about the Pixel 5’s live wallpapers, we also talked about a third, hidden live wallpaper called Conveyor Belt that wasn’t fully implemented. At the time, we had only managed to extract a still preview of the wallpaper. Somehow, that Conveyor Belt live wallpaper rolled out to a handful of users, and so Pranav Pandey has updated his Pixel 5 live wallpaper port with this new option.
As with the previously released live wallpapers, the Conveyor Belt live wallpaper from the Pixel 5 should work on any device running Android 7.0 Nougat or higher. And it also has 4 different variants to choose from. You can install the wallpaper by downloading the APK from the forum post linked below. Once installed, the wallpaper should appear in the stock wallpaper picker on your device. In case it doesn’t, you can download the Google Wallpapers app from the Play Store to apply the wallpaper.

Android 11’s first Developer Preview is upon us, and there are going to be a ton of changes under the hood to discover and analyze. Given that it only just came out, we’re only just beginning to discover new features. On Google’s Android Developer blog, however, they’ve outlined one change that may go a long way towards ensuring the privacy of users, and it won’t be reserved for just Android 11. Developers will eventually need to get approval straight from Google in order for their Play Store app to get location services in the background.
With the release of Android 10, Google made it so that the user had to explicitly allow an app to access location services in the background. When an app requests location, currently, a prompt will appear to allow access, allow while using the app, or decline access entirely. Google appears to have taken that a step further, and developers will now need to go through the company directly. In their blog post, Google said that over half of all users selected the “while app is in use” option. With Android 11, users will also have the ability to select to allow an app access to location data one time only, where the app will then need to request it again the next time that it is launched.
As for apps accessing location data in the background, Google discovered that many apps “didn’t actually need it.” The factors the company will look at in order to decide whether an app requires the ability to access the location in the background will be the following.
- Does the feature deliver clear value to the user?
- Would users expect the app to access their location in the background?
- Is the feature important to the primary purpose of the app?
- Can you deliver the same experience without accessing location in the background?
These are the factors Google will be looking at after updating the Google Play policy. All requests for this permission will be reviewed by members of the Trust & Safety team at Google Play. Google gave the following three app examples as to how the permission will be granted for devices running Android 11.
An app that sends emergency or safety alerts as part of its core functionality – and clearly communicates why access is needed to the user – would have a strong case to request background location.
A social networking app that allows users to elect to continuously share their location with friends would also have a strong case to access location in the background.
An app with a store locator feature would work just fine by only accessing location when the app is visible to the user. In this scenario, the app would not have a strong case to request background location under the new policy.
This policy change is not immediate and will take time to implement. Google anticipates the following roll-out timeline.
- April: official Google Play policy update with background location
- May: developers can request feedback on their use case via the Play Console with an estimated reply time of 2 weeks, depending on volume
- August 3rd: all new apps submitted to Google Play that access background location will need to be approved
- November 2nd: all existing apps that request background location will need to be approved or will be removed from Google Play
Google currently encourages all developers to review their applications and ensure that when they request background location access, it’s for the right reasons. Developers are also responsible for any third-party SDKs that may try and access location in the background. This change affects more than just Android 11, as the apps will be removed from the Google Play Store entirely.
We’ve already detailed all of the major new features in Android 11, along with all of the new privacy and security improvements, so be sure to check them out!
Source: GoogleAT&T enables Dynamic Spectrum Sharing in some areas to boost 5G speeds, starting with the Galaxy S20, LG V60, and Note 10+
As the 5G race heats up in the U.S., AT&T just became the first carrier to launch Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) in some markets.
Dynamic Spectrum Sharing is a technology that allows operators to operate both 4G LTE and 5G NR simultaneously on the same network band. That means carriers don’t have to rush to erect new 5G NR cell sites or dedicate a chunk of the spectrum for either 4G or 5G. DSS provides a practical and cost-effective way for carriers to bring 5G to the masses without spending millions of dollars in building new infrastructure, which will ease the transition for carriers from non-standalone 5G networks (NSA) to standalone 5G (SA).
Unlike T-Mobile, AT&T doesn’t have any surplus mid-band spectrum on which it could expand its 5G network. This is where DSS technology will come handy for AT&T as it will enable the company to serve both 4G LTE and 5G NR users using its existing mid-band airwaves.
In the first phase, AT&T is enabling DSS in parts of North Texas and will be gradually expanding its use to more markets in the coming months. The LG V60 ThinQ 5G, Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G, and Samsung Galaxy S20 series are among the initial list of devices that will support DSS. AT&T says it will be adding support for more phones later on.
“DSS allows carriers to share the same channel between both 4G and 5G users simultaneously. It turns up 5G without turning off LTE – creating a seamless experience for users, and a graceful spectrum transition for carriers.”

Apart from AT&T, Verizon is also planning to make use of DSS to expand its 5G coverage to more markets. The company hasn’t yet shared a concrete date about when it will make a move, but it did promise it will happen sometime in the second half of 2020.

XDA forums are home to hundreds of Android smartphones, providing device owners a centralized platform to exchange information, share their works and findings, and collaborate on custom development projects. We keep opening forums for new and upcoming smartphones to help new users and potential buyers in finding all relevant information specific to their device in one place. Last month, we opened forums for the Samsung Galaxy A51 5G, Galaxy A71 5G, and ZTE 11 5G/4G. Today, we are opening forums for three more devices: the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, OPPO Reno 4 Pro, and Nokia 8.3.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is among the five new devices Samsung announced earlier today at its Galaxy Unpacked event. We got our first look at the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra last month, followed by a hands-on video, which gave us a detailed look at the overall design. Yet another leak revealed the full specifications of the device including a 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, 120Hz screen refresh rate, Exynos 990 SoC, up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage, a 108MP primary camera, Real Feel S Pen, and a 4,500 mAh battery with support for wireless charging.

The Nokia 8.3 is already up for pre-order in Europe, and it’s set to hit the U.S. shores later this fall, as recently confirmed by the company. In terms of specifications, the phone packs a 6.81-inch full HD+ LCD with a 120Hz screen refresh rate, Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G SoC, up to 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM, up to 128GB of storage, a 64MP primary camera with ZEISS Optics, and a 4,500 mAh battery with 18W fast charging support.
Nokia 8.3 ForumsHuawei Quick Apps is Huawei’s alternative to Google Instant Apps
Android without Google and Google Mobile Services (GMS) is an alien concept to the average consumer, one that fundamentally alters the experience they have come to expect out of their Android smartphone. And because of certain political decisions, Huawei faces the unenviable task of convincing the world outside of China that it can provide a software experience on Android that can compete against the experience they have come to expect out of Google’s Android. The Chinese company did have some foresight, as it had begun work on several avenues much before the political decisions, and these avenues then had to step up and fill in as replacements to crucial Google services and frameworks. In this article, we take a look at Quick Apps from Huawei, one such avenue that serves as an alternative to Instant Apps from Google.
Google Instant Apps
Google introduced Instant Apps back at Google I/O 2016, imagining it as the next evolutionary step in the way Android apps are experienced. Traditionally, a user would need to download and install an entire app, even if their intention was to merely check out the app or achieve a very specific one-time task; and then also remember to uninstall the app if they wanted to keep their phone clean. With Instant Apps, users could “stream” apps to try out certain limited functionality without involving any of the friction associated with installation. This approach promised to increase the reach for app developers, as they could essentially project a native Android app experience to the user through a URL instead of merely presenting a website. Over the years, Instant Apps saw several key improvements — the Google Play Store gained support for Instant Apps, with a prominent “Try Now” button appearing next to “Install” on several popular apps, developers were allowed to publish Instant Apps without a website, and even games joined in the Instant Apps party with playable demos, something that definitely helps in engagement if the game is paid or available to pre-register only.
While Instant Apps haven’t yet completely eliminated our need for traditional apps — and by design, they cannot do so, as they are a precursor to the full experience of a traditional app or game, and not a full replacement — they do serve important functions for both users and developers. But for users and developers who are looking at Huawei for its hardware, the lack of Instant Apps will add to the overall pinch in the Google-less software experience. If an app relies on GMS for its core functionality, this functionality will also be undeliverable through Instant Apps. The absence of the Play Store also reduces the channels available for users to land on and try out Instant Apps, as the Play Store was one of the popular mediums to promote Instant Apps.
Huawei Quick Apps
In an ideal world, the political situation that forces Huawei to discontinue the use of Google services would not exist. But we do not live in an ideal world, so the next best solution for Huawei is to ensure that its stakeholders are impacted in minimal ways. For the same, the Huawei AppGallery was presented as the homegrown alternative to the Google Play Store for app distribution. HMS Core attempted to fill in the space left behind in GMS’s absence; while Huawei Ability Gallery presented itself as the comprehensive service distribution platform. Huawei Quick Apps aims to fill in the gap from Google’s Instant Apps framework, providing users with an installation-free app experience on Huawei’s smartphones.
Much like Instant Apps, Quick Apps aims to reduce the friction that users feel when they have to install an app, relying on the reluctance faced by an average user for installing a large app when they have just some limited use to look forward to. Since users are hesitant in installing new apps, developers have to explore alternate mechanisms to get their app’s experience to the user as promoting a new app becomes a difficult job under these circumstances.
Advantages
Some of these alternate mechanisms include HTML5 and Progressive Web Application (PWA), WeChat Mini Programs, Facebook Instant Game, and of course, Google Play Instant App; but there are drawbacks associated with each of these. PWAs are good for bringing about a universal experience through a browser, but they can tend to have a slower interaction experience compared to a proper application. Similarly, WeChat Mini Programs are HTML 5 and JavaScript-based programs, suffering from slower interaction experience and limited reach outside of China. Facebook Instant Game utilizes HTML 5 and WebGL, but suffers from the lack of native graphics acceleration. Google’s Instant Apps was thus a good solution against these options, but this too suffers from the limited usability as the whole intention of Instant Apps is to provide limited functions and convince the user on whether they need to install the full app.
Huawei Quick App makes use of HTML 5, JavaScript and CSS to provide a native GUI for the app, while trimming down code volume to just 20% of a traditional Android app. Quick Apps are not just limited to Huawei devices, as Huawei claims that they are compatible with a “new set of standards” supported by more than 12 major Chinese handset manufacturers, representing more than 35% of the global market and 85% of the Chinese market; and being supported on over 1 billion smartphones. The sheer scale of support makes them lucrative for developers looking to reach new users. Quick Apps also supports all “H5” apps, which are essentially mobile web pages that are frequently shared over WeChat in China. Quick Apps can also be added to the home screen on a device, and can also access device functions.
While Google’s Instant Apps could be accessed through a deeplink URL and through the Google Play Store, Huawei Quick Apps can be accessed through the Huawei AppGallery, through Search, Instant Access, Smart Care (Huawei Assistant on the homescreen), through the Huawei Quick App Center app, and through deeplink URLs. The Quick App Center app can run and manage quick apps, ensuring that you run on the latest version of the app available. It also allows users to delete data, withdraw authorizations, and disable notifications for a quick app.
As far as their basic premise goes, Quick Apps can open instantly, and be used without needing to be installed. Huawei also claims that they can update automatically, and take up limited storage space. Once closed, they can also be rediscovered easily through their home screen icon, or be found through Recently Used apps, or through Push notifications.
Huawei also claims that Quick Apps perform as well as traditional Android apps. In its tests, a Quick App performed very similarly to an equivalent Android app, while requiring only a very small fraction of storage space. This low storage requirement will come in very handy on budget smartphones, as users can confidently get lower storage devices, store their media, and still retain the ability to access native Android experiences for a lot of apps.
Huawei also claims that Quick Apps adoption is on a meteoric rise. So far, Quick Apps are supported on over 250 million Huawei phones, with an MAU of more than 30 million. Quick Apps access has also increased by 100% each quarter, and the average time per user exceeds 14 minutes per day.
In a second example, Huawei claims that Quick Apps provide better returns in promotional activities. When both Quick Apps and the traditional Android app are promoted through different means, the Android app only saw 10% of the users reached installing the app, while the Quick App saw 72% of users reached experiencing the Quick App, indicating a very substantial effect. User retention remained the same though, which still attests to the benefits of the Quick App approach. Since more users experienced the Quick App, the promotion cost per user retained came down drastically, making it a much more efficient method for promoting and advertising the app experience.
The performance-related benefits of Quick Apps extend to Quick Games too, which are essentially games in the Quick Apps format. Huawei claims that Quick Apps can be either through H5 or can be “native runtime games” as well. Native runtime games through Quick Apps promise device-level graphics acceleration, ensuring that the game runs smoothly and at high quality. The games also retain the ability to access device capabilities, including location, sensors, Bluetooth, and others.
Benefits from Quick Apps also extend to the time actually involved in building a Quick App or Quick Game. If you already have an existing H5 app or game, you can have a Quick App or Game up and running within an hour. The timeframe expands by two more days if you wish to incorporate Huawei’s account or payment services. Huawei claims that new Quick Apps can be developed and released in as early as under a week.
Disadvantages
Quick Apps have a lot of benefits, but there are some limitations to them that you as a developer should keep in mind.
If your app/game is very large in size, there is a loss in performance that becomes apparent because of the larger reduction in the volume of the package. Further, Quick Apps does not support the entire gamut of Android APIs; so if your app relies on some rarely used APIs, you will be unable to migrate completely in a clean fashion. Similarly, Huawei mentions that apps that require special permissions, such as theme APKs for example, are not supported through the Quick App format.
Quick Apps also need to run on the “Quick Application Center” platform, which will be preloaded on devices through their Android 10 updates. Devices not on Android 9 need to download and install the platform once to be able to run Quick Apps.
Phone Support
Quick Apps are useful, but their usefulness is only as wide as their availability to end users on their devices. All Huawei smartphone launched after the Huawei Mate 30 directly support Quick Apps, while other selected Huawei and Honor devices will support it when they receive their Android 10 update. Huawei has shared a list of devices that support Quick Apps after their Android 10 update:
- Huawei Mate RS
- Huawei Mate 20
- Huawei Mate 20 Pro
- Huawei Mate 20 Lite
- Huawei Mate 20 X
- Huawei Mate 10
- Huawei Mate 10 Pro
- Huawei P30
- Huawei P30 Pro
- Huawei P30 Lite
- Huawei P20
- Huawei P20 Pro
- HONOR V20
- HONOR 20
- HONOR 20S
- HONOR Magic 2
- HONOR 10
- HONOR V10
- Huawei Nova 4
- Huawei Nova 5
- Huawei Nova 5 Pro
Further, more Huawei phones can support Quick Apps once their AppGallery is updated to v10.1 or later.
Project Structure
At several of its Developer Day conferences, Huawei has shared information on the project structure of a Quick App.
A Quick App takes the .rpk extension. The project structure consists of three parts. The Manifest file contains the meta information of the Quick App, with details like the package name, app name, version number, home screen icon, page path, and other relevant configurations. The app.ux holds all the common capabilities of the project. The third element is page, and each page corresponds to a subdirectory that contains the app’s layout file, CSS file, and JavaScript running file. Each Quick App RPK is signed with a unique signature, in the same manner as Android apps are signed, so keep in mind to preserve the signature key privately and securely.
Huawei provides an IDE (for Windows and MacOS) for developing Quick Apps and Games, along with documentation on learning more about developing Quick Apps. There are demo apps included too within the IDE, so you can take a look for yourself. Once you have developed your Quick App and are ready for release, you need to sign into the Huawei Developer website and submit your Quick App, after configuring the countries and regions you want your Quick App to reach. Huawei will review the submission and then release the Quick App in the target countries and regions. If you plan to make use of Huawei’s ID, payment or push services, you would need to apply for these services before you can complete app development, debugging, submission, and review.

The Xiaomi Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro are very similar to each other, with barely any differences in their design, and just a few key differences internally.
Most of the front of the device is dominated by the 6.67″ OLED 90Hz FHD+ display that is curved on the side edges. The camera sits within the hole punch on the top left corner. The rest of the device is a standard affair of glass and metal sandwich, with a USB port on the bottom but no 3.5 mm headphone jack. Both the Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro come with quad-rear camera setups, but the sensors are different.
The Mi 10 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC, coupled with LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.0 storage. There is no microSD expandability on board, so choose the storage capacity that will last you for your usage through the years.
The biggest difference between the two phones is the rear camera setup. The primary camera on both is a 108MP sensor with OIS, though the Pro gets an 8P lens setup against the 7P lens setup on the regular variant. The specifications start diverging at this stage. The Mi 10 gets a 13MP ultra-wide, 2MP macro, and 2MP depth sensor. On the other hand, the Mi 10 Pro keeps up its Pro reputation with a 20MP ultra-wide with, a 12MP portrait, and an 8MP telephoto camera with OIS. Both the phones are capable of 8K video recording, as well as record Portrait Video, videos with Color Focus (focus is in color, while the background is monochrome), and ShootSteady videos (EIS + OIS).

Battery capacity and wired charging speeds are also different on the phones. The Mi 10 gets a larger 4,780mAh battery with 30W fast charging support while the Pro gets a relatively smaller 4,500mAh battery with faster 50W charging support. Both the devices get 30W fast wireless charging support and support for 10W reverse wireless charging. Surprisingly, both the phones come with a 65W charging brick in the box, so you can use the same charger even with laptops.
Pricing and Availability
The Xiaomi Mi 10 will be available for €799 for the 8GB + 128GB variant, and €899 for the 8GB + 256GB variant.
The Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro will be available for €999 for the 8GB + 256GB variant. China did get 12GB RAM variants, but these are not available globally just yet.
The device goes on pre-order in various parts of Europe, from April 1, 2020, onwards.AT&T’s new Unlimited Your Way plan lets you pick and choose the best plans for each family member
If you’re on AT&T, you can now mix and match your wireless plan for each family member. AT&T this week introduced an “Unlimited Your Way” plan that provides consumers with the flexibility to choose the unlimited wireless plan that best fits each person in their family. There’s no need to have everyone be on the same plan.
AT&T provides a few scenarios in which your family might want to consider its new Unlimited Your Way plan. “Whether mom needs more hotspot data for working from home, or dad wants HBO Max entertainment options — now everyone can get the features they want, without having to pay for more than you need,” AT&T said in an announcement post.
AT&T’s Unlimited Your Way plan has three options: Starter, Extra, and Elite:
- AT&T Unlimited Starter – -At $35/mo. per line for 4 lines, our best price unlimited plan includes unlimited talk, text and data, access to our 5G network, and spam and fraud blocking at no extra charge.
- AT&T Unlimited Extra – Our Extra plan gives you all the benefits of Starter plus 15GB of hotspot data and 50GB of premium data, as well as advanced security including safe browsing and identity monitoring, starting at $40/mo. per line for 4 lines.
- AT&T Unlimited Elite – Our best unlimited plan comes with everything Extra has but doubles the hotspot data to 30GB and premium data to 100GB. Plus, you can binge all the HBO Max content you like because HBO Max is also included on us, starting at $50/mo. per line for 4 lines.
Verizon offers similar mix and match options, leaving T-Mobile to be the odd one out. With AT&T continuing to expand the reach of its 5G network, the launch of Unlimited Your Way couldn’t have come at a better time.
To go along with the announcement of Unlimited Your Way, AT&T also said that teachers, nurses, and physicians will be offered 25% in savings — an offer that was previously extended to first responders, the military, and veterans.
AT&T Unlimited Your Way is available now.Access Dots now logs when your camera and microphone are accessed
Earlier this month, XDA Recognized Developer jagan2 released Access Dots, an app that alerts users when their phone’s camera or mic is in use. After some feedback, jagan2 has introduced an update that makes Access Dots even better for those who value privacy.
The update will now log when your camera and microphone were accessed, and for how long. Jagan2 explains in the release notes for the Access Dots update:
That’s a nice update if I do say so myself, and jagan2 isn’t stopping there. Access Dots will also soon display a colored dot when both your microphone and camera are accessed, which comes in addition to showing colored dots when they’re accessed individually.
If you have yet to check out Access Dots, the app aims to bring awareness to Android users. With the app installed, you’ll know if an app is surreptitiously accessing your camera and microphone, protecting you from potential snooping.
Access Dots should work on all Android devices running Android 7.0 Nougat and newer.
Access Dots XDA Forums threadSultanxda Bypasses New SafetyNet Unlocked Bootloader Check on Latest CM13 Builds for OP3
Google’s SafetyNet has been a huge thorn in the side of anyone who wants to use Android Pay while having full control over their phones. Until recently, it has mostly been about disabling Android Pay on devices with Root, but a couple days ago, Google took it one step further — they are triggering SafetyNet even on devices with unlocked bootloaders.
Thankfully, just like how Chainfire’s systemless Root has temporarily bypassed the root restrictions imposed by SafetyNet a couple of times (as has topjohnwu’s open source Magisk, an interface for systemless modding and Xposed), Sultanxda has found a temporary patch for the unlocked bootloader issue, which he has included in his latest builds of CyanogenMod 13 for the OnePlus 3.
How it works is that SafetyNet usually checks to see if the bootloader is unlocked through the use of verified boot, a feature which has only been around in Android since KitKat, and is not yet supported by every device (a feature which has become increasingly aggressive with Android 7.0 Nougat, even blocking traditional root methods on the Pixel phones). In order to support those older phones that don’t have the hardware required to support verified boot, SafetyNet fails to green if it doesn’t get any response from the verified boot test.
But as the saying goes, XDA always finds a way:
In order to bypass this, Sultanxda removed support for the verified boot flag from his modified kernel, thereby preventing the bootloader from passing the flag to SafetyNet. This gives SafetyNet the same response it would expect to see from a device that doesn’t support verified boot at a hardware level, and as a result SafetyNet allows the device to pass the test.
While this is not a permanent fix (and none before it have proven to be), it should allow people to bypass SafetyNet until Google finds a way to patch this security hole. Thankfully, this particular security hole looks like it could take Google a while to fix, but it is a shame to our enthusiast and developer community that Google is taking these steps in the first place.
People having root support for their own computers is standard for the Linux and macOS worlds (as is admin access for Windows personal computers, although it is not quite the same thing), and yet Google feels that we cannot be trusted with control over our own devices (not shipping with it by default, and taking steps to prevent people from using it). They act as if it is a device managed by them, rather than a device bought from them. Thankfully people like Sultanxda, Chainfire, and topjohnwu are here today to help restore the features taken from us, but what will happen in the future?
Spread the word about this patch so that others can enjoy it on their devices too!Cell Phone Unlocking Bill – Expert Analysis of Why it Sucks
We all remember the story on this one. It was our moment of triumph. The moment our collective voices were heard across the Capitol, which yielded a law nearly 2 years later. The glorious Cell Phone Unlocking Bill, finally came into full force in the beginning of February. As of now, it is perfectly legal to have your device SIM unlocked anywhere in the United States (that is, until the provision expires yet again towards the end of this year). There are so many things that went wrong into the creation of the current “patch” that it is difficult to pin point a place to start. Having said that, we will start with the obvious, which is what they should have done.
As you are likely aware, the provision that protects the right to unlock our devices is part of the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act). This was included in here due to it being believed that unlocking the SIM in a device would amount to violating IP rights on the software used to lock it in the first place. This was the reasoning used a few years ago to remove said exemption by the Librarian of Congress. Our compounded efforts ended up placing the exemption back in there. Why am I pointing this as a mistake? Because it should have not gone back in as part of the DMCA to begin with. This was the first step towards modernizing the laws in the United States and getting them adapted for the 21st century, which we have been part of for the last 15 years. The better course of action would have been to set it as a separate law, away from intellectual property jargon which has nothing to do with any of this, and properly set it as a stand alone law, away from the influence of people completely unqualified to judge the need (or lack thereof) for such a law. Surely, one can add provisions that are set to expire for many things, but why is there a need to set one up on being allowed to use personal, legally purchased goods, in any manner that we see fit (so as long as we are not breaking other laws, of course)?
Now, lets focus on the matter at hand. We have a “bill”, which is in full force. The bill basically is aimed at doing 3 things right now:
- Allows consumers to legally unlock the SIM card on their devices, thus allowing them to jump carriers while taking their devices with them;
- Makes the use of 3rd party software to achieve unlocking perfectly legal. Hooray! You no longer need to feel like you are looking to buy illegal drugs whenever you are going to unlock a phone;
- Forces the carriers to cooperate with you towards unlocking your devices.
Point #3 is the sticking point of this entire article. CTIA, which is an entity that is nothing but a special interest group (aka lobbyist) consisting of most carriers as well as a few handset manufacturers, put a metric ton of pressure while the crafting of the bill was taking place. The result is that even they had to do a few concessions in order to be able to have any say in the making of this bill. To be more precise, once the law went into full effect at the start of February, the carriers were supposed to take certain steps that would aid their consumers in the unlocking of their devices. Many of the carriers must have thought the law was fiction or some figment of their imagination because only one of them has done something to address everything in their to-do list, and that was Verizon (and it was forced due to them buying block C last year, which basically forced them to have every device on their network unlocked). The other 3 major US carriers lack in certain areas. Sina Khanifar, who was one of the major organizers of the original push for the legalization of SIM Unlocking, has written a blog article with a very detailed description of how each carrier fell short of the expectations. The following is a chart he made to summarize his findings
The scores are somewhat deceptive for Verizon and not really all that surprising for Sprint. For instance, (and I will take Sprint as I have a major pet peeve with their unlocking system due to personal experience), Sprint’s take on this entire thing is comical at best. While I am not going to bother in pasting the unintelligible dribble that is their unlocking policy into this post, I will condense it to the following:
- If the device you have is CDMA, there is no SIM unlocking due to a technological difference between CDMA and GSM;
- If your device is equipped with a SIM slot (namely any phone that has LTE), they will only unlock it for “international travel”, which means that they only unlock any bands that are not used in the US, despite the device having the bands required to work on other carriers;
- When an unlock is requested, they will go about giving you the “MSL”, which stands for Master Subsidy Lock. For those of you familiar with CDMA programming, the name might sounds familiar. For those of you who aren’t, the MSL is a code that unlocks the programming portion of the device. This allows carriers to push OTA programming to the device to set the carrier settings on the NV partition. Things like your phone number and your subscriber number get stored there. Now, you are likely asking yourselves why is this required for SIM unlocking the phone? The answer is, it isn’t. They simply will not unlock the SIM portion for domestic use;
Now, after the beginning of February, you’d expect that the aforementioned would be out the window, right? Well, it kinda is… but only for devices that have come out AFTER beginning of February of this year. In other words, if you jumped onto that shinny iPhone 6 Plus – 128 GB edition back in September, congratulations! The moment you decide to try and take it to a different carrier, you will be sporting a brand new device to match your iPod 6 Plus – 128 GB edition, as you will be unable to use it outside of Sprint (as they will not unlock it). Same goes for all you Nexus 6, G3, S5 adopters. Needless to say, most of these devices can be unlocked via other means (thankfully) but the point still stands. The carrier still has the upper hand and has far too much power when it comes to letting you unlock it, regardless of whether you have paid off your contract/balance on your device. Oh, and good luck trying to put an outside phone in Sprint’s network.
Each one of the major carriers has a different thing that makes you want to smash your face against the keyboard though. It is truly uncertain what will happen later this year when the provision expires yet again. However, we ask that you write to your Congressmen and let them know that the fight for your cellular freedom is not over and that you as a consumer have a right to do as you please with things that you legally purchased. We still have about 75 years left before the turn of the century. Who knows? We might get it right sometime…

The latest update to the Fire TV Stick packs in an enhanced 1.7GHz quad-core processor, making it 50% more powerful than the previous generation. The device is capable of streaming 1080p video at 60fps with HDR compatibility, and it features a new dual-band, dual-antenna design with support for 5GHz Wi-Fi networks.
Amazon claims that the updated Fire TV hardware will ensure that users have a more stable streaming experience with fewer dropped connections. Furthermore, the updated hardware reduces power consumption by 50% than the previous generation. Along with the hardware updates, the new Fire TV Stick now also features Dolby Atmos support for a more immersive audio experience with compatible content and speakers. The Fire TV Stick comes with an Alexa-enabled Voice Remote with dedicated power, volume, and mute buttons.
The new Fire TV Stick is priced at $39.99 (₹3,999) and it starts shipping in select countries next week. Customers in Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States can pre-order the new Fire TV Stick starting today.
Fire TV Stick Lite
As seen in the previous leak, the new Fire TV Stick Lite is an affordable version of the Fire TV Stick which is also capable of streaming in Full-HD resolution. Much like the new Fire TV Stick, the Fire TV Stick Lite is 50% more powerful than previous-gen Fire TV Sticks and Amazon claims that it’s the most powerful streaming device under $30.
Despite the ‘Lite’ moniker, the Fire TV Stick Lite includes HDR support. It comes with a Lite version of the Alexa-enabled Voice Remote. While the remote features the same design as other Fire TV remotes, it doesn’t include a couple of buttons that you’d find on other versions. However, it still features support for voice commands.
The Fire TV Stick Lite is priced at $29.99 (₹2,999) and it starts shipping in select countries next week. Customers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States can pre-order the Fire TV Stick Lite starting today.
Redesigned User Experience
Along with the new Fire TV Sticks, Amazon has also unveiled a completely redesigned Fire TV interface. With the new interface, Amazon expects to make it easier for users to find what they want to watch on their Fire TV and offer a more personalized experience to discover new content on the platform.
The updated Fire TV interface includes a revamped Home Screen, which has been designed to help users find all their favorite content in one place. At the center of the redesign is the new Main Menu, where users will be able to simply scroll over their apps to get a preview of the content and jump directly into their favorite shows on supported streaming services.
The new Main Menu makes it faster for users to get right to the content they want to watch. The menu also serves as a single destination for all of Fire TV’s popular features like Find, Live TV, Library, and pinned apps.
The Find experience has also been revamped to make it easier for users to browse through popular categories like movies, TV shows, free ad-supported content, and sports. It now includes a couple of filters to help users shortlist content based on the genre. Additionally, users will also be able to use the feature to discover other experiences on their Fire TV, like cooking classes with Food Network Kitchen, daily fitness with Peloton, and more.
In case you share your Fire TV with others, you’d be glad to know that the new UI includes support for personalized streaming profiles. With this new feature, you’ll be able to set up different profiles for each user. The streaming profiles will ensure that your personalized recommendations don’t interfere with those of other users. The feature supports up to 6 personalized profiles, each with their own recommendations, viewing history, watch lists, preferred settings, and more. On top of that, you’ll also be able to set up a Kids Profile with Amazon Kids to ensure that your children can only access family-friendly content.
Alexa on the Fire TV has also been updated with new experiences and improved voice controls. It now supports commands like “Alexa, go to Live TV” and “Alexa, go to News” to help you quickly jump from one category to another. There’s also an optional Alexa Voice Profile feature, which is designed to recognize your voice and automatically switch to your user profile when you say, “Alexa, switch to my profile.”
Additionally, Amazon has also introduced Video Calling with Fire TV, which will allow users to connect a Logitech USB webcam to their Fire TV Cube and call friends and family right from their TV using Alexa. Amazon plans to add support for Zoom, but the company hasn’t revealed a launch date yet.
The new Fire TV experience will be available globally on the next-gen Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite. Amazon plans to roll it out to additional devices early next year.Verizon debuts nationwide sub-6GHz 5G network alongside iPhone 12 launch
Verizon is making a significant change to its 5G network today to coincide with the launch of the Apple iPhone 12. Apple’s latest iPhone is the first in the series to support 5G, providing Verizon with a good opportunity to flip the switch on its nationwide 5G network.
The U.S. carrier has lagged behind the competition in 5G coverage due to them using a millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G network, which is difficult to erect and offers short-range coverage. When it does work, however, it offers blazingly fast speeds. Verizon’s current mmWave network is called “5G Ultra Wideband” and is only available in parts of dozens of cities across the U.S., but the carrier’s new “5G Nationwide” sub-6GHz network is available in 1,800+ cities.
The new 5G Nationwide low-band network won’t offer the same performance as the 5G Ultra Wideband network, though. That’s because it makes use of Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, a technology that allows carriers to shift existing 4G channels to 5G when they aren’t being used by 4G phones. As explained in 5G guide, DSS is basically a stop-gap measure to refarm existing 4G coverage for 5G, but the throughput pales in comparison to true standalone coverage.
Still, rolling out a more widely available 5G network alongside the new iPhone 12 is a great way to get people onboard with the new technology. But it’s going to take a lot of public education before people fully understand the benefits of 5G and where it’s available, especially with so many bands in the mix. While 5G isn’t particularly popular right now, partly due to availability, the launch of the 5G iPhone 12 will surely spur adoption.
The big three carriers in the U.S. have been working hard to roll out their 5G networks, and today there are more 5G devices than ever before. With the launch of the iPhone 12, we may see a larger effort from Verizon to attract people to its growing 5G network, allowing consumers to see what its mmWave 5G network is all about.

Samsung’s expanded Samsung Pay gradually over the past year, and it’s made strategic investments in developing markets. India’s been an outsized focus — Samsung Pay added over a million users in the region within the span of a month, and the Indian subcontinents become one of the payment platform’s top three markets. That’s why Samsung’s testing a new feature in the region, Bill Payment, that’ll roll out in the coming weeks.
Bill Payment lets users pay their cellphone, electricity, DTH, and utility bills using Samsung Pay. Here’s how it works: In the application, you’ll see the categories of bills that the platform supports. Once a company’s been added to the Bill Payments section of Samsung Pay, you’ll be notified when the bill is ready and needs to be paid. You’ll then be able to pay the bill using credit and bank accounts associated with your Samsung account.
The new Samsung Pay Bill Payment feature will also let you save the bank account and IFSC information of friends and family members in UPI, so that you can quickly transfer money to them.
We recently wrote about how India’s digital payment services are unique and how it can benefit companies that offer features tailored to specific needs. Google’s done a lot of work in this field with their Tez mobile application, and Samsung’s made inroads with Samsung Pay. If recent trends are any indication, growth in India’s payments ecosystem won’t slow down anytime soon.
Source: SamMobileGoogle reportedly blocks Android TV makers from also using Amazon Fire TV
Google and Amazon have long been engaged in a cold war for user share. The two internet giants cross each other’s path in several product categories – TV dongles, smart speakers and smart displays, voice assistants and a host of voice-activated products, and even app stores for Android devices. The feud took an ugly turn in 2017 when Amazon and Google started dropping support for each other’s services on their devices. It’s irrelevant who started it first but last year, things seemed to ease out a bit as YouTube returned Amazon Fire TV while the Prime Video apps gained Chromecast support. However, a recent report suggests Google may have restricted TV manufacturers from using the Fire TV operating system if they were already signed up for Android TV.
Google reportedly expects smart TV manufacturers to commit to Android TV and not experiment with other alternatives like Amazon’s Fire TV interface. Protocol reports that among the conditions that a smart TV manufacturer has to agree for an Android TV license, one condition also prevents them from engaging in the making other smart TVs that use forks of open-source Android, including Amazon Fire TV. A major TV manufacturer’s senior employee told Protocol, a company “cannot do Android TV and Fire TV simultaneously.“.
Notably, Android TV is not open-sourced and runs a customized version of the launcher and Play Store along with other Google apps that are optimized for large-screen experiences.
Homescreens of Android TV and Amazon Fire TV
In the Android Compatibility Definition Document (CDD), Google has laid out guidelines for device manufacturers to follow along with the minimum requirements they’re required to meet if they want Play Store and other Google apps to be accessible on the device. While Google allows developers and device manufacturers to customize their versions of Android by making modifications to Android’s source code, these forks must be sanctioned and verified by Google and Amazon Fire TV apparently does not make the cut for obvious reasons. The restrictions are even valid across categories and manufacturers who have agreed to the CDD for mobile devices still cannot make TVs with Fire TV interface.
Google does grant exceptions to equipment manufacturers if the devices operating on different software products are manufactured for different brands. It can also allow some leeway to those brands which sell products with variations in Android according to the region.
Google’s past troubles
Google’s CCD, formerly known as Anti-Fragmentation Agreement, has caused legal trouble for the tech giant in the past. Last year, India’s Competition Commission initiated a probe against Google on allegations that these policies prevent manufacturers from working on devices running on alternatives to Android. Similarly, the European Union had previously fined Google with €4.34 billion (approximated $4.85 billion) on the grounds that Google was “preventing manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android open source code.”
Besides Amazon’s Fire TV, the CCD also blocks other forks of Android. Other than biggies such as Amazon, the agreement also prevents smaller manufacturers from developing their own custom versions of TV interface based on Android, if they have signed up for CCD for any other device. This ultimately prevents any significant competition from sprouting and giving absolute control over the smart TV landscape.
Whether this disclosure about Google’s binding agreement targetting and harming Amazon’s Fire TV will gain the same impetus as similar cases did in the case of Google’s monopoly in smartphone operating systems and search engines is something we’ll learn over time. For now, Google can be seen benefiting from this as it announced signing deals with six out of the top 10 smart TV manufacturers and 140 cable TV operators around the globe.Even the best smartphones on the market have a common enemy--the low battery warning.

We recently opened forums for the Realme 7 series and ZTE Axon 20 5G. As we brace for the next wave of smartphones to hit the market, we are following up with the launch of XDA forums for four new and upcoming smartphones: the Xiaomi POCO X3 NFC, the Sony Xperia 5 II, the LG Wing, and the Motorola Razr 5G.
POCO X3 NFC
Following days of teasing, the POCO X3 NFC was finally unveiled earlier this week as a direct successor to the POCO X2. The POCO X3 NFC offers several hardware improvements over its predecessor, including a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 732G SoC, a switch to a 64MP Sony IMX682 sensor, a bigger 5,000mAh battery, and dual stereo speakers. The phone also packs in a 6.67-inch 120Hz LCD, 6GB RAM, a 33W fast charging support, Bluetooth 5.1, and LiquidCool Technology.
POCO X3 NFC XDA Forums
Sony Xperia 5 II
The Sony Xperia 5 II is an upcoming compact flagship smartphone from the Japanese smartphone maker and will succeed the last year’s Xperia 5. The Xperia 5 II is expected to feature a very similar design language to its predecessor, with the phone offering a tall 21:9 display with top and bottom bezels, a triple camera setup on the back, a side-mounted fingerprint reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Although Sony hasn’t shared any information about the device yet, the Xperia 5 II is rumored to pack in an 120Hz OLED FHD+ display, Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 865 SoC, a 12MP f/1.7 primary camera, and up to 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage. The phone is set to launch officially on September 17th.

LG Wing
The LG Wing could be one of the most unique smartphones of 2020. As already seen in action in previous leaks, the phone will feature a radical dual-screen design with a rotating secondary display. LG recently confirmed the phone will indeed be called Wing and will officially launch on September 14th. In terms of specifications, the phone is expected to pack in a 6.4-inch main display, a 4-inch secondary display, a 64MP primary camera, and a Snapdragon 700-series processor with 5G connectivity.

Motorola Razr 5G
Motorola earlier today announced its second-generation Razr foldable smartphone. Dubbed the Motorola Razr 5G, the latest foldable addresses many of the shortcomings of its predecessor and brings along massive improvements to the camera, SoC, memory, and battery departments. The Razr 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G SoC, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a 2,800mAh battery. The phone will run Android 10 out-of-the-box and features a 48MP rear camera and a 20MP front camera.

Earlier this month, we opened forums for three of Samsung’s latest Galaxy devices — the Galaxy Tab S7, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and the Galaxy Watch 3. Since then, Android OEMs have launched a couple of interesting devices like the Moto G9, Moto G9 Play Realme C12, and Realme C15. Additionally, Taiwanese OEM ASUS is expected to unveil its next-gen ZenFone 7 lineup at an online-only event tomorrow. To promote third-party development and discussions for these devices, we’re now opening forums for the ASUS ZenFone 7, Moto G9, Realme C12, and Realme C15.
ASUS ZenFone 7/7 Pro
While ASUS is yet to announce its ZenFone 7 lineup, we’ve already learned a few key details about the devices. The company’s upcoming flagship ZenFone lineup is expected to feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 SoC and, according to a recent teaser from the company, it will make use of a flip camera module once again. A database listing for the device has also revealed that it will feature a 5,000mAh battery with support for 30W fast charging. In case you’re interested in checking out the ZenFone 7 launch event, you can watch the live stream at 2:00 AM ET on August 26th.

Realme C12
Realme’s new budget-friendly Realme C12 was launched in India just a few days ago. Much like the Moto G9, it features a 6.5-inch HD+ LCD display with a waterdrop style notch. The device is powered by MediaTek’s Helio G35 SoC, coupled with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. For imaging, the device packs in a 13MP primary camera, a 2MP monochrome camera, a 2MP macro camera, and a 5MP selfie shooter. The device packs in a massive 6,000mAh battery with support for 10W fast charging.
Realme C12 XDA Forums
Realme C15
The Realme C15 is the first budget-friendly device from the company to feature a quad-camera setup. Much like the Realme C12, it packs in a 13MP primary camera and a 2MP monochrome sensor. However, instead of a 2MP macro camera, the Realme C15 features a 2MP retro camera and an additional 8MP ultra-wide sensor. Over on the front, the device sports an 8MP selfie shooter. The device packs in the same 6.5-inch HD+ display with a waterdrop style notch, it’s also powered by the MediaTek Helio G35, and it features the same 6,000mAh battery. But the C15 includes support for 18W fast charging, with the 18W fast charger included in the box.

XDA Forums: Samsung Galaxy...The 2017 Amazon Fire HD 10 can now be rooted
We’ve seen a lot of progress when it comes to unlocking the bootloader and rooting various Amazon tablets as of late. In fact, it was back in January when the 2018 Amazon Fire HD 8 was unlocked and rooted. This was followed up with an unlock and root method that was made available for the 5th and 7th gen Amazon Fire 7 tablets. Then, less than a week, later the 2015 Amazon Fire TV was rooted and made public to the Android community. Today, we wanted to highlight a guide that shows you how to root the 2017 Amazon Fire HD 10.
Amazon Fire HD 10 XDA Forum
This complete guide was put together thanks to XDA Senior Member k4y0z who will walk you through how to unlock the tablet, install TWRP, gain root access (and even unbrick) to the device. You will need a Linux installation or live-system as well as a micro-USB cable if you want to accomplish all of this.
Check out this guide in our Amazon Fire HD 10 forumT-Mobile will require VoLTE for all phones starting January 2021, AT&T to follow suit in February 2022 – Here’s what that means for you
The constant evolution of network technology is exciting to follow but only if you have the means to stay up-to-date with new advancements. In our industry, that means buying new smartphones, routers, and plans from carriers. Furthermore, you have to make sure that whatever you purchase is actually compatible with the network you’re paying for. This week has reminded us once again of the importance of network compatibility, as we’re reminded that both AT&T and T-Mobile will eventually shut down their 3G networks. This shouldn’t come as a surprise since both carriers are in the process of rolling out their 5G networks, but it’s important to note because of the complicated nature of VoLTE on Android.
If you’re unfamiliar with VoLTE, it stands for “Voice over LTE” and it’s exactly what it sounds like. Phone calls are routed over a 4G LTE connection instead of 2G or 3G. A few years ago, this was seen as a big deal as the higher bandwidth of 4G LTE means that more data can be transmitted, resulting in reduced compression of voice data and thus better call quality for both parties. VoLTE is pretty standard nowadays, with pretty much all of the major carriers having implemented it and all devices with cellular modems supporting the technology. In fact, T-Mobile’s Q1 2020 earnings report states that “VoLTE comprised 91% of total voice calls” on the network. Many carriers have already shut down their legacy 2G networks because the vast majority of customers have upgraded to devices compatible with newer network technologies, and the carriers are gearing up to shut down their 3G networks, too.
Earlier today, AndroidPolice published a screenshot of an internal T-Mobile notice that reveals that the carrier will require VoLTE for all devices connecting to its 4G LTE and 5G networks. The publication also reported on emails that were sent to customers of AT&T informing them that their phones will eventually become incompatible with the carrier’s network. Here’s what you need to know about the upcoming shutdown of T-Mobile and AT&T’s 3G voice networks.
T-Mobile’s VoLTE Requirement – Coming Soon
Starting August 4th, 2020, T-Mobile will stop activating new devices that do not support VoLTE on its network. T-Mobile says that all devices in its current lineup (meaning, devices sold through them) support VoLTE.
Starting January 2021, any device that does not support VoLTE on T-Mobile will no longer be able to connect to the carrier’s 4G LTE or 5G network. Existing T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile (formerly known as MetroPCS) customers who activate a non-VoLTE-compatible device before August 4th will be informed via a text message that their device will become incompatible with the network starting January 2021.
Although it hasn’t been confirmed yet, it’s possible that some devices purchased via Sprint will be affected by this change. Sprint has always required certification for devices to connect to its network, and that certification has included VoLTE compatibility. However, T-Mobile is in the process of refarming Sprint’s network to expand its own 5G network, so it’s possible that some Sprint devices won’t be VoLTE compatible with the new T-Mobile network. We also don’t know how this change will affect devices from the myriad of other MVNOs that use T-Mobile’s network, including Ting, Consumer Cellular, and Mint Mobile.
T-Mobile issued the following statement to AndroidPolice in regards to this notice:
We’re making great progress building a truly transformative nationwide 5G network. As part of that, we will be phasing out some older technologies over time to free up even more capacity for LTE and 5G. In preparation for that and to give customers the best experience, those activating new lines at T-Mobile will need a VoLTE capable device, which is all we’ve offered for years now and represents the overwhelming majority of devices on the network.
The carrier, however, declined to explicitly confirm the timeline of its 2G and 3G voice network shutdown.
AT&T’s 3G Shutdown – Coming February 2022
Earlier this week, AT&T (poorly) warned many customers that they should upgrade their smartphones soon as their devices will soon become incompatible with the carrier’s network. AT&T sent out emails to customers telling them their device “is not compatible with the new network and [they] need to replace it to continue receiving service.” The part that AT&T failed to explicitly mention to customers is that they won’t be affected by this change until February 2022. The email, as it was worded, clearly suggested that customers take urgent action to upgrade their device, even going as far as outlining steps to “easily” get a new device.
To its credit, AT&T is at least informing customers of its impending 3G network shutdown well ahead of T-Mobile, but they did so incredibly poorly. AT&T provided a statement to AndroidPolice to clarify that this email was the first of many it plans to send to customers to keep them informed of the impending shutdown of the carrier’s 3G network. Here’s the statement the carrier sent to the publication:
This email was one of many planned to keep customers informed about the shutdown of our 3G network in early 2022. It should have included the date that certain devices would no longer be supported. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused and will be more clear in future updates.
So AT&T, like T-Mobile, will require all devices connected to its network to support VoLTE. AT&T calls this “HD Voice,” and like T-Mobile, will block voice and data service for phones that don’t support it. AT&T, unlike T-Mobile, whitelists devices for VoLTE/HD Voice. That whitelist, available here, includes the Essential Phone, all Google Pixel phones since the Pixel 2, the LG G7 and V35, 9 Motorola devices, the OnePlus 7 Pro and 7T Pro, and all Samsung Galaxy flagships since the S8.
What this means for BYOD, unlocked devices, and custom ROMs
If you have purchased a recent smartphone directly from AT&T or T-Mobile, then you very likely have nothing to worry about here. However, if you’re using an unlocked device or a device on a custom ROM, then you’ll want to pay attention to what’s coming. Since AT&T whitelists devices for VoLTE compatibility, you won’t be able to BYOD to the carrier starting February 2022 unless the carrier changes its practices or whitelists a lot more devices. There’s no reason they can’t—VoLTE is a standard protocol, after all—but thus far they haven’t. There’s nothing you, the device maker, or a custom ROM developer/modder can do about it.
While T-Mobile, on the other hand, doesn’t use a whitelist for VoLTE compatibility, many unlocked devices just straight up don’t support it regardless. The recently announced ASUS ROG Phone 3 does not currently support VoLTE on the network, for example. It’s not that these phones can’t support VoLTE on T-Mobile, it’s just that the device maker hasn’t done the work to outright support it. Modders on our ROG Phone II forums have figured out the steps needed to enable VoLTE on T-Mobile, proving that a little more work at the factory could enable support.
Theoretically, as long as your Android device has a working IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) stack, it should support VoLTE on T-Mobile (but not AT&T because of its whitelist system.) Typical Android devices with Qualcomm modems ship with a privileged application that bridges the radio interface layer (RIL) and the IMS, which developers take bundle in their custom ROMs to enable VoLTE support. LineageOS, for example, requires maintainers to support VoLTE if the stock ROM supports it. If the stock ROM doesn’t support it, then it’s unlikely you’ll be able to use the device on AT&T or T-Mobile once they shut down their 3G networks.
One more thing we need to talk about is support for phones purchased overseas. It’s likely that if your phone has the right hardware (which nearly all do) and the right IMS configuration (a bit iffier) to support VoLTE on T-Mobile and AT&T, then you’ll be able to make VoLTE calls on both networks, provided your carrier back home has a roaming agreement.
How to check if your phone supports VoLTE
There’s a pretty easy way to check if your phone supports VoLTE on your current carrier. Simply install the “Network Mode Universal” app from the Google Play Store, turn on mobile data (and turn off Wi-Fi so you don’t accidentally trigger VoWiFi), and make a phone call to another number. If the “Voice Network Type” line shows “LTE,” then your phone call is being routed over LTE. Congrats, your phone supports VoLTE on your carrier! If you see anything other than LTE, like GSM, WCDMA, UMTS, or just 3G, then your phone does not support VoLTE on the network. In this case, talk to the customer support of your carrier for your next options.
Thanks to AndroidPolice for bringing this app to our attention.Fairphone 2 is the first and only Snapdragon 801 phone to get Android Nougat
Android Nougat is not the headline-grabbing OS it used to be. We’ve moved on to Android Oreo and Android Pie, but some devices are still lagging behind. The Fairphone 2 just received Android Nougat, which wouldn’t be exciting, except for the fact it’s the only Snapdragon 801 device to do so.
The Fairphone 2 was released all the way back in 2015 with Android Lollipop. The unique thing about this device is the effort the company took to use as ethically sourced materials as possible. It has a modular design to make it easy to repair, rather than throwing the device away when something breaks. It’s designed to be able to last a long time, which makes software updates very important.
Back in 2016, Qualcomm announced it would not be providing support for the Snapdragon 801 on Android 7.0 Nougat. We wrote an in-depth article about why 801 devices were excluded from the Nougat update if you’re interested. The update process is not as simple as consumers might think.
Fairphone says they have spent around €500,000 to implement this update. They had to do their own development for the unsupported chip. And all that work is for only around 100,000 phones. The good news is this will allow the company to put out updates faster and easier. This shows that Fairphone is truly committed to making their phones last, even if not many have been sold.
Beyond the Snapdragon 801, the Fairphone 2 sports 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, 2,420 mAh battery, and a 5-inch 1080p display. Those specs are certainly not anything to write home about in 2018, but this is a 3-year old phone. Unfortunately, the price has not gone down if you’re interested in an ethical device, and there’s no word on a Fairphone 3. If you’re still trucking along with the Fairphone 2, go enjoy the Nougat update. A lot of work went into it.

The Google Play Store is home to millions of different apps and games, and while all of this variety is great to have, it can make finding the perfect addition to your phone a hassle at times.
Google’s Editor’s Choice section of the Play Store is one of the many tools used to help you find exactly what you’re looking for, and it recently received a complete overhaul to be even more useful.
Along with the updated UI, the new Editor’s Choice section now features editorial pages that help to give better context as to what apps you’re looking at. For example, one page is dedicated to, “5 Essential Apps for an Epic Road Trip”, whereas another is solely for, “Platform Games to Love Even Without a Controller.”
For every app/game featured in Editor’s Choice, there are three reasons given as to why it was chosen. It’s a small addition for sure, but it does help to quickly preview the top features of an app or game to decide if it’s something worth downloading.
The new Editor’s Choice area of the Google Play Store is available now on both Android and the Web.

Last week at Google I/O, Google announced they had plans to expand Android Pay to a number of new countries in the near future. Countries confirmed at this event were Russia, Canada, Brazil, Spain and Taiwan. While they didn’t give exact dates on when they expected this expansion to happen, they did make it seem that the wheels were in motion and that we should expect to hear news about it in the coming months. Then earlier this week we saw that Google officially launched Android Pay in Russia.
A Russia launch is something we had been expecting since there was an announcement in a press release, but we’re also seeing a lot of activity in Canada as well. Over in the /r/Android subreddit, multiple Canadians have talked about seeing Android Pay stickers at various terminals. Visa Canada even published details about Android Pay on their website earlier this month, although it was almost immediately taken down and reverted back to its original content.
Now, it’s being rumored that Android Pay will be launching in Canada at the end of this month. This information comes to us thanks to MobileSyrup, who says they received internal documents that claim the launch date will be May 31st. Apple Pay had a slow build up in Canada with only American Express supporting the platform at launch, but these internal documents seem to say that “major credit and debit cards in Canada” will be supporting Android Pay at launch.
The documents also say that Android Pay will be accepted “anywhere contactless is accepted,” so it may have a better initial launch than Apple Pay did. Just as you would expect, you’ll be able to use Android Pay in Canada with any Android 4.4+ device that supports NFC once the service has been launched.

Remember when Sprint sued AT&T for misleading consumers with the “5G E” branding but later settled the dispute? In a cruel twist of fate, now a bunch of Sprint phones are going to lose their 5G connectivity following the merger with T-Mobile. Meanwhile, AT&T continues to expand its 5G network across the US. As a quick refresher, AT&T originally initiated the rollout last year, and later partially introduced its mmWave network last month. The carrier has now added a whopping 90 new cities under the 5G umbrella.
The list of new cities goes as follows:

According to AT&T, they are covering “… more than 120 million people” with the latest expansion which is based on low-band spectrum. On the other hand, mmWave 5G, which is branded as “5G+” by AT&T, is based on ultra high-band frequencies and can offer much faster speed than low-band 5G. However, the scope of mmWave is extremely limited (you should be in very specific locations to connect properly), thus upgrading existing LTE infrastructure to low-band 5G is indeed an effective measure.

In 2018, both players separately introduced...BraveDNS is an open-source DNS-over-HTTPS client, firewall, and adblocker for Android
Replacing the factory-installed OS with an aftermarket ROM isn’t just limited to the Android ecosystem. People started modding Linux-powered wireless routers and access points long before the rise of Android smartphones in order to enable functionalities such as packet filtering, firewalls, or adblocking that aren’t otherwise present in the stock firmware. Unsurprisingly, such features are much requested in the world of Android as well. While it is possible to configure Private DNS (or DNS-over-HTTPS) and subsequently block ads on an Android device since Android Pie, end-users still need to rely on third-party apps to set up a proper firewall. If you are looking for an all-in-one app that can act as a firewall, adblocker, and even a DNS-over-HTTPS client, BraveDNS might interest you.
The name “BraveDNS” might sound like yet another DNS resolver service, but it is certainly more than that. This free and open-source app describes itself as “an OpenSnitch-inspired firewall and network monitor + a pi-hole-inspired DNS over HTTPS client with blocklists”. The DoH client module, which is mostly based on another popular open-source project named Intra, uses its own ads, trackers, and spyware-blocking DNS endpoint. The developer team also offers their own DNS resolver service as a paid option for those who need features like custom blocklists, allowlists, the ability to store DNS logs for later analysis, etc.
Below you can find a list of features that are currently offered by the app:
- DNS over HTTPS (circumvent censorship and prevent surveillance of DNS logs by ISPs and everyone else).
- View DNS logs.
- BraveDNS ads, trackers, and spyware-blocking DNS endpoint powered by oisd_dbl and Energized Protection
- Firewall by app categories.
- Firewall individual apps.
- Firewall when apps are in the background (not-in-active-use).
- Firewall when device is locked.
The latest version of BraveDNS on Google Play and on the website requires at least Android 8 Oreo, but the developers have plans to make it compatible all the way down to Android Marshmallow in the near future. Moreover, support for dual-mode DNS and firewall execution is promised to be backported to legacy Android versions.
You can download the BraveDNS app on your device from the Play Store link below, or grab the APK from their official site.

As many of our readers are aware, the much lauded Samsung S-Voice application from the Samsung Galaxy S III was ripped two days ago and made available for the world (and most of XDA) to ravenously consume. Many users today, however, are reporting that the application is no longer functioning.
When the app is opened and a command issued, the application comes back with, “Network error. Please try again.” Users across several device forums have confirmed this error as well. At the time of this writing the issue is still occuring on this writer’s Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
One can only wonder if this is intentional on the part of Samsung or if they are simply encountering technical difficulties. If any of you are not experiencing the issue, please sound off in the comments section below.Google Pay adds support for mobile boarding passes and event tickets
Google is further advancing the capabilities of their payment suite known as Google Pay. Earlier this year, Google announced it was merging Android Pay and Google Wallet and changing the branding. Now they are adding support for mobile tickets for travel and entertainment purposes. A huge variety of digital boarding passes and event tickets can be added, in a collaboration between Google and Urban Airship. iPhones have had this ability for some time inside of their wallet application, but it’s great to see Google starting to compete in the same space as well. Initial partners that will be allowing their passes to be added to Google Pay include Singapore Airlines, Southwest, Eventbrite, and FortressGB.
In the future, other companies that integrate with Google Pay, such as Ticketmaster, could potentially allow concert-goers to save their tickets to their phones. This’ll allow you to show a digital ticket instead of a physical one that has to be printed out. Venues could potentially have a mostly-automated entry for events simply by scanning the phones of attendees via NFC rather than physically checking every ticket. It’s all about increased efficiency, and Google is hoping to spearhead it by bringing us digital tickets integrated into their payment service and thus attracting more users to their service.
“Mobile wallet tickets not only offer greater convenience for attendees and lower ticket distribution costs, they offer a path for post-event re-engagement as we can update tickets with other events they may be interested in attending with an easy path to purchase. Google brings scale and ubiquity to this global proposition, which is truly exciting,” said Doug Kruse, CTO and co-founder, TicketNetwork.
Not only that, but these tickets have one major advancement over their physical counterparts: real-time information. Your boarding pass can tell you if your flight is delayed, for example. You could have flight changes or other related information sent as push notifications too, so you’ll always be updated on your arrangements.
Source: Urban AirshipForums for the Moto G8, Realme 6 series, Black Shark 3 series, and OPPO Find X2 Pro are now open
The season of phone launches for 2020 is kicking into high gear. This week alone, we saw phone announcements from Motorola, Realme, Black Shark, and OPPO. As usual, we have opened up forums for all of these devices, which include the Moto G8, Realme 6 series, Black Shark 3 series, and OPPO Find X2 Pro.
First, the Black Shark 3 and 3 Pro were announced on Tuesday. These are the company’s latest entries in the gaming smartphone market. They offer some key improvements over the previous generation, including physical shoulder buttons, a magnetic charger, a 5,000mAh battery, and the Snapdragon 865. Available now in China, a global release is expected in the “near future.”

Next, the Realme 6 and 6 Pro were announced early on Thursday. The Realme 6 series features a 64MP main camera, 90Hz display, and support for 30W fast charging. The Pro model has a slightly larger display and a more powerful processor, but for the most part, they are very similar. Realme has now finally launched the Realme 6 series in India starting next week.

Later on Thursday, the Moto G8 was announced by Motorola. The Moto G8 is an evolution of the Moto G7 with small upgrades in most areas except for the display. Most notably, the processor has been bumped up to the Snapdragon 665 and there is a beefier 4,000mAh battery. The Moto G8 has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The Moto G8 is available now in Brazil and it will come to Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Australia eventually.

Lastly, the OPPO Find X2 and Find X2 Pro were announced earlier today. OPPO’s latest flagships have quite a few flashy features to show off, such as 120Hz displays, SuperVOOC 2.0 for 65W fast charging, Snapdragon 865 SoC, 12GB of RAM, leather and ceramic build materials, and so much more. The phones will go on sale in early May 2020 across Europe.

XDA-Developers has, over the years, grown to be a lot more than just a forum for people to discuss phones. We have grown in terms of content, membership, and staff. This last point is the one I will be touching upon today.
Our staff is a very tightly knit core of approximately 100 moderators and administrators. Much like other groups around the site, our group is quite unique for a wide variety of reasons, but among the most important points, is that we treat each other like family. We laugh together, we work hard together, and we care deeply for one another. It is because of this same reason that today, with a very heavy and sorrowful heart, announce to the community the passing of one of our fellow moderators, TonyStark (aka. Tom). The loss of a loved one is never something easy or simple and this was not the exception.
Tom was a fantastic moderator, an exemplary Recognized Contributor, and overall, an amazing human being. He was always around when needed, and his undying love and devotion for this site was second to none. This was all despite having had major health problems for a long time. He always managed to have a great attitude coupled with a good sense of humor. In these few years, he grew as a paramount part of the moderation team, selflessly offering his time and energy to uphold the values of this site. He made us all laugh and reflect upon our lives in ways we wouldn’t do otherwise. We are all thankful for the time he has spent with us.
Tom, thank you for completing our lives with your ways. We will miss you, my friend. We will all miss you.
For those of you who have met Tom either personally, in the forum, or any other way and would like to say something, KennyG123, has created a public thread to say your goodbyes and to find more information regarding this tragic event.OnePlus has been maintaining a good record with its flagships, the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T.

Even the best smartphones on the market have a common enemy–the low battery warning. Even the best-rated smartphone can run low on juice after extended use, and you may not always be around a wall outlet when it happens. Save the stress and hassle by picking up a charger and we’ve rounded up the best portable chargers for you below.
There are so many portable chargers on the market, though. We’ve found nine quality portable chargers, each with different functionalities to fit your needs. We’ve also identified who should buy each charger, so there’s bound to be a portable charger for you in the list below!
A number of powerbanks offer wireless charging, but the Aukey Basix Pro allows you to wirelessly fast charge your device while having it propped up in landscape mode. This is perfect for charging and watching YouTube in cramped travel areas, and saves you from buying a kickstand case.
With solar charging power, this GoerTek battery pack is perfect to stash in the car or with camping gear for emergencies. If you're worried about your phone and powerbank running dry while exploring the Great Outdoors, a solar battery pack will put your mind at ease.
Bulky, heavy powerbanks can be an absolute chore to carry around. T-Core's battery pack is built to be small and light-weight, making it easy to slip into a purse or laptop bag without adding bulk. It packs in 10,000mAh of battery capacity, so you're pretty covered for a fair few charges.
While this battery pack isn't as strong as other power banks on this list, the low price and compact nature of Anker's PowerCore make it an easy choice for a backup.
AC Outlet For Laptop Charges
Morphie's battery pack really stands out due to its ability to have an AC charged plugged into it, in addition to 22,000 mAh capacity. You can charge your laptop as well as your mobile device!
RAVPower Quick Charging Quality
If you want reliable quick charging, then you can't go wrong with RAVPower. This basic 20,000 mAh battery pack will get the job done, and get it done quickly.
Big Battery for Multiple Charges
iMuto's portable charger is one of few on the market with 30,000 mAh of power, meaning that it can charge more before needing a charge itself. However, this is not an air-travel-friendly charger, so this battery pack is for domestic use only!
Samsung Price, Samsung Quality
Samsung's battery pack is more expensive than the competition, but with the premium name comes a premium and sleek product. You can also bundle it with a phone or other accessories for payment plans to make the price easier to swallow.
RAVPower Charge for Laptop and Smartphone
Another battery pack that has an AC port, RAVPower's AC charger can power your laptop or your mobile devices, and has 20,ooo mAh capacity. It's a bit of an odd shape compared to the Morphie pack, but you can't argue with the RAVPower name!
With so many battery packs on the market, you can be sure these will stand up to the test. My personal recommendation is the Aukey Basix Pro, and it’s my go-to for day-to-day use, especially with my aging phone’s slowly failing battery.
Which battery pack or powerbank do you use? Let us know in the comments!Facebook Messenger is getting an App Lock and new message controls for better privacy
User privacy isn’t one of Facebook’s strong suits, and the company has found itself embroiled in numerous privacy debacles in the recent past. However, Facebook has been taking small steps in the right direction, ever since the company’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined his vision for a privacy-focused messaging and social networking platform last year. The latest in the list of privacy-focused changes comes in the form of a new App Lock feature and additional privacy settings for Facebook Messenger.
As per a recent blog post from the company, the Facebook Messenger app is getting a new App Lock feature, which will allow users to secure their chats using their phone’s biometric authentication. The company released a similar feature for the popular WhatsApp messenger back in October last year, and now it’s finally rolling out to Facebook Messenger on iOS and should reach Android users in the next few months.
The new App Lock feature can be found within the new Privacy settings section on the app, which offers easy access to all privacy settings like Story Audience, Muted Stories, Blocked People, Secret Conversations, and more.
Along with these new features, Facebook is also working to bring additional controls that will let users decide who can reach them on Messenger directly, who goes to the requests folder, and who can’t message them at all. The controls will also include a feature that blurs images in the message requests folder, which will give users the choice to view an image from an unknown person. As of now, Facebook hasn’t revealed when the new privacy controls will be available on the messaging platform.

Samsung Pay is, in my view, the best mobile payment app out there. It supports making payments through MST on Samsung Galaxy flagships and NFC payments on some devices, and you can hook up PayPal or most credit cards for payments. Samsung has also added cashback awards and Samsung Pay Rewards to the app. Now, Samsung is adding a few new features to make its payment service even better. Samsung is introducing the Samsung Pay Cash virtual debit card and Travelex integration for international money transfers.
Samsung Pay Cash looks like a response to Apple Pay Cash since they have a lot in common besides the names. Samsung Pay Cash allows you to request, send, or add money to your wallet. It allows you to add money through any card in Samsung Pay, credit or debit. Debit transfers from your card to Samsung Pay Cash will incur a $0.25 fee. Using credit, you will be charged a 3% fee. You can then use this card to make payments via MST or NFC wherever you can swipe or tap a card. It is accepted anywhere MasterCard is accepted.
The next feature Samsung added to the latest Samsung Pay beta app is international money transfers. Samsung partnered with the Travelex service to allow you to send money around the world and exchange currencies in the process. This feature allows for very easy money transfers without you having to go through sketchy companies or pay exorbitant fees. The feature lets you choose to transfer directly to a bank account, a “premium” transfer service, or start a cash pickup. It supports a bunch of different major currencies in major countries.
This feature is currently rolling out to users in the Samsung Pay beta program in the United States. The APKs are linked below which will give you access to these features. If you install them outside the United States, be warned that Samsung Pay will break. If you aren’t in the US, you’ll need to wait for this to officially roll out to gain access to it.

YouTube TV is one of the youngest names in the television streaming market, and today, the service is gaining support for 10 additional areas.
When YouTube TV first launched in April, it was initially just available for Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Philadelphia. However, thanks to this latest expansion, you can now subscribe to YouTube TV in Dallas-Forth Worth, Washington D.C., Houston, Phoenix, Atlanta, Detroit, Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Charlotte, and Orlando-Daytona Beach-Melbourne.
A subscription starts out at $35/month, and for that price, you can stream from ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, AMC, FX, and plenty of other channels with support for unlimited cloud DVR and access for up to 6 people. Additionally, a YouTube TV subscription also comes with all of the benefits found with YouTube Red – such as no advertisements on regular YouTube videos and access to YouTube Red Original Content.
If you live in one of the areas that YouTube TV is available in, you can get a 1-month free trial of the service to see if it’d be a good fit for you. If you decide to continue with your subscription and pay for it, you’ll also be able to grab a Google Chromecast for free after your first payment (a $35 value).

To coincide with the launch of Apple’s new iPhone 12 lineup, Verizon officially unveiled its 5G Nationwide service, the carrier’s low-band (sub-6GHz) 5G network. Apple’s newest devices support Verizon’s new sub-6GHz network out of the box, but the carrier’s existing 5G devices will need a software update before they can connect to it. Verizon spokesperson George Koroneos has confirmed that a software update has rolled out or is in the process of rolling out to a number of 5G-capable devices from Samsung and LG.
The full list is a venerable “who’s who” of top Android smartphones, from the unique LG Wing to the Galaxy Note 20 5G and Galaxy Note 20 5G Ultra. These devices are some of the most popular (and unique) phones on the market, and it’s great to see Verizon roll out support so quickly.
- LG V60 ThingQ 5G
- LG Velvet 5G
- LG Wing
- Samsung S20 5G
- Samsung S20 Ultra 5G
- Samsung S20 Plus 5G
- Samsung Note 20 5G
- Samsung Note 20 Ultra 5G
- Samsung A71 5G
- Samsung A51 5G
If you own one of these devices and you’re a Verizon subscriber, you’ll need to download the software update that’s pushed to your device to access Verizon’s low-band coverage.
Before Verizon’s 5G Nationwide announcement, the carrier lagged behind the competition in terms of 5G coverage as they relied on high-band (mmWave) frequencies. Millimeter-wave networks are more difficult to build out and offer short-range coverage, which is why Verizon’s is only available in parts of a few dozen cities in the U.S. On the other hand, the carrier’s 5G Nationwide sub-6GHz network is available in more than 1,800 cities across the U.S, though the speeds will be much, much slower than the mmWave network. Don’t be surprised if the speeds you’re getting right now are around the same as or only slightly higher than Verizon’s existing 4G LTE network. That’s because Verizon is using a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing to expand coverage, which means the carrier is essentially refarming its existing 4G infrastructure. Once the carrier rolls out its standalone 5G network and deploys some coverage in the mid-band spectrum they recently purchased, we should see faster speeds.
We wrote up a comprehensive guide to 5G, explaining the technology that’s used and its many applications. You can check out a coverage map of Verizon’s 5G network right here.Samsung Galaxy A51 5G comes to T-Mobile and Verizon starting at $499
The Galaxy A51 was Samsung’s big mid-range hit of 2020. It features an immersive 6.5-inch OLED display with a centered hole-punch camera, quad rear cameras with a 48MP sensor, and a competitive price tag of $399 in the U.S. With the influx of more affordable 5G smartphones, Samsung is adding its own mid-range 5G smartphones to its catalog. Hence, earlier this year, the Samsung Galaxy A51 5G was announced with the same design, display, and cameras, but with added support for 5G connectivity. A few months after its initial announcement, the Galaxy A51 5G will soon become available in the U.S. starting at $499—making it Samsung’s cheapest 5G smartphone.
Samsung Galaxy A51 5G XDA Forum
The Galaxy A51 5G is an important smartphone both for Samsung and for the U.S. market as most 5G devices are expensive flagships. 5G-capable flagship smartphones cost anywhere between $800 to a jaw-dropping $1200, which is partly due to the fact that 5G connectivity is mandatory for all phones powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865. The Galaxy A51 5G, on the other hand, is powered by the cheaper Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G, which features an integrated 5G modem (the Snapdragon X52). It’s pretty much identical to the LTE version of the device in all other aspects.
Now, for availability. The Galaxy A51 5G will become available on Samsung.com and T-Mobile starting August 7th and soon after on Metro by T-Mobile as well. Verizon users can expect the device to become available starting August 13th for $22.92 a month for 24 months on Verizon Device Payment ($549.99 retail). The Galaxy A51 5G UW for Verizon will support the carrier’s mmWave network.
Additional carrier availability will be announced at a later date according to Samsung’s blog post. Samsung says the phone starts at a price of $499.99 which is far from “budget” but still a pretty decent price to pay for a 5G smartphone, all things considered. In comparison, the Samsung’s other mid-range 5G smartphone, the Galaxy A71 5G, has a retail price of $599.99.

Google Assistant’s Driving Mode was first announced at I/O 2019 where we got our first look. It’s meant to replace the Android Auto app for phones, though Google will still offer the phone interface through a separate app that acts as a shortcut to the old UI. We’ve been waiting for this Android Auto replacement since it was teased at I/O 2019, and it looks like we won’t have to wait much longer for it to go live.
However, it looks like the final UI will look a bit different than what we were expecting. In fact, the new car mode UI shown in Google Maps for some users last week more closely matches what’s shown in the screenshots. The new car mode UI is very clean and reminiscent of Android Auto for Android, with itself provides a clean, minimal interface and quick access to features and services.

New Google Assistant Keyboard Dictation
We were also able to enable the new Google Assistant’s integrated keyboard dictation feature, as shown below running on a Pixel 4. In Gboard, you can tap the microphone button to dictate messages and send them (or delete them) all without having to feverishly type it out. You can already do this with the integrated voice input, but once this version of the feature rolls out, you won’t have to download standalone voice models in Gboard. That’ll save some storage space, but the new Google Assistant’s on-device machine learning models should enable voice dictation that’s quicker and more accurate.
Here's a quick demo of the new Google Assistant's integrated keyboard dictation feature on the Google Pixel 4. This feature will probably roll out with the next Pixel Feature Drop, but that's just my guess. pic.twitter.com/NuhPAmiJAy

As you can see in our quick hands on demo, the new feature seamlessly integrates into the keyboard and does a decent job of dictating messages. Of course, we activated it before it’s official launch, so it’s possible that it isn’t running as smoothly as it should be. The last time we saw this feature in action, it was much, much slower, although that’s because it was running on a modded first-gen Pixel device. The keyboard dictation UI was also a bit different, so we’re not sure which of these two interfaces will end up as the final version. We’ll hopefully find out soon, though.
The new Google Assistant is only available on the Pixel 4, Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G, and Pixel 5. Thus, this new keyboard dictation feature will likely be limited to these devices as well.
Connecting to Health Services for Sleep Data
Finally, new strings in Google App version 11.31.9.29 suggest that you’ll be able to connect Google Assistant to health service providers like Fitbit in order to let the Assistant access your sleep data.
<string name="sleep_account_linking_action_button_positive">Connect</string> <string name="sleep_account_linking_legalese">&lt;p> Your Assistant will get access to your &lt;xliff:g id=provider example=Fitbit>%1$s&lt;/xliff:g> sleep data. Google Assistant will use this data to answer your sleep-related questions across your devices that have personal results turned on. &lt;/p>&lt;p> On devices where you have proactive health and fitness results turned on, the Assistant will show this data, suggestions, and related content without you having to ask. This data also helps troubleshoot and improve your health and fitness experience with the Assistant. Once your Assistant successfully fulfills your request to update, show, or answer questions about this data, Google will delete your audio query. The text from your request and other Assistant usage information is used to troubleshoot, develop, and improve Assistant services. &lt;/p>&lt;p> &lt;b>Things to know&lt;/b> &lt;ul> &lt;li>Disconnect your Assistant from &lt;xliff:g id=provider example=Fitbit>%1$s&lt;/xliff:g> in your Assistant settings.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Turn off personal results, or just your proactive health and fitness results, in your Assistant settings.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Review and delete your Assistant activity at myactivity.google.com.&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;/p></string> <string name="sleep_account_linking_legalese_title">Connect %1$s to your Google Assistant?</string>
According to the strings, once connected to a health service, Google Assistant will be able to use your sleep data to answer sleep-related questions. And if you have devices with proactive health and fitness results turned on, Assistant will show this data along with suggestions and related content without you having to ask.

The custom Android flavor has given hundreds of thousands of users a chance to unlock their smartphones' full potential, and in many cases, give it a lease of life way beyond what the manufacturer intended. But, ahead of our big LineageOS-related news tomorrow, if you’ve never...Forums for Realme 7 series and ZTE Axon 20 are now open
There has been a significant uptick in the smartphone launches in the last few weeks, with the likes of Realme, ZTE, Xiaomi, and Samsung bringing their latest offerings to the market. Last month, we opened forums for the ASUS ZenFone 7, Moto G9, Realme C12/15, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Galaxy Tab S7. Today we are launching XDA forums for three new smartphones, namely, the Realme 7, Realme 7 Pro, and ZTE Axon 20 5G.
Realme 7
The Realme 7 is a direct successor to the Realme 6 that was launched six months ago. The phone continues to feature the same 6.5-inch LCD with a 90Hz refresh rate as its predecessor but brings along an upgraded silicone in the form of MediaTek Helio G95, a bigger 5,000 mAh battery, and a switch to a 64MP Sony IMX682 sensor. We also see a bump in RAM, with Realme now offering 6GB of RAM on the base variant and up to 8GB on the top model. Other specs are more or less the same as the Realme 6, including an 8MP wide-angle camera, 2MP depth, and macro cameras, a 16MP selfie camera, a 30W fast charger, and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner.
Realme 7 XDA Forums
Realme 7 Pro
The Realme 7 Pro succeeds the Realme 6 Pro and brings improvements in the areas of display, camera, and charging speed. The phone packs a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G SoC, up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB UFS 2.1 flash storage, a 64MP Sony IMX682 primary sensor, and a 4,500 mAh battery. The biggest highlight of the Realme 7 Pro is the 65W SuperDart charger, which comes inside the box and claims to fully charge the phone in just 34 minutes.
Realme 7 Pro XDA Forums
ZTE Axon 20 5G
The ZTE Axon 20 5G is the first commercial smartphone to bring the under-display camera tech to the market. It flaunts a 6.9.2-inch 90Hz OLED display that also hides the selfie camera and an in-display fingerprint scanner underneath it. On the inside, the phone is powered by the familiar Snapdragon 765G SoC coupled with up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB/256GB of storage. In terms of optics, the phone carries a quad-camera setup on the back comprised of a 64MP primary shooter, an 8MP ultra-wide camera, and two 2MP depth and macro sensors. The phone runs Android 10 out-of-the-box and packs a 4,220 mAh battery with support for a 30W fast charger.
ZTE Axon 20 5G XDA ForumsAndroid version distribution updated for August with no sign of Android Pie
It’s that time of the month when Google updates the Android version distribution chart. It was last updated at the end of July when we found out that 12.1% of Android phones ran on Android 8.0 Oreo. Unfortunately, the updated statistics aren’t that exciting. Since the last update, we now have a new version of Android to track, Android Pie (Android 9), which has not reached enough devices to make a dent in the numbers. Here are the updated percentages:
|Android Version||July 2018||August 2018|
|Android 2.3 Gingerbread||0.2%||0.3%|
|Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich||0.3%||0.3%|
|Android 4.1 Jelly Bean||1.2%||1.2%|
|Android 4.2 Jelly Bean||1.9%||1.8%|
|Android 4.3 Jelly Bean||0.5%||0.5%|
|Android 4.4 KitKat||9.1%||8.6%|
|Android 5.0 Lollipop||4.2%||3.8%|
|Android 5.1 Lollipop||16.2%||15.4%|
|Android 6.0 Marshmallow||23.5%||22.7%|
|Android 7.0 Nougat||21.2%||20.3%|
|Android 7.1 Nougat||9.6%||10.5%|
|Android 8.0 Oreo||10.1%||11.4%|
|Android 8.1 Oreo||2.0%||3.2%|
Since Google doesn’t display any Android version that’s installed on less than 0.1% of devices, it’s no surprise that Android 9 doesn’t show up here since it was released earlier this month. Currently, the new version is only officially available on the Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL, Google Pixel 2, Google Pixel 2 XL, and Essential Phone. There are other devices like the OnePlus 6, Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S, and Nokia 7.1 Plus that have Android Pie betas, but most people are unwilling to install beta software on their devices and hence won’t contribute to Pie’s numbers. There are also users on custom Android 9 Pie ROMs, but they won’t be enough to contribute any meaningful numbers to the overall statistics.
Once popular Android smartphones launching with Android Pie are released such as the Sony Xperia XZ3, Samsung Galaxy S10, and Huawei Mate 20, or existing devices like the Samsung Galaxy S9 series make the jump to Android Pie, we should expect to see a sharp increase in Pie’s numbers. Thanks to Project Treble support, OEMs will take less time bringing up the latest version of Android, so we should expect to see Android 9 releases faster than last year’s Android Oreo releases.
Speaking of Android Oreo, Android 8.0 Oreo saw an increase from 10.1% to 11.4% while Android 8.1 Oreo saw an increase from 2.0% to 3.2%. These are important numbers for developers to keep track of as all apps on the Play Store (both newly released and soon updated ones) will have to target at least Android 8.0 Oreo according to Google’s new rules.

It has been a long time, and the device that refuses to die seems to keep on chugging along. The mythical HTC HD2 has been blessed with yet another opportunity to live a little longer thanks to the efforts of XDA Senior Member macs18max.
For those of you lucky enough to still own one of these beauties, you now have a chance to play around with Android’s latest incarnation of its operating system: Android 6.0 aka Marshmallow.
The port in itself is based on CM13 and just like its predecessors, it is riddled with bugs and non-working features. Among the things that do work out of the box, you can find that your screen, wifi, and audio are working just fine. Everything else… not so much (at least not yet). As far as installation is concerned, you have to have MAGLDR installed to be able to flash this port. Other than that, it is a straight forward flash via NativeSD Recovery. One thing worth noting is that you have to be mindful of the file system used to format your SD card (as you will have to create 2 partitions on it). As per the OP’s instructions:
You can use ext4 or f2fs. But you should make sure that both partitions are of the same format.
Which mean if sdext is ext4 then sd-ext2 also should be ext4. —OR— if sdext is f2fs then sd-ext2 also should be f2fs.
The HTC HD2 is living proof that the site’s cornerstone is still there. Moreover, it also proves that HTC, despite its most recent failures, did make some of the most amazing hardware the mobile world has ever seen, and despite them not admitting to it, they made it to last (unlike all the currently disposable tech that companies are churning out every day).
You can find more information and more specific instructions on how to install it in the original thread.
Do you still own an HD2 or another device that has outlived its reasonable life-span thanks to the efforts of our developers? Please share your stories below![Update 3: June 15 Sale] OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro launched in India, starting at ₹41,999 ($549)
After months of leaks and teasers, OnePlus finally launched the OnePlus 8 series earlier this month. However, unlike previous years, the company didn’t launch the OnePlus 8 series in India and China at the same time as the global launch. While OnePlus launched the devices in China just a day after the global launch, the company has now finally gotten around to launching the OnePlus 8, OnePlus 8 Pro, and OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z in India.

Indian Pricing
India is currently in the middle of a lockdown because of COVID-19, because of which, many OEMs have had to shelve their plans. Nonetheless, the company is going ahead with a price reveal.
The OnePlus 8 series will be available in the following RAM and storage variants at the below-mentioned prices:
- OnePlus 8:6GB + 128GB: ₹41,999 (Amazon.in exclusive) (Glacial Green)8GB + 128GB: ₹44,999 (Onyx Black, Glacial Green)12GB + 256GB: ₹49,999 (Onyx Black, Glacial Green, Interstellar Glow)
- OnePlus 8 Pro:8GB + 128GB: ₹54,999 (Onyx Black, Glacial Green)12GB + 256GB: ₹59,999 (Onyx Black, Glacial Green, Ultramarine Blue)
- OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z: ₹1,999 (Black, Blue, Mint, Oat)
XDA Review: OnePlus 8 || OnePlus 8 Pro
Interestingly, India gets a lower RAM variant and an even lower starting price point ($549). Even the matching variants are priced lower in India. For instance, the starting 8GB + 128GB variant of the OnePlus 8 costs ~$588, which is a good ~$100 cheaper than the US pricing of $699. Similarly, the OnePlus 8 Pro’s 12GB + 256GB variant costs ~$785, which is a far cry from the $999 price tag for the top variant. Even the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z is half the price. Keep in mind that the Indian variant lacks some 5G bands, which is a non-issue for India because the country does not have 5G anyway.
The phones and accessories will be available across all online and offline channels when the sale is made possible in India in line with the government’s COVID-19 advisories.
Here is the complete price chart for major markets:
|Device||USD||UK||EU||India|

Update: OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro availability in India
The OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro will be available on open sale in India on May 29, 2020 across Amazon.in, oneplus.in, and select OnePlus exclusive offline stores and partner outlets. The OnePlus 8 will also be made available in limited quantities in a special early access sale on Amazon.in on May 18, 2020, at 2 pm IST. The phones are currently available for pre-booking on Amazon.in.
Pre-book OnePlus 8 series on Amazon.in and get ₹1,000 cashback
In addition to the pre-booking offer, there are a few launch offers as well. Customers using an SBI Credit Card can get an instant discount of ₹2,000 and ₹3,000 on the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro respectively. No-cost EMI options are also available across all channels on popular bank debit and credit cards. Reliance Jio users will also be getting ₹150 off on 40 prepaid recharges of ₹349, making it a good deal for their continued data usage.
OnePlus is also offering a Limited Edition pop-up bundle, which will include the device along with a Bullets Wireless Z (Black) earphones, a Cyan Bumper case, and a Karbon Bumper Case at an additional ₹1,000 above the retail price of just the device. The pop-up bundle is available on an invite-only basis for Red Cable Club members initially and will be opened up on select channels later on. Red Cable Club members also get a few other discounts, such as on extended warranty, battery replacement, and assured buyback protection.
Update 2: Open sales delayed
The open sales for the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro in India were scheduled for May 29, 2020. Unfortunately, OnePlus has now announced that the open sales for the devices have now been postponed indefinitely.
The announcement post mentions that production was temporarily halted. The reason has not been specified, but external sources suggest it is because of workers testing positive for COVID-19 at the assembling facility. The OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro for the Indian region are assembled in India, which is the reason why they are priced competitively, relatively speaking.
Production for the devices is back up and running, but the delay has altered the sales plan. Consequently, the devices will not go on open sale on the mentioned date. Instead, the OnePlus 8 will be available in very limited quantity on the date. Further information on the open sales schedule will be communicated soon.
Update 3: OnePlus 8 Pro goes on its first sale on June 15, 2020
The OnePlus 8 Pro is finally going on its first sale in India, on June 15, 2020 at 12 noon. However, since the product is expected to have high demand and there have been stocking issues, we presume that the product will sell out quite early owing to its presumed limited quantities.

MWC 2020 may not be happening this week, but we’ve already had a number of product announcements. Huawei and Sony have revealed a few devices so far, and we have forums open for them. You can check out the forums for the Huawei MatePad Pro, Huawei Mate XS, Sony Xperia 1 II, and Sony Xperia 10 II.
Huawei revealed their next foldable phone, the Mate XS. The display is said to be more durable this time around and the hinge has been redesigned as well. It’s also more powerful with the Kirin 990. The other Huawei device is a little less exciting as it’s a 5G version of the MatePad Pro, which launched last year. It has a 10.8-inch display and works with a handy keyboard case and stylus.

Sony, on the other hand, announced two new smartphones: the Xperia 1 II and the Xperia 10 II. The Xperia 1 II is the flagship offering with a 6.5-inch display, Snapdragon 865 SoC, 8GB of RAM, and triple rear cameras. The Xperia 10 II is more on the mid-range side of things with a 6-inch display, Snapdragon 665 SoC, 4GB of RAM, and triple year cameras. Both devices have Sony’s now typical 21:9 aspect ratios.

Google Assistant currently allows users to set their preferred default service for video, music, and radio, and it might soon let you do the same for podcasts.
As spotted by 9to5Google, the search giant has recently added a new option in Google Assistant settings that allows users to change their podcast service from the default Google Podcasts. The caveat, though, is that no other podcast service can currently be selected in this menu. You can, however, change it from Google Podcasts to “No default provider.”
Here’s what the new setting looks like.
It’s not confirmed if Google plans to actually let users pick their own preferred podcast service, such as Pocket Casts, but the fact that Google is providing users with this menu means there’s a good chance that that’s exactly what’s going to happen. As 9to5Google points out, however, the “Photos” provider option in Google Assistant’s settings doesn’t actually let you change the default service from Google Photos, and the “Live TV” section in the Google Home app also only lists a single service—Sling TV.
It’ll be a nice change if it rolls out, because it means that going forward, you’ll be able to call Google Assistant to play the next episode of your favorite podcast without having to specify the name of the podcast service you want to play from. The settings page shows that changing the default podcast provider will apply to voice commands from all compatible Assistant devices, including Google Home devices, Chromebooks, Android smartphones, Android tablets, Android TV, and smart displays. We’ll update this article if third-party services appear in this menu.
Update: Spotify is available as a default podcast provider in Google Assistant
When the news first broke about the existence of a default podcast settings page in Google Assistant, users could not really set any other service as the default. Google has likely flipped the switch, as at least one user is now able to set Spotify for the option.
Thanks, Pratik Goswami for the tip!Download Google’s new “Captured on Pixel” and “Art & Culture” wallpapers
Last week, Google announced the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5, the latest premium Pixel smartphones with Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon 765G SoC. The two phones will only be available in a handful of regions, but they won’t reach the hands of consumers until later this month. With each new Pixel phone launch, Google introduces a new set of wallpapers in the Google Wallpapers app. Immediately following the launch event, I grabbed the new set of wallpapers from the Google Wallpapers app under the “For Fun” section, but we’ve since discovered two more sets of wallpapers that are likely for the Pixel 5. Using a modified version of the Google Wallpapers app, we discovered the “Captured on Pixel” and “Art & Culture” sections with loads of new wallpapers.

Twitter user @forherpieces originally discovered these new wallpapers, and we can confirm that they show up if you modify the Google Wallpapers app to pull wallpapers from Google’s staging server. We can’t confirm if these wallpapers actually appear on the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5, but we do expect they’ll become available for them since these wallpapers only showed up for us when we spoofed the device model. In any case, user @forherpieces was kind enough to extract the wallpapers and upload them for everyone to enjoy.
“Captured on Pixel”, “Art & Culture” Wallpapers
The “Captured on Pixel” wallpaper collection consists of 13 images from different photographers. There are photos from different parts of New York City, London, and Japan. These images were presumably captured on a Pixel phone—likely the Pixel 5.

“For Fun”
Lastly, there are 12 new wallpapers in the existing “For Fun” collection. Like the wallpapers for the Pixel 4a, the new “For Fun” wallpapers are designed specifically with the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5’s hole-punch cutout in mind.
Download the latest “For Fun” Wallpapers
It’s always fun to change your phone’s wallpaper, and Google is one of the best at designing new wallpapers. This time around, though, it looks like they’re spicing up the wallpaper selection with more real-world imagery. We’ll keep an eye out for when the new “Art & Culture” and “Captured on Pixel” collections go live, but you can check for their presence yourself by downloading Google’s Wallpapers app from the Play Store. Keep in mind that Google hides certain wallpapers based on what device you have, so you probably won’t see these new wallpapers unless you have either the Pixel 4a 5G or the Pixel 5.There was a time when the name Pandora was synonymous with the streaming music industry. The company still holds strong brand recognition, but rising competition from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play Music, and others have caught the folks behind Pandora off guard. There has been some effort put into improving the streaming...The Show Must Go On – Custom ROM Available for the LeTV X3 Series (LeEco)
Android TV is a mixed bag, for lack of a better term. Some people like it, while others just flat out hate it. What is more, there is not that much custom ROM development for this particular version of Android, which makes the developer community shy away from it. LeEco, which has been on the headlines for a slew of reasons, most of which are somewhat-negative, has been manufacturing their own Android TVs for the last couple of years, starting with the X3 series and most recently, the X4 series.
Not long ago, we published an article regarding a custom AOSP recovery for the LeEco (formerly LeTV) X3 series, which was developed by XDA Senior Member dipcore. At the time the article was written, not much was achieved other than a functional recovery. However, as it is the case with most devices that get a custom recovery, the doors to rejoicing in the endless opportunities of hacking open up. As for the case of the X3, dipcore decided to not stop at simply having made a recovery, but he also made a custom ROM for the set. The dev has offered various instructions in the thread on how to root and install other goodies (think Playstore), but if you are looking for a simpler solution, then the ROM in question is for you.
The ROM for the X3 is based off of an official release from LeEco and on top of being rather debloated (no more TV Manager!), it comes with familiar options and extras that do not come standard with EUI (LeEco’s UI flavor). For instance,
- Change default launchers and not be restricted to use EUI as default;
- Google Services pre-installed (along with the Google Play Store);
- Root via SuperSU;
- An updated (and somewhat friendlier) UI;
- Access to Android Settings (yes, the stock sw hides it);
- Access to the Engineering Menu (half of it is in Chinese, so unless you understand it, messing with the options in there is likely not the best idea);
There are other goodies under the hood as well and, according to dipcore, another version will be coming soon. The ROM, however, is not without its hiccups. For instance, updating the Play Store (because we all know how much the Google’s services and apps like to stay up to date) will cause, not only for the Store to not work properly (or at all) but it can also cause major system instability. The easiest way around this would be to install everything and anything you may need on the TV before the Play Store tries to update itself (and turn off automatic update). You can also install any other app by downloading the apk and installing it via a file explorer.
As far as installation of the ROM is concerned, you must first make sure that your recovery is properly installed.
How to flash recovery?
– TV is off
– Put LetvUpgrade928.bin from the archive to root folder of a usb drive and insert it to the TV
– Stay in front of the TV and point the remote to the center of the TV and press: SETTINGS, VOL+, VOL-, CH-, CH+, POWER (each button should be hold during 1-2 seconds, so no rush)
– TV will boot up and you’ll get a blue progress bar. After flashing the TV turns itself off.
After that, installing the ROM is just a regular procedural ROM flash. You will need an external memory to do this. Luckily, the TV is furnished with 3 USB ports as well as a SD card port. Simply put the file under the root directory of the memory you choose and flash away. One word of advise would be to ensure that the ROM is compatible with your specific set as LeEco made several variants of the X3.
In order to obtain the ROM file to flash, you need to get in touch with the developer via pm and express your interest to test it. Be sure to include your exact model and current software version in the pm. Do you feel that your TV could do more? Then follow the link below!

The Nokia 5.3, one of the first smartphone announcements delayed because of COVID-19, follows in the same footsteps of other Nokia-branded devices launched after 2016. It offers a relatively pure Android software experience as a result of HMD Global’s commitment to Google’s Android One program. More recently, the Nokia 5.3 was launched in India, where smartphone companies often employ a nasty method to make smartphones more affordable — serving obnoxious ads in system apps. HMD Global’s smartphones, though, offer a unique proposition to users; the Nokia 5.3, for instance, brings a bloatware-free, ad-free Android experience at a price of ₹13,999, alongside a software update promise that extends much longer than smartphones in the same price bracket.
In December 2016, the Nokia brand name reemerged in the smartphone market after over two years of hiatus. This hiatus was a result of Microsoft acquiring Nokia’s phone business — what was once the world’s largest phone-related entity — in 2014, and eventually liquidating it. These events were a result of bad choices by the company’s leadership, perhaps the worst of which was the choice to stick with Windows Mobile as the preferred operating system when the rest of the industry gravitated towards Android. When it came time to revive the Nokia brand for the Finnish startup HMD Global, which was made up of former employees in Nokia’s mobile arm, the decision was clear and univocal. They weren’t going to — yet again — ignore the massive force that Android had become!
HMD Global committed to shipping devices under Google’s Android One program a year after they brought the Nokia smartphone brand back into the market. The key devices that mark their entry into the Android One club include the Nokia 6 (2018) and the Nokia 7 Plus. Since then, the Nokia brand has remained aligned with the pure Android experience as one of the largest brands to be associated with Google and the Android One branding. With guaranteed Android version updates for the next two years and security updates for an additional year on top of that, the Nokia 5.3 guarantees long-lasting software support.
Before going into more detail on why that is important, here’s a look at what the Nokia 5.3 offers in terms of specifications:

How Android One sets the Nokia 5.3 apart
The beauty of Android being an open-source OS lies in the fact that you can experience it in different flavors. There are a variety of custom Android software experiences available in the market, and some of the most commonly known ones include Xiaomi’s MIUI, OnePlus’s OxygenOS, Samsung’s One UI, OPPO’s ColorOS, Huawei’s EMUI, and so on. Each of these custom Android builds add distinct components and features, both visually as well as functionally. But at the same time, a relatively undervalued flavor of Android is what is commonly known as vanilla, or stock Android.
Simply put, stock Android, as users commonly refer to it, is generally considered the barebones version of Android with little to no visual changes from the AOSP (Android Open Source Project) code, along with some basic apps like Gmail, Photos, Maps, YouTube, etc. from Google. Unlike Android builds that are extensively personalized by OEMs, the stock Android user interface remains unchanged from how Google intended it. While the set of pre-installed apps may vary based on the manufacturer, a stock Android UI is nearly visually identical to how Google designs Android for its own Pixel smartphones.
The user interface on smartphones under Google’s Android One program is essentially stock Android with a set of apps, as per Google’s conditions and recommendations. Instead of developing their own user interface based on the open-source version of Android, certain manufacturers collaborate with Google to simply optimize the user experience for the hardware.
These apps may be complemented by some utility applications that fit the bill for a clean software experience. HMD Global’s Nokia 5.3, which is part of the Android One program, also offers the same clean experience that we’ve just been discussing.
Clean software experience without bloatware
In price-sensitive markets such as India, many smartphone manufacturers compete to offer the best hardware specifications at the lowest prices. These brands then recover these costs through software partnerships by pre-installing third-party applications and services on smartphones. The pre-installed third-party apps are — in a way — both advertisements and points-of-sale for any particular app or service.
Pre-installed bloatware on premium Xiaomi and OPPO devices as compared to zero third-party apps or bloatware on Nokia 5.3’s Android One UI
Users in the lower price brackets, especially in developing countries, often lack the technical skill required for deleting these apps and end up being users of these apps. Even though users may enjoy these apps and services, there are underlying concerns citing lack of privacy for user data or the trustworthiness of these apps.
Left-to-right: System apps in MIUI, app install recommendations in MIUI, and suggestive push notification ads in Samsung’s One UI
HMD Global’s commitment to providing a clean software experience means, for the most part, that they’re omitting the pre-installation of any third-party apps. The opinions about this approach may vary — while some users prefer having loads of pre-installed apps on their devices, some like to start with a clean slate. But from the standpoint of data security, a clean user interface reduces the scope of any app jeopardizing user data.
Besides protecting users’ data, Android One devices are also required to get security patches routinely. The promise of periodical security updates ensures that smartphones are guarded against the latest security vulnerabilities.
Two years of Android updates guaranteed
As part of the Android One requirements outlined by Google, a manufacturer must provide a guarantee of at least three years of security updates. At the same time, smartphones certified for Android One must also receive at least two years of Android version updates.
HMD Global has lived up to this expectation and has delivered timely updates to its smartphones across different price segments. Recently, they rolled out the Android 10 updates for Nokia 3.1 and Nokia 5.1. Both of these phones were launched in mid-2018 and shipped with Android 8.1 Oreo pre-installed. That makes Android 10 their second major OS update. Notably, the Nokia 3.1 —the more affordable option out of the two — is among the few entry-level smartphones from 2018 to get a taste of Android 10.
HMD Global recently also announced its timeline for the Android 11 release, and the announcement includes premium devices such as the Nokia 8.1 and the Nokia 9 Pureview, mid-rangers such as the Nokia 7.2 and the Nokia 6.2, and even entry-level devices such as the Nokia 2.2. All of the smartphones hit the market running Android 9 Pie, so that means Android 11 will be their second OS update.
Few smartphone manufacturers reach the same level of support as HMD Global—OnePlus and Google do, for instance, though they maintain far fewer devices. While Google promises three OS updates on Pixel devices, OnePlus has pushed out up to three consecutive updates to its smartphones including the OnePlus 3/3T and the OnePlus 5/5T which have been updated to Android 9 Pie and Android 10, respectively.
It’s worth noting that Google and OnePlus have always targeted the premium (or quasi-premium) segment with their smartphones. HMD Global, on the other hand, has been able to keep devices, especially in the lower and mid-range segments, up-to-date for relatively longer than other manufacturers competing in similar price brackets.
Android One offers a Pixel-lite experience but at a much lower price
The Android One program was originally designed to offer a clean Android experience on low-end devices, especially for markets like Southeast Asia and Africa. It evolved significantly to rope in several manufacturers like Japan’s Sharp, which released the Aquos 507SH with decent mid-range specifications. In 2017, Google partnered with Motorola to announce the Moto X4 Android One Edition powered by Google Fi in the U.S., paving way for brands like Xiaomi and HMD Global to jump on the bandwagon. While the rest of the brands have seemingly pulled the plug on (or neglected) their partnerships, HMD Global is still wholly committed to Android One.
Devices like the Nokia 5.3 enjoy certain benefits apart from Google’s assistance for software that other smartphones may not enjoy. Besides a user interface emulating Google’s Pixel smartphones, Android One devices also benefit when it comes to receiving features from Pixel smartphones before any other device. Google’s Call Screen, a feature that lets Google Assistant talk to callers on your behalf, was rolled out exclusively to select Android One devices last year.
“Pure” may not be the “best” Android experience
While this article has mostly highlighted why the Nokia 5.3’s Android experience is closest to what Google intends for users to experience, we do not — in any way — suggest that that “pure” Android experience is also the “best” one. Android’s open-source nature allows different manufacturers to serve different custom experiences to their users. Most often, these custom user experiences become the selling point for companies, even crucial to their identities. Besides visual enhancements, brands also add their own features or replace Google’s apps with more feature-rich versions in a bid to secure a consumer’s loyalty. In certain use cases, this can go beyond marketing and actually mean that the user gets better features than on stock Android, leading to a quite evident consumer stickiness.
Stock Android, on the other hand, is not exclusive to a brand, and that frees users from the obligation of sticking to a familiar one. They can use smartphones from different brands — like HMD Global, Motorola, Google, ASUS, etc. — without any significant learning curve.
Overall, different flavors of Android offer some unique characteristics to attract and hook users. Stock Android, and more specifically Android One, does that by ensuring a bloat-free interface, some of Google’s Pixel software features before a wider roll-out, and guaranteed delivery of at least two generations of Android versions.
Nokia 5.3: Bound to outlast the competition
The Nokia 5.3 is understandably pricier than other smartphones in India running on similar hardware. The competition at its ₹13,999 price point includes the Redmi Note 9 Pro, POCO M2 Pro, Realme Narzo 20 Pro, the Samsung Galaxy M21, and others. Each phone has a definitive advantage over the Nokia 5.3 when it comes to hardware — the Redmi and POCO phones feature a more powerful processor, the Narzo features faster charging and a 90Hz display, and Galaxy M21 offers a larger 6000mAh battery with an AMOLED display.
Metaphors about sprints and marathons aside, none of these phones offer the software experience and update guarantee that HMD Global offers for the Nokia 5.3, making it an excellent choice for any user seeking longer use of their phone.Android Pay on Wear 2.0 will not work if your Smartphone has an Unlocked Bootloader
For those of you who have been clinging onto hope that Android Pay for Android Wear 2.0 would allow you to make mobile payments even if your device’s bootloader is unlocked, we have some bad news to share.
Google has confirmed to AndroidPolice Android Pay on the latest Wear 2.0 update will not work if the paired smartphone has an unlocked bootloader. While ultimately disappointing, it’s not as if this news is unexpected. Although the Wear 2.0 update introduces the ability to install standalone applications onto your smartwatch, adding cards to the Android Pay application on Wear 2.0 requires you to go through the Android Pay application on your smartphone.
Given that the smartphone Android Pay application already refuses to add cards on devices with unlocked bootloaders, it is no surprise that the application will refuse to do the same for your smartwatch. After all, if Google treats your smartphone with an unlocked bootloader as a potentially compromised device, there’s no way that determination changes simply because you plan on using your smartphone only to add new cards to Android Pay on your watch. If your smartphone is compromised, then any data sent to your smartwatch (such as the card information beamed to your Android Wear watch via Bluetooth) could also become compromised.
Of course, this is all just speculation on Google’s thought process behind why they are barring Android Pay from being used on your smartwatch even if the smartwatch itself has a locked bootloader. It is unclear if this situation will ever change in the future or if there might be a workaround. For now your only option if you want to use Android Pay on your smartwatch is to re-lock the bootloader on your smartphone, but that may trigger a factory reset on certain devices and means you won’t be able to enjoy any of the awesome mods that are posted on our forums.

You can pre-order now and it will be released on August 20th
After months of delays due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Google’s new Pixel 4a smartphone is finally on sale. The mid-range Android phone packs a similar feature set to the Pixel 4 including its excellent camera and clean Android experience, but at a significantly lower price. While the Pixel 4 starts at $799, the Pixel 4a retails for less than half that at $349 in the US.
You can order the Google Pixel 4a right now from a few different retailers including Amazon, Google’s own store, and Best Buy. You don’t have a lot of choice around size, storage, or color as there’s only one option available: the Just Black model that comes equipped with 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM. Nonetheless, Amazon lets you bundle a case with your new phone to give you a little choice between options.
Unlike previous devices – including the Pixel 3a series last year – there’s no XL model. However, Google has announced the Pixel 4a 5G, which will launch later this year and will likely come with a display larger than the 5.81-inch OLED panel on the Pixel 4a. There’s also a more-than-capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor, the excellent 12.2MP dual-pixel rear camera from the Pixel 4, and a 3,140mAh battery. Given the battery problems that plagued the regular Pixel 4, the larger battery in the Pixel 4a should result in all-day battery life.
Despite a few compromises compared to its more expensive siblings, the Pixel 4a is easily one of the best Pixel devices ever made and the best value-for-money smartphone you can buy right now.
Pixel 4a price and release date in the US
Google’s new smartphone is launching in the US on August 20th, with the phone only sold for $349, and a phone bundled with a case retailing for $389. Although it was just announced, there are already offers available that can reduce the price to only $249.
Best Pixel 4a Carrier deals in the US
If you don’t mind having your Pixel 4a on a contract, you might want to consider looking at Verizon’s offers. You can buy the phone outright from Verizon’s store for $380, which is a bit above other retailer prices. But, if you’re starting a new line and choose to do monthly payments, you’ll pay $10 a month for 24 months. Now that’s a deal.
Pixel 4a price and release date in the UK
While you can get the Pixel 4a from August 20th in the US, you’ll have to wait until October 1st to get your hands on it in the UK. It will be priced at £349, including 20% VAT, and pre-orders will open on September 10th, although you can join the official waitlist right now.

Qualcomm is expanding its lineup for 2020-2021, bringing in newer SoCs that you can expect to see in your next smartphone. Back in May, Qualcomm launched the new Snapdragon 768G, bringing in improvements over the Snapdragon 765G. And earlier this month, the company launched the new Snapdragon 732G, which brings improvements over the Snapdragon 730G. Today, Qualcomm is announcing the new Snapdragon 750G as an interesting addition alongside these two new SoCs, providing OEMs and consumers with more options in the premium mid-end segment.
Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7-series mobile platforms have become a very popular choice in the market, with more than 275 designs announced or in development across this series. Of these, a good 140 designs incorporate 5G, and the continued focus forward on this makes sense for OEMs and network partners alike. What the Snapdragon 750G does is carry along the Snapdragon X52 5G Modem-RF system from the 765G, allowing wider consumer reach for a solution that offers support for mmWave and sub-6GHz frequencies, SA and NSA networks, TDD, FDD, and Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS), global roaming and global multi-SIM.
The 8nm Snapdragon 750G (SM7225) features a 64-bit Octa-core Kryo 570 setup with the two performance cores clocked at a max clock speed of 2.2GHz and the 6 efficiency cores clocked at a max speed of 1.8GHz. By nature of Qualcomm’s Kryo nomenclature, this is a big step up from the Kryo 470 cores on the Snapdragon 732G and the Kryo 475 cores on the Snapdragon 768G, and just a step down from the Snapdragon 865’s Kryo 585 cores. The 2 performance cores are indeed ARM Cortex-A77 based and not the ARM Cortex-A76 based like the ones found in the Kryo 4-series, though the 6 efficiency cores are still ARM Cortex-A55 based. While the CPU clock speeds of the performance cores are not as high as they are in the flagship Snapdragon 865 and Snapdragon 865 Plus, you should expect to get better CPU performance than you would from the Snapdragon 732G and even the higher-numbered Snapdragon 768G.
As far as specific performance improvements, Qualcomm claims that the Snapdragon 750G can deliver up to 20% improvement over the Snapdragon 730G. To better put this into context, the Snapdragon 765 barely offered CPU improvements over the Snapdragon 730; the “G” variants usually feature a higher clocked “Prime” core and GPU; and the 2020 SoC upgrades simply went up to bump the clock speeds on the Prime core and GPU further. So a 20% improvement over the Snapdragon 730G is actually exciting news, one that could possibly place the Snapdragon 750G as the SoC with a better CPU than the Snapdragon 768G.
The Adreno 619 GPU is claimed to enable up to 10% better graphics rendering compared to the Snapdragon 730G. In comparison, the Adreno 620 GPU on the Snapdragon 765G claimed to offer up to 20% better performance and efficiency compared to the Snapdragon 730G. We can thus conclude that the Snapdragon 750G is placed between the Snapdragon 732G and Snapdragon 768G in terms of performance.
The Snapdragon 750G also features select Snapdragon Elite Gaming features, including Qualcomm’s Game Color Plus, Adreno Updateable GPU Drivers, and Adreno HDR Fast Blend. The 5th generation Qualcomm AI Engine, meanwhile, distributes AI workloads across the compute blocks and claims to offer up to 4 Trillion Operations per Second (TOPS) for up to 20% improvement over the Snapdragon 730G.
Qualcomm is also boasting the inclusion of its always-on Sensing Hub in the SoC, which features a low-power AI Engine that “enables AI-based echo cancellation and background noise suppression to provide improved voice-chat gaming experiences, uninterrupted voice communication, and support for always-on voice assistants.” This is part of a growing trend of AI-based noise cancellation features, with NVIDIA offering RTX Voice for its GPUs and Krisp offering its software solution to apps like Discord. Qualcomm’s AI-based noise suppression solution will be hardware accelerated on devices with the Snapdragon 750G, enabling faster processing and thus lower latency.
The Snapdragon 750G, supports Bluetooth 5.1 and is “Wi-Fi 6-ready” if paired with Qualcomm’s FastConnect 6200 mobile connectivity subsystem. The new Spectra 355L Image Signal Processor lacks hardware acceleration for computer vision tasks and can process slow-motion video only up to [email protected], but you get up to 32+16 MP dual camera processing with Zero Shutter Lag.

The Snapdragon 750G is pin- and software-compatible with the Snapdragon 690. Commercial devices based on the Snapdragon 750G are expected to be commercially available by the end of 2020. Xiaomi is announcing that it will be the first OEM to deliver a smartphone with this new SoC, which is teased to be a new member of the Mi 10 series costing under €300.Huawei’s Celia voice assistant is now available on EMUI 10.1 on the Huawei P40
Huawei is trying hard to decouple Google services from their custom Android skin, EMUI, due to the trade ban imposed on the company by the US government. Replacing the Google Play Store with the Huawei AppGallery and shipping Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) instead of Google Mobile Services are some of the notable steps in that direction. The OEM has also created a dedicated voice assistant named Celia as an alternative to the Google Assistant. Celia was originally announced during the online launch event of the Huawei P40 series, but the initial firmware packages didn’t feature the voice assistant.
Around a week ago, the Huawei P40 series received the EMUI 10.1.0.121 update, which introduced a surprising “Huawei Assistant” top-level setting with references to Celia. That was probably a preparatory step, as Celia is now fully accessible on the Huawei P40, Huawei P40 Pro, and the Huawei P40 Pro+ running the latest version of EMUI 10.1. At this moment, the availability is region-restricted, though, as you need to set the locale to the UK, France, Spain, Chile, Mexico, or Columbia beforehand to get this feature unlocked. Celia currently supports three languages: English (UK), French, and Spanish.
For those not familiar with Celia, the voice assistant can be summoned with the hotword “Hey Celia”. You can hold the power button for a second to activate it as well. Celia should be able to seamlessly integrate itself with the stock EMUI apps and allows users to toggle device settings and flashlight as well as start voice recording, translate sentences, play multimedia contents, and more.
Celia is also compatible with HiVision AI Lens and AI touch-shopping. Apart from the flagship P40 lineup, the voice assistant should be available on more Huawei and Honor branded devices with the upcoming EMUI 10.1 update. To learn more about Celia and its features, take a look at the official product page.

Check out Crypto Trakr on the XDA ForumsXiaomi to bring its Google Assistant-powered Mi Smart Speaker to Europe
Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi is bringing its Mi Smart Speaker to Europe shortly after its launch in India last month, according to WinFuture. The Google Assistant-powered smart speaker follows the usual Xiaomi ethos of offering a premium experience at a more pocket-friendly price point.
Offering a dual-band WiFi connection, a 2.5-inch, 12-watt front-firing speaker backed up by a Texas Instruments audio processor, the Mi Smart Speaker boasts an AmLogic A113 SoC powered by a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processors and two long-range microphones for voice control from across the room. Two Mi Smart Speakers can even be paired to form a stereo array.
Measuring around 15cm high and weighing in at 850g, the white casing with a black speaker grill, in classic Xiaomi styling, also includes full media control touch buttons and an LED strip-light which, we’re told will eventually be capable of projecting in 16m colours, after a future firmware update which will also activate DTS audio tuning.
Currently only available in China and India, the device has had warm reviews since launch, suggesting that it offers more bang-for-your-buck than most third-party Google Assistant smart speakers and even gives the Google Nest Mini a run for its money too — not the best sound, but an impressive (some would say too powerful!) bass and fidelity at this price point.
As you’d expect with a Google Assistant smart speaker, the Mi Smart Speaker doubles as a Chromecast receiver and can control all your Google Home linked devices.
In India, the Mi Smart Speaker will set you back ₹3,499, so we’d expect it to be around 50-55 Euros or £55-60. WinFuture claims the price of the device at a Spanish retailer is set at €52.99, while its price at a Portuguese retailer is set at €59.95. Spend more and you’ll get more, but if you’re looking at an entry-level smart speaker, this may well surpass your expectations in a way that a Google Nest Mini or Amazon Echo Dot just won’t.
The Xiaomi Mi Smart Speaker should be available from Mi.com, when it becomes available in your region.Alexa Can Now Control Hulu, NBC, and More on the Fire TV
When it comes to the highly competitive voice assistant market, Amazon isn’t playing around. It recently rolled out an update that lets developers notify Alexa users with audible pings and flashing LEDs, brought Alexa to smartphones such as the Huawei Mate 9, and and introduced Google Home-like personalised voice recognition to its Echo speakers. Needless to say, the retailer’s taking its market dominance very seriously, and Amazon’s newest project — support for new voice commands on Fire TV devices — dovetails with the company’s other efforts.
Amazon brought Alexa to its set-top Fire TV devices in July, and the integration works pretty much like you’d expect — you can use an Alexa-powered speaker, smartphone, Fire TV remote, or tablet to control video playback, search for videos, and launch any app on the Fire TV. Now, starting this week, Fire TV applications from Bravo, CBS, Hulu, NBC, Showtime, and Sony PlayStation Vue gained support for Alexa voice commands.
Here’s how it works: When you’re in the Hulu app or any of the other updated applications, you can say, “Alexa, go to ESPN”, for example, and the Hulu channel for ESPN will start playing. You can pause, play, rewind, or fast-forward the video with subsequent voice commands, or ask to start an episode over, skip it, or go back to the previous episode.
All you need to take advantage is an Alexa-enabled device, of course. (Amazon’s Echo Dot, which retails for about $50, isn’t a bad choice.) If you’ve got that part covered, simply updating your Fire TV’s applications to their latest respective versions should be enough to get the feature working — they’re compatible with the Amazon Fire TV (1st, 2nd, and 3rd Generation), Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, Fire TV Stick with Voice Remote, and the Fire TV Stick (1st and 2nd Generation).
Give it a try, and check out the blog post from the Amazon Fire TV for more information.

Hundreds of phones, hardware advancements, new software features, and even new form factors made headlines this year. So what was the best of the best? Some of the XDA Staff have put...Dish Network is taking over Sprint’s prepaid business, Boost Mobile, and Virgin Mobile on July 1st
The Sprint/T-Mobile merger finally went through in April and we’ve been slowly seeing the effects of it. While T-Mobile’s big 5G plans will take some time to develop, we’ve already seen the carrier expand its 5G network with its newly acquired spectrum from Sprint. One part of the puzzle that allowed the merger to happen in the first place was Dish Network agreeing to buy Sprint’s prepaid business, including Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile.
Back in July of 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice approved the merger after Dish Network agreed to acquire Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, and Sprint’s prepaid business. Amazon was initially reportedly interested in scooping up these 3 sets of customers, but ultimately Dish stepped up to the plate. We now know that the deal with Dish will finally happen in two weeks, on July 1st, according to SEC filings.
We don’t have all the exact details, but it was previously reported that Dish Network agreed to spend $1.4 billion for Sprint’s prepaid business. According to Fox Business‘s Charles Gasparino, the Department of Justice forced Dish to complete the deal after it was reportedly trying to negotiate better terms.
According to details from the deal last summer, Sprint and T-Mobile will be required to provide at least 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations to Dish Network. T-Mobile is also required to give Dish “robust” access to its network for 7 years while Dish builds out its own 5G network. This aid is due to the DOJ wanting to maintain four major carriers in the U.S., with Dish stepping into that fourth role.
Will Dish actually be able to fill the hole left by Sprint? Only time will tell, but it won’t happen overnight if it does.

Fresh off of the announcement of Android Wear being rebranded to Wear OS, another Google service that was recently rebranded is in the news. In January, Android Pay was rebranded as Google Pay. Similar to Android Wear, the service is for more than just Android devices, so the name change made sense. Now the two newly rebranded services are teaming up in more countries.
Google Pay is now available on Wear OS devices in Canada, Spain, and Australia. It was previously only available in the United States and United Kingdom. There were ways to get it working in other counties, but nothing was officially supported. Now people in those countries can officially use their watch to pay for everyday items and transit tickets using Opal in Australia.
Of course, in order to use Google Pay you’ll need an NFC-equipped smartwatch. Users in Canada and Australia can refer a friend to Google Pay and receive a $10 credit for every friend (up to 10) until May 14th. The friend gets $10 too. Google Pay is already a very convenient way to pay for things with your phone. It gets even easier to use when you don’t have to pull your phone out of your pocket.

Samsung’s second-generation foldable phone is now finally available to buy and as we said in our Galaxy Z Fold 2 review, it’s probably our phone of the year!
The Galaxy Z Fold 2 brings several improvements including a new hinge that can be stopped at any angle, a wider front screen, a pinhole camera instead of that awful notch, and far more. There are also optimizations thanks to close partnerships with Google, where Duo and YouTube display controls on half the screen and video on the other half, and Microsoft, where you can work on a Powerpoint and Excel sheet side-by-side from within the Office app.
The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is $1,999 in the US. Although fairly expensive, it’s only priced at $20 more than the price of the original Galaxy Fold, despite the vast range of improvements it brings.

Today,...Google Maps Will Soon Allow You to Share Your ETA, Add a Shortcut to Routine Destinations, and Create a Map of Your Location History
Although many of Google’s first-party applications were given a nice update over the course of Google I/O, Google Maps was not one of them. There was a minor update that shipped with the new Android N developer preview which allowed you to see your contacts on Maps and to share your contributions, but apart from that nothing really major was brought to the table.
New evidence found in the latest Google Maps update pushed out yesterday to the Play Store, version 9.26.1, indicates that Google is about to unveil a whole host of new and exciting quality of life and accessibility features. Among the most prominent features we discovered was the ability to share your ETA with other people, create a shortcut to start navigating towards your most common destinations, and the ability to create a private map of your location history.
Disclaimer: The evidence we dig up from the APK file of an app is not definitive. Google may choose to pull these features without any indication in a future release.
Sharing your ETA
We’ve all been there. You’re on your way to a gathering with your friends and family but thanks to some unforeseen traffic incident, you’re stuck in a grid-lock of unmoving vehicles. You’re anxiously sitting behind the wheel and (hopefully not, but probably are) texting updates to your contacts about how long it’ll take you to get there. We all know the statistics – texting while driving is a major contributing factor to motor vehicular accidents on the road. But you really have to let your friends and family know where you are and when you’re going to be there. That’s why Google seems to be adding a button that will allow you to quickly share your ETA with a quick blurb about the current traffic en route. You can also opt to automatically send updates about the progress of your trip in case your loved one is the kind who anxiously texts you multiple times asking you how much longer it’ll take.
<string name="SHARE_ETA_BUTTON">Share ETA</string>
<string name="SHARE_ETA_MESSAGE_HEAVY_TRAFFIC_FORMAT">On my way to %1$s. Heavy traffic. Should be there at %2$s.</string>
<string name="SHARE_ETA_MESSAGE_LIGHT_TRAFFIC_FORMAT">On my way to %1$s. Light traffic. Should be there at %2$s.</string>
<string name="SHARE_ETA_MESSAGE_NORMAL_TRAFFIC_FORMAT">On my way to %1$s. Usual traffic. Should be there at %2$s.</string>
<string name="SHARE_ETA_MESSAGE_NO_TRAFFIC_FORMAT">On my way to %1$s. Should be there at %2$s.</string>
<string name="SHARE_ETA_PROMO_DISMISS_TEXT">Understood</string>
<string name="SHARE_ETA_PROMO_TEXT">"Tap to tell people you've left &amp; send updates about your progress"</string>
<string name="SHARE_ETA_PROMO_TITLE">Share your journey</string>
<string name="SHARE_SUBTITLE">Shared</string>
Common Destination Shortcut
If you use Google Maps to travel to a certain place fairly frequently, then you might feel annoyed with having to enter the destination into the navigation menu every time you want to go there. Why not create a home screen shortcut to that destination? (Seriously, why don’t you?) Many people probably didn’t realize they could even do such a thing, so Google will now be advertising the feature to users who travel a certain route fairly often.
<string name="CREATE_DIRECTIONS_SHORTCUT_DISMISS_TOAST">Add it later from the overflow menu.</string>
<string name="CREATE_DIRECTIONS_SHORTCUT_MENU_ITEM">Add route to Home screen</string>
<string name="CREATE_DIRECTIONS_SHORTCUT_NUDGEBAR_DESCRIPTION">Tap here to add a Home screen shortcut to this route</string>
<string name="CREATE_DIRECTIONS_SHORTCUT_NUDGEBAR_TITLE">Go here often? Add this route</string>
<string name="CREATE_DIRECTIONS_SHORTCUT_POPUP_ACCEPT">Add shortcut</string>
<string name="CREATE_DIRECTIONS_SHORTCUT_POPUP_DISMISS">No, thank you</string>
<string name="CREATE_DIRECTIONS_SHORTCUT_POPUP_TITLE">Next time, get directions to this place faster by adding a shortcut to the device’s Home screen</string>
<string name="CREATE_DIRECTIONS_SHORTCUT_TOAST">A shortcut to this route was added to the device’s Home screen</string>
Map of your Location History
People who use the desktop version of Google Maps might know about Google’s Location History page which overlays your locations in the past few months onto a map. Now, this feature seems to be headed to Android as well. Previously, users could only cycle through a timeline of their location on a day-by-day basis within the Google Maps app.
<string name="MULTI_ILLUSTRATION_LOCATION_HISTORY_PROMO_TEXT">Creates a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. %s</string>
<string name="MULTI_ILLUSTRATION_PROMO_TITLE">Get more magic out of Google Maps</string>
Accessibility Enhancements
As with any other Google app update, there are some more minor enhancements hidden away to improve the ease of use for more special use cases. Given how many people use Google’s services, though, these features will definitely be welcome by many, many people even if they don’t affect the rest of us.
First up, for wheelchair-bound users of Google Maps, the app will now tell you which places are wheelchair accessible so you can quickly tell if the place can accommodate you.
<string name="ACCESSIBILITY_WHEELCHAIR_ACCESSIBLE">Wheelchair accessible</string>
Next up, if you use Google Maps frequently for finding directions for modes of travel outside of driving, then a new feature will prompt you when you can’t travel to your destination by your selected method. For instance, if there is no public transportation route available to your destination, Google Maps will flash a toast message telling you that you can’t get there by public transport. A small, but nifty message so you can quickly refine your trip.
<string name="DESTINATION_REFINEMENT_NON_NAVIGABLE_BICYCLE_TOAST_TEXT">"Can't get there by cycling, using original destination."</string>
<string name="DESTINATION_REFINEMENT_NON_NAVIGABLE_TAXI_TOAST_TEXT">"Can't get there by taxi, using original destination."</string>
<string name="DESTINATION_REFINEMENT_NON_NAVIGABLE_TRANSIT_TOAST_TEXT">"Can't get there by public transport, using original destination."</string>
<string name="DESTINATION_REFINEMENT_NON_NAVIGABLE_WALK_TOAST_TEXT">"Can't get there by walking, using original destination."</string>
Finally, if you’re traveling to a remote area where you’re likely to lose a data connection, then you should probably download an offline direction list to the destination just in case you accidentally exit navigation and need to start over. In case you forget to do so, Google Maps will now automatically ask you to download offline directions to the area if it detects that the area will have spotty data connection somewhere along the route.
<string name="DIRECTIONS_OFFLINE_PROMO_AREA">Tap to download offline directions for this area</string>
<string name="DIRECTIONS_OFFLINE_PROMO_ROUTE">Tap to download offline directions for spotty connections on your route</string>
Miscellaneous Updates
In our previous teardown of the Google App, we discovered an upcoming feature that will show popular searches in your area. Well it seems that Google is bringing this feature to other apps in its catalogue, as now the Google Maps app will now display new and popular places in your surrounding area. This could be useful for people who have lived for a long time in an area but are looking to try something new and exciting, or people who are visiting a location and want to see what’s interesting in that area.
<string name="ROVER_NOTIFICATIONS_OPT_IN_ACTIONABLE_TOAST">New &amp; popular places notifications turned on.</string>
<string name="ROVER_NOTIFICATIONS_OPT_IN_TOAST">New &amp; popular places notifications turned on. To turn off, visit your notifications settings.</string>
<string name="ROVER_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_SUMMARY">Get updates about new and popular places near you</string>
<string name="ROVER_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_TITLE">New and popular places</string>
Finally, for people who love to track how your driving (especially those who need to do so for tax purposes), then you’ll love the new Maps feature that will track how many miles you drive and even congratulate you on a new milestone of miles driven. Hooray!
<string name="SWIPE_MILESTONE_SHARE_TITLE">Share milestone to...</string>
<string name="SWIPE_ODOMETER_CONGRATULATIONS">Congratulations</string>
That’s all we found in the latest Google Maps update. Stay tuned to future posts in our series when we investigate what’s new and what’s coming in Google’s Apps.Samsung certification confirms a 5G Galaxy Z Flip is coming
After months of leaks and rumors, Samsung officially unveiled the Galaxy Z Flip at the Galaxy Unpacked event earlier this year in February. Unlike Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S20 lineup, the Galaxy Z Flip featured last year’s Snapdragon 855+ chip and it didn’t include 5G support. However, over the last few weeks, there have been rumors that the company is working on a 5G version of the foldable device. The rumors are mostly based on the fact that the company has started software development for a Galaxy smartphone with the model name “SM-F707B”.
Since the original Galaxy Z Flip goes by the model number “SM-F700”, it was believed that the “SM-F707B” is a successor to the Z Flip, as “SM-F” has been reserved for Samsung’s foldable devices so far. For instance, the Galaxy Fold has the model number SM-F900. On top of that, the “B” in “SM-F707B” is believed to signify that this Galaxy Z Flip successor will support 5G connectivity. The reasoning commonly given for this assumption is that Samsung has previously appended “B” to the model names of devices with 5G support, such as in the case of the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G (SM-G977B) and the Samsung Galaxy A90 5G (SM-A908B). However, the existence of SM-707B firmware isn’t confirmation that there’s a 5G Galaxy Z Flip and the “B” at the end isn’t always used for 5G Galaxy smartphones.
Now, though, we have pretty definitive evidence that there is indeed a 5G variant of the Galaxy Z Flip in the pipeline, which goes by the model number SM-F707B. We’ve spotted a certification filing online, submitted by Samsung themselves, which ties the marketing name and model number together. As you can see in the attached screenshot, the certification filing mentions the commercial name Galaxy Z Flip 5G and the product name SM-F707B. It’s worth noting that the filing was spotted on the same certification source that has previously helped us confirm that the OPPO Find X2 Neo is the same device as the Chinese Reno3 Pro and that the Galaxy A71s 5G would feature support for Verizon’s mmWave network. Therefore, we have no doubts regarding its credibility.Google+ prepares to add Link Previews in Comments and the ability to show Low Quality Comments
Besides our very own forums, Google+ has long been a great place for Android users to congregate in communities around their favorite ROMs or apps. Many of our readers likely only use the website because for the longest time it was required to sign up for application beta testing.
For some time, you were even required to use an account there just to comment on YouTube (though last year Google reversed that change after much backlash). Google hasn’t yet given up on its social media website yet, and since the website is supposed to be used for far more than just users of Google products, it appears that Google may soon roll out additional features including the ability to view link previews in comments as well as the ability to show/hide low quality comments in order to improve everyone’s user experience while using the app. We’re seeing evidence for these features in the latest Google+ update version 8.2, by the way.

Currently, Google+ doesn’t provide many formatting options for commenting on a post. In fact, the few formatting options that are available aren’t really publicized at all. Even on the desktop version of the website the comment box is pretty much void of any options.
It appears that Google will finally be bringing at least one new feature to the comment box; a feature that has already existed for quite some time whenever you create a new post: the ability to add a properly formatted link with a link preview.
<string name="create_comment_add_link_button">ADD</string>
<string name="create_comment_add_link_hint">www.example.com</string>
<string name="create_comment_add_link_title">Add a link</string>
<string name="create_comment_invalid_link">"The URL provided isn't valid"</string>
<string name="create_comment_preview_error">No preview available, but you can share a comment instead.</string>
As someone who frequents several Google+ groups for Tasker creations, it’s about time. Google+ comments can become a mess if you share a lot of different links.
Low Quality Comment Toggle
Finally, if you’re a masochist Google+ will soon allow you to unhide comments that have been removed by its spam filter. Currently, users are able to choose between 5 different reasons when they report a comment. If enough people report a comment and Google+ decides the comment violates its content rules, then the comment will be hidden from the public feed of comments. Unfortunately, such a system can be abused so Google+ will soon allow us to toggle between showing/hiding comments that it has deemed to be “low quality.”
<string name="menu_show_low_quality_comments">Show low quality comments</string>
We know that this menu option will appear under the dropdown menu whenever you open the menu in any post, according to these next few strings.
<item android:id="@id/show_low_quality_comments" android:title="@string/menu_show_low_quality_comments" support:showAsAction="never" />
<item android:id="@id/hide_low_quality_comments" android:title="@string/menu_hide_low_quality_comments" support:showAsAction="never" />
showAsAction being set to “never” means that the menu option will only be shown in the overflow menu list, and the fact that no icon is identified in these strings indicates that it will merely show up as another text button in the menu.

It’s been a while since OnePlus made an affordable phone. The OnePlus One, OnePlus 2, and the OnePlus X were perhaps the only devices in the product lineup that could inarguably be called affordable. All the flagships since then have introduced a price creep, some greater than others. Today, the current generation cheapest device from the company is at a healthy ₹41,999 in India, and $699/€699 internationally. The flagship products may still be considered worth their price, but they are certainly priced above what a lot of users would be comfortable paying for a smartphone. OnePlus was looking to remedy that with the OnePlus Z this year (leaked earlier as the OnePlus 8 Lite). Now, a new leak sheds light on the possible specifications as well as the possible pricing of the OnePlus Z.
According to a thread on an online forum called DesiDime, some PayBack users recently received a survey that asked whether they would be willing to purchase a smartphone from OnePlus with certain specifications and at a certain price.
PayBack is a customer rewards program in India that essentially lets users of credit cards and debit cards accumulate reward points on their card-based purchases, and it is known to run product and marketing surveys occasionally. This particular survey is talking about an unreleased OnePlus smartphone, and it lists out certain specifications that align with what is expected out of the OnePlus Z.
According to the survey, the OnePlus Z will come with a 6.55″ Super AMOLED display with a 90Hz screen refresh rate and an in-display fingerprint scanner. It will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 SoC with 5G support, along with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The phone will apparently have a 4300 mAh battery and 30W fast charging support, which we guess can be through Warp Charging. On the camera end, the survey puts forth a 64MP + 16MP + 2MP triple camera setup, and we presume that the 16MP camera is likely an ultra-wide-angle camera and the 2MP camera is either a depth sensor or a macro shooter. There is also a 16MP camera on the front within the hole punch on the display.
Interestingly, according to the survey, the OnePlus Z is said to be priced at ₹24,990, which is approximately $330 according to current exchange rates. Keep in mind that OnePlus tends to have lower pricing in India as it takes advantage of the local assembly incentives from the government, so the pricing internationally could likely be higher. OnePlus did confirm an announcement for July 2nd for the new OnePlus TVs for the Indian market, and this might just be the perfect opportunity to launch the new smartphone as well.
All of the pricing and specs presume that the survey is correct and is an accurate representation of the OnePlus Z. PayBack does have a reputation, but we could not independently verify if such a survey was indeed sent out. Nonetheless, we are excited to see how this turns out because that price certainly has us intrigued.

The newly released Google Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 come with a revamped version of the Recorder app, an immensely useful voice recording app that Google debuted last year on the Pixel 4. The new Google Recorder 2.0 brings several exciting features, including a Smart Scrolling feature that highlights important keywords in a transcript next to the scrollbar, an Audio Editing feature that lets you edit your voice recording by editing the transcript, and Video Clips that allows you to generate a video clip using your audio recording. Now, the app is preparing to add Google Account integration that will enable users to back up their recordings to Google Drive automatically.
Currently, if you want to backup your audio or transcript files, you have to either locally export these files or upload them manually to Google Drive. Once Google Account integration goes live, Google Recorder will automatically backup and restore your recordings for you. The recordings will be backed up on your Google Drive and count against your storage.
Our Editor-in-Chief, Mishaal Rahman, managed to activate this new feature in Google Recorder 2.0 extracted from Pixel 5, and you can see it in action in the screenshots attached below.
Similar to Google Photos, you’ll also have the option to back up recordings only when you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network. Moreover, if you end up losing the on-device recordings, you’ll be able to redownload them from your Google Drive backup. Previously, if you uninstalled or cleared data for the Recorder app, there was no way to restore recordings in the app – you would have to rely on whatever files you manually externally backed up, with no way to reimport them into Google Recorder.
We don’t know when Google plans to roll out this feature to the masses, but we’ll be sure to let you know when that happens. Meanwhile, if you’re interested, you can try out the new Recorder app on your Android phone running Android 10 and above.

The best Android tablet I've ever used and a screen that's simply stunning
Android tablets suck, well, a lot of them do. Ask any regular person to describe a tablet, and they’ll often call it an iPad. While Samsung and others do a great job of not allowing the iPhone to become synonymous with the mobile category, it’s in tablets where Android manufacturers haven’t figured it out.
That’s not to say they haven’t tried, and Samsung has released several Galaxy Tabs that try to compete with the steady cadence of slabs coming out of Cupertino. None have appealed to me, mainly as I don’t think Android was designed with tablet sizes in mind. The Galaxy Tab S7 Plus, however, is the first Android tablet that would make me consider switching from my trusty iPad Pro.
XDA Forums: Samsung Galaxy Tab S7
There’s a whole lot of reasons why, and while the experience is mostly positive, there’s a couple of pitfalls that Samsung has also fallen into. I’ve been using the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus 5G for about 72 hours now, and here are our hands-on first impressions.
Visually breathtaking
There’s no other way to put it – the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus is stunning, and the display is visually breathtaking. Apple likes to tout marketing terms like Retina Display, but the 12.4-inch Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus is in a league of its own. At 1752 x 2800 pixels and a 16:10 aspect ratio, the display “only” offers 266 pixels per inch density, but much like megapixels aren’t the only deciding factor in cameras, the quality of the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus display is second to none.
The rest of the tablet is standard fare: a fairly uniform and large bezel around the screen, which results in an 84.6% screen to body ratio. An array of color choices, with the Mystic Bronze featuring a brushed rear finish and the best choice of color by far. Even though the black bezels seem unsightly, the sleek 5.7mm thickness means its part of the design aesthetic, and you don’t think about them.
At 575g, however, you feel the heft and at 285mm tall by 185mm wide, it’s not the most comfortable thing to use without a case. Unfortunately, right now, you can’t buy the keyboard cover, which means you’re limited to the on-screen keyboard (as there are no good third-party keyboard cases right now), and it’s too wide to be comfortable trying to hold at the bottom and type in portrait mode. Samsung has made some tweaks to the software so the keyboard can be split or turned into a floating keyboard, but you’ll want a keyboard cover: it’s just too uncomfortable otherwise.
While most of the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus is stylish and sleek, the position of the S Pen on the rear is problematic and honestly, quite unsightly. Using relatively strong magnets, the S Pen automatically attaches to the back. Connecting to an extended magnetized area that blends into the camera housing, this is probably the best that Samsung could do, but it’s not the most stylish thing.
Further, in the space of 48 hours, I’ve already lost the S Pen a couple of times. Once, it came loose and rolled under my car. The other, it fell to the bottom of my bag. Unlike the iPad Pro, where the Apple Pencil connects to the top of the iPad, the S Pen connects to the back, which also means it doesn’t lay flat when you put it on a table. It’s not a deal-breaker, but I’d love to see Samsung fix this flawed design in a future version.
Powerful performance and impressive hardware
Take the main specs from a flagship like the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (aside from the camera), put it in tablet format, and what do you get? The Galaxy Tab S7 Plus.
The package includes the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor – the latest from Qualcomm, and a modest upgrade over the Snapdragon 865 found in most flagship phones – and 6GB or 8GB of RAM. If you go for the 6GB version, it comes with 128GB of storage, while the 8GB variant comes with either 256GB or 512GB of storage. There’s also support for microSD expansion. I’m using the entry-level 6GB model and thought I had a higher spec: there’s been no initial lag or stutter, and it’s been lightning-fast with an experience that’s akin to the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Of course, it’s too soon to tell and I’ll reserve final judgment for the full review.
The rest of the hardware is equally impressive. The display supports HDR 10+ and offers a 120HZ refresh rate like the new Galaxy Note 20 series. The dual camera combines a primary 13MP wide-angle sensor with f/2.0 aperture, with a 5MP ultra-wide sensor with f/2.2 aperture.
The camera is ok at first glance, but no one should buy a tablet for its camera, please don’t be that person. The front camera is arguably more important, especially for things like video calls, and the 8MP f/2.0 sensor will likely be ok, although it is limited to Full HD at 30 frames per second. If you really must be the person using a giant tablet to take photos or videos, you’ll be happy to know the rear camera supports 4K video, also at 30 frames per second.
The rest of the hardware package includes a 10,090 mAh battery, and thankfully, 45W charging that should mean relatively rapid charging times. The Galaxy Tab S7 Plus is also one of the first devices to support the latest Wi-Fi 6 standard. Like the rest of Samsung’s recent flagship devices, there’s also wireless DeX so you can use your tablet to turn any display into a PC.
You might be wondering where the fingerprint sensor is. The answer is, Samsung went for an in-display fingerprint sensor, but Samsung might as well have not bothered. Anyone who’s used the Galaxy S20 range will understand what I mean: that series (and the Note 20 range) both had fairly bad in-display fingerprint readers, but somehow, Samsung has made it even worse on the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus. Whether you keep your fingerprint static when registering, or rotate it so you can unlock at any angle, it doesn’t matter. The fingerprint reader is almost useless, and in two days, I’ve had more failures to unlock than with any other device I’ve ever used. Unfortunately, there’s no other secure method for things like banking apps, etc., so it’s either struggle through the fingerprint issues or constantly have to log in to those apps.
Where I’ve been truly impressed so far is in the audio experience: the quad speakers tuned by AKG are loud, clear, and immensely enjoyable. The speakers have the added benefit of louder notifications, although you’ll want to turn this down as at its loudest, the notification sound can be heard upstairs in my house. If you’re buying the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus for its visual and auditory experiences, you won’t be disappointed.
Samsung is the software king
I’ve been using the Galaxy Fold for the past few months and love Samsung’s multitasking features. The best thing about the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus is your ability to multitask. You can have three windows side-by-side and can open more in a pop-up view that lets you also minimize the app into a little chat head. The iPad and even other Android tablets can’t compare, and Samsung’s decade of experience refining the multitasking experience shows.
Unfortunately, they’ve still not addressed my big concern about tablets as a whole: they’re treated less like independent experiences, and more like big smartphones. This is flawed, and it’s most apparent on the home screen. The Galaxy Tab S7 Plus offers a 5×6 maximum grid layout, which is also the same on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, despite the former having almost twice the screen real estate. Yes, there are third-party launchers, etc., but just like my complaints with the Galaxy Fold, it doesn’t feel like Samsung is maximizing the larger screen real estate. Is it that difficult to give us the ability to use smaller icons, and a larger overall grid to fit more on the screen?
That said, Samsung has made some optimizations, mainly to the keyboard experience. Knowing that many people will rely on the on-screen keyboard, there’s the ability to resize the keyboard, turn it into a split keyboard or undock it and let it float on top of whatever app you are using.
The keyboard also contains Ctrl, Shift and arrow keys, allowing you to use common PC commands like Ctrl + C / V to copy and paste. While necessary for DeX, this also has the by-product of finally offering the ability to quickly undo what you last did using the Ctrl + Z / Y key combos. It’s long been a gripe of mine that Android doesn’t have an easy way to undo or redo your last action, and while these keyboard shortcuts can’t be used outside of text input fields, it’s still a handy feature to have.

Galaxy Tab S7 Plus: I’m tempted to switch from the iPad Pro
This is the most surprising part of my first impressions: the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus is so impressive in the right areas that I am considering switching from my iPad Pro. There are some inexcusable things like the fingerprint sensor and that awful design of the S Pen location on the back, but these are nitpicking from a positive experience.
That said, the real proof will be in the coming days and weeks as I put it through its paces. It may not live up to its early hype, but the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus has left enough of a good impression that I can’t wait to see how it performs.
Stay tuned for the full review, but in the meantime, I’m off to try and hunt down the keyboard cover or an alternative. I wrote this entire post in word using the on-screen keyboard on the Tab S7+, and my hand is suffering from cramp, so I don’t recommend relying solely on the on-screen keyboard.

OnePlus handsets have historically been home to a lot of developer support, and the OnePlus 5 has been no different. MokeeROM is one of the latest custom ROMs for the OP5, and it comes equipped with a ton of great features – including tons of gestures to play around with, button customization, status bar control, and plenty more.
MokeeROM is much more stable and daily-driver material than LegendROM that we previously checked out last week, and, better yet, it also supports OnePlus’s Dash Charge system.

Android users love to stretch the functionality of every aspect of their phones. This is why the modding community is so active. People want complete control over their device. If there’s a button on a phone programmed to do something, we want it to do something else. The developer of the popular bxActions app is back with a similar tool for the Galaxy Note 10 and the S Pen.
Galaxy Note 10 Forums ||| Galaxy Note 10+ Forums
sideActions is an app that allows Galaxy Note 10 (and 10+) users to remap the power button on the S Pen. The developer says this is the first time the power button on the S Pen has ever been remapped. The power button can be mapped to any action or app you like. It can even be used to navigate the phone (map the button to the Back button).
Setting up sideActions is pretty easy. All you need to do is hook up the Galaxy Note 10 to a computer and run a simple ADB command. After that, it can be remapped to your heart’s content. Download the app for free from the Play Store below. Here’s a list of features and actions:

A while back, we told you about the Lumia 710 getting its first custom ROM. Well today we have even bigger news: the Nokia Lumia 800 (the 710’s more expensive sibling) has received its first custom ROM, courtesy of XDA Forum Member lucifer3006. Known as RainbowMod and based off of Windows Phone 7.10.8773.98 (Tango), the ROM promises such exciting features as:
Full Unlock from UltraShot
Removed OEM applications (Nokia Drive, Maps, etc.)
Search key remapping
QuickLaunch menu for quick switching state of WiFi, 3G, Flight mode, Power save, etc.
Ability to access file system via WiFi/USB
Integrated Live ID, DppImplant no longer needed, but new key can also be banned

The Huawei Mate 40 Pro is arguably the most intriguing smartphone launch of the year, what with it being potentially the very last Huawei phone to use a Kirin chip due to ongoing U.S. sanctions that prevent most of the world’s chipmakers, including Huawei’s longtime partner TSMC, from supplying silicon for Huawei.
But even without the U.S. scrutiny drama, the Huawei Mate 40 Pro would still have been one of the more interesting launches of the year anyway. Ever since 2018’s Huawei P20 Pro, every Huawei flagship has brought with it a breakthrough in camera hardware, whether it be RYYB sensors that can literally see in the dark, a true 10x lossless optical zoom lens, or computational night mode photography before Google and Apple did it.
I’ve been testing a pre-production unit of the Huawei Mate 40 Pro for about a day and a half. Here are my first impressions.

Design: Evolution of an established look
The Huawei Mate 40 Pro continues the design aesthetics established with the Mate 20 series: a centrally-placed camera module with a 2×2 camera layout, a curved screen, and real 3D face scanning — a rarity in the Android space. Thankfully, the angular, unsightly notch of the Mate 30 is gone. In its place is a hole-punch cut-out housing a selfie camera, a TOF sensor, and an infrared camera, similar to what we saw in the P40 series.
The “waterfall” curved display first seen in last year’s Mate 30 Pro — meaning the sides of the screen slope at a more dramatic 88-degree angle and curves further down the sides of the phone — is back. Many people in the tech space criticized this design last year (mostly from looking at product shots), but those who actually reviewed the Mate 30 Pro reported no false touch issues across the board. The same can be said here — even with my palm rubbing all over the side, it doesn’t get in the way of scrolling or tapping. The 6.67-inch OLED panel is “just” 90Hz, so it’s technically slower than the 120Hz seen in rivals, but animations appear very smooth to my eyes. I suppose the OnePlus 8T’s animations zip around a hair more fluidly, but I don’t think many people will look at this 90Hz panel and complain.
The back of the Huawei Mate 40 Pro is glass, covered in this soft-touch matte coating that fights off fingerprints quite well. My unit has this silver color that subtly changes shade depending on how the light hits the back. The volume rocker, which had been removed from last year’s Mate 30 series, is back, but it is placed further towards the back edge than usual since the waterfall display curves substantially. However, the double-tap-side-of-screen to trigger the on-screen volume control trick is still here.
The Kirin 9000 SoC: 5nm and 5G
The Huawei Mate 40 Pro is packed with the HiSilicon Kirin 9000, a 5nm chip that also has a 5G modem built-in. This is an impressive feat of engineering, as even Apple’s 5nm A14 Bionic requires a separate radio for 5G.
Because this phone is running pre-production software, I was unable to install many benchmark apps, such as Geekbench 5, PCMark, and GFX Bench. However, I did successfully install 3D Mark, and in the “Wild Life” test that benchmarks graphic performance, the Kirin 9000 beat the Snapdragon 865 running in the Galaxy S20 FE with a score of 6,505 to 3,723. The score on the Mate 40 Pro is ~2x that from the Kirin 990 on the Huawei P40 Pro, and ~1.5x of the score from the Snapdragon 865+ in the ROG Phone 3. It is too early to arrive at a conclusion, but the Kirin 9000 showcases immense potential as far as improvements in the GPU performance is concerned. We’ll be doing more benchmarks in the near future.

I was able to test the 5G in Hong Kong, and in the Speedtest from the Ookla app, data speeds were very similar to what the iPhone 12 has been getting.
Cameras: Another zoom and low-light beast
Whether you like the look of the Mate series’ centrally-located camera module or not, you can’t deny that it is fairly unique and stands out from the sea of similar-looking camera modules on the market. This year’s design, dubbed “Space Ring,” houses a 50MP, f/1.9, RYYB primary camera, and a 12MP, f/3.4 Periscope zoom lens. Both of these sensors appear to be the exact same ones used in the P40 Pro earlier this year. The other two cameras consist of a 3D ToF sensor and a 20MP ultra-wide-angle camera.
The latter camera — the ultra-wide — is interesting. It’s still an 18mm lens (meaning the field-of-vision is 100-degrees, relatively narrow compared to other phones’ ultra-wide sensors), but the pixel count has been halved from the 40MP lens used in the Mate 30 Pro and P40 Pro. Huawei has not released a spec sheet or early information at the time of me writing this article, so I don’t know why this change happened, but I can tell the ultra-wide camera is still the sharpest in the mobile space (but with framing being a bit too tight), and excels even more in even extreme low light condition. See the ultra-wide samples below. The Mate 40 Pro’s ultra-wide shots are sharper, and at night, they exhibit a lot less noise than the iPhone 12’s ultra-wide.
Ultra-wide: Huawei Mate 40 Pro vs iPhone 12
In the below set, I took ultra-wide, 1X, and 10X zoom shots with both the Huawei Mate 40 Pro and the Apple iPhone 12 Pro, and to my eyes, Huawei won the ultra-wide and 10X zoom, but loses the 1X to Apple’s new shooter.
Ultra-wide, 1x, 10x: Huawei Mate 40 Pro vs iPhone 12
In night time photography, I’m a fan of the Mate 40 Pro’s contrasty vibe. For example, the neon lights in the image below look far cleaner than on the iPhone 12’s shot.
Night Shots: Huawei Mate 40 Pro vs iPhone 12
Huawei added a similar ultra-wide camera to its front shooter this year, giving it also a 100-degree field-of-view. For the most part, selfies on the Huawei Mate 40 Pro appear excellent. In the set below, the Mate 40 Pro’s selfie camera has the widest field-of-view, and is a happy medium between the iPhone 12’s all-natural look and Samsung’s overly beautified, skin-smoothened aesthetic. Notice the Mate 40 Pro’s shot is the only one that didn’t completely blow out the sky behind me — you can actually see some semblance of clouds.

Software — You already know where the issue is
The Huawei Mate 40 Pro runs EMUI 11 over Android 10. I haven’t had time to dive too deep into the software yet, but my early impressions are that the UI mostly feels the same as previous Huawei phones, with the most notable addition being improved multitasking in the form of a slide-over menu that allows the user to launch apps in a floating window.
There’s also a new Always-On Display that intelligently only turns on when you move your head towards the screen. It works like magic — anytime I tilt my head over at the phone screen, the AOD lights up. Huawei hasn’t explained how exactly it’s doing this at the time of writing this article, but I’m assuming it’s using the 3D face scanning system to detect head movement, perhaps?
But of course, the elephant in the room: The Huawei Mate 40 Pro does not ship with Google’s Mobile Services core and they cannot be installed without some sort of hack or unofficial methodology. I’ve used the last two non-GMS Huawei devices so I’ve gotten pretty familiar with what apps I can use and what I can’t: key Google services like YouTube, Drive, Docs, Keep are all no go. But Google Maps and Chrome work. Other widely-used apps (for me) like WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter all work.
Thoughts so far
As is the case with the last four or five Huawei flagships, the Huawei Mate 40 Pro has absolutely top-notch hardware — arguably the best in Android. But the software issue is going to require compromises in usage habits for many people around the world. I’m going to be testing this phone thoroughly over the upcoming days, so stay tuned for more coverage.
Huawei Mate 40 Pro ForumsGmail prepares to let you opt out of personalizing other Google services
Given how important email has become in our day-to-day lives, it’s important that you sign up with an email service that you can trust. Most people are using free email services like Gmail, and it’s thanks to Gmail’s huge userbase that Google is able to collect massive amounts of aggregated data on our email habits. Google uses this data to show you more targeted ads, but they also use this data to improve their own services. Features like smart reply and nudges are two of the ways that Gmail has become smarter for the user, but there are also various cross-product integrations like Google Pay surfacing your loyalty cards, Google Assistant reminding you of your bills, and Google Maps displaying your restaurant reservations.
Once you’ve enabled these features, you have to go to the settings of multiple apps to turn off all these integrations if you want to rein in what information other Google services can glean from your emails. Fortunately, it looks like the Gmail app is preparing to add a form to make it easier to opt out of cross-product information sharing. That form will also inform the user about Gmail’s various “smart” features, and Google may soon require users to opt in to continue using them (if they’re already using them.)
Version 2020.09.20 of the Gmail app rolled out today on the Google Play Store, and it contains strings suggesting there will be in-app forms for the user to opt-in or opt-out of personalizing other Google products based on your Gmail, Chat, or Meet content. It seems the opt-out process is all-or-nothing as you can’t opt-out of sharing your Gmail, Chat, and Meet content on a per-service basis. Once you opt out, you won’t be able to have Google Assistant remind you of your upcoming bills, you can’t have Google Maps display your restaurant reservations, you can’t have Travel bundle your itineraries, and you can’t have Google Pay extract your loyalty cards and tickets from your email.

In addition, the first page of this form will allow you to opt out of other “smart features” in Gmail, such as nudges, smart reply, smart compose, automatic email filtering/categorization, high priority notifications for important emails, and extracting calendar events from emails.

In the middle of 2019, Google revealed 3 hidden privacy settings for Google Pay that users could opt out of. Earlier this year, Google announced that the company will no longer store audio recordings by default for all users of Assistant. It seems that Google wants to address the concerns of privacy advocates, who have alleged that Google’s services collect and use data in a manner that isn’t abundantly clear to users. By informing users what data is collected to make these features possible and requiring them to opt back in to continue using them, Google can satisfy both regular users who wish to continue using these features and the privacy-conscious who want to limit what services their data is shared with.
I have not been able to surface these settings in the latest version of the Gmail app for Android. If Google announces this feature, we’ll of course provide coverage of that announcement.Android 8.0 Oreo Unofficially Lands on the LeEco Le Max 2
Ever since the official arrival of Android Oreo, developers worldwide have been hammering away at bugs on their build machines in order to shoehorn the newest Android OS onto our devices. As is customary, we have begun to see AOSP variants of the major release surface across a wide variety of devices, the latest of which is the Le Max 2 from LeEco.
The ROM at hand, brought to you by XDA Senior Member andr68rus, is an unofficial port of LineageOS 15. The work has been released in an alpha state, which basically means that it is not suitable as a daily driver due to the sheer number of bugs and non-functional features. The most prevalent one (as of the time this article was written) is the camera, which has been a thorn on the side of many developers working on the device.
In fact, it was not long ago that the LineageOS 14.1 port obtained a working camera. Having said that (and onto the good news regarding this Oreo port), the main bits that you would need to at least use this port are working.
If you feel like helping out the developer to test for more bugs or even to work on the ROM itself, feel free to download the build and take it for a spin. Just be sure to include any and all relevant logs along with your bug report. This will not only make the developer’s life easier, but it may actually help the developer possibly fix the error/bug that you are reporting.

Our phones now have more apps that we can keep count of. As a result, Rogue apps sometimes masquerade as utilities and may misuse the granted permissions to secretly snoop on you. Smartphone manufacturers, as well as Google, have grown wary of the issue and every time an app uses the camera, microphone, or the location in the background on Android 9 Pie and upwards, you get a notification. Xiaomi has also added visual cues in MIUI 12 and so has Apple with iOS 14 to alert users every time an app accesses some features in the background. For phones by other manufacturers or running older versions of Android, Access Dots offers a similar solution by showing colored indicators every time an app uses the camera or the mic.
The app is created by XDA Recognized Developer jagan2, who has also created apps like Energy Ring, Energy Bar, and Energy Notch in the past. Much like the implementation in iOS 14, Access Dots shows colored dots whenever the camera or the mic is in use. Although the dots show up at the top right corner of the display, you can also choose the location for the dots from within the app’s settings. You can also choose from different colors for the camera and the microphone and change the size of the dot from the Settings.
The app is free to use and is live right now on the Google Play Store. jagan2 also notes that the app itself does not access the camera or the microphone. You can see it in action in the GIF shared below, showing camera access for Instagram Stories.
Access Dots is expected to work on all Android devices with Android 7.0 Nougat and upwards. You can visit the Play Store link below to download it now or visit the XDA forum thread to give feedback/suggestions.
Access Dots XDA Forums threadSamsung Galaxy A51 5G, Galaxy A71 5G, and ZTE Axon 11 5G/4G forums are open
Phone launches typically slow down in the summer months, but there have still been plenty of new phones as of late. Samsung, unsurprisingly, has announced a couple of new devices and ZTE has joined in as well. We’ve opened up forums for the Galaxy A51 5G, Galaxy A71 5G, and both variants of the ZTE Axon 11 (4G & 5G).
The Samsung Galaxy A51 5G was announced for the US market back in April, and it’s simply a 5G version of the existing device. The basic details include a 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED, a quad camera setup consisting of a 48MP primary camera, the Samsung Exynos 980 processor, a 4,000mAh battery, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of internal storage.
Samsung Galaxy A51 5G XDA Forums
It’s a similar story with the Samsung Galaxy A71 5G, which launched in the US this week, and is a 5G version of the existing device. It features a 6.7-inch FHD+ AMOLED display, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G in the U.S. and Exynos 980 abroad, quad rear cameras, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4,500mAh battery.

ZTE, on the other hand, launched both 4G and 5G versions of the ZTE Axon 11 at the same time. However, the two devices are not the same. The 5G model has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G SoC, while the 4G model has the MediaTek Helio P70. They both have 6.47-inch AMOLED displays, quad cameras, and 4,000mAh batteries.

Following the recent announcement of the new LG K42, LG K52, and LG K62, the South Korean OEM is gearing up to launch another smartphone as part of its K Series. The upcoming device was recently spotted in Google Play Console’s listing of certified devices, revealing some of its key specifications. The Google Play Console listing suggests that the upcoming device will be called the LG K92 5G, and it will go by the model name LM-K920 and code-name acexlm. The listing further reveals that the device will run on the sm6350 platform, which is the part number for the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 690 5G chipset.
As you can see in the attached image, the LG K92 will feature 6GB of RAM, an FHD+ display, and it’ll run Android 10 out of the box. Further, the listing reveals that the device will include an Adreno 619 GPU. While the image in the listing doesn’t give us a clear look at the device, renowned leaker Evan Blass has shared a high-resolution render that reveals a bit more about the device.
Unlike the other three devices in the LG K Series mentioned above, the upcoming LG K92 won’t include a rectangular camera module on the back. Instead, the device will offer a Pixel 3-like two-tone finish with three of the four cameras embedded within the top class. The fourth, likely primary 64MP, sensor will protrude slightly. Right next to the camera module, the device will have a large quad-flash array, with camera branding underneath.
The render further reveals that the LG K92 will have a centered hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera, a side-mounted fingerprint scanner integrated into the power button, the volume rocker on the left edge, and an extra button underneath the volume rocker. The device also looks to have a 3.5mm headphone jack, but we can’t be sure of that at the moment. Additionally, the render reveals that the device will be released on AT&T’s prepaid subsidiary Cricket Wireless in the US, and it will feature prominent Cricket branding on the back panel.Samsung Galaxy A51 is now available from AT&T and Xfinity Mobile in the U.S.
Back in December, Samsung launched the Galaxy A51, the mid-range successor to the Galaxy A50. Priced at $399, this mid-range smartphone is a strong competitor to the Apple iPhone SE and upcoming Google Pixel 4a. The phone was launched in the U.S. early last month and is already available through multiple carriers and retailers. Now, the Samsung Galaxy A51 can be purchased directly through AT&T and Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile.
Samsung Galaxy A51 Forums
To recap, the Samsung Galaxy A51 features a large 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with a centered hole-punch cutout (Samsung calls this an “Infinity-O” display). This hole-punch cutout houses the single 32MP front-facing camera. On the rear, there’s a quad camera setup consisting of a 48MP primary wide-angle camera, a 12MP ultra-wide angle camera, a 5MP dedicated macro camera, and a 5MP depth sensor. Internally, the phone is powered by the Samsung Exynos 9611 processor, a 4000mAh battery, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of internal storage (expandable via a microSD card). The phone supports 15W wired charging via the included USB Type-C charger. The Galaxy A51 runs Samsung’s One UI 2.0 software on top of Android 10.
On AT&T and Xfinity Mobile, you can pick up the Samsung Galaxy A51 in Prism Crush Black for a full retail price of $399. You’ll pay $13.34/month for 30 months under AT&T’s Installment Plan with delivery between May 5-7.

The Samsung Galaxy A51 has an impressive set of specifications on paper, and because of its $399 price point, it’s widely compared to the new Apple iPhone SE. Although the Pixel 4a hasn’t been released yet, we can expect it go toe-to-toe with the Galaxy A51 based on what we’ve heard from leaks and rumors. There’s also a 5G Galaxy A51 coming later this year, but we don’t know its pricing or availability yet.Sony Xperia XA Ultra Simple Rooting Guide
Remember those days when rooting was a simple set of steps that anyone with basic computing knowledge could follow?
Pepperidge Farm XDA Developers remembers, and especially XDA Senior Member rrvuhpg who has kindly put together a very easy-to-follow rooting guide for Sony’s phablet, the Xperia XA Ultra.
Every device manufacturer has its own set of quirks and hoops to jump through when it comes to liberating its software. While Sony was, in many occasions, labelled as one of the most developer friendly OEMs in the market, its products are not without their complexities. In the particular case of Sony devices (most/all devices released after the Xperia Z back in 2012), they come with a little drawback when it comes to unlocking: while most devices can lose their warranties when you unlock them, Sony takes things a few steps further and effectively disables features (proprietary to Sony Mobile) by virtue of deletion of DRM keys. This was something that earlier developers on our site figured out and despite discussions with Sony Mobile employees, it is something that stayed behind as a means to protect the company’s IP. More specifically,
Unlocking your BootLoader will void your warranty, break your device DRM and lose X-Reality and image optimization on low light when taking pictures.
Naturally, rooting requires unlocking of the bootloader, which will have the side effect of wiping the aforementioned keys. However, on top of the guide presenting a simple method for rooting, it also includes specific steps to be taken in order to preserve the DRM keys, in case one wants to revert back to a stock software configuration (be it for warranty purposes or any other reason). The process is quite simple and it involves backing up said keys prior to the actual unlocking through a process called TA Backup via a tool created by XDA Recognized Developer rayman.
Another bump in the road to rooting is the fact that depending on which variant of the device you purchased, it may or may not be rootable with this guide. The reason behind it is that not all Sony devices are created equal as they may come with an non-unlockable bootloader. So, word of advise, if you are in the market for one of these and will be requiring root, read through our fora and Google around before you spend your hard earned money.
Please do keep in mind that the guide this is linked to is only for Android Nougat. Should you still be sporting Marshmallow on your XA Ultra, you will need to follow this guide if you need root. If you have read all the warnings, backed up anything important, and are ready to go, then head over to the thread to get started!

The Xiaomi Mi Band 4 was launched in June 2019, coming up as a big upgrade over the Mi Band 3 thanks to its color display and other additions. In my review of the Mi Band 4, I noted how the Mi Band lineup has evolved over the years to the point that the Mi Band 4 had left behind very little room for improvement for the next generation. Now, the Mi Band 5 is here (or the Mi Smart Band 5, as they call it here in India), picking up the baton from the predecessor in this marathon of a healthy lifestyle. How does the Mi Band 5 perform? Read along as we figure out what Xiaomi has brought to the table with the latest evolution of its popular fitness tracker lineup.

About this review: Xiaomi India loaned us the Mi Smart Band 5 for review. This review is after 3 weeks of use. Xiaomi did not have any inputs in this review.
Design and Display on the Mi Band 5
While the Mi Band 4 brought along a color touchscreen as a headlining upgrade, the Mi Band 5 does not attempt to fix what is not broken. Xiaomi has only added marginal improvements here, namely with a slightly larger display (1.1″ vs 0.95″) which gets brighter at up to 450 nits. The Mi Band 4 performed decently under bright sunlight, and the Mi Band 5 does even better on that end. You will have no issues reading the display under bright sunlight.
On the display, what appears to be a bigger change is the ability to set a custom wallpaper on your watch face on the Mi Smart Band 5. The previous Mi Band supported multiple official watchfaces as well as unofficial watchfaces that could be sideloaded to bring in more customization. With the Mi Band 5, you can make a custom watch face from within the Mi Fit app, letting you choose from a few different clock and info layouts, then change the wallpaper (it can even be your own selfie if you want it to be), and change the font color. And of course, the unofficial watchfaces can still be installed, though you may need to be careful of the changes that Android 10 and 11 bring about with Scoped Storage (not Xiaomi’s fault in any way).
You can even switch watch faces from the Band itself, and some of the preloaded Bandfaces also have customizations to what information they can display. There are even animated official watch faces! Overall, there is a lot more customization possible on top of whatever the Mi Band 4 offered, and that is always a good thing.
But the biggest change of all on the Mi Band 5 is the fact that the wearable now uses a magnetic charging pin. Gone is the awkward and awful cup-like design from the Band 4 that did a very poor job at holding the band module in place. With the Mi Band 5, you no longer need to remove the band module from the silicone strap — just bring the magnetic charger close to the charging pin and it will snap itself into place. This elegantly solves my biggest complaint with the predecessor, and I no longer need to contend with tightly stringing around rubber bands just to get the band module to charge. The other end of the magnetic charger is still USB Type-A, so for the future, I wish Xiaomi makes the switch over to Type-C. But for now, it works and it works well.
A con with these changes — namely the larger display and the switch over to a magnetic charging design — is that bands for the Mi Band 4 and its predecessor are no longer compatible with the Mi Band 5. You can force the Band 5 module into a Band 4 strap, but you’ll likely end up with a broken or deformed strap instead of a clean solution. I reckon there will be third-party straps available for the Mi Band 5 on its own.
The Mi Smart Band 5 continues to omit NFC and microphone on units sold outside of China. NFC is barely used in India, so the absence of it is a non-issue.
Overall, my positive impressions from the Mi Band 4 have carried over onto the Mi Band 5. It retains the discreet and understated look, and brings along a few key changes that overall enhance the experience on the wearable. Remember, this fitness tracker sits within the cheapest segment of fitness trackers — so what you get for the price remains commendable.
User Interface and Experience on the Mi Band 5
I have extensively talked about the user interface and the experience on the Mi Band and the companion Mi Fit app in my Mi Band 4 review, so I urge readers to read those sections as the Mi Band 5 carries over all of those experiences, and then some.
The Mi Band 5 adds in several new features, such as the ability to record more sports, the ability to track sleep better and even track mid-day naps, track menstrual cycles for people who get periods, help you relax with breathing exercises, give you an indication of how stressed you are, control your phone’s camera shutter from the Band, and even give you personalized activity tracking in the form of PAI.
More Sports Mode
The Mi Band 5 now comes with tracking for:
- Yoga
- Power Walking
- Treadmill
- Outdoor Running
- Outdoor Cycling
- Indoor Cycling
- Pool swimming
- Jump rope
- Freestyle workout
- Rowing machine
- Elliptical
These sports modes should be sufficient for the large mass of average users who are just getting started on their fitness journey. Note that the Mi Band series does not come with GPS built-in, so for activities that involve route-tracking, the Mi Band relies on GPS information collected through the Mi Fit app on your phone.
Step Tracking
Tracking by itself is okay, a sentiment that becomes “good” when you factor in the price of the product. I still found the Band being a little over-sensitive for step tracking, usually counting a few steps for periods when I was asleep. The data is reliable within an error margin of less than 5% — I find this to be an acceptable margin for the simple reason of the Band being a starter tool and not for professional tracking. If you need devices that can deliver more precision tracking, you need to spend over five times the price of the Mi Band 4/5 — and with that in mind, the Mi Band 5 continues to do a pretty good job.
Sleep Tracking
For sleep tracking, my personal experience dictates that the Mi Band 4 was better at tracking sleep than the Mi Band 5, despite the new band claiming to come with upgraded sleep analysis tech. I usually spend a good amount of time idling in bed before falling asleep and after waking up — the Mi Band 4 was fairly accurate in capturing these, but the Mi Band 5 catches in the lowered body movement as an indication of sleep, perhaps to accommodate daytime naps? But then, there are instances when the Band said I was awake at night, which was simply not true. On a personal note, I am unable to nap during daylight hours, so measuring this conclusively was difficult. It’s also more difficult to sleep with two fitness trackers on my wrist, so I am unable to get comparison screenshots for the same night.
In the first screenshot above, I went to sleep at a good 2am, but the Band 5 already registered a sleep session when I was idling in bed. The last stretch of light sleep data is also wrong, as I had woken up by my 9am alarm. In the second screenshot, there are large periods of time when my Band 5 presumed I was awake, when in fact, I have no recollection of periods.
From personal experience, the Mi Band 4 is just better for sleep tracking. The Mi Band 5 does track REM state for sleep too, so if tracking this is important for you, you should only prefer the Mi Band 5 within this narrow context of sleep tracking. Otherwise, the Mi Band 4 is better for sleep tracking.
Period Tracking
The Mi Band 5 comes with period tracking features built-in, to better aid people who get periods. This section has been written with the assistance of a friend who gets their period.
You need to input an initial data set within the Mi Fit app first for onboarding the feature. Once your first entry is done with regards your period length, cycle length, last menstrual period date, and your consent to predict the next menstrual cycle, the Mi Fit app displays a calendar with information related to menstruation, fertility periods, and ovulation days, as well as the next cycle prediction if you chose that setting. You can enter data on a new menstrual cycle, and optionally, you can also input data on pain, bleeding, and emotions. The idea with this data collection is to maintain a history, in case you may need it for medical reasons. You can also get notified through the app on your phone, or have a notification sent to your band when your next cycle approaches.
The Mi Band 5, on the other hand, displays a timeline of period activity. You can quickly add in an entry if you get a period, but that is about it on the information you can add and interact with on the Band.
While I personally cannot hold an opinion on how useful this feature is, my friend mentions that the UI is decent, and the app displays what it can with the information provided. Period tracking usually improves as history builds up, so one should avoid judging the menstrual cycle predictions from a singular month of data alone. One point to note is that there is currently no way to add in sexual activity, as that is also vital information for period tracking, especially for figuring in delays or other unusual behavior. Period tracking apps also have a wider range of emotions that can be tracked, which is something that can be improved here. What I would add from my end is the fact that the app should consider adopting gender-neutral vocabulary to be inclusive of everyone. Even the Mi Fit app profile (your Xiaomi account) only has two gender options, so there’s room for improvement here.
Stress Monitoring and Breath Training
Another highlighting feature of the Mi Band 5 is the addition of Stress Monitoring and Breath Training. These features are pretty self-explanatory. In my daily usage so far, I did not receive any notifications related to being over-stressed (although we had just handled Techtober and some stressful workdays). The Band 5 did record a fair few periods (36%) of moderate stress, but for the most part, my sedentary lifestyle just gave me mild stress (64%), with no instances of relaxed states or overstressed states. Xiaomi notes that this data is calculated through HRV (Heart Rate Variability) and is for reference only, so I would advise readers to not read too much into it unless you get overstressed.
Breath Training is something I found useful. Essentially, you can set 1-5 minutes of training for relaxed breathing. The Band then guides you through inhaling and exhaling periods through an animation on the display and short vibration when the state is to be changed. At the end of the exercise, the Band displays your initial and your final heart rate, giving you an idea of how much you managed to calm yourself down. I love the inclusion of this feature. My wishlist for the same would be perhaps set a time of the day when the Band reminds you to do this exercise or perhaps customizing the Stress limits on which the Band could trigger a reminder notification for this exercise.
PAI – Personalized Activity Intelligence
This is a new addition to the Mi Band 5, although we have seen the same on more expensive wearables such as the Huami Amazfit GTR and Amazfit GTS
PAI uses the heart rate data collected during physical activity to provide a PAI score. The total PAI score is based on a rolling 7-day window, and the goal is to maintain a PAI score of 100 or more, which has apparently proven to provide maximum health benefits. The goal of 100 PAI was chosen as a normalized value, but what each person needs to do to achieve 100 PAI is also apparently unique to them. As you become more fit, it also becomes inherently more difficult to achieve 100 PAI which makes it appropriately challenging for all levels. Shamefully, my lifestyle, Techtober, and the COVID-19 pandemic ensured that I could only exercise irregularly and that too, for the sake of this review. My score never went above 7, which is worse than the 11 I had managed to achieve when reviewing the Amazfit GTS. I wouldn’t blame this on the Band.
Battery and Charging on the Mi Band 5
All the Mi Bands have provided excellent battery life so far, and the Mi Band 5 is no exception. For wearables, anything above a 7-day life cycle is considered “good enough” in my books, as one can presume that there will be at least one opportunity to charge your watch once in a week. The Mi Band 5 has a bigger battery, but the display is also marginally bigger and fairly brighter, plus there are more functions. Xiaomi claims up to 14 days of battery life, and up to 21 days if you use the band in power saving mode. Their claims check out almost, as I was able to get 12 days reliably with most features enabled. Charging the watch up takes between 1.5-2 hours, and as mentioned before, connecting the charger is no longer a task in itself, so you can consider quick 5-10 minute top-ups every day. The Mi Band 5 aces the Battery and Charging section of the review, with no complaints.
Conclusion: The Xiaomi Mi Band 5 is a noticeable improvement from the great Mi Band 4
My Mi Band 4 review mentioned that “the Mi Band lineup from Xiaomi keeps improving and keeps surprising, year after year. Just when you thought the company has delivered the best value product, out comes another that raises the bar even higher.” The statements continue to hold true for this generation as well.
We do need to take note of the fact that there has been a small rise in pricing for the Band series in India. The Mi Band 3 came in at ₹1,999, while the Band 4 came in at ₹2,299 and the Band 5 comes in at ₹2,499. The price increase is small, but it does admittedly affect how affordable this starter fitness band can be. Xiaomi also has introduced lower Bands in the form of the Redmi Band at ₹1,399, so the pinch from the Band 5 doesn’t hurt at much. For the price it commands, you do get a well-rounded product, and it is easy to ask potential customers to shell out another ₹200 and just get the newest product, completely justified by the change in the charger itself.
The Mi Band 5 is a wearable that makes good fitness tracking affordable. You can achieve a lot of these functions from other wearables in the market, but Xiaomi has figured out the mantra on the Mi Band lineup. The only downside on this device is the lower reliability in sleep tracking, which the company could fix through software updates. If you are a hobbyist or an amateur just looking to get some motivation for your first week of running, the Mi Band 5 is an excellent purchase for a healthier lifestyle and a great option for gifting.

Register or Login with GoogleGoogle Photos v1.22 Prepares to Add Black Point, Saturation, Shadow, Temperature, and Tint Adjustment
Within each Google App update, there’s always something interesting to find. For instance, a little over a week ago we discovered some exciting upcoming features within the Google Maps app.
Google is always testing out new features for us to toy with, and with the latest Google Photos update come some hints about where Google is headed with the service’s photo editing capabilities. Google Photos v1.22 appears to be adding several new photo editing features such as black point adjustment, brightness adjustment, saturation adjustment, shadows, temperature, and tint.
Disclaimer: The evidence we dig up from the APK files of an app are not definitive. Google may choose to pull these features without any indication in a future release.
Google Photos Meets Snapseed
It’s been a long while since Google bought Snapseed, so we’ve been expecting Google to take advantage of the photo editing technology used in Snapseed within its namesake products. Although Google Photos has been a smashing success since its initial launch, its success probably isn’t attributed all that much to its photo editing capabilities. People love free stuff, and Google’s unlimited online free storage with minimal compression was a massive selling point for its users, but if Google wants to stay competitive with the likes of Apple, Amazon, Samsung, and other major brands they will need to continue bringing more features to Google Photos. Just recently, Google Photos received a web update allowing users to adjust the timestamps on multiple photos. Still, apart from very basic EXIF data manipulation, Google Photo’s has lacked many of the image processing features seen in Snapseed.
Currently, the only things you can currently do are automatically adjust color and exposure, manually change lighting, manually adjust color, or add effects. That’s about to change, at least according to some strings found within the latest Google Photos update.
<string name="cpe_adjustments_black_point">Black point</string>
<string name="cpe_adjustments_brightness">Brightness</string>
<string name="cpe_adjustments_highlights">Highlights</string>
<string name="cpe_adjustments_midtones">Midtones</string>
<string name="cpe_adjustments_saturation">Saturation</string>
<string name="cpe_adjustments_saturation_deep_blue">Deep blue</string>
<string name="cpe_adjustments_saturation_skin_tone">Skin tone</string>
<string name="cpe_adjustments_shadows">Shadows</string>
<string name="cpe_adjustments_temperature">Temperature</string>
<string name="cpe_adjustments_tint">Tint</string>
With these image processing features in Google Photos, there’s less of a reason for most average users to use Snapseed or similar product. Why navigate to another app when you can access, store, and edit all of your photos on any platform thanks to Google Photos? Now I don’t think Google will be abandoning Snapseed anytime soon, but it’s nice to see them finally taking steps to take advantage of the technology they bought back in 2012.
That’s all we found in the latest Google Photos update. Stay tuned to future posts in our series when we investigate what’s new and what’s coming in Google’s Apps.Those of you who love having a random, but always great wallpaper, have surely heard about 500 Firepaper.

Amazon competes with Google on a number of fronts, from smart speakers to streaming boxes. (It even had its own smartphone once upon a time.) But the operating system at the heart of Amazon’s Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top boxes is Fire OS, which is based on Android. It even supports a lot of Android’s core features, like the ability to sideload apps and switch between home launchers.
If you’re an Android purist, or if you just aren’t a fan of the Fire TV’s user interface, you’ll be happy to know that you can change the launcher to something different. One excellent choice is Leanback Launcher by XDA Member rockon999: a fully-featured Android TV launcher for Amazon Fire TV devices. It’s as simple and easy to navigate as on Android TV set-top boxes like the Shield TV and Nexus Player — once installed, the top row displays applications that you’ve pinned, and as you scroll down, you’ll see installed applications organized into categories like Video and Music.
Leanback Launcher Features
– Can open Bluetooth and WiFi settings without the stock launcher installed.
– Opens notification center, notification settings, and displays the current amount of unread notifications.
– Can display Amazon-downloaded apps in the store for easy updating and management.
– Can open individual app’s settings.
– Favorites row
– Stripped of all Google services (to prevent crashes!)
Navigation is simple enough. The menu button on the Fire TV remote opes an app menu, and the [+] tile in the favorites row can be used to add apps to your favorites row.
To install Leanback Launcher on an Amazon Fire TV device, you’ll need to have a PC with ADB handy.
Use the command adb install [path] (replace “[path]” with the location of the target Fire TV device on your network).
The next step is optional, but if want the launcher’s notification counter to work, you’ll need to execute this command: adb shell pm grant com.rockon999.android.leanbacklauncher android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS.
You have the option of disabling the stock launcher if you’re on Fire OS version 5.2.6 or lower. You’ll want to disable the over-the-air update feature so it doesn’t overwrite your newly installed launcher.
The developer recommends that you install LauncherHijack v3 for a fully functional home button.
Next up, you’ll need to install Google Search version 2.x or newer if you want search functionality up and running. Be forewarned that if try to use the “microphone” orb in the launcher to interact with Google Search, it might crash — use the keyboard orb instead.
Leanback Launcher isn’t perfect. A few niggling issues include the notification counter, which doesn’t always work properly. And you’ll sometimes have to restart the app for the WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission to take effect, the developer notes. Still, a completely functional Android TV launcher on Fire TV devices is quite an achievement — and a boon for couch potatoes.

Back during Google I/O 2016, Google introduced the “Save to Android Pay API” which would allow companies to digitize their loyalty programs, gift cards, or other offers.
Companies were now able to add special links to text messages, e-mails, their website, or their Android app that would quickly save a new card to Android Pay in a single tap. These would typically show up as a “Save to Android Pay” button and made use of deep linking to the Android Pay app. Now it appears that with Android Pay v1.14, linked offers will receive a few enhancements within the Android Pay application.
Android Pay Linked Offer Improvements
Currently within Android Pay, your cards are all displayed in a large card carousel. Your loyalty cards are indicated as such in the card name, but as for any loyalty cards you add via the “Save to Android Pay” button, it can be a hassle sifting through any cards you have.
Fortunately, it looks like Google will be making some enhancements to make it easier to view all of your linked offers.

From the strings pulled above from the latest Android Pay APK, we can see that Linked Offers may soon be viewed in their own separate list. In addition, there may be a new indication as to how much money you are saving by having access to all of these offers. This isn’t a major change by any means, but it is certainly a nice addition if you frequently use Android Pay to save loyalty cards.
We can see further evidence for this change in the AndroidManifest.xml file, which adds a new activity filter to quickly open up Android Pay to a new list activity showing all of your Linked Offers.
<activity android:name="com.google.commerce.tapandpay.android.valuable.verticals.loyaltycard.LinkedOffersListActivity" android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar"/>
Within the APK’s layout files, we can see this new list being implemented from the addition of three new aptly named XML files: linked_offer_list_item.xml, linked_offers_list.xml, and linked_offer_preview.xml.

A new asset has been added as well (quantum_ic_add_circle_outline_googblue_24.png) which presumably will act as the button to allow you to add another linked offer straight from this new list activity.

A few years ago, smartphone companies began working on a trending new technology that would let people use their smartphone to pay at compatible credit card terminals. This went from Apple Pay for iOS customers, then Android Pay (which was renamed to Google Pay), but all of these banking and retail companies saw there was money to be made with it. We started seeing more platforms fragmenting the ecosystem from LG Pay to Walmart Pay and even JPMorgan Chase thought Chase Pay was a good idea. Some of these do give rewards and they can be beneficial to for those who are loyal to certain companies. Today, Samsung has announced that Chase Pay customers with a Samsung device and Samsung Pay will be able to link their accounts.
Samsung may not have been the first mobile payment service on the market, but they had a major advantage over the competition. Most mobile payment services rely on NFC technology to complete the transaction from the phone to the credit card terminal. Mobile payment services that rely on NFC come at a major disadvantage since (at that time) 90% of the credit card terminals didn’t support the technology. However, back in 2015, Samsung acquired a company called LoopPay and instantly became a strong rival to Apple Pay.
LoopPay was able utilize the MST technology that the majority of credit card terminals already supported. So you can pay with your phone at basically any terminal. The South Korean conglomerate went all in with this new acquisition by expanding it to multiple markets all across the world. The success of this new feature took off with multiple other retailers and banking services partnering with Samsung to increase their customers’ usage. The list of credit unions, banks, and gift card merchants have grown so large that the company has a dedicated landing page for you to see who supports it.
JPMorgan Chase held off for so long and kept refusing to support Samsung Pay and instead created Chase Pay as one of their competitors. Naturally, this didn’t work out as they had hoped, so today both companies have announced those who are using Chase Pay can now link it directly to Samsung Pay. Less fragmentation is always a win for consumers.
Source: SamsungRealme’s new V series of 5G smartphones is coming to Europe
Realme kicked off 2020 with the launch of its first 5G-enabled smartphone — the Realme X50 5G. The device was shortly followed by the company’s first flagship 5G smartphone — the Realme X50 Pro 5G — which featured Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 chip. Soon thereafter, the company launched the Realme X50m 5G — a slightly more affordable version of the Realme X50 5G. In a bid to make 5G devices more affordable and well within the reach of average buyers, the company debuted a new V series of 5G smartphones in China yesterday. As part of the new series, the company launched the Realme V5 — a MediaTek Dimensity 720 powered 5G device which is priced starting at CNY 1,499 (~$215).

The device is being offered in two RAM/storage variants, with the base 6GB/128GB model priced at CNY 1,499 (~$215) and the 8GB/128GB model priced at CNY 1,899 (~$270).
While the new Realme V5 is yet to go on sale in China, the company has now revealed that it will soon be making its way to the European market. According to a recent statement from a Realme spokesperson, the Realme V series (the V5 in particular) will soon be launched in most overseas markets where the company currently operates in, including Europe. This news is in line with recent reports which suggested that phones with MediaTek’s Dimensity chips will start shipping on overseas devices later this year.Google Messages app tests categorizing your conversations to reduce text message clutter
Google is testing a long-awaited feature in its popular Messages app. The feature, which our tipster Hani Mohamed Bioud first discovered, adds categories at the top of the app, allowing users to better organize their messages.
From what we can tell, the categories that are being tested in the Google Messages app include: All, Personal, Transactions, OTP, Offers, and More. There are other apps like Microsoft’s SMS Organizer that can do this already, but it’s nice to see this feature integrated into Google’s Messages app.
While we were able to manually surface the categories at the top, we weren’t able to get it working completely. Conversations weren’t moved to any of the categories automatically, and we are unable to manually move a conversation into one of the tabs. When the feature is functional, we expect Messages to automatically categorize conversations, much like Gmail does for email.
The hope is to seemingly provide users with a more organized experience, thus making it easier to carry on conversations. Having a filter for one-time passwords (OTP) is particularly nice, because those can clutter up a messaging app quick. Speaking of which, we recently spotted evidence in the Messages app that Google will allow users to automatically delete OTPs after 24 hours.
From what we can tell, it doesn’t look like the categories are available to users just yet, either via an update or a server-side flag, and it’s unclear when it’ll be available to test out by a wider audience. But since we were able to surface its UI, it’s possible the rollout is just around the corner. Once it goes live to everyone, we’ll be sure to let you know, along with any changes we find.SmartTubeNext is a YouTube client for Android TV with additional playback features
Android TV doesn’t have nearly the same selection of apps as Android for smartphones, so it’s always nice to see developers support the growing TV platform. If you watch a lot of YouTube on your smart TV and want more viewing options, check out SmartTubeNext, an unofficial, open-source YouTube client for Android TV. The app features a more modern UI to match the look of Android TV and offers some great playback features.
SmartTubeNext is available for Android 4.3 and above but is primarily aimed at Android TV devices. The app, of course, functions as a typical YouTube client, with the ability to like, dislike, subscribe to channels, and see an animated preview of videos.
Here are some of the features the current version of SmartTubeNext offers:
- Browse news, games and music
- Browse subscriptions, history and playlists
- Play videos
- Like, dislike or subscribe to channels
- Search for videos
- View subscribed channel content
- Change various settings for the video player
- Animated previews for videos
- Android TV channels and search support
In a discussion thread on Reddit, SmartTubeNext users seem pleased with the progress that’s been made so far. One of the features users are most excited by, it seems, is playback speed control. However, some features are still missing, like support for multiple accounts. The app is in beta, though, and it sounds like new features are constantly being introduced to address grievances.
If you’re tired of YouTube’s own app, SmartTubeNext looks like a nice alternative with some cool features. You can keep track of the app’s progress and GitHub, and grab the APK while you’re at it. You can push the APK to your device over ADB or use an app like Downloader.[Update 1: Indian Pricing] Here are all the Echo and Alexa announcements Amazon made today
Amazon’s ecosystem has become amazingly powerful as of the past few years, and the company, which used to be a simple online retailer, is now fiercely competing toe-to-toe with Google in the AI market space. Amazon’s Echo line of AI smart home devices, which compete with Google’s Google Home line, is considerably more successful than its competitors in the same marketplace. And all of these devices are powered by the Amazon Alexa assistant, which is a direct competitor to–you guessed it–Google Assistant.
Ahead of the Made by Google event, where Google is expected to launch new smart home products alongside the Pixel 4/Pixel 4 XL, Amazon held a hardware event of its own. The company announced renewed Echo devices and a lot more. The company is focused on bringing their AI to most aspects of your life, and with its newest hardware, they’re trying to make your life a lot easier.
Among these, there is a new model of the Echo Dot. Amazon isn’t exactly calling this one a second-generation Dot, as it is pretty much the same as the regular Echo Dot, just adding an LED display which can display the clock, alarms, and more, allowing you to check the time without asking Alexa for it. The unsurprisingly named “Echo Dot with Clock” will retail at $59.99.
There is also an even smaller Echo Flex, which is the smallest Echo speaker yet. It plugs directly into a wall outlet and can be combined with other accessories. The Echo Flex will retail at $24.99 and accessories will go for $15.
Of course, Amazon is also renewing its regular Echo, improving, this time, on the speaker quality. The third generation of the Echo has an all-new, improved sound system which sounds stronger and clearer, sporting the same audio architecture as the Echo Plus, all while keeping the same $99.99 price tag as the previous model.
There is also an Echo Studio, which serves as the first high-end, premium smart speaker from Amazon and sports Dolby Atmos’ 3D audio surround sound as well as built-in Alexa microphones to calibrate the Echo Studio to any room you put it into. The Echo Studio will retail at a heftier $199.99 price tag and it’s now available for preorder.
Amazon is also launching their own set of wireless earbuds called the Echo Buds, which will be powered by Alexa and will allow you to use voice commands on-the-go, hands-free. They’re now available for preorder at $129.99. Additionally, the company is now launching an 8-inch version of the Echo Show–their smart display offering–called the Echo Show 8, which will serve as a middle option between the 5-inch Echo Show and the 10-inch Echo Show. This one will retail for $129.99 and will complement the other two Echo Show options, which will retain their same price tag.
There is also a number of, shall we call them, “weirder” devices that Amazon is launching under the Echo branding and putting Alexa in the back seat of all of them. Among these, we can find the Echo Loop, which is a smart ring that nudges you with vibrations, as well as Echo Frames, which are, you guessed it, glasses frames powered by Alexa. There is also an Amazon Smart Oven, which succeeds last year’s Alexa powered microwave and it’s capable of microwaving, convection cooking, air frying, and more. And of course, it has Alexa.
- Amazon Echo Glow ($29.99)
- Amazon eero (from $99)
- Ring Alarm Retrofit Kit (from $199)
- Ring Stick Up cam ($99.99)
- Ring Indoor cam ($59.99)
- Amazon Smart Oven ($249.99)
- Amazon Echo Frames ($179.99)
- Amazon Echo Loop ($129.99)
Of course, all of these new Echo devices can’t be complete without updates to the underlying AI system behind all of them, Amazon Alexa. Alexa is getting a slew of new features and improvements in order to try to make it more conversational. It’s getting a multilingual mode, which allows it to speak multiple languages at the same time–Spanish and English in the case of the U.S, French, and English in the case of Canada, and Hindi and English in the case of India.
Alexa will also be able to detect frustration: if you get frustrated with Alexa getting something wrong, it will be able to adjust its tone accordingly. Lastly, Alexa is also getting a number of celebrity voices for its text-to-speech engine, starting with Samuel L. Jackson’s voice. These celebrity voices will have a price tag starting at $0.99 this year.
Phew. What do you think about Amazon’s new offerings?

Update 1: Indian pricing and availability of new Amazon Echo products
Amazon has announced that some of the newly launched products will also be made available in India.
The Amazon Echo 3rd Generation will be available for a price of ₹9,999 ($140); the Echo Studio will be available for a price of ₹22,999 ($325); while the Echo Dot with clock will be available for a price of ₹5,499 ($78). The devices are available for pre-order on Amazon.in and select offline stores, with shipping expected to begin later this year. Customers who pre-order can avail of a smart bulb for free and a smart plug for ₹199.OnePlus Issues OxygenOS 4.5.6 Hotfix Update to Fix Reboot When Calling 911
We use our phones for a lot of things, and every once in a while, we use our phones as, well, phones. Most people probably hope they’re never in a situation where they need to call an emergency number, but if you ever are, you’d expect your phone to call it without any issues.
Yesterday, a user on Reddit reported that when trying to call 911 on his OnePlus 5, the phone would start to make the call but then begin to reboot itself. Shortly after this initial report was made, several other users commented on the original Reddit post to say that they were experiencing similar issues.
The issue also gained traction on the Android subreddit, where other users chimed in claiming the same issue on other devices as well. Reported devices ranged from the Verizon Galaxy S7 Edge to the Motorola G5. To complicate matters, the issue could not be consistently replicated on most devices, including on the OnePlus 5. So mileage varied by a large margin, which should never be the case with something as important as an emergency call.
9to5Google reached out to OnePlus specifically, following all of this, and the company responded by saying that it has “been in touch with the customer and have tested a software update that has resolved the issue.” It is suspected that the reboot issue is a result of the OnePlus 5 sending your location information when calling either 911 in the US or 999 in the UK, but OnePlus has yet to confirm whether or not this is the case. Speculation in the Android subreddit points to this being an issue in AOSP itself because of its random occurrence across devices, but OnePlus seems to be the only one who is pushing out an update to fix this, or that has publicly addressed the issue for that matter.
OnePlus has begun rolling out a hotfix update for the OnePlus 5. The OxygenOS 4.5.6 hotfix update specifically targets the 911-reboot issue and users so far have been reporting success on the patch on the OnePlus 5. Nonetheless, with how randomly the problem has been occurring in other devices, one can only hope to never run into this issue especially at a time where you really need your phone to function.
We hope other OEMs also acknowledge the existence of this issue (if reports we’ve seen so far are valid) and work towards rolling out a fix at the earliest keeping in mind its rather serious nature.

Huawei launched its flagship Huawei P40 series earlier this year in March. The devices launched with the company’s custom Android skin — EMUI 10 — based on Android 10. However, due to the trade ban imposed on the company by the U.S. government, the smartphones shipped with Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) and the Huawei AppGallery instead of Google Mobile Services and the Google Play Store. As an alternative to the Google Assistant, Huawei also announced its own Celia voice assistant at the launch but the devices did not ship with the new voice assistant when they initially went on sale.
Now, it seems like the Celia assistant will soon be added to the Huawei P40 series as the latest EMUI 10.1.0.121 update has started rolling out globally and it includes a new “Huawei Assistant” top-level setting with references to Celia. Currently, all of the options in this “Huawei Assistant” settings page go to existing settings for features like HiVision. But we believe a future update should bring support for the Celia voice assistant. The update, which weighs in at 1.14GB, also includes improvements for the camera and display, along with the Android security patches for April 2020.
For the unaware, the Celia voice assistant can be summoned with the command “Hey Celia”, or by holding the power button for a second. Celia can help you with regular daily tasks, such as initiating phone calls and texts, setting up calendar appointments and reminders, start voice recording, translate sentences, play music, videos, toggle device settings and flashlight, and of course, search for information such as sports, weather, and more. Celia is also compatible with HiVision AI Lens and AI touch-shopping. At the Huawei P40 series launch, the company had revealed that Celia would be released in the UK, France, Spain, Chile, Mexico, and Columbia with support for three languages, including English (UK), French, and Spanish. To learn more about Huawei’s Celia voice assistant and its features, you can visit the official product page by following this link.
It’s also worth noting that the Celia voice assistant will be rolled out to more Huawei and Honor devices with the EMUI 10.1 update. As per the EMUI 10.1 update roadmap shared by the company earlier this year, users should start receiving the update on supported devices in the following months.Google Announces Collaboration with PayPal for Android Pay Support
Android Pay as a means of quick, cardless, and cashless payment faces heavy competition from the likes of Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. So it comes as no surprise that all of the competitors in the mobile payments space continue looking for more ways to one up their competitors.
Google is doing just that with its latest strategic collaboration with PayPal, the popular online payments system. The partnership enables PayPal to be used as an option at checkout in Android Pay.
PayPal is one of the world’s leading online payment platforms, and one that many of us use for transferring money internationally. Google has recognized PayPal’s importance in a world that can be better defined as a ‘global village’, and adding in PayPal as an option makes it very convenient for lots of existing users to tap and pay with their phones. Users can also utilize PayPal to checkout in Android apps that support Android Pay.
At launch, this feature will be available for users in the U.S.A., but Google is silent on when this functionality will roll out to other Android Pay-supported regions. Users in the U.S.A. can simply link their PayPal account to use with Android Pay once the feature starts going live. Google mentions that the new feature will be made available in the Android Pay and PayPal apps ‘within the next few weeks’. Theoretically, this means that you may be able to use any bank or credit card to make payments with Android Pay if you’ve linked your accounts with PayPal.

Source: GoogleUnofficial LineageOS 14.1 brings Android 7.1 Nougat to the 7th gen Amazon Fire HD 10
The beauty of the XDA development community is how passionate it can be. We are constantly impressed by some of the feats pulled off by developers in our community, allowing users to break free from the burdens imposed by some OEMs to make their device truly theirs. Amazon has become one of the most restrictive OEMs in this regard. Their Fire devices don’t really run Android in the traditional sense, rather, their devices run Amazon’s heavily customized Fire OS. It might be based on Android, but it barely resembles it. The OS in the 7th gen Amazon Fire HD 10 is actually based on Android 5.1 Lollipop, which is a very old version of Android that’s starting to become deprecated by some developers.
If you have one of these tablets, all hope isn’t lost: a developer has managed to put together an unofficial LineageOS 14.1 build based on Android 7.1 Nougat. Now granted, this is still a very old version of Android, with Android 7.1 having been released around late 2016 to early 2017. Nonetheless, this is still a very impressive development. Not only is the tablet stuck on Lollipop, but the low-end MediaTek MT8173 on it isn’t exactly developer-friendly at all. The software in this tablet predates the Project Treble times by several years, so you can’t just flash a GSI on it.
Being able to run Android Nougat on the tablet should open a lot of doors for Fire HD 10 users. There are a number of bugs to take note of such as a nonfunctional camera and issues with wired headphones and OMX. Still, if you want to try out the build for the Fire HD 10, you can head over to the XDA thread linked below to find the instructions and download links. You’ll need to unlock the bootloader first, and we have instructions for how to do that here.
Unofficial LineageOS 14.1 for the 7th gen. Amazon Fire HD 10Google will now automatically delete Web & App activity, Location history, and YouTube search history for new users
Whether it’s fair or not, Google has a reputation for collecting a lot of data about people. To its credit, Google has been making improvements in how it lets users control their privacy. Today, CEO Sundar Pichai announced some changes in how the company handles data for new users.
Pichai announced several privacy improvements to help users better control the data they’re sharing. Google logs Search history, YouTube history, location history, and voice commands through Google Assistant on the My Activity page. Last year, the company made it possible to have this data automatically deleted every 3 months or 18 months. Now, that feature will be enabled by default for new users.
New Google users will have their search history, location history (which is already off by default), and voice commands automatically deleted every 18 months by default. The user doesn’t have to do anything to make this happen. YouTube search history will be set to delete after 3 years to ensure it can “continue to make relevant entertainment recommendations.”
Existing Google accounts won’t have this enabled by default, though the company will begin promoting the option more prevalently on those services. You can adjust the frequency on the Activity controls page (scroll down for the YouTube section).
The company will also be making it easier to check in on your Account controls more easily. Users will be able to simply do a search for “Google Privacy Checkup” and “Is my Google Account secure?” to see a box with your privacy and security settings. And to browse more privately, Incognito Mode will be accessible by simply long-pressing your profile picture in Google Search, Maps, and YouTube.
Data is very valuable to Google’s ad network business, so it’s nice to see the company make some compromises. Obviously, a user’s recent data is the most useful for targeted ads, but it’s still great to be able to scrub older data from your account.
Source: GoogleGoogle accidentally rolls out “Personal Safety” app, confirming car crash detection is coming to the Pixel
Back in May, we discovered changes to the Emergency Information app that hinted at Google adding automatic car crash detection to Pixel smartphones. We haven’t heard any new information about this feature since then, and it hasn’t appeared in any of the numerous Pixel 4 leaks this past month. However, Google updated the built-in Emergency Information app on my Pixel 2 XL today, rebranding it in version 1.0.271601625.release as “Personal Safety.” The Play Store’s app description confirms that car crash detection will be made available for Pixel devices in the United States, though it’s unclear if it’ll be made available for all Pixel devices or only the Pixel 4 series.
Here’s the updated description on Google Play:
Google says that your phone will automatically dial 911 if it detects you’re in a car crash, using your location and sensor readings from the accelerometer and microphone to detect when a car crash has occurred. When your phone thinks you’re in a car crash, it’ll vibrate and play a sound at maximum volume, asking you if you need help. If you don’t respond, Pixel will automatically dial 911 and provide your location. Here’s the demo provided in the app that shows you the steps involved to call 911 or report that you’re okay:
Another new feature mentioned in the changelog is the ability to quickly share your emergency status with your contacts. You can send your location and a custom message about your current situation to multiple contacts.
I downloaded the update on my Pixel 2 XL, but I don’t see the car crash detection or emergency status sharing feature shown in the screenshots submitted to the Play Store. I also don’t see an announcement on the official Google blog, but it’s possible that Google is preparing an announcement shortly. So far, I’m the only person to have received this update, possibly due to the numerous tweaks I’ve made to my device, which leads me to believe that this is an intended feature for the Pixel 4.
Apart from that, I did notice that the app has been slightly redesigned and now includes settings to show or hide your emergency info from the lock screen. Here are some screenshots:

Google recently announced another U.S.-only emergency feature that lets you send important information to emergency responders without having to actually talk. We’re hoping the company makes these features available for Pixel owners in other countries, but Google is known to take its time in rolling out features globally.
You can download the latest version of the app from the Play Store link below. We’ll update this article if we learn more about the rollout of these new features, but do let us know if you see any of these new features on your own Pixel device.

Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen plenty of leaks and teasers about the upcoming OnePlus 8T. While the company has just dropped a few tidbits about the device, leaked renders and a premature retail listing have already revealed almost everything there is to know about the next-gen flagship. On top of that, we’ve also managed to get our hands on the OnePlus 8T’s static wallpapers. Now, just days ahead of the launch event, XDA Recognized Contributor linuxct has managed to extract OnePlus 8T’s live wallpapers from an OxygenOS 11 build.
As you can see in the attached tweets, the new OnePlus 8T live wallpapers follow the same design language as the static wallpapers we shared earlier. There are three live wallpapers in total, including one OxygenOS 11 wallpaper that we shared earlier and two new OnePlus 8T live wallpapers. All the wallpapers offer a rotation effect when you scroll through pages on your homescreen and a cool animation when you unlock your device. Additionally, the wallpapers feature dynamic colors that change based on the time of day.
Now with the new ones, this is Aquamarine Green! pic.twitter.com/AZoSugzWdk

The OnePlus 8T live wallpapers have been tested on a Sony Xperia XZ Premium running Android 9.0 Pie at a forced 4K resolution, and they work as intended. The wallpapers should work on all devices running Android 8.0 Oreo or above. However, they may not perform well on all devices as they’re rendered using OpenGL. In case your device offers good OpenGL performance, the wallpapers should look as fluid as they would on a OnePlus 8T.
And now, this is Lunar Silver 🌚 pic.twitter.com/bVxJeyXAbk

If you’re interested in trying the OnePlus 8T live wallpapers on your device, you can grab the APK from the APKMirror link below. To use the wallpapers, you’ll first need to install the APK on your device. Once that’s done, you should be able to select them from your device’s stock wallpaper picker. In case you’re not able to do that, you can download the Google Wallpapers app from the Play Store to apply the wallpapers.
OnePlus 8T Live Wallpaper Port — XDA Forum Thread || Download OnePlus 8T Live WallpapersGoogle Assistant prepares to let you pay for gas from your phone
Remember CES? It seems like the world’s biggest tech event happened ages ago, so it’s easy to forget that so many new products and services were announced there. Take, for example, Amazon’s new “Pay for Gas” service for Alexa. The feature lets drivers ask Alexa to handle fuel payments at over 11,000 gas stations across the U.S. All you have to do is pull up to the pump, launch Alexa, say “pay for gas”, and then follow the directions to activate the pump to refuel your car. Based on code within the latest version of the Google App — version 11.33.5.29 to be precise — it looks like Google is preparing to add a similar feature to Google Assistant.
In the latest version of the Google App, there’s a new string titled “aa_pay_for_gas_query.” This is one of those hardcoded queries that the Google Assistant can recognize, alongside several others such as one to play calming sounds.
<string name="aa_pay_for_gas_query">Pay for gas.</string>
Digging deeper into the APK, we spotted evidence that this new feature can be launched in another way: through the At A Glance widget on the launcher. When you arrive at a gas station, the At A Glance widget will be updated to say “At [station name].” Tapping the widget will send an intent to view https://pay.google.com/gas/payment (likely to be recognized by the Google Pay app) with several URI parameters, including the brand and store ID. Presumably, this means you’ll be able to pay for gas with the Google Assistant at multiple different gas station chains. Amazon Alexa, for example, lets you pay at over 11,500 locations from Exxon and Mobil.
There’s not much code within the Google App detailing this feature, and we haven’t been able to activate it ourselves yet. That means you should take this news with a grain of salt, but given that Amazon has already rolled out a similar feature for Alexa, it makes perfect sense for Google to follow suit with Assistant.Big Changes To XDA Forums are Coming Soon
Today we have some news to share: over the coming weeks, we will be launching a ground-up forum redesign, which we’re calling XDA 2020. We’ve outgrown vBulletin (which was never designed to handle a community our size) and are moving to XenForo, a more modern platform that powers some of the biggest and best forum communities that you might already be a part of. While it’s difficult to pick an exact date for such a large project, we’re currently targeting mid-October 2020 to make this change and we’ll communicate more specifics as we get closer to the date.
While we’ll be gaining a lot with XenForo, including a new forum design with multiple templates from which to choose (two dark modes, two light modes, and even a “classic” template that is similar to the look of the forum today) and overall much better performance, there are a handful of XDA features and products that we’ll be sunsetting. Doing so ensures we can confidently take a step into the future and make a break with some of the more resource-intense features of the past that our small technical team is unable to support. Some of these features you may not have heard of, which is fine; many of them launched without fanfare and aren’t used much.
- All DevDB threads will revert to regular threads. DevDB Downloads will be removed, and we are significantly increasing the max file size for the attachment system on Xenforo. Any files uploaded via DevDB should be downloaded as they will be removed by 12/31/2020. To help ease the transition, we’re working on a mechanism to contact developers that have files on DevDB to provide download links and suggestions on hosting files elsewhere.
- Real Life Review will be imported and flattened with no interactivity for now. We have some exciting future plans for reviews in the community that we’ll share a later date.
- Our current search system, powered by Algolia, will be replaced by Threadloom, which is built for forums, and in our view gives a better search experience.
- The main XDA app on the Play store will undergo a major update in the coming weeks to work with the new forum backend. Support for XDA Labs is tentatively ending at the end of this year, but we’re exploring options to keep it going, because we know that a small handful of developers use Labs to distribute their app. We’re hoping to open source and find a team to take the reins and continue development, and if you’re a developer that wants to work on Labs, send a PM to svetius. We’d be delighted if Labs could continue, but as a small technical team and we don’t have the resources to maintain it. Over the coming weeks we will be taking steps to inform any developer that is actively using Labs about this change so they can plan accordingly.
- All Tapatalk integrations (our legacy app for older versions of Android & integration into the main Tapatalk app) will cease to work. We recommend any Tapatalk users download the new XDA forum app once it’s available.
- Authentication for Swappa, Xposed, etc will no longer work, but we plan to reintroduce XDA authentication shortly.
- Our Forum API will be migrated to the XenForo built-in API
Attached to this post you’ll find a handful of screenshots that should give you a good sense of what XDA 2020 will look like, though they’re subject to change as we continue to refine the look and feel of the new templates. Undoubtedly, the migration won’t be perfect as it involves many moving parts. We expect 6-12 hours of downtime when we make the move, during which time we will have the forum in “read only” mode for as long as possible.
We ask for your patience and understanding as we make this big change. Once launched, we will make a feedback thread for issues, bugs, and comments.
We will follow-up once we have a confirmed launch date, and as always, thanks for all of your support.

T-Mobile, in particular, has aggressively upgraded its...AT&T expands its 5G network to 22 new cities and introduces mmWave 5G+ in some markets
2020 is the year when 5G will become more of a reality for most people. The major US carriers are all boasting about their 5G networks, but not all of these networks are the same in terms of coverage and performance. AT&T tried to hop on the bandwagon before everyone else with their fake “5Ge,” but they also rolled out real 5G in the form of sub-6GHz connectivity last year. This week, AT&T is expanding its sub-6GHz 5G network and is finally making its mmWave network available to consumers.
5G on mmWave frequencies is the fastest offering, but it has pretty severe range limitations. This is the same 5G technology that Verizon is using, and it requires customers to be in very specific locations to connect to it. But when you can get it, AT&T promises speeds up to 2Gbps. Only the Galaxy S20+ and Galaxy S20 Ultra support mmWave on AT&T and not the carrier’s variant of the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G. The company’s mmWave network, which they are calling “5G+,” is available in 35 cities.
Last month, AT&T expanded its coverage of sub-6GHz 5G to more cities. This week, they are adding 22 more markets to the list, bringing the total number up to 80. Those markets include:
Albany, Ga.; Albany, N.Y.; Athens, Ga.; Beaverhead County, Mont.; Binghamton, N.Y.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Denver, Colo.; Hamilton, Ohio; Lancaster, Pa.; Lincoln County, Mont.; Madera County, Calif.; Madison County, Va.; Mono County, Calif.; Provo, Utah; Raleigh County, W. Va; Ross County, Ohio; Santa Rosa, Calif.; Springfield, Ohio; State College, Pa.; Sussex County, N.J. and Worcester, Mass.

Many months ago, we talked about an unofficial Citra port which allowed you to play Nintendo 3DS games on your Android smartphone. While that specific build saw few updates, there’s a new build that just got released by the developer of Dolphin MMJ, and it runs a whole lot better than before. On high-end devices, games like Pokemon X/Y and Persona Q are very playable, with very few visual bugs and minimal lag. It’s obviously not perfect yet, but it’s certainly on its way. I ran some tests to see what games work and don’t work, and the results may surprise you. To use the Citra for Android emulator, you will need a smartphone with top of the line specifications at the moment. A Snapdragon 855 is basically a requirement to even get playable framerates.
Citra for Android is still unofficial
So, first things first, this is still an unofficial port. It’s not officially endorsed by the developers of Citra, and until recently, was actually plagued with ethical concerns over its violation of the GPL. That has been rectified since its published source code to GitHub, but it’s something to keep in mind as well to the legitimacy of it all. It works, but if you’d rather wait for an official release from the Citra developers (which has apparently been in the works for a long time now) then you can wait for that. If you want to start using it now though, it’s extremely simple to use and navigate. There are a lot more features than that older port allowed as well, including actually useful features such as internal resolution scaling, emulation regions, and more. You can check out the screenshots below to see all of that.
Fire Emblem: Awakening
This title was the first that our Editor-in-Chief, Mishaal Rahman, tested on Citra. He tested it on the ASUS ROG Phone II which launched just recently, with the game more or less completely playable. Some parts may suffer frustrating slowdowns, but for a first port, it’s nothing short of amazing. Fire Emblem: Awakening probably fared the best in our tests, as its problems were kept to a minimum. You can check out the video of which Mishaal recorded down below to get a feel for how the game runs on the ASUS ROG Phone II.
Animal Crossing: New Leaf
One of my favorite titles from the Nintendo 3DS, I was excited at the prospect of playing this game on my smartphone. Sadly it wasn’t meant to be, as the frame rates are basically unplayable. It runs at 50% speed most of the time when in the overworld, and even lags quite a bit during the opening intro sequence with Rover. It runs well though, and if you can bear the horrible framerates, it does appear to be functional. I’m super excited for the future of this title in particular, as playing it on a smartphone would be incredible. It’s worth noting that the screen flashing is because of the screen recorder, as disabling it also stops the flickering. This happens on both the OPPO Reno 10x Zoom and the OnePlus 7 Pro, though Mishaal Rahman didn’t see it happen on the ASUS ROG Phone II.
Pokemon X
One of the best-selling titles from the Nintendo 3DS, fans of the Pokemon series will be clamoring to see if it runs on Android. I’ve seen people using emulators solely to play Pokemon games, so I would be surprised if people were any different with Pokemon X. Just like other Pokemon games, Pokemon X is one of the least intensive games on the system, and runs surprisingly well. Again, the flickering appears to be caused by my screen recorder as it goes away once I stop the recording. It’s a surprisingly playable game, though it’s worth mentioning that there’s no music yet due to the audio’s file format. The game also allows you to actually complete the intro sequence, a problem which plagued the last Citra for Android port that we tested a few months back.
How to download Citra for Android
You can download Citra for Android from Github, but keep in mind it’s certainly not in its best state yet. It has a number of issues and the performance is poor in most games, though it might be worth checking out anyway! You can download it below. Note that Citra can only play decrypted files with the “.cci” file extension, which you can get by decrypting the games using your hacked Nintendo 3DS. If you decrypt your games to a .3ds file format, you can just rename it to .cci.
Citra for Nintendo 3DSEarlier today, Xiaomi announced the Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro. These are the company's latest flagship devices with high-end specifications such as the Snapdragon 865 SoC, 108MP cameras, and 90Hz displays. The company also announced a more affordable phone, the Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite 5G. Let's take a look at what this device has...Chainfire’s Systemless Root for Pixel Phones is Coming
We all knew it was coming. It’s basically tradition that within days of Google releasing a new device, XDA Senior Recognized Developer Chainfire finds a working root method. In keeping with that tradition, earlier today Chainfire demonstrated he had achieved root access on his Pixel phone with a picture of ADB shell requesting superuser access. The news understandably brought much excitement to fans of the Google Pixel phones, but Chainfire quickly clarified that the method he used to achieve root access required modifying /system and disabling dm-verity.
Frequent readers of our Portal might recall that we wrote an article explaining the possible difficulties with rooting the Pixel phones, and it seems we were right on some fronts: Chainfire initially confirmed that disabling dm-verity would be problematic, and for a while he thought it would be impossible to disable dm-verity without changes to the kernel. But eventually he found a way to disable dm-verity, as usual, and within a day of poking around he achieved full systemless root by modifying the boot image:
Victory is mine! Full systemless root achieved. Boot image mods only, /system fully intact, dm-verity switchable. #pixel
— Chainfire XDA (@ChainfireXDA) 27 October 2016
This is exciting news for all Pixel owners, as systemless root has become the most common way of rooting devices since Android Marshmallow and now Google’s latest phone can enjoy the benefits of root access, without the need for altering the kernel. Chainfire has once again worked around Google’s changes to Android in order to bring root access to millions in the Android community, but the method is not ready for release yet. Chainfire says it’ll take a few days to automate the process, clean up his work, and package it into a flashable zip, so please wait patiently for the release!
Keep in mind that to even attempt to root your device requires you to unlock the bootloader, which will cause SafetyNet to fail, so don’t expect to play Pokemon Go or use Android Pay on your Pixel. Even with SultanXDA’s temporary SafetyNet bypass patch, it’s only a matter of time until Google updates SafetyNet to fix this loophole. Still, we were worried that disabling dm-verity would require modifying the kernel, but Chainfire proved us wrong. We can only hope that the ingenious developers on our forums can continue finding workarounds should the need arise, but at this point it’s basically a game of whack-a-mole between developers and Google.

Samsung kicked off the One UI 3.0 developer beta program for the Galaxy S20 series back in August. Later on, the company started offering public beta builds of its Android 11-based custom software to Galaxy S20 users in South Korea, the United States, Germany, and earlier today, the UK. While the stable version of the update has yet to land on any of these devices, the company is now recruiting testers in the U.S. for the One UI 3.0 public beta program for the Galaxy Note 20 and the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Forums ||| Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Forums
Today, a Community Manager for Samsung announced the One UI 3.0 beta registration on Samsung’s community forums. While the announcement does not highlight any of the new features and improvements that will be included in the update, we expect the build won’t be too different from the one that’s already available for the Galaxy S20 series. If you have the Galaxy Note 20 or Galaxy Note 20 Ultra on Sprint, T-Mobile, or unlocked through Samsung, you can register now for the beta by opening the Samsung Members app and then tapping on the banner up top.
The first One UI 3.0 public beta build, based on Android 11, is not yet rolling out for Samsung Galaxy Note 20 users in the U.S, but once it does roll out, we’ll let you know.
We expect the beta program to expand to other regions in the next couple of days.

After announcing Google Assistant‘s Driving Mode back at Google I/O 2019, Google seems to finally be rolling out the feature on Android. The new feature is supposed to serve as a replacement for the Android Auto app on smartphones.
Two weeks ago, a few users started to see a new navigation UI in the Google Maps app. Last week, we discovered evidence that tied the rollout of this new navigation UI to Google Assistant’s Driving Mode. Today, I found that the new navigation UI has been enabled on several of my devices, including the Google Pixel 4, the LG Velvet, and the ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro. The navigation UI that I’m seeing is the same one that a handful of users saw a few weeks ago, and I’ve discovered a new settings page that further corroborates that this new navigation UI is indeed part of Google Assistant’s driving mode.
As you can see in the screenshots embedded below, the “Google Assistant settings” item in the “Navigation settings” of Google Maps has been updated with the description “manage driving mode.” Previously, the description for this item said “Google Assistant settings”, and tapping this item merely opened the general settings page for Google Assistant. Now, tapping this item opens up a new driving mode settings page for Google Assistant. Strangely, though, toggling “driving mode” on this page doesn’t actually disable the new navigation UI for me, and I’m also unable to activate Google Assistant’s Driving Mode through a voice command. It’s possible that the feature has only partially rolled out for me, though.
The Google Assistant Driving Mode UI that was shown off at Google I/O 2019 looks very different compared to what has been rolling out for some users these last few weeks. It’s possible that Google is still running A/B tests for the UI, but it’s also possible that Google significantly changed the interface since it’s been over a year from the announcement. Here’s a screenshot gallery showing off the new UI:
The rollout of Google Assistant Driving Mode on my devices doesn’t seem to be tied to any particular version of Google Maps and the Google App. My LG Velvet is running Google Maps version 10.52.3 and Google App version 11.32.5.23, my Pixel 4 is running Google Maps version 10.52.3 and Google App version 11.31.9.29, and my ZenFone 7 Pro is running Google Maps version 10.52.2 and Google App version 11.32.5.23. All of these devices are signed into my primary Google Account, though, so I’m likely one of the lucky few to have received this feature as part of a server-side test.
You can download the latest version of Google Maps and the Google App from the Play Store links embedded below, though there’s no guarantee you’ll get this feature by updating your apps. Since this feature has started to appear on some devices in the last few weeks, we’re probably not far off from an official announcement.[Update 3: Clearer Toggle Language] Researchers accuse Xiaomi web browsers of collecting browsing data – even in Incognito mode
Xiaomi smartphones are unanimously agreed to be one of the best value purchases available in the market at any point in time. Packing some insane hardware at some very lucrative price points, especially at the lower end of the smartphone market, these phones make an offer that a lot of people just can’t refuse. Xiaomi has also been receptive to the needs of the developer community, with decisions such as allowing bootloader unlocking without sacrificing the manufacturer’s warranty — a combination that a lot of other popular OEMs discard, as well as vastly improving upon their kernel source releases. These reasons make them one of the most popular devices in our forums, and they have rightfully earned that spot of popularity.
However, recent reports from security researchers point towards a worrying privacy issue observed on Xiaomi’s web browsers. Forbes’ cybersecurity contributor and associate editor Thomas Brewster, along with cybersecurity researchers Gabriel Cirlig and Andrew Tierney recently concluded in a report that Xiaomi’s various web browsers were sending data to remote servers. They allege that the data being sent included a history of all websites visited, including the URLs, all search engine queries, and all the items viewed on Xiaomi’s news feed, along with device metadata. What’s even worrying about this data collection allegation is that this data is being collected even if you seemingly browse with “incognito mode” enabled.
This data collection seemingly occurs on the pre-installed stock browser on MIUI, as well as Mi Browser Pro and Mint Browser, both of which are available for download through the Google Play Store. Together, these browsers have over 15 million downloads on the Play Store, while the stock browser is preloaded on all Xiaomi devices. The devices tested include the Xiaomi Redmi Note 8, Xiaomi Mi A1, Xiaomi Mi 10, Xiaomi Redmi K20, and the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3. There wasn’t a distinction between Xiaomi’s Android One or MIUI devices, as the collection code was found in the default browser anyway. As such, this issue does not appear to be MIUI-centric but depends on whether you use any of these three browsers on your device, irrespective of the underlying OS. Other browsers, like Google Chrome and Apple Safari collect far less data, restricting themselves to usage and crash analytics.
Xiaomi responded by seemingly confirming that the browsing data it was collecting was fully compliant with local laws and regulations on user data privacy matters. The collected information was user-consented and anonymized. However, the company denied the claims in the research.
The research claims are untrue. Privacy and security is of top concern.
This video shows the collection of anonymous browsing data, which is one of the most common solutions adopted by internet companies to improve the overall browser product experience through analyzing non-personally identifiable information.
The researchers, however, found this claim of anonymity to be dubious. The data that Xiaomi was sending was admittedly “encrypted”, but it was encoded in base64, which can easily be decoded. Since the browsing data can be decoded in a rather trivial manner, and since the collected data also contained device metadata, this browsing data could seemingly be correlated to the actions by individual users without significant effort.
Further, the researchers found that the Xiaomi browsers were pinging domains related to Sensors Analytics, a Chinese startup also known as Sensors Data, known for providing behavioral analytics services. The browsers also contained an API called SensorDataAPI. Xiaomi is also listed as a customer on the Sensors Data website.
Xiaomi has responded to the report from Forbes with denial on several aspects:
While Sensors Analytics provides a data analysis solution for Xiaomi, the collected anonymous data are stored on Xiaomi’s own servers and will not be shared with Sensors Analytics, or any other third-party companies.
The researchers responded against Xiaomi’s denial with further proof of their data collection practice.

With the information available at hand, there does appear to be a worrying privacy issue in the way these browsers function. We’ve reached out to Xiaomi for further comment on these claims.

Update 1: Xiaomi Responds in Blog Post
In an official blog post on Mi.com, Xiaomi strongly denied the allegations that they were violating user privacy.
“Xiaomi was disappointed to read the recent article from Forbes. We feel they have misunderstood what we communicated regarding our data privacy principles and policy. Our user’s privacy and internet security is of top priority at Xiaomi; we are confident that we strictly follow and are fully compliant with local laws and regulations. We have reached out to Forbes to offer clarity on this unfortunate misinterpretation.”
The company confirms that they collect “aggregated usage statistics data,” which includes “system information, preferences, user interface feature usage, responsiveness, performance, memory usage, and crash reports.” They state that this information “cannot alone be used to identify any individual.” They confirm that URLs are collected, but that this is done to “identify web pages which load slowly” so they can figure out “how to best improve overall browsing performance.”
Next, the company states that individual browsing data history is synced, but that this is only done when “the user is signed on Mi Account…and the data sync function is set to ‘On’ under Settings.” They deny that browsing data, apart from the aforementioned aggregated usage statistics data, is being synced when the user has enabled incognito mode.
Xiaomi then published screenshots of code snippets from one of their browser apps (they did not specify which browser, though) that they claim demonstrate their points. The first code snippet, according to Xiaomi, shows a decompiled method for “how [they] create randomly generated unique tokens to append to aggregate usage statistics.” They state that “these tokens do not correspond to any individuals.” The next code snippet is seemingly from the browser’s source code and shows a method for “how the Mi Browser works under incognito mode, where no user browsing data will be synced.” The third code snippet demonstrates that the aggregated usage statistics that Xiaomi collects are “stored on Xiaomi’s domain” and aren’t passed to Sensor Analytics. Finally, the fourth image “shows that usage statistic data is transferred with HTTPS protocol of TLS 1.2 encryption.”
To cap it all off, Xiaomi then cites 4 certifications their software has received from TrustArc and British Standard Institution (BSI). These certifications include ISO27001:2013, ISO27018:2014, ISO29151:2017, and TRUSTe.
In response to this blog post, cybersecurity researcher Andrew Tierney took to Twitter to refute Xiaomi’s claims. He states that he and several others re-confirmed the findings across multiple devices—that there “is no doubt that the Mint Browser sends search terms and URLS whilst in Incognito mode.” He states that the code that Xiaomi published does not demonstrate that their “randomly generated unique tokens” can’t be correlated to individuals. The researchers note that the UUID seems to persist across browsing sessions and only changes when the browser is re-installed. Whether Xiaomi only stores the data on their own servers or elsewhere was not a point of contention for the researcher, too. In addition, the researcher states that Xiaomi wasn’t accused of sending the data to remote servers through insecure methods—Mr. Tierney notes that the issue at hand is the data itself that is being sent.
We’re glad to see Xiaomi address these allegations directly, but the explanation does not seem to satisfy the researchers at this point. We will keep an eye on this story for further developments.
Update 2: Xiaomi to offer opt-out option in next browser update
Xiaomi has updated its blog post to announce that the next update to Mint Browser and Mi Browser will include an option in incognito mode to switch off the “aggregated” data collection. The software updates will be submitted to Google Play Store for approval today itself and should be available to users pretty soon.
It remains to be seen whether this data collection will remain enabled by default within the incognito mode, or not. We hope it isn’t. Still, having an option to opt-out works to address some privacy concerns.
Update 3: Xiaomi is updating its Mi Browser and Mint Browser to clarify its incognito data collection toggle
While Xiaomi did address the privacy concerns with a new settings toggle, what actually happened was that the language used for the toggle was misleading, achieving the opposite of what was written. As Android Authority points out, the “enhanced incognito mode” toggle said: “Aggregated data stats won’t be uploaded when incognito mode is on”, which led users to believe that flipping the toggle on would make this statement true. But this was not the case. The wording reflected the current state of the toggle, and was not a true/false statement that you change by flipping the switch.
Old behavior
Now, Xiaomi has updated Mi Browser and Mint Browser to have better language on this toggle. The toggle is now called “Help us improve Mi/Mint Browser“, and the accompanying text says “Turn on to share usage stats with us when incognito mode is on“, with the text remaining the same when you flip the switch. This is much more clear to the purpose and the active state of the setting.
New behavior
In both the versions, the toggle needs to be in the off state if you wish to not have your data collected in incognito mode. It’s just the text that is changing to better reflect the state. The new update to both the browsers is being pushed to the Google Play Store.APK TEARDOWN Posts on XDA

Amazon doesn’t officially make any Android-powered smartphones but the e-commerce giant does have a range of products that utilize Android. Amazon’s Fire TV devices, for example, run a fork of Android, called Fire OS, with Amazon’s customized user interface on top. Although the underlying software is based on Android, Amazon doesn’t make it any easier for users to customize or tweak the software to their liking. Using third-party launchers is something we take for granted on our Android smartphones and tablets, but on the Fire TV you don’t have that freedom because Amazon prevents you from using custom launchers.
There used to be a popular app called LauncerHijack to get around this restriction. The app simply redirected the home button press on the Fire TV remote to instead take you to a third-party launcher of your choice. Using ADB, users could then disable the stock Amazon launcher, effectively replacing the stock launcher with a custom one.
Unfortunately, Amazon rolled out a Fire OS update that blocked the LauncherHijack package and also removed the ADB shell command to disable packages, effectively stopping users from running custom launchers without rooting.
Luckily, a new workaround has been found by XDA Junior Member TheRealQubix that once again makes it possible for Fire TV owners to replace the default launcher with a custom launcher of their choice without root. Dubbed FTVLaunchX, the new solution is inspired by LauncherHijackis and also overcomes some of the issues of the old method.
The FTVLaunchX has been successfully tested on the Fire TV Stick 2nd Generation, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Nvidia Shield 2017. However, it could work on other models as well.

PUBG Mobile has undeniably changed the mobile gaming landscape for casual as well as professional gamers. It is now regarded as one of the top mobile games around the world. What started off as a simple battle royale game now offers a variety of gameplay modes including deathmatch, domination, sniper training, and more.
Today we are looking at five of the top-rated weapons that are available on PUBG Mobile. Now we are strictly talking about the guns that are available in the classic mode and not the other modes. Also, do note that these are just the most commonly used and recommended options. Your use case may vary depending on your skill and style of gameplay. We’ve also listed some tips to improve your PUBG Mobile gameplay.
Best Gun in PUBG Mobile: M416 Assault Rifle
The M416 is considered to be one of the best guns in the game, and it is also our personal favorite. Apart from offering a wider range of attachments than any other weapon, it offers a good rate of fire and is pretty versatile for all sorts of battles. Pro-tip: You can use a 6x scope on the M416, pull down the zoom to 3x, and get excellent stability and recoil control.
Best Sniper in PUBG Mobile: AWM Sniper Rifle
The best sniper gun in the game, the AWM is undeniably the most powerful weapon of choice. A single headshot with this gun guarantees a knock/kill. The only downside of the AWM is that it isn’t as common compared to other guns in the game. You need to either hunt for an air-drop supply or call for a flare drop supply to get one.
Best SMG in PUBG Mobile: UZI Submachine Gun
You might not prefer using an SMG (submachine guns) in PUBG Mobile, but the UZI is such an amazing weapon to have. It is excellent for short-range and mid-range battles thanks to its fast rate of fire. One clip into your enemy and he is toast! The UZI also comes in handy during the early stages of a map, with the only limitation being its range.
DP-28 Light Machine Gun
Another versatile weapon, the DP28 light machine gun can be very deadly if used smartly. Like the M416, it can accommodate up to a 6x scope, allowing it to be used for short, mid, and long-range fights. It also offers a large 47-bullet clip, however to balance it out, it is one of the slowest guns when it comes to reloading. Additionally, this gun doesn’t let you add any attachments other than sight. Nonetheless, the DP28 is fairly stable when it comes to recoil.
AKM Assault Rifle
The go-to secondary weapon used by a number of players, the AKM isn’t the easiest weapon to tame. However, it does offer a base damage of 49, which is higher than most assault rifles in the game. Apart from the scope, the AKM can accommodate muzzle and magazine attachments.Best Galaxy Note 20 Deals: Where to buy the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra in India
Samsung has officially announced its next Galaxy Note series. Despite being successors to the Galaxy Note 10 series, the new devices have adopted a moniker befitting the most eventful year (so far) of the 21st century. As expected, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 phones, especially the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G (first impressions), are stocked with premium features. In India, Samsung justifies that by selling the Galaxy Note 20 for ₹77,999 (~$1,040) and the Note 20 Ultra for ₹1,04,999 (~$1,400).
Although these prices align with those in the U.S. (see the best Galaxy Note 20 deals for the US), the phones are definitely outside the comfortable spending zone for most Indian users. Thankfully, Samsung has some sweet deals on pre-orders of the smartphones, and that may grant some sort of comfort to those who eagerly wish to cherish the improved Note experience.

If someone is using an Android phone somewhere in the world and they want to mod it, the XDA forums has a home for them. That’s why we open up forums for new and upcoming smartphones so new users and potential buyers can find all relevant information specific to their device in one place. Today, we are opening forums for a bunch of interesting smartphones from four different OEMs, including Xiaomi (the Mi 10T series), Vivo (the Vivo V20 series), Realme (the Realme 7i), and Samsung (the Galaxy F41 and the Galaxy A42 5G).
Xiaomi Mi 10T and Mi 10T Pro
The Mi 10T and Mi 10T Pro are among the three new devices Xiaomi announced yesterday at its event. We already got our hands-on of the Mi 10T Pro, which gave us a detailed look at the overall design. The full specifications of the device duo include a 6.67-inch LCD display, 144Hz screen refresh rate, Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC, up to 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage, a 108MP primary camera (64MP on the non-Pro variant), and a 5,000 mAh battery with 33W fast charging support.
Thanks to their internal similarities, the Mi 10T (code-name “apollo”) and the Mi 10T Pro (code-name “apollopro”) share a common firmware. This is the reason why we have created a unified section instead of two separate forums.

Vivo’s V20 lineup debuted last week in Thailand. The family includes three phones: Vivo V20, Vivo V20 SE and Vivo V20 Pro. The midrangers recently caught our attention, as the OEM actually managed to beat Google to launching a phone (Vivo V20 to be precise) with Android 11 on board.

Samsung Galaxy A42 5G XDA ForumsUse Xposed Edge Pro to Auto-Start FireStarter or AppStarter on the Amazon Fire TV
A few days ago, the Playing With Fire Mod was published that allows you to essentially turn your Fire TV box/stick into an Android TV device. Following upon that, XDA Senior Member Y314K has published a guide showing you how to use Xposed Edge Pro to get FireStarter/AppStarter working on a a Fire TV/Fire TV Stick and have access to all of the pre-rooted ROMs that are available and based on Fire OS 5.
You’ll be using Xposed Edge Pro v3.9 to complete this process, and you can access it by sideloading it to your Fire TV. You don’t technically need the Pro version of the app, but some of the steps in Y314K‘s step-by-step guide are specific to the Pro version (plus, $1.99 is a low asking price and a great way to support the devs behind it).
In addition to Xposed Edge Pro, you’ll also need a rooted Fire TV device that’s currently running on either Fire OS 5 or 3, Xposed Module and Manager, and a fully-functioning version of FireStarter, AppStarter, Kodi, SPMC, or MrMC (any one of these will work).
After you follow the guide and get everything working, you’ll have FireStarter/AppStarter auto-starting upon turning on your Fire TV and complete control over the Home button on your remote so you can customize it to your heart’s content.

Back in April, the LineageOS team released LineageOS 17.1 with Android 10 as the base. Since then, we’ve seen several devices receive official support from this popular custom ROM distribution, including Google’s Pixel lineup. Most recently, the Redmi K20 (also known as the Xiaomi Mi 9T in some regions), Samsung Galaxy S5, and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 received their first official LineageOS 17.1 builds. And now, the Nokia 6.1 has joined the list, making it the first ever Nokia smartphone to receive official LineageOS support.
Nokia 6.1 XDA Forums
HMD Global’s Nokia is known for offering a clean stock Android experience on its devices and the stock Android One ROM on the Nokia 6.1 is no different. The OEM, however, cracks down on the ability to modify the software on their devices, which means there is no simple way you can unlock the bootloader of your Nokia phone and install a custom recovery like TWRP, root, and flash custom ROMs (either in the form of GSIs or device-specific ROMs). If you already own a Nokia 6.1 and you’re really desperate to unlock the bootloader, there’s one last resort: third-party paid services.
Naturally, XDA-Developers does not endorse the use of third-party services to unlock the bootloader of your device. This is a tricky situation for users who were looking forward to getting their bootloaders unlocked. If you have managed to do it anyway, then you can grab the official LineageOS 17.1 package for the Nokia 6.1 (code-name “PL2”) from the LineageOS download portal, courtesy to XDA Recognized Developer theimpulson and XDA Senior Member npjohnson. The developers have been compiling unofficial LineageOS builds for this device since January, so we’re not too surprised to see an official build.

It is worth mentioning that the Nokia 6.1 received its second major (as well as last) platform update in the form of Android 10 earlier this year. Given that, the availability of official LineageOS builds certainly broadens the scope of aftermarket development on the device.The global mobile connectivity market is quite diverse these days.

They've even tried to take on Google's dominance in the smartphone marketplace. In the case of smart TVs, though, Google's Android TV is challenged...Google is Removing YouTube from the Amazon Echo Show and Fire TV
There’s between an open feud between Amazon and Google over the past few years. Amazon sells a line of Fire products with their own application store instead of opting for Google Play and they still aren’t allowing the sale of competing products such as the Google Home or the Chromecast on the Amazon marketplace. It seems this rivalry has only gotten worse lately as Google has officially confirmed it’s removing access to YouTube from the Amazon Echo Show and the Amazon Fire TV.
The issue with Amazon not letting Google sell the Chromecast and Google Home devices on their website has been going back for years. This is likely due to Amazon selling their own products which compete with Google in these areas. However, recently there’s been some dispute about certain Amazon devices using YouTube. We first learned about this back in September of this year when Google abruptly removed access to YouTube from the Amazon Echo Show.
At the time, Google said it was due to the company violating their terms of service and Amazon was upset because they didn’t get a warning of the removal ahead of time. Amazon went to work and created a new implementation of YouTube for the Echo Show but this merely resulted in the same actions being taken from Google yet again. This time, however, Google is taking things a step further as this relationship between Amazon and Google heats up.
So, not only did Google remove access to YouTube from the Amazon Echo Show this week, but they also said they’ll be doing the same to the Amazon Fire TV. A spokesperson from Google even gave us a reason this time and said “Amazon doesn’t carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home, doesn’t make Prime Video available for Google Cast users, and last month stopped selling some of Nest’s latest products.” As a result, they have removed access to YouTube from the Amazon Echo Show and they will do the same to the Amazon Fire TV starting on January 1st. Google says they hope the two companies “can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon.”

As you may be well aware by now, the stable version of Android 11 has now been released to the masses. Google’s Pixel series of phones and a handful of Xiaomi devices have joined the update train so far, while official beta builds are available for the OnePlus 8 lineup, the Samsung Galaxy S20 series, and several other smartphones from different OEMs. Source code for the newest iteration of Android is up and available at AOSP as well, which is undoubtedly a vital ingredient for compiling Android 11-based custom ROMs. Matter of fact, the Redmi K20 Pro/Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro has already received a fairly usable vanilla AOSP 11 ROM. Now, more Android 10 custom ROMs have begun popping up in our forums for devices like the Xiaomi POCO F1, OnePlus 5/5T, Essential Phone, and the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1; and we expect even more to come along the way in the coming weeks. We’ll add and update this list with some of the first set of Android 11 builds and custom ROMs for a wide range of devices!

Dubbed as “Yet another AOSP project” (YAAP), it is barely more than a simple AOSP build.

XDA Senior Member Nikhil has stepped up and published an updated version of the NikGapps package. The SetupWizard module within this Gapps distribution is known to be problematic, but you can remedy this by skipping the module using nikgapps.config or flashing the variant without SetupWizard.

The world of mobile development is filled with the ingenuity of coders from all over the globe. In their quest to contribute to what is already out there, sometimes you can come across something so unusual and unique that it takes the world by storm. It happened with Angry Birds, Pokemon Go, Temple Run, Trivia Crack and even with Flappy Bird . All these brought something completely out of the ordinary to the mobile landscape as we know it today, creating new paradigms and spawning thousands of clones.
The question is, how do the creators of these ground breaking titles do it? Or more importantly, how can I do something like that? To answer these and many other questions, we had a talk with the company responsible for one of these games.
Etermax is an Argentina-based company and it’s the creator of Trivia Crack (among other offerings), a quiz game where you challenge friends and strangers to determine who knows more about all sorts of subjects. This game was the most downloaded game in the world shortly after it was released in 2013, and has been downloaded over 250 million times ever since. Because at the time there was nothing quite like it, the game became an instant sensation — and with players from tens of countries joining in the fun, the platform grew at an unprecedented rate. As time went by, the developers started adding more unique features as other similar games started surfacing. These additions allowed the game to sit at the top for quite some time.
Since we wanted to know exactly what Etermax did to appeal to so many people for such a long time, we decided to ask them!
Q: Thank you very much for taking the time to enlighten us into the world of Trivia Crack. What is your name and your role in the company?
A: Hi! glad to be here :). My name is Martin Dominguez and my role is the Chief Infrastructure Officer in Etermax. I take care of the Infrastructure issues for the company along with the developers.
Q: For those people out there who may not be aware of what Trivia Crack is, would you mind talking a little bit about the game?
A: Trivia Crack is a quiz game the involves competing with your friends and other players from around the world in various subjects. You can also suggest your own questions to the game, translate questions into another language or rate other users’ suggested questions. You can even complete unique card series with gems that you obtain by answering questions correctly or buying them through the shop.
Q: How did you/the company come up with the idea for the game? What was the inspiration behind it?
A: We love to make games that ignite a person’s competitive fire. In Argentina we have a whole culture of trivia games (quiz shows, etc) ,so we grew up with that. For us, it was a natural choice.
Q: How many users/players did the game originally have? (for the first year)
A: The game started slowly until we added the question factory feature, which gave the users the ability to create their own material for the game. We reached a million daily active users near the end of the year, and the growth from that was massive, ultimately allowing us to reach 25 million daily active users.
Q: What kind of bugs or problems were most common in the earlier versions of the game?
A: When the game started growing rapidly, we had to get rid of some features in the dashboard due to performance problems (nothing vital, just a friends list). We didn’t have any major bugs on the client side, but on the infrastructure side we had to formulate a plan in order to get the architecture working for the huge user base.
Q: Did you/your company expect the sustained growth in its user base?
A: We expected growth, of course, but not at this level. We had the first wave of users from Latin America and when the numbers started to normalize we thought “ok, so that’s it”. Then America and Europe started playing, blowing all of our expectations out of the water.
Q: Piggy backing on the previous question, what is the current player base world wide?
A: We have a lot of users playing trivia crack, not as much as the peak, but still a couple million, with our main player base stationed in the U.S.
Q: How do you upkeep such a massive online platform? What kind of services do you use?
A: We use Amazon Web Services, and if this happened 10 years ago we probably would have crashed from the traffic of the first million users. We needed servers, fast, and without the elasticity of cloud computing the process would have taken more time than we could have afforded to wait to be operative.
Q: In your opinion, what was one of the most crucial factors (from a designer’s/engineer’s perspective) that made the impact which launched the game into stardom?
A: Definitely, the question factory. It gave our users control over the content and that was the game changer that allowed us to enter markets where we didn’t have the manpower or cultural insight to create the right content ourselves.
Q: One of the most important factors for most gamers out there is developer support. In other words, players do not want to feel like they are stranded in a deserted island when they try to report a bug. Do you/your team keep in touch with your user base? How often and by what means?
A: Yes! We do our best to answer all of our users, in any way that they try to reach us. It’s hard work, but we have a whole team dedicated to this task.
Q: Describe one thing that you believe will continue to make the game popular in the foreseeable future.
A: A commitment to progression. If the user feels “stuck in a moment” without any foreseeable signs of an update, they will just quit. We think the users want new experiences every time they open the game and we intend to give those to them.
Q: There are obviously millions of games, many of them even similar to what Trivia Crack has to offer. What do you believe set your game apart from the rest?
A: I think the most successful feature that we offer is the ability for the user to provide their own content. That and a good geographical localization of the users, who helped us to expand the market into countries where we didn’t even know the language, culture, etc.
Q: What advice do you have for starting programmers trying to create the next “Trivia Crack” (popularity wise)?
A: Don’t be afraid to use things (technologies, methodologies) in a different way than everyone else. Try to give your users the capacity to create their own experience and you’ll have a winner on your hands.
Q: Anything exciting planned (that you can freely reveal) for next major revisions?
A: We have a couple of exciting releases for Pictionary (our newest game) and a few others during the year involving experiences in real time.
So, there you have it! If you are willing to move into game development and would love to put out the next king of games, take this sage advise to heart and code away!

In every category, Xiaomi's products are typically available at a lower price than competitors. Thus, a premium Xiaomi smartphone that seeks to compete with flagships from Samsung, Huawei, or Apple seems strange to users who see Xiaomi as the ultimate cost-effective "value" brand. Xiaomi...[Update: Verizon in July] Samsung Galaxy A71 5G launches in the US this week for $599
In April, Samsung announced a slew of Galaxy A devices that would be headed to the US market. A few of them have already gone on sale, but we’ve been waiting for arguably the best of the bunch. Finally, the Samsung Galaxy A71 5G will be available to purchase this week on June 19th.
As you might expect, the Galaxy A71 5G is essentially the same as the LTE-only Galaxy A71, which we got our hands on at CES. It sits at the higher-end of the A-series with a 6.7-inch FHD+ AMOLED display, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G SoC, quad rear cameras, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a 4,500mAh battery, and Android 10. It’s very close to being a flagship-level smartphone, but the processor downgrade is enough to keep the price down.
Of course, with 5G in the name, we have to talk about 5G support. The Galaxy A71 5G will be available from T-Mobile and Sprint on June 19th, presumably with support for the networks’ sub-6GHz 5G. As we previously reported, the device will also be coming to Verizon at a later date, likely with support for its Ultrawide Band (mmWave) 5G network. The device will also be available from AT&T eventually and sold unlocked.
Samsung Galaxy A71 XDA Forums
The Galaxy A71 5G was announced with three color options, but it will only be available in Prism Cube Black to start. As mentioned, it goes on sale on June 19th at T-Mobile, Sprint, and Samsung.com for $599. You can also opt to enroll the phone in Samsung Premium Care for $12 per month to cover accidental damage and breakdowns. If you’re looking for a more affordable near high-end phone in the US, this is a great option, even if you don’t care about 5G.

Update: Verizon in July

For some time now, we’ve heard rumors suggesting that Amazon was planning on releasing an Android-based smartphone. After many months of rumors, leaks, and hints, we finally have Amazon’s entry into the smartphone world. Earlier today, Amazon officially unveiled the Amazon Fire Phone, which will make its way to consumer hands on July 25, starting at $199 on-contract.
From the outset, Amazon worked hard to differentiate the Fire Phone from the sea of other Android smartphones. It hopes to accomplish this goal with the help of a number of innovative technologies including Dynamic Perspective, Firefly technology, Mayday, and Amazon Prime integration.
Dynamic Perspective
Through the use of a custom-designed sensor array, the Fire Phone is able to respond to the way in which you hold, look at, and move your phone. This allows developers to create immersive games and apps that take user position into account for altered viewpoints and more. There are also various shortcuts and gestures enabled by this sensor array such as tilting to navigate through menus, swiveling to access notifications, “peek” to only show relevant data when necessary, and one-handed scrolling. This functionality is even available in absence of light due to infrared illumination designed to aid the four front-facing dynamic perspective sensors.
Firefly Technology
No, not THAT Firefly. Rather, Amazon’s Firefly technology gives you a single hardware button on the side of the phone that uses the camera and other sensors to instantly identify and perform relevant tasks on contact information, playing media, and more. At this point, Firefly seems like Amazon’s answer to a variety of Google products such as Google Goggles, Google Sound Search, the now defunct Google Shopper, and more.
Mayday
Finally, the Fire Phone brings Mayday technology for live, on-device tech support with an Amazon representative. This feature, although clearly not intended for readers of this site, will help new users obtain easy answers to a number of problems by having a live “co-pilot” on screen. As promised by Amazon, this service will result in “help in 15 seconds or less,” without an appointment or end user hassle.
Hardware Specifications
In order to power all of these ambitious features, Amazon has given the Fire Phone a fairly beefy set of hardware specifications, (mostly) in line of what we’ve come to expect from a modern flagship device. For starters, the phone is powered by a 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, which is backed by 2 GB of RAM. This then feeds a 4.7″ 720p display that comes out to 315 ppi. The phone runs on Fire OS 3.5.0, which is a very highly skinned version of Android, and it packs plenty of connectivity options including pentaband 3G, 9-band LTE, and support for carrier aggregation for greater speed. The camera array in addition to its four perspective sensors is also formidable, thanks to its 2.1 MP front-facing camera and 13 MP rear-facing camera with optical image stabilization. All of this is then housed in a device that measures in at 8.9mm thick and weighs 160 grams.

Just a few days ago, Huawei unveiled its newest series of flagship devices, which include the Huawei P40, Huawei P40 Pro, and the Huawei P40 Pro+. The Chinese OEM is shipping a slightly upgraded version of their custom Android 10-based UI, dubbed EMUI 10.1, with the P40 lineup. One notable inclusion in EMUI 10.1 is Celia, Huawei’s own Voice Assistant, which can be invoked with the hotword “Hey Celia,” or by holding the power button for a second. Now the company has announced the rollout schedule of EMUI 10.1 beta for existing Huawei and Honor branded devices.
The current roadmap is applicable to the Chinese device variants. This internal beta will be further expanded to a series of public beta tests before concluding with the stable release of EMUI 10.1. Huawei has been known for prioritizing their home country to conduct beta testing or release updates and take several months before rolling them out worldwide. Hopefully, this incremental update doesn’t take that long, as the EMUI global Twitter handle is actively teasing EMUI 10.1.
The full list of eligible devices can be found below.

After months of leaks and speculation, the Galaxy Note 20 is here, and as you might expect, a flagship specs list means a premium price tag. The regular Galaxy Note 20 starts at $999 in the US, while the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra starts at $1399. However, as with every Samsung launch, there are also some deals to be had if you place an early pre-order so below, we’ve rounded up all the best deals for the Galaxy Note 20, including ways to save on multiple devices and the best postpaid deals we can find as well.
Where to buy the Galaxy Note 20
One of the biggest phones of the year is going to be available through every major carrier and most major retailers across the world.
Best Unlocked Galaxy Note 20 Deals in the US
The unlocked Galaxy Note 20 is available at three major retailers: Amazon, Samsung, and Best Buy. They all offer different deals, check them out below!
Amazon
Thinking of grabbing the Galaxy Note 20 at Amazon? You’ll be able to save $200 on it today! If you have the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa, you can sign up for an 18-month payment plan, as well. Of course, while you’re there you can also pick up a Galaxy Note 20 case (and we’ve summarized the best ones!).
Samsung
If you have a recent phone to trade if, you’ll want to get you Note 20 from Samsung. Get up to $650 off with a trade-in, bringing the phone’s grand total down to just $350. Normally you can only get up to $400, and this is a limited-time offer, so don’t sit on this one too long!
Best Buy
Best Buy also offers a myriad of options depending on whether you want to buy it unlocked or on a carrier plan. First and foremost, no matter if you pick unlocked or a carrier phone, you’ll save a flat $200 if you activate today. If you grab a Verizon carrier phone, you’ll save $300 with activation today. If you want the unlocked Note 20 you’ll have to pay the full amount outright, but on Sprint and Verizon you can do a 24-month payment plan or a 30-month payment plan on AT&T.
Best Carrier Galaxy Note 20 Deals in the US
Of course, each major carrier is also selling the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Here are the best deals for each of them:
Verizon
Verizon usually has a ton of promotions to take advantage of with their phones, and the Galaxy Note 20 is no exception. Here are just a few of those offers:
- Buy one phone, get a second for up to $700 off with a new line
- Get up to $550 off with a trade-in
- If switching from another carrier, get a $250 Verizon e-Gift Card on select Unlimited plans
If you can stack multiple deals, you’ll save big on the Galaxy Note 20 at Verizon!
AT&T
AT&T Next lets you pay for your phone over 30 months, with the Galaxy Note 20 costing $33.34 per month on the plan. But, that’s without taking advantage of AT&T’s trade-in offer! If you’re switching to AT&T from another carrier, adding a line, or upgrading your plan, the Galaxy Note 20 will only cost $10/month! Additionally, you can save $50 on the Galaxy Buds Live if you bundle it and the Note 20 together.The LG Velvet is coming to Europe, North America, and other regions soon
After LG teased the device for several weeks, the LG Velvet was finally announced last month. The device grabbed a lot of attention initially for marking a pretty drastic design shift for LG. It also signified the company’s possible shift away on flagship phones as it features the upper mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G SoC. Today, LG announced wider availability for the Velvet.
The LG Velvet is currently only available in South Korea, but it will soon be coming to Europe and North America. Specifically, it will be coming to Germany, Italy, Spain, Hungary, and Poland in June. North America, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America will get it “in the weeks ahead.”
LG Velvet XDA Forums
To recap the LG Velvet, it features a very simple design. Like the Galaxy A71 5G, it gets 5G support from the Snapdragon X52 modem in the Snapdragon 765G SoC. Other specifications include a 6.8-inch OLED display, triple rear cameras, 6GB of RAM, a 4,300mAh battery, microSD card slot, a headphone jack, stylus support, and LG’s Dual Screen accessory. Pricing for these new regions has not been revealed, but it should be around $700.

Google has a tradition of rolling out Android security patches on the first Monday of each month, but that doesn’t mean other OEMs can’t beat the Mountain View giant at their own game. The latest Android Security Bulletin and Pixel Update Bulletin for September 2020 have yet to go live, but several Samsung phones have already started to get the new security update. Three more phones, the Galaxy Note 20, Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and the Galaxy A50 are now receiving the same treatment from the Korean OEM across the globe.
Galaxy Note 20
Tagged with the version number N98xxXXS1ATH9, the new OTA for the Galaxy Note 20 series is intended for the Exynos-powered international models. Both the 4G (SM-N980F and SM-N985F) and the 5G (SM-N981B and SM-N986B) variants are now getting the update in Germany and the SEE region, which is Samsung’s code for South East Europe. The official changelog doesn’t mention anything other than the obvious bump in the Android security patch level.

Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Review: For Those Ahead of the Curve
Galaxy A50
The mid-ranger Samsung Galaxy A50 was well received by its target audience, and the swift update frequency now makes this device even more attractive. Two different variants of this popular phone – SM-A505F and SM-A505FN – are receiving the September 2020 Android security patches in the form of software version A505FDDU5BTH8 and A505FNXXU5BTH8, respectively. As reported by SamMobile, the new build also improves AR Emoji stability as well as compatibility with third party apps.
Samsung Galaxy A50 XDA Forums
The bootloader version remains unchanged from the last stable build in both cases, thus owners of these phones are free to downgrade if required. The new security bulletin, as well as more regional OTAs, should be available in the near future, albeit people can use tools like Frija to bypass the waiting queue and download the new firmware packages right away.XDA Developers was founded by developers, for developers.

Welcome to the XDA-Developers Root Directory. Here, you can find root tutorials for most devices that are on the XDA Forums. Learn how to root any Android device! If you don’t see your device listed or you see a misplaced link, send a PM to PG101, with the device details and a link to the root thread on XDA.
For those new to the world of rooting, acquiring root access essentially grants you elevated permissions. With root access, you are able to access and modify files that would normally be inaccessible, such as files stored on the /data and /system partitions. Having root access also allows you to run an entirely different class of third-party applications and apply deep, system-level modifications. And by proxy, you may also be able to access certain device features that would otherwise be inaccessible or use existing features in new ways.
Having root access isn’t the end all-be all of device modification–that title is usually reserved for fully unlocked bootloaders and S-Off. That said, root access is generally the first step on your journey to device modification. As such, root access is often used to install custom recoveries, which then can be used to flash custom ROMs, kernels, and other device modifications. Root access also enables users to install the powerful and versatile Xposed Framework, which itself acts as a gateway to easy, non-destructive device modification.
Due to its inherent power, having root access is often dangerous. Thankfully, there are root brokering applications such as SuperSU that only grant root access to applications of your choosing. There are also various root-enabled utilities available to help you restore in the event that something goes wrong. For starters, you can use any number of root-enabled application backup tools to backup your applications and their data to your local storage, your PC, and even online cloud storage. And in conjunction with a custom recovery, rooted users are able to perform a full, system-wide Nandroid backup that essentially takes a snapshot of your current smartphone or tablet at any particular time.
We can go on about the virtues of root access ad infinitum, but we’ll stop for now because we sense you salivating at the prospect of root access and what you can do with your device once root is achieved. Head to the links below to begin the journey.
PLEASE NOTE: Rooting a device may void the warranty on the device. It may also make the device unstable or if not done properly, may completely brick the device. Some methods may install additional apps/software on your device. XDA-Developers or the author does not take any responsibility for your device. Root at your own risk and only if you understand what you are doing!

Magisk Root
Framaroot
Many devices can be rooted using this application. Check your device for compatibility.
Towelroot
Created by XDA Recognized Developer geohot, Towelroot is another root exploit app that is compatible with a large range of devices. The root exploit itself is built around Linux kernel CVE-2014-3153 discovered by hacker Pinkie Pie, and it involves an issue in the Futex subsystem that in turn allows for privilege escalation. Although specifically designed for certain variants of the Galaxy S5, it is compatible with the majority of devices running unpatched kernels.
CF-Auto-Root
Created by XDA Senior Recognized Developer Chainfire, CF-Auto-Root is a root for “rooting beginners” and those who want to keep as close to stock as possible. CF-Root is meant to be used in combination with stock Samsung firmwares as well as Nexus devices, and be the quickest and easiest way for your first root. In essence, it does nothing but install and enable SuperSU on your system, so apps can gain root access.
KingRoot
KingRoot is root for people who just want to have root access to their devices, and not necessarily wanting to flash anything extra. It works on almost all devices from Android version 2.x to 5.0. Working of KingRoot is based on system exploit. The most suitable root strategy will be deployed from cloud to your device according to the ROM information on the device. The best part of using this root method is that it does not trip KNOX and have the ability to close Sony_RIC perfectly.

Updated: 14 August 2020Google Chrome will start offering to sync saved credit cards with Google Pay
If you’re a frequent online shopper (who isn’t these days?), quick access to your credit card is very important. Walking across the room to get your card is an inconvenience. It can bring your better judgment to the forefront and put an end to a frivolous purchase. We can’t have that, which is why Chrome’s Autofill feature can save your credit card info. However, a new integration with Google Pay will make it even easier.
Currently, Chrome Autofill and Google Pay exist with minimal synchronization. G Pay is a service that some websites have implemented for checkout. Chrome Autofill, on the other hand, works on almost every website because it’s the same as filling in a saved password. Right now, cards saved in Google Pay can be synced with the browser’s Autofill feature, but not vice versa. A recent commit talks about making that possible.
This project is to offer users an option to upload chrome local credit cards to Google Pay server. This bubble UI is the entry point of the entire flow. It should be anchored to a credit card icon in the location bar and be shown from it.
The commit talks about a UI for “local card migration flow.” Users who already have cards saved in Chrome Autofill will be able to merge them over to Google Pay. Chrome Autofill has been around much longer than G Pay, plus Chrome has a lot more users. Google likely wants to get more people using Google Pay and this could be an easy way to get people to move over. It’s possible that Google Pay will replace the credit card feature of Autofill, but that’s just speculation.Congress scrutinizes Google over use of private DNS in Chrome
DNS over HTTPS is a new-ish concept that was first introduced and proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) back in October 2018, roughly a year ago. For starters, it allows for performing DNS resolutions over the HTTPS protocol, providing great advantages for both privacy and security. This new protocol was supported, among other companies, by Google, and the company is currently working into implementing DNS over HTTPS on Google Chrome and is planning to start testing the feature on Chrome 78, rolling it out to a small number of users.
But this new protocol is, however, not sitting well with ISPs as it effectively blocks them from having any insight into their users’ traffic. Now, Congress seems to be scrutinizing Google over its implementation of DoH, according to a Wall Street Journal report. According to this report, the House Judiciary Committee has sent a letter to Alphabet Inc. asking for information regarding its “decision regarding whether to adopt or promote the adoption” of DNS over HTTPS, as well as information on whether they were planning on using data processed through this protocol for commercial purposes. The Justice Department has also expressed that they were aware of concerns regarding this protocol and has confirmed that they’ve received complaints, likely from ISPs.
In response to this, Google has declared that they were supporting this feature to maximize and ensure the privacy and security of users online, as well as dismissed claims that they were trying to force users into passing their data through their own encrypted DNS servers. The company has declared in an emailed statement that “Google has no plans to centralize or change people’s DNS providers to Google by default” and that “any claim that we are trying to become the centralized encrypted DNS provider is inaccurate.”
As we said before, Google plans to begin testing a rollout of DNS over HTTPS starting with Chrome 78, in anticipation of a wider rollout on a future Chrome version.

Arguably, one of the pioneers in the consumer sector for more “rugged” devices (or at the very least IP certification) has to be Sony. Back in 2012, they introduced the Xperia Z line of the devices, which marked a turning point for Sony in most of its philosophy as well as its design language.
They completely overhauled the look and feel of the devices they had in favor of the glass slab that they offer even in today’s phones and tablets. Despite its fragile appearance, most of their offerings were drop-tested and were able to withstand a substantial amount of mistreatment. On top of all that, the Sony Xperia Z was the first commercially available phone from Sony to me, marketed as “water resistant” with an IP56 rating for water and dust ingress (which isn’t really much, but at least it would keep your phone going in spite of an accidental drop in the beach or in the pool). However, the phone was advertised in such a way that it it looked as if the device was waterproof and not water resistant (there is a big difference). This led to a lot of water-damaged devices, which Sony did nothing about and eventually, a class action lawsuit was filed (and won) against Sony.
People used to do all sorts of crazy things with the phones. Everything from dropping them on concrete, to dunking them on glasses of water, wine, beer, hot chocolate, and there is even a video in Youtube of someone cooking the device in soup (because why not, right?) Then, you had the more “sane” ones (like yours truly) who would simply use the device, at most to take pictures in a pool (at around 2 inches in depth) to test how the camera would perform under water. There were some precautions that needed to be taken before the water activities took place, like for instance making sure all the access ports were securely closed to prevent water ingress. Personally, I always did it with my phone. However, one day, my Xperia Z simply stopped working.
I decided to have a close look at the ports (which had multiple water detecting strips) to see if maybe I had forgotten to close the lids as per manufacturer instructions. The water indicators were white as snow, which means that either the device was failing for a different reason or water had gone in through a different place. Upon closer inspection of the device, I noticed that the back glass panel of the phone was raised and could actually be pressed back into place only for it to pop up again. The area was right around where the processor was placed (a Snapdragon S4 Pro) and it was no surprise as there were reported overheating issues with the device.
Upon closer inspection, I found that the glass on the back was warped, likely because of the heat coming from the chipset, which also likely loosened the glue thus compromising seals in place to prevent water from getting in. With all this information (as well as a myriad of complains about similar issues in our forum as well as Sony’s official forum), I decided to send my device over to Sony for a warranty repair. About 2 weeks later, I received an e-mail update from Sony stating that my device was on its way back to me and that I was correct in my assumption as the technicians had found rust caused by water shorting some components inside the device. However, because it was me who used the device under water, they said the damage was my fault and was not covered under the warranty (despite the device supposedly being able to withstand light water immersion). In case you are wondering, they also included the pictures of the water indicators being white in the report, which means that it was not really going in through a user-accessible area (in other words, water did not go in because I did not follow directions). Since my phone had turned into a glass covered paper weight, I decided to sell it on eBay for spares (as the screen and everything else was immaculate.)
Fast forward a few years, as it turns out most other people who suffered a similar fate did not sit idly and decided to file a Class Action lawsuit against Sony. According to the settlement, there were 24 models affected (ironically, the original Z is not listed as being one of them) starting from the ZR, which was a close cousin of the original Z and going all the way to the Xperia Z5, along with a few tablets as well. The settlement goes on to state that there are a few things that, if you were affected, you can opt for:
- Warranty extension for up to a year if the device is within warranty period;
- Warranty extension for up to 6 months if the device is no longer under warranty;
- Up to 50% of MSRP as refund for compensation if the device is listed among the ones on the Sony lawsuit;
If you are going for the cash alternative, you do have a deadline to meet, which is January 30, 2018. Whichever course of action you do decide to take, please make sure that you understand the entire lawsuit document before doing anything!

Huawei is among the most valued Chinese companies and one which has an empire fanning out in all directions. Besides claiming the number two spot in terms of smartphone sales worldwide, Huawei is among the leading suppliers for telecommunication equipment and a driving force in the adoption of 5G. But for certain reasons, the company has been under the gunsight of the Trump administration, which has repeatedly alleged that Huawei’s smartphones and telecom equipment are potentially being used for espionage. Citing founder Ren Zhengfei’s previous association with the Chinese army, the U.S. government has barred government agencies as well as their private contractors from using any Huawei product, and also pursued allies to do the same.
With escalating diplomatic tension between the two countries, President Trump declared a national emergency and passed an executive order to restrict companies in the U.S. from supplying products to Huawei last week. While the Chinese giant claimed to have a decent stockpile of hardware goods and seemingly felt at ease even with these restrictions in place, a recent disclosure from Google puts Huawei’s prominence in the market at stake. As part of the blacklisting by the government, Google has removed Huawei from the Android partner program, suggesting that the latter will no longer have “access to proprietary apps and services from Google,” Reuters reported.
Google is currently “reviewing the implications” of the executive order from the White House, but for now, Huawei will reportedly be unable to install Google Play Service on the smartphones henceforth. The crackdown bars Huawei from applying for evaluation of devices under the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS), which any OEM must pass to be able to use the Android branding on its devices and provide services like the Google Play Store, YouTube, Google Search, Chrome, etc. out-of-the-box.
Users will not be able to just side-load APKs for these services because Google prohibits CTS-unverified devices from running its apps. Besides Google apps, all the others that use Google’s APIs, to facilitate log-in, for instance, will also be blocked on smartphones by Huawei and sub-brand Honor.
For the existing Huawei devices, Google has confirmed users will continue to be able to update apps through the Google Play Store. However, the blacklisting also prohibits Huawei and Honor from sending out newer updates to their smartphones, and if it does, it will be forced to remove Google Play Services and Google apps from the existing devices too.
For Huawei users' questions regarding our steps to comply w/ the recent US government actions: We assure you while we are complying with all US gov't requirements, services like Google Play & security from Google Play Protect will keep functioning on your existing Huawei device.
— Android (@Android) May 20, 2019
As a result of this ban, Huawei will not have access to the code for monthly Google security patches before the public release. Furthermore, Huawei and Honor can no longer be a member of the Android beta programs starting with the next commercial release of Android i.e. Android R. If Huawei intends to move ahead with updates and brings users onboard the Android R bandwagon, it will have to wait until the public release which happens around August every year.
Fundamentally, the only way Huawei can now continue using Android onto its smartphones is building its own custom version of Android using AOSP (Android Open Source Project) code, exactly how developers of custom ROMs do. Unlike custom ROMs, however, Huawei might not be able to strap GApps along with the package without going unnoticed by Google.
All in all, the situation is really bad for Huawei. The only plausible option it has for now is to either finally start rolling out its own operating system that it has reportedly been working on, in the anticipation of the day when the U.S. finally obstructs its usage of Android. That might be a challenging shift since most Huawei users are habitual of Android and the Google ecosystem. But, so long as the operating system resembles Android in terms of experience and allows the installation of Google apps, it should be useful. However, we haven’t seen any previews yet, which means that it might not be ready for use just yet.
Alternatively, Huawei could continue to tinker with Android and use AOSP builds to continue providing EMUI updates. However, in that case, it will not be able to support Google Play Services and other Google apps. This will limit the users to rely on Huawei’s AppGallery, which has a relatively smaller number of apps, even though that wouldn’t resolve the issue with Google apps.
Overall, the condition is really limiting for Huawei, essentially confining it to China, where Google’s services are already banned by law. This executive order crushes Huawei and Honor’s presence, not just in the U.S., but basically every market where devices are shipped with Google services pre-installed. Given that the U.S. government already has a strict view of the company, we do not expect any relief in the coming months. Earlier, Huawei had also shared its plans to sue the U.S. government but a favorable decision may take several months or even years.
For now, this step reeks of the upcoming death of another smartphone giant.
Update 1: Qualcomm, Intel, Xilinx, Broadcom break trade ties with Huawei
After the report of Google limiting its software exchange with Huawei, American chipmakers Qualcomm, Broadcom, Xilinx, and Intel have announced that they will cede to the executive order by the U.S. government and limit supplies to Huawei. Huawei “is heavily dependent on U.S. semiconductor products and would be seriously crippled without supply of key U.S. components,” analyst Ryan Koontz told Bloomberg. As mentioned above, Huawei does seem to have stockpiled enough chips to keep production going for the next three months. However, the ban may take longer to be lifted.
Among the four chipmakers, Intel Huawei’s the primary supplier for chips used in its data centers. Additionally, Intel also provides processors for Huawei’s Matebook series of laptops. Qualcomm sells it Snapdragon SoCs for various entry-level devices like the Honor 8C as well as some network chips. Qualcomm also licenses aptX codec for Bluetooth audio to Huawei. Meanwhile, Xilinx provides programmable chips for networking while Broadcom supplies packet switching chips for telecom equipment.
In all, there are more than 30 companies in the U.S. considered as “core suppliers” by the company, and all of them are likely to follow the same route.
Update 2: Official response
Following the debacle, the Chinese company has officially shared a response on the matter. Here’s how it goes:
“Huawei has made substantial contributions to the development and growth of Android around the world. As one of Android’s key global partners, we have worked closely with their open-source platform to develop an ecosystem that has benefitted both users and the industry.
Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products covering those have been sold or still in stock globally.
We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally.”

Update 3: Honor 20 Launch unaffected
Huawei’s Honor has announced that in spite of the on-going turmoil between the U.S. government and the rescinding act from Google and other partner corporations, tomorrow’s launch of the Honor 20 series in London remains unaffected.
Update 4: Huawei Granted Temporary License
Barely 24 hours after news broke that Google revoked Huawei’s Android license, plunging the tech sphere into chaos, the U.S. Commerce Department told Reuters that Huawei will be granted a “temporary general license.” This license, which lasts until August 19th, allows Huawei to “maintain existing networks and provide software updates to existing Huawei handsets.” The license does not allow U.S. companies to work with Huawei on new products, however.
To be clear, this temporary license only grants Huawei a reprieve from the U.S. trade ban. We have yet to see if Google has temporarily restored Huawei’s Android license, though that’s likely going to happen given that the alternative is chaos and uncertainty for hundreds of millions of Android users worldwide. If Huawei is once again allowed to become a GMS Partner, then the company can proceed with releasing its planned updates on schedule.
Although Huawei likely has much of its work already completed for the next EMUI version based on Android Q, it’s unlikely the company will release the update if it cannot ship Google Play apps and services with the release. We’ll have to wait and see what happens to Huawei after August 19th.
Update: The full text of the Temporary General License can be found here. Thanks Roland Quandt!
Update 5: Working ‘closely’ with Google
After the U.S. Commerce Department gave the Chinese manufacturer some temporary relief, it hit back at the U.S. for its bias. Calling this an act of “bullying” by the Trump-led U.S. government, Huawei told Reuters that it is working “closely with Google” to understand the impact of the ban as well as to work out a solution in order to mitigate the impact on consumers.
Abraham Liu, Huawei’s chief representative to the EU Institutions and VP for the European Region, told media that Google has “zero motivation to block us.” He remarked, ” it is an attack on the liberal, rules-based order.”

Update 6: Google reverses decision
Following the U.S. Commerce Department’s decision to grant mobile phone companies a 90-day license to work with Huawei, Google has reversed their decision. The company will now send software updates to Huawei phones until August 19th.
“Keeping phones up to date and secure is in everyone’s best interests and this temporary license allows us to continue to provide software updates and security patches to existing models for the next 90 days.” – Google spokesperson
The Commerce Department will reassess the situation after the 90-day license expires. At that point, Google will most likely make the same assessment and decide how to move forward. For the time being at least, Huawei’s Android phones are safe.

Update 7: Carriers dropping Huawei
UK carriers EE and Vodafone have dropped Huawei phones from their 5G launch plans. Both carriers were planning to launch the Huawei Mate X 5G with their 5G network rollout. The carriers point to long-term usability for their customers as a reason for pulling the device.
On top of the UK carriers, SoftBank in Japan and Chunghwa Telecom in Taiwan have also dropped Huawei devices, including the Huawei P30 Lite and Huawei P20 Lite. South Korea’s KT is also considering halting sales and NTT Docomo in Japan has halted pre-orders of the Huawei P30 Pro.

Update 8: Removed from Android Enterprise Recommended
Android Enterprise Recommended is Google’s program for certifying devices that are considered secure and safe for enterprise. Google has now removed all Huawei devices from the website, including the old Nexus 6P. Other devices that were in this list included the Huawei Mate 10, Huawei P10, Huawei Mate 20, and the MediaPad M5 tablet.

Update 10: Huawei devices have been added back to the Android Enterprise Recommended website
In a strange turn of events, Huawei devices have been added back to the Android Enterprise Recommended website. Devices that have been re-added so far include the Huawei Mate 20 X and Honor devices like the Honor 20 Pro.
What makes this development strange is the fact that the US Government was still yet to make a decision on the pending license applications from US companies to resume business with Huawei. Google is also quite opaque with its additions to and removals from the Enterprise website, so we are not entirely sure about what is happening here. We’ll keep our readers updated if the trade ban has been lifted or if Google has been granted a further license.

Update 11: Temporary License Extended
Originally reported by Reuters last week, it is now confirmed that the US Commerce Department is postponing the trade ban on Huawei for 90 more days. The temporary license that allows US companies to continue working with Huawei was set to expire today.
“As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei’s products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any disruption. Simultaneously, we are constantly working at the Department to ensure that any exports to Huawei and its affiliates do not violate the terms of the Entity Listing or Temporary General License.”
– Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Commerce
46 additional Huawei affiliates are said to have also been added to the entity list, though that has not been confirmed. Huawei has not yet released a statement on the situation.
Source: CNET
Update 12: Temporary General License Extended (Again)
Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration has extended Huawei’s Temporary General License for another 90 days, according to Reuters. This will allow the Chinese tech giant to continue working with U.S. companies in a limited capacity. The goal of the initial Temporary General License extension was to minimize the harm on network operators in rural America, as many were dependent on Huawei for telecommunications equipment. This new extension, per Reuters, was intended to only last for 2 weeks but was extended to another 90 days due to unspecified “bureaucratic issues.” The Trump administration has still not decided whether they will grant individual U.S. companies licenses to sell components to Huawei, however. The ban is now postponed until February 16, 2020, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see yet another extension come next year.
In terms of Huawei’s smartphone business, the extension of the TGL means they can continue to support existing devices but cannot launch new devices with Google certification.
Update 13: Temporary General License Extended (Once Again)
Unsurprisingly (again), the Trump administration has extended Huawei’s Temporary General License once more. However, this extension is only for 45 days, as reported by CNet, which is half the period of previous extensions.
“The license is being extended to prevent interruption of existing network communication systems in rural U.S. regions and permit global network security measures. The 45-day extension is necessary to allow existing telecommunication providers — particularly those in rural US communities — the ability to continue to temporarily and securely operate existing networks while they identify alternatives to Huawei for future operation.”
The ban is now postponed until March 31, 2020, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see yet another extension, albeit of smaller duration.
Update 14: Temporary General License Extended (Yet Again)
The Commerce Department has once again extended the Temporary General License. This extension has come in before the previous extension expired on March 31, 2020. The new extension is once again extending it by a further 45 days.
“The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced today it was seeking public comments on March 10-25, 2020 the continuing need for, and scope of, possible future extensions of the Temporary General License (TGL) for Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and its non-United States affiliates (Huawei) on the Entity List. At the same time, the Department extended the TGL through May 15, 2020 to provide for this opportunity for public input.
The initial TGL from May 2019 and the three extensions that followed were intended to allow time for companies and persons to shift to alternative sources of equipment, software, and technology (e.g. those not produced by Huawei or one of its listed affiliates). The current extension expires on
April 1, 2020 and the request for public input by March 25, 2020, demonstrates the Department is trying to find a permanent solution.”

Google Assistant is available on everything from smartphones to smart displays, and now it’s coming to 2020 Samsung TVs. Support is rolling out first in the U.S., followed by additional countries soon.
Samsung shared a list of compatible TVs:
Voice control on Samsung’s smart televisions previously went through the company’s own Bixby platform, as Samsung’s TVs don’t run on Google’s Android TV (soon to be called Google TV) platform. With Google Assistant support, you can do everything from control playback to open apps. You can also ask the Google Assistant to find you action movies or search for films with a specific actor. Of course, you can also use Google Assistant to perform typical actions, like control your smart home or show the weather forecast. Samsung’s support page details more voice commands you can try out.
To setup Google Assistant on your 2020 Samsung TV, navigate to Settings > General > Voice and select Voice Assistant. When prompted, select Google Assistant. If you don’t see it as an available option, you’ll need to update your TV’s software to the latest version. To finish setup, you’ll need to open Google Assistant on your smartphone. If you do enable Google Assistant on your TV, Samsung said that you’ll give permission for Google and Samsung to share information with each other.
Google Assistant is available now for Samsung’s latest smart TVs, and will roll out to other markets later this year.
In the same blog post, Google also revealed Assistant will be available on the new Fitbit Sense and Fitbit Versa 3 this winter. On these smartwatches, you’ll be able to start a Fitbit Exercise, control timers, manage tasks, add items to shopping lists, and more.Google Calendar now lets you Change Event Times with a Drag and Drop
Google Calendar has been my go-to calendar app for years, and while I’ve been happy with most features of the app during this time, one feature that’s been noticeably absent for a while is the ability to drag and drop events to different times. Thankfully, with the latest update to version 5.7.29 of the Google Calendar app, this is no longer a missing feature.
In order to move an event from one time slot to another one, hold down on the event you want to change, wait for the small vibration, and then move it to the new time. It’s a pretty basic feature, but it makes moving appointments/meetings around considerably easier than opening the event and manually adjusting the time.
Changing an event with the new drag and drop functionality will show a small snackbar at the bottom of your screen, and if you move an event by accident or to the wrong time/date, you can tap the undo button to revert your action. Drag and drop functionality works in Google Calendar’s Day, 3 Day, and Week views. The Month and Schedule options aren’t currently supported, and there’s no word as to whether or not this will change at some point down the road.
The update to version 5.7.29 of Google Calendar is available now in the Play Store, but if the update isn’t showing up for you, you can download the APK file below.

Xiaomi releases a ton of smartphones each year, often bringing existing smartphones released in China into new markets under a different brand name. That’s exactly what happened with the budget Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A and Redmi Note 5A Prime smartphones, which were released in India in late 2017 as the Redmi Y1 Lite and Redmi Y1 respectively. Xiaomi launched the Redmi Y1 smartphones with Android 7.1 Nougat-based MIUI 9, but promised users that they would deliver a MIUI 10 update. After a long delay to fix some “critical issues”, the MIUI 10 Global Stable update is finally rolling out for these devices.
The recovery ROM download links are provided below, courtesy of XDA Recognized Developer yshalsager, the creator of the Xiaomi Firmware Updater service. You can either sideload the update in MIUI’s settings app or flash the ROM in TWRP.

The update brings the MIUI version to 10.2.1.0. The software is still based on Android 7.1 Nougat, though. The new features in MIUI 10 should satisfy some users, but there will still be plenty of users waiting for Xiaomi to roll out an official Android Oreo update.

Earlier this month, Paranoid Android 7.2 was released to the world with a host of useful new features, support for more devices, and an overall more stable experience compared to previous builds. Today, the team behind the ROM is releasing Paranoid Android 7.2.1.
This is a minor update compared to the jump from 7.1.2 to 7.2.0, but there’s still plenty to talk about – most notably the three new devices that are now officially supported by the AOSPA team. With the 7.2.1 update, Paranoid Android now has official support for the Nexus 5 (hammerhead), Sony Xperia X (suzu), and the Xperia X Compact (kugo).
One feature being added, that’s been available in other ROMs as well, is a three-finger swipe down gesture for taking screenshots. OnePlus added this to OxygenOS starting with the OnePlus 3T, and it’s much more convenient than trying to press the power and volume rocker at the same time to perform the same function. In addition to this, the 7.2.1 update also brings a new version of the PA Browser, better handling of carrier provisioning and telephony handling (improvements for wfc and volte), performance enhancements, and other minor improvements throughout the ROM.
There are a number of device-specific changes for the OnePlus 3/3T, Nexus 6P, Nexbit Robin, OnePlus One, and LeEco Le Pro3. Most of these minor additions, but they can be read in full detail on Paranoid Android’s Google+ post if you’re interested.
Lastly, as with any update, a host of bugs have been squashed as well. There have been fixes for tethering issues, launcher layout fixes, sensitivity with PIE controls, and a resolution to a bug with media controls when using Pocket Lock.
There’s also a reworked boot animation by Espen Flagtvedt Olsen that looks quite sweet, as shown above this paragraph. You can get Paranoid Android 7.2.1 either by sideloading your device’s build or waiting for an OTA update, and when you do so, you’ll get all of the above improvements in addition to the latest July 2017 security patch. Check out their downloads page to get started!

However, as it turns out, the Taiwanese OEM secretly enabled VoLTE support on US carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile with this update, but chose not to list the improvement in the OTA changelog for some reason.
ASUS ROG Phone 3 XDA Forums
Multiple users on Reddit’s ROG Phone 3 subreddit have corroborated that VoLTE starts working on AT&T after installing the latest update. The OTA is good for T-Mobile users too, as our Editor-in-Chief, Mishaal Rahman, has confirmed that the phone can now make use of VoLTE on T-Mobile without any extra configuration. This is no doubt an important advancement as more carriers move towards adopting VoLTE on their network.
For your information, it is possible to manually set the carrier-specific parameters on select ASUS smartphones — including the ROG Phone 3 — to unlock advanced IMS services like VoLTE on T-Mobile’s network if you have root access. Having said that, an official update is always preferable in this scenario, especially since not everyone wants to tinker with their shiny new gadget.
At the time of writing this article, the official announcement thread for this update is no longer up on ASUS’ ZenTalk Community. Perhaps the current implementation needs another coat of paint before ASUS is confident enough to announce it officially. If you want to sideload the new build anyway, you can download the full firmware from the link below.

To install, simply place the downloaded file in the root directory on your ROG Phone 3. Then reboot your phone and check for the firmware update notification pop-up on the status bar. Tap “System update file detected” and follow the steps shown to update the firmware.Enable video over LTE, RCS, and other carrier features on U.S. unlocked Samsung Galaxy Note 20
The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra are some of the most powerful smartphones you can buy right now. A culmination of the best flagship technologies, the Galaxy Note 20 flagships from Samsung feature top-of-the-line hardware. You can find Samsung’s Exynos 990 chip on the global units, while the U.S. models are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus SoC — although there is a caveat with the U.S. models.

The catch is that there is a further demarcation between the U.S. carrier (model number ended with U) and the U.S. carrier unlocked variants (model number ended with U1). Certain carrier baked features such as Video over LTE (ViLTE) and Rich Communication Services (RCS) can’t be accessed on the unlocked Galaxy Note 20 model, even after putting in the carrier SIM. Interestingly, there are no internal hardware differences between these two variants, which means users who purchased the phone at full retail are at a disadvantage against users who opted for a carrier-based contract.
If you specifically bought the unlocked Note 20 for a carrier-bloat-free experience, then you would be glad to know that XDA Recognized Developer warriorvibhu has managed to activate native video calling over LTE, RCS, and other carrier features on this variant. The developer has also put together an elaborate guide that utilizes the Google Phone app to access the hidden IMS Settings and subsequently turn on the required parameters.
How to enable ViLTE and RCS on unlocked Samsung Galaxy Note 20
- Download and install the Google Phone app.
- Open Google Phone and make it your default Phone app.
- Dial
*#*#467#*#* to open IMS Settings.
- Tap on “IMS Service Switch”. Then make sure “MMTEL switch” and “RCS switch” are toggled on. Turn on every sub-option of MMTEL as well.
- Go back to main page and then tap on “RCS Configuration” settings. Make sure the underlying options are configured as “Always Connect”.
- (Optional) You can now change the default phone app from Google Phone to Samsung’s stock dialer.
- Enjoy ViLTE and RCS on your unlocked Samsung Galaxy Note 20!
Note that the default video calling option on the stock contacts app still points to Google Duo. You have to make a regular voice call to a contact and select the native video call icon to properly make use of ViLTE. Moreover, you may need to turn off Google Messages’ chat features in order to get RCS working on Samsung Messages.The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is Samsung's answer to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over the past few years, we have witnessed consumer privacy eroded in many ways, too many for us even to begin recounting them. Then, there are never-ending antitrust lawsuits between big corporations and regions like the EU and USA; Facebook’s ongoing straddling of the line between judge and jury; and this year alone, an entire saga where the privacy of Americans has resulted in the expected, then likely, and now probable, sale of TikTok’s western business.

Something Special Is Coming…[Update: Officially rolling out] PayPal integration is finally rolling out for Samsung Pay in the U.S.
Samsung Pay is one of the most popular mobile payment solutions because it utilizes MST to simulate the magnetic stripe of physical credit cards, allowing for the service to be accepted in nearly any store. Your bank and credit card must support Samsung Pay, however, and support for services such as PayPal has been missing even though integration was announced quite several months back. Now, after nearly 9 months since Samsung first announced PayPal support in Samsung Pay, it appears that the integration is finally rolling out for some users in the United States.
PayPal support in Samsung Pay allows for you to use your balance and/or the credit or debit card connected to your account. Some people like to keep to keep money in their PayPal balance instead of in a bank account, so this is perfect for those users who own a Samsung Galaxy flagship and want to use Samsung Pay.
To add a PayPal account, you can select the plus icon at the top right corner of the screen. Then, under “add credit or debit card”, it should say add PayPal. If your phone does not have that option yet, you just need to wait for it to roll out. Currently, it seems to be rolling out to the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 in the U.S. and should be rolling out to other devices and countries soon. I haven’t seen the feature yet on my Samsung Galaxy S9, so it’s possibly going to be a slow roll out. If you do notice this option in the Samsung Pay app, leave a comment below to let us know.Another country is officially joining the shortlist of places that support Google's Android Pay program. After the official announcement during Google I/O 2017, support for Android Pay in Canada is finally rolling out starting today. This confirms earlier rumors that stated Google would unveil Android Pay support on this exact day.

US telecom giant Verizon has entered an agreement with Mexico’s América Móvil to acquire its US-based subsidiary TracFone. TracFone is one of the leading prepaid phone providers in the US and its acquisition is expected to help Verizon expand its portfolio into the value segment. For the unaware, TracFone has been a longtime partner of Verizon, with more than 13 million TracFone subscribers relying on Verizon’s wireless network through an existing wholesale agreement. Following the acquisition, Verizon aims to bring its 4G LTE and 5G networks to TracFone customers, develop its distribution channels, and expand its market opportunities.
As per a press release on Verizon’s website, the “consideration for the transaction will include $3.125 billion in cash and $3.125 billion in Verizon common stock, subject to customary adjustments, at closing.” Additionally, the agreement includes up to $650 million in future cash consideration based on certain predefined performance measures and other arrangements.
In a statement regarding the acquisition, Hans Vestberg, Chairman and CEO of Verizon, said, “This transaction is aligned with what we do best: providing reliable wireless service alongside a best-in-class customer experience…We are excited about the opportunity to bring Tracfone and its brands into the Verizon family where we can put the full support of Verizon behind this business and provide exciting and compelling products into this attractive segment of the market. We are pursuing this important strategic acquisition from a position of strength given our very strong and prudent financial profile.”
The acquisition is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Verizon expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2021.
Via: Yahoo FinanceDownload Google Pixel 3 Live Wallpapers Ported for Android 6.0+
Earlier today, the official Google Pixel 3 wallpapers leaked online along with the Pixel Wallpapers app containing the new Live Wallpapers. While the high-quality still images of the live wallpapers are nice, what people really want are the new Google Pixel 3 Live Wallpapers. The few users who could install the leaked Live Wallpapers APK discovered that some of the wallpapers appeared on the Always on Display on their Google Pixel 2, but most users can’t install it because the APK requires an Android Pie device. Now, XDA Recognized Developer Pranav Pandey has ported the Pixel 3 Live Wallpapers app so it’ll work on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and later.
You may recognize Pranav Pandey from his work on Rotation – Orientation Manager or other open source projects but most importantly, his previous port of the Google Pixel 2 Live Wallpapers last year. He’s back at it again with a port of the Google Pixel 3’s Live Wallpapers—only hours after the wallpapers leaked online yet weeks before the official announcement on October 9th!
There are 28 total wallpapers divided into two groups: “Come Alive” and “Living Universe.” There are 5 sets of wallpapers in the “Coming Alive” group:
- Bloom Cloud, Bloom Sky, Bloom Sunrise
- Bubble Up Lemon, Bubble Up Peach, Bubble Up Plum
- Burst Dusk, Burst Forest, Burst Midnight
- Groove After Dark, Groove Chill, Groove Party
- Pixie Cobalt, Pixie Emerald, Pixie Periwinkle
There are 4 sets of new wallpapers in the “Living Universe” group:
- Bird’s-Eye View, Zion National Park
- Light the Way, Schwyz
- White Sands, Sonoran Desert
- Tropical Voyage, Malolo Barrier Reef
Like the Live Wallpapers pack from the Google Pixel 2, these Live Wallpapers are more than just animated videos playing in the background. They might react to music playback, notifications, time of day, movement, and more. Here’s a preview of the Live Wallpapers you’ll get in this port of the Pixel 3’s Pixel Wallpapers app, which was leaked online by @IshanAgarwal24.
Download Google Pixel 3 Live Wallpapers Port
As noted before, this is a port of the Live Wallpapers from the upcoming Pixel 3 devices. Unlike the original APK which requires you to be on an official Android Pie release or a custom ROM, this should be installable on any ARM64 Android device running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or later. That means if your device is on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Android 7.0 Nougat, Android 7.1 Nougat, Android 8.0 Oreo, or Android 8.1 Oreo, you can enjoy the Google Pixel 3 Live Wallpapers. The developer has split the Live Wallpaper port into two separate versions: One for Android 6.0 – Android 7.1 devices and another for Android 8.0 – Android 8.1 devices. This is because Android 7.1 and below devices can’t support the audio visualization wallpapers (Groove) while Android 8.0 and above devices can.
On some devices from Samsung, Xiaomi, and others, you’ll need to also install the Google Wallpapers app from the Google Play Store to set these live wallpapers. You can download it from the link below.
Lastly, here are the download links to the Live Wallpapers port.
Android 6.0 – Android 7.1

Troubleshooting
The developer states that he had to remove the WallpaperColors API so it would work on older devices. That means the SystemUI color will not change according to the live wallpaper. We highly recommend you visit the XDA forum thread below to stay up to date on the latest developments by Pranav Pandey. If you have any issues with the port, you’ll find the developer active on this thread. If there are any updates to the port, you’ll also find them here.

Android O is chockfull of new features, and one of the most useful ones is Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality. PiP allows videos to play over your screen while using other apps or playing games, and the latest app to add support for this feature is WhatsApp.
In the latest WhatsApp beta for Android (version 2.17.265), the application now allows video calls to be used in PiP mode. Once you start a video call in WhatsApp, pressing your Home button to leave the app will shrink your video call down to a small rectangle that you can move around to any side of your phone’s display. Other applications have implemented PiP functionality before Android O, such as Twitch and even Skype for video calls, but PiP should make it easier for more applications to adopt the feature.
With PiP for WhatsApp, you can continue a video call with someone while looking up notes on Google Keep, searching for a restaurant, or really anything else – all without having to interrupt the call you’re currently in.
PiP in enabled by default in version 2.17.265 of the WhatsApp Android beta, and it’s rolling out now to users that are a part of the beta program. There’s no word as to when PiP will be available outside of the beta, but it shouldn’t be too much longer until that day comes.

Fortnite, the massively popular free-to-play battle royale game, is coming soon to Android. Epic Games said the game would launch this summer but we now know that the game will likely launch as an exclusive on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. It won’t be on the Google Play Store (but possibly on Samsung Galaxy Apps) as the game will be distributed from Epic Games’ website. If you’re wondering whether your Android smartphone or tablet is powerful enough to run Fortnite Mobile on Android, we have put together a comprehensive list of software and hardware requirements based on a configuration file we obtained from a leaked build of the Android app.
In the past week, we posted a list of Android smartphones that might support Fortnite Mobile on Android as well as a set of minimum requirements needed to run the game. The former list was obtained from Epic Games’ mobile sign-up page but is dated back to the release of the iOS version of the game. Hence, it’s a few months old and might not be representative of what devices will actually be capable of running Fortnite. The minimum requirements list is up-to-date as it was recently updated just this week, but it contained few details about exactly which Android devices will be powerful enough to run Fortnite Mobile on Android.
Fortunately, we were able to obtain a full, detailed list of supported hardware. This list is based on an encrypted configuration file within the Fortnite Mobile APK. This list is used by the app to determine whether your device will be allowed to run the app. This is by far the most comprehensive list one can find of supported hardware for Fortnite Mobile on Android. If you are wondering whether your Android smartphone or tablet is able to play Fortnite Mobile, then read on.
Step 1 – Check Your Hardware
Before you can view the tables to determine whether your Android device is capable of running Fortnite, you’ll need to know what hardware is inside your phone. To do so, we’ll need a free app called “DevCheck” from the Google Play Store. It’s made by a trusted developer of the XDA community, XDA Recognized Developer flar2, and you can read all about its features here. (If you already know what hardware is inside your device, you can skip this section.)
Install the app and open it up. We’ll need the following pieces of information from the app:
You can find all of these in the “Hardware” and “System” tabs of the app, as shown in the screenshots below. Find and make note of each of them because you’ll need to reference this information to see if your device is compatible with Fortnite Mobile. You won’t need any other information, but I recommend keeping DevCheck installed on your device because it’s handy to have this information easily accessible in case you want to pull up relevant device information when troubleshooting a problem with developers of any other app!
Step 2 – The Basic Requirements to Run Fortnite Mobile on Android
Now that you know the basics of your Android smartphone or tablet’s hardware, here are the basic requirements your device must meet to be able to play Fortnite Mobile on Android.
|Specification||Requirement|
|Android Version||Android 5.0 Lollipop or newer*|
|CPU Architecture||ARM64 with NEON and Floating Point Render Targets (FPRT) support|
|RAM||3GB RAM or higher|
|OpenGL Version||3.1 or newer|
*The configuration file states that the game runs on Android 4.4 or higher, however, Epic Games likely never updated these lines in the configuration file as the actual installer APK only works on Android 5.0+ and the minimum requirements we leaked earlier also state that Lollipop is the oldest supported Android version.
Furthermore, Epic Games is still working on optimizing the game for certain hardware. According to the comments in the configuration file, the following hardware is currently not compatible with the game:
- Devices with Intel Atom chips.
- Devices with PowerVR GPUs.
- Devices with NVIDIA chips. (We have still listed tables for them below because there’s little doubt these will be made compatible in the future.)
- Devices from HTC, Sony, Motorola, Lenovo, and Essential. (For some undisclosed reason, Epic has blacklisted devices from these brands. The comment implies this may be temporary, though. Also, all non-Samsung hardware is blacklisted anyways until the exclusivity is over, so there’s not much you need to worry about if you own a device from one of the named brands.)
Step 3 – Find Your Hardware
Now, we’re ready to look through each table to see if your smartphone or tablet is able to play Fortnite Mobile on Android. All you need to do is look up your device’s chipset and see if there’s a “Yes” in the Capable column. If it is Capable of running Fortnite Mobile, you can also see what graphics quality Fortnite Mobile will run at by default. Take note that if your device supports the Vulkan Graphics API, then you’ll likely see a graphics quality bump in Fortnite Mobile.

The big buzzword for mobile carriers right now is “5G,” and there’s little chance the marketing and hype will slow down anytime soon. After all, 5G is a great opportunity for carriers to plaster big, impressive-sounding numbers on every billboard and TV commercial. The only problem is that a lot of what they’re hyping up means little to the vast majority of people. Thankfully, two of the biggest offenders of overhyping 5G, AT&T and Verizon, are facing heavy criticism within the industry for misleading consumers.
We’ll start with AT&T, which has already faced its fair share of scrutiny over its bogus “5G Evolution” marketing. T-Mobile and Verizon pushed back against the moniker, and Sprint even went as far as suing the company (though they later settled). Now, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) is recommending that AT&T stop its “5G Evolution” advertising. If you’re not familiar with the BBB, they’re a private, nonprofit organization that was set up with the goal to improve consumer trust in businesses. (The BBB has had its fair share of controversies over favoritism and being generally toothless, but businesses tend to self-adhere to BBB standards or at least listen to consumer complaints filed with the BBB in order to appear better than competitors.)
Why the BBB is relevant to this story is because the National Advertising Review Board, which is part of the BBB, said AT&T should discontinue advertising “5G Evolution” as being “The First Step to 5G.” The panel determined this claim is misleading “reasonable consumers into believing that AT&T is offering a 5G network” when industry tests have found 5G E to be slower than other carriers’ 4G LTE networks. AT&T said it “respectfully disagrees” with the decision, but that it will stop the advertisements nonetheless. More importantly, however, is that AT&T refuses to stop the “5G E” branding on devices, according to LightReading.
Verizon, like AT&T, has its own situation brewing with the BBB. The National Advertising Division of the BBB has told Verizon to stop claiming that it’s “building the most powerful 5G experience for America” and recommends it make it clear to consumers that the availability of its 5G network is very limited. Verizon has agreed to update its disclosures but will appeal the decision on the network construction claims.
Another concern of the NAD is Verizon’s spotty coverage in cities, some of which is only in stadiums and airports. The NAD said that Verizon’s billboards implied 5G coverage was coming wherever the ads were placed and the small print was obscured by colors and video transitions. Humorously, AT&T is the one that brought forth the initial complaint about the misleading Verizon ads.
While AT&T and Verizon are both fielding criticism from the BBB, mobile analytics company OpenSignal has released its 5G report detailing the 5G networks of popular carriers. The report compares network speeds across South Korea, Australia, the UK, and the US. In terms of speed, Verizon came out as the clear winner. The carrier’s Ultra Wideband (mmWave) network had average download speeds of 506 Mbps which was significantly higher than speeds possible with the other US carriers. Sprint averaged 114 Mbps, AT&T had 62 Mbps, and T-Mobile was last with 47 Mbps.
Of course, speed is only one part of the equation. In the case of 5G, coverage is a much bigger issue. OpenSignal’s report also said that Verizon customers are only using 5G 0.5% of the time. This fact harkens back to the BBB and its criticism of Verizon inflating the actual availability of its 5G network. Even if you live in one of the cities that has Verizon’s UWB 5G network, you have to be in a pretty precise location to actually use it. The fact is that it’s just not available for many people, even if they do have a compatible phone.
The other US carriers fared better in terms of coverage area. T-Mobile customers are using 5G 19.8% of the time, while AT&T customers use it 9.7% of the time. This is because both T-Mobile and AT&T have sub-6GHz 5G networks, which are considerably slower than Verizon’s mmWave 5G network but have dramatically better coverage. Still, if you’re only using Verizon’s hyper-fast 5G 0.5% of the time, maybe it’s better to be using the other carriers slower offerings more often? Even then, Verizon’s speed advantages may be slipping away, as PCMag reports that T-Mobile’s recent acquisition of Sprint’s mid-band 5G network have allowed for download speeds to exceed 1Gbps in New York City.
Well that was unexpected… Just two weeks after the 2.5GHz NYC launch, @TMobile upgrades the NR bandwidth from 40 to 60MHz!

5G will continue to be a battleground when it comes to carrier marketing. The data is currently not on the side of the carriers and their boastful claims, however. Right now, consumers just aren’t seeing the benefits that carriers are touting. Did you know, for example, that Verizon just enabled uploads over its 5G network?

As noted industry leaker Evan ‘evleaks’ Blass suggested on his Twitter page, today Google has finally unveiled the next major upgrade for its Android-based smartwatch OS: Android Wear 2.0. This announcement also comes along with the release of the newest Android Wear smartwatches in the form of the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport.
Android Wear 2.0
Personalized Watch Faces
The newest Android Wear update brings in ‘personalized’ watch faces which can pull in various information and variables from different apps. The selection of watch faces also allows for quick switching via a swipe on the watch face, letting users have different watch faces set up and ready for different activities through the day.
Third Party Complications
A complication is defined as a feature in a watch face which displays more than just hours and minutes.
With Android Wear 2.0, watch faces can display extra information without needing code for getting the underlying data. The data is supplied by data providers to any and all watch faces using the Complications API.
This works out to the benefit of both watch face makers as well as app developers. Watch face makers can incorporate data from different apps (like battery level, step counts, calories burnt, weather, time zones and more) as long as the app developer has made provisions for supplying such data through the API. The complication itself also allows the underlying app to be quickly launched and can display information even in ambient mode, so the app developers have plenty of benefits to look forward to as well.
Simpler Navigation
Android Wear 2.0 also brings in improvements in navigation around the UX by simplifying the overall experience. Swiping sideways on a watch face switches the watch face, while swiping up brings up notifications and swiping down brings the settings panel. Pressing on the main hardware button pulls up the simple app list for app launching, while long pressing the button launches Google Assistant.
The update also adds in support for “rotational input”. As the name would imply, this allows the watch to be operated through the watch bezel or the watch crown. Lists are also biased to the sides instead of centered to make better use of rounded displays and make that rotational input more satisfying.
Watch App Store and Standalone Apps
Android Wear 2.0 allows users to choose the apps they want on their watches independent of the choices on their smartphones. The new on-watch Google Play Store showcases apps which are specifically built for the Wear platform and allows downloads directly on the smartwatch by cutting out the phone as the middleman. Moreover, if your watch has cellular capabilities, you can continue using the watch apps without needing your phone nearby.
Standalone Apps are also a big deal for the newest upgrade to the platform. While app functionality would still feature simplistic interfaces for easier navigation on a very limited size display, the workings of the apps would be done on the watch or in the cloud (depending on the functionality asked and expected). The phone is removed from the equation, except for routing data when the watch itself does not have a WiFi or LTE connection available. For most instances, the watch will function as an independent device, to the great benefit of users who would like to leave their phones behind for a while.
As much as standalone apps benefit Android users, it is of even more importance to iPhone users and the iOS platform. By decoupling the need of an Android phone, Android Wear will seek to expand into the territories of the Apple Watch by aiming to be more host-platform independent.
As a bonus, Android Wear is also rumored to be getting a new Google Music App that will allow for music streaming and a new UI.
Google Assistant
Android Wear 2.0 is the newest home for Google Assistant, which is a logical jump in our opinion. Voice commands are one of the basic forms of input on a smartwatch, so a personal voice assistant finds a natural environment for interaction on your wrist. You get all the benefits of Google Assistant directly on your watch as long as you are connected to the Internet. On WiFi and LTE, there is no need for a phone, while you do need a phone to route data via a bluetooth connection.
Google Assistant on Android Wear is available in English and German on Android Wear, with Google promising support for more languages in the coming months.
Improved Message Responses
Wear 2.0 also brings in improvements to message responses. A great deal of improvements come from the fact that the watch is no longer considered a mere accessory to the smartphone experience. The watch is now considered capable of its own communications through WiFi and LTE. As AndroidPolice reports, Android Wear 2.0 should improve the reaction times of voice input and transcription.
As they explain, prior Android Wear versions routed all smartwatch interaction data through the smartphone. By making Google Assistant a native feature of Android Wear 2.0, Google has removed the crutches of disability that came in the form of the smartphone over-dependence for the wearable platform. Android Wear 2.0 runs Google Assistant on the watch, allowing faster voice input and transcription, and as a result, faster response times.
Contextual replies, as seen in Inbox and Google Allo, will also play a crucial part in the new Android Wear experience. These improvements will be noticeable on all devices which will receive Android Wear 2.0, and not just the new generation of smartwatches.
Last but not the least, in case you are not satisfied with the current input methods, Android Wear 2.0 also adds in handwriting recognition and a full QWERTY keyboard as part of the OS.
Android Pay
The next headlining feature of Android Wear 2.0 is the addition of Android Pay capabilities to the smartwatch. Sadly, Android Pay does need NFC as a special hardware requirement, which means that it won’t be available in a lot of legacy watch hardware.
On the LG Watch Sport which comes with Android Wear 2.0 and NFC, Android Pay works in a familiar manner as that on smartphones. As AndroidPolice reports, you need to re-add your cards as the watch is registered as a new device. To ease up the pain of input, you can make use of a connected smartphone as an input device.
You also need to setup a lockscreen on your watch as it now holds confidential information related to payments, and hence, calls for added security to avoid accidents. Android Pay needs a lockscreen-unlocked watch to function, but it isn’t as inconvenient as it sounds as Android Wear does a good job at keeping your watch unlocked while it is on your wrist.
To Pay, open up the Android Pay app, select your card and tap and pay on the terminal.
Improvements to Google Fit
Google has refocused on the Fitness aspects of smartwatches with this update. The updated Google Fit on Wear 2.0 offers new exercise options as well as challenges for users. Coupled with the support for additional sensors, the newest Android Wear smartwatches can now track diverse activities with much more accuracy.
Android Wear 2.0 is rightfully the biggest upgrade to the wearable platform. But how the consumers react to the latest update is something that only upcoming sales figures would indicate. Is this update enough to rekindle the fire of owning a smartwatch? Source: GoogleGoogle Camera offers one of the greatest experiences when it comes to smartphone photography. Even though the camera hardware has remained unchanged for several generations of Pixel smartphones, each new device gets new and exciting software features. With the recent launch of the Pixel 5 and the Pixel 4a 5G, Google introduced several new Camera...Motion Stills – the iOS App for Stabilizing Live Photos – is now on Android
Apple’s Live Photos feature was met with mostly positive feedback when it was first released with the iPhone 6S, and a year after its release, Google made it even better with the Motion Stills app in 2016. Motion Stills essentially took Live Photos from iOS and turned them into video and GIF files that were much easier to share, and after great demand from the community, Google is now bringing its Motional Stills app to Android.
Motion Stills obviously has to work slightly different on Android since there’s no Live Photos data to work with, but the way that Google has gone about this is pretty sleek. Upon opening the Android app, you’ll be able to record short clips from the built-in viewfinder. A Motion Still is captured with a single tap of the screen, or you can record longer shots with the new Fast Forward feature that turns lengthier clips into shorter ones that are easier to share. Playback speed can even be adjusted (from 1X to 8X) after recording with the Fast Forward feature.
Along with the release of Motion Stills on Android, Google has also revamped the way that the app processes GIFs/videos you capture with the app. Each individual frame that you capture with Motion Stills is processed as it is recorded, and when this is combined with intermediate motion metadata, Google is able to get Motion Stills to instantly stabilize your recording while also creating the iconic looping sequence found in GIFs. The Android app also comes with a new trimming algorithm that helps guard against pocket shots and camera shakes.
If you want to give the Motion Stills app a try, you can download it for free from the Google Play Store. No Internet connection is required to use the app, but you will need to make sure your phone is running Android 5.1 Lollipop or later.

It was just last week when Google announced Android Pay was finally being launched in Hong Kong. The company has been working at a slow but steady pace to expand Android Pay around the world, and they’ve also been working to add support for more local banks as time goes by.
Now, the company has just announced a new partnership with both Visa and MasterCard that will allow Android Pay to be used on a lot more online websites.
Visa has a service called Visa Checkout while MasterCard has their own online service called Masterpass. Similarly to Android Pay, Visa Checkout and Masterpass are services that make it quicker and easier for customers to pay for online purchases. Masterpass is currently available in 25 countries with over 250,000 merchants using it, while Visa Checkout is available in 16 countries with over 225,000 merchants employing the system.
With this new partnership, Android Pay will now be accepted on hundreds of thousands of new websites around the world. Just like all Android Pay purchases, customers will be able to complete their transaction using their phone or tablet’s preferred authentication method instead of remembering usernames and passwords. This reduces the friction points of the checkout process for websites and apps, and has proven to increase sales and improve customer satisfaction.
For those curious, Google has even included a couple of case studies from applications like Fancy and Luxe that can be checked out both here and here (PDFs). These case studies show that merchants who include an Android Pay option at checkout see faster checkout times, fewer abandoned carts, higher conversions and increased sales. Naturally, these results will vary from app to app and website to website, but it has proven to be beneficial to both the customer and the merchant.

Google and Amazon have become fierce competitors in the past few years, competing for dominance on a lot of things such as artificial intelligence, voice assistants, and the smart TV ecosystem. They’ve even tried to take on Google’s dominance in the smartphone marketplace. In the case of smart TVs, though, Google’s Android TV is challenged by Amazon’s Fire TV devices–while this space is currently dominated by Roku, Amazon still has a small, yet considerable lead over Google here. This fierce competition has also led to some services from one company not being available on the other company’s devices, but this has been slowly changing. Now, YouTube TV, Google’s live TV streaming service, is becoming available on some Fire TV devices.
Amazon took to their Fire TV blog to announce the news today. The YouTube TV app, in case you don’t know, allows users to get access to live TV and over 70 channels from cable networks and local networks such as FOX, CBS, and ABC, all without the hassle of cable boxes and contracts. You tune into YouTube TV using your Internet connection. YouTube TV is also available on other popular platforms such as Roku, Apple TV, and (obviously) Android TV, as well as consoles like the Xbox One. Now, it’s also available on Fire TV devices, allowing more users to access Google’s TV platform. The list of compatible devices includes:
- Fire TV Stick (2nd Gen)
- Fire TV Stick 4K
- Fire TV Cube (1st/2nd Gen)
- Toshiba, Insignia, Element, and Westinghouse Fire TV Edition Smart TVs
- Fire TV (2nd Gen)
- Fire TV (3rd Gen, Pendant Design)
If you want to check out YouTube TV on your Fire TV and download it, then be sure to hop into Amazon’s app store to download it to your device right now.

Huawei has been striving to give several reasons for users to buy its phones despite the unavailability of Google’s apps. It has been bolstering its own App Gallery as a replacement for the Google Play Store by onboarding several third-party applications like HERE WeGo Maps to run on its devices. Against all odd, Huawei launched its flagship P40 series in March this year featuring a 50MP UltraVision camera with RYYB sensor and a 32MP selfie camera across all three models, including Huawei P40, P40 Pro, and P40 Pro+. Huawei has also been releasing frequent EMUI updates to improve the camera.
Earlier this month, Huawei pushed the EMUI 10.1.0.131 update for its flagship Huawei P40 series, adding Petal Search as well as improvements to the Camera app. Huawei is now rolling out another update (EMUI v10.1.0.140) for the Huawei P40 Pro and Pro+ smartphones bringing new features for taking better night selfies and photographs.
The most interesting of the new features that arrive on the Huawei P40 Pro series with the EMUI 10.1.0.140 update includes “smart eye-tracking.” As per the changelog, the feature can “quickly and intelligently track human eyes” in case of both – still selfies and selfie videos. The feature is claimed to work perfectly whether you’re close to the phone or at a distance. This could be possible because of the front-facing IR depth sensor on the two smartphones.
Huawei has also upgraded the Super Night portrait mode 3.0 on the P40 series. With this update, the feature will capture more details and more accurate skin tone while capturing portraits at night.
Lastly, Huawei has added optimizations for selfie videos for users who use a light ring while recording videos for vlogs or TikTok videos. The new “ring light compensation” feature will improve the lighting conditions and make up for any lack of light while recording selfie videos, especially when you’re far from the light.

Owing to the political situation between Huawei and the USA, the company was forced to release the Mate 30 Pro without the most crucial part of Android — Google Play Services. Huawei had no alternative to the proprietary Google Mobile Services (GMS) for the device and as such, the device took a huge hit in sales. Earlier this year in November though, we got our first look at Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) and HMS Core — the company’s in-house alternative to GMS, consisting of both user-facing apps and background apps. HMS aims to provide users with an experience that’s consistent across devices and independent of the platform update. And much like how GMS is made up of app elements and core elements, the HMS ecosystem comprises of HMS Apps, the HMS Core, and the HMS Capabilities that the Core enables through its available APIs. While HMS still hasn’t made an appearance on any Huawei device yet, a senior official from the company has now revealed that it will be rolled out with the Huawei P40 series next year.
Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei Technologies Consumer Business Group, has confirmed to Frandroid that the Huawei P40 will be launched towards the end of March during an event in Paris and it will feature the HMS ecosystem. Yu further revealed that the P40 series will offer users a completely new design, improved imaging props, better performance, and improved AI capabilities. Much like all smartphones launching next year, the Huawei P40 will run Android 10 out of the box with the company’s EMUI 10 skin on top. Interestingly, Yu also promised that the upcoming smartphone will be marketed via the classic distribution channels, operators and resellers included, which suggests that the company is planning a wide-scale release despite the recent setbacks.

Featured image: Huawei P30 ProBack in April, the LineageOS team released LineageOS 17.1 with Android 10 as the base. Since then, we’ve seen several devices receive official support from this popular custom ROM distribution, including Google's Pixel lineup. Most recently, the Redmi K20 (also known as the Xiaomi Mi 9T in some regions), Samsung Galaxy S5, and Samsung Galaxy...EMUI 10.1.0.131 update on the Huawei P40 adds Petal Search to help you find apps and a picture-in-picture frame to help you zoom past 15X
Huawei’s flagship P40 series launched with the company’s latest custom Android skin — EMUI 10.1 — earlier this year in March. Shortly after the launch, Huawei rolled out EMUI 10.1.0.121 to the devices, which brought some camera improvements, a new Huawei Assistant top-level setting, and the Android security patches for April 2020. The new Huawei Assistant setting led us to believe that the company would soon roll out its Celia voice assistant to the devices. As expected, the voice assistant was enabled on the P40 series just a few days after the update started rolling out. Now, the company is pushing another major update for the Huawei P40 series, which adds a few more useful features into the mix.
Huawei has started rolling out EMUI 10.1.0.131 to the Huawei P40 series which adds a new Petal Search app to help you find apps that aren’t yet available in the Huawei AppGallery. The app searches through various online app sources like APKPure, Aptoide, APKMonk, and others, which is quite handy given that the devices don’t ship with the Google Play Store. The app comes with a home screen widget that you can use to look up apps quickly, and it also supports checking for updates to apps that you have installed on your device.
The Petal Search app is divided into three tabs — For You, Search, and Me. The For You tab features the search bar at the top, along with trending news posts sourced from Microsoft News. The Search tab lists down some of the most popular local and essential apps that you can download. In case you don’t find the app you’re looking for in the lists, you can easily search for any app using the search bar at the top. The tab also stores your search history which is displayed right underneath the search bar. Searching for any app lists down all the apps related to that keyword and, if you still don’t find the right app, you get the option to look it up using Bing. And finally, the Me tab houses the Search history, an Incognito mode, Downloads, and Settings.
Along with the new Petal Search app, the latest EMUI 10.1 update adds a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) preview frame in the viewfinder on the stock camera app. As you can see in the attached video, the PiP frame pops up when the zoom level is set to 15x or higher, making it easier for you to focus on objects while zoomed in. Furthermore, the update includes enhancements for the Huawei Golden Snap feature which is expected to improve the quality and colors of photos taken in certain conditions for more natural and authentic effects. Here’s the complete changelog for EMUI 10.1.0.131:
- CameraAdds a Picture-in-Picture preview frame in the viewfinder when the zoom level is set to 15x or higher to help you focus.Enhances the Huawei Golden Snap feature. Improves the quality and colors of photos taken in certain situations for more natural and authentic effects.
- SystemT-Mobile launches the first nationwide standalone (SA) 5G network
Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are competing to deliver next-generation 5G connectivity to hundreds of millions of Americans. While Verizon is deploying its high-throughput, low-latency mmWave network in new U.S. cities every month, T-Mobile and AT&T are rapidly expanding their slower but more accessible sub-6GHz networks across the country. T-Mobile, in particular, has aggressively upgraded its 5G network after acquiring Sprint’s 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum. Now, the carrier has announced a major milestone in its 5G deployment efforts: The rollout of a nationwide standalone 5G network.
For those unfamiliar, the vast majority of 5G networks around the world are considered non-standalone (NSA) as 5G radios are broadcast using existing 4G LTE infrastructure as the backbone. While that allows carriers to more quickly provide 5G access thanks to the broad availability of existing 4G infrastructure, the downside is that download, upload, and latency won’t meeting consumer expectations of next-generation 5G connectivity.
AT&T is using a technique called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) to operate both 4G LTE and 5G NR simultaneously on the same network band, but this is only a stopgap solution to ease the carrier’s transition from a non-standalone to a standalone (SA) 5G network. T-Mobile, however, doesn’t need to use DSS (which incurs performance penalties), as it has a lot of mid-band spectrum in which it can offer 5G service.
Now, T-Mobile is leveraging its extensive cellular spectrum holdings to be the first to deploy a nationwide SA 5G network. The company is boasting up to 40% lower latency and 20-30% faster download and upload speeds while testing its new SA 5G network, according to VentureBeat citing T-Mobile VP Karri Kuoppamaki. In addition, T-Mobile says that they’ve expanded 5G coverage by 30%, allowing them to provide service to nearly 250 million Americans in over 7,500 cities across 1.3 million square miles. This expanded coverage is now possible because, under T-Mobile’s new SA 5G network, a 600MHz 5G signal can cover much more distance from a single tower. In contrast, under T-Mobile’s previous NSA 5G network, 600MHz 5G was combined with mid-band LTE to access the core network, so the 5G signal could only travel as far as the mid-band LTE signal.
VentureBeat states that T-Mobile will continue to operate its NSA 5G network as it transitions to full SA 5G coverage.
One of the other benefits of SA 5G for consumers may be improved smartphone battery life. That’s because, according to VentureBeat, smartphones connected to standalone 5G networks won’t need to simultaneously have their 4G LTE and 5G NR radios active. Many existing 5G smartphones support SA 5G, though not every device will be capable of connecting to T-Mobile’s new 5G network. Sprint and T-Mobile devices with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X55 modem will for sure be capable of connecting to the new network.New BlackBerry smartphone with a physical keyboard and 5G is coming in 2021
BlackBerry once occupied position as the maker of one of the more coveted pieces of technology to own, but the company and the brand have fallen a long way since then. When the company lost its market share in the smartphone market, it opted to license its name in 2016, letting other smartphone manufacturers design smartphones under the brand name. TCL took up the opportunity with devices like the KEYone, Motion, KEY2, and KEY2 LE, but the company had to stop using the BlackBerry name as its agreement came to an end this month. But if you are still yearning to own a BlackBerry device, a new company has picked up the mantle, promising new BB-branded smartphones with 5G connectivity and physical keyboards.
OnwardMobility has announced a licensing partnership with BlackBerry and FIH Mobile Limited (a subsidiary of Foxconn), which allows OnwardMobility to develop, engineer, and produce a new 5G-enabled BlackBerry-branded smartphone. The only other pieces of information available on this smartphone, apart from a part of its name, are the facts that it will have a physical keyboard and that it will come to Europe and North America in the first half of 2021.
“Enterprise professionals are eager for secure 5G devices that enable productivity, without sacrificing the user experience. BlackBerry smartphones are known for protecting communications, privacy, and data. This is an incredible opportunity for OnwardMobility to bring next-generation 5G devices to market with the backing of BlackBerry and FIH Mobile.”
The press release appears to be leaning into the needs of the enterprise market, as more and more employees are currently working remotely with critical data and applications.
“BlackBerry is thrilled OnwardMobility will deliver a BlackBerry 5G smartphone device with physical keyboard leveraging our high standards of trust and security synonymous with our brand. We are excited that customers will experience the enterprise and government level security and mobile productivity the new BlackBerry 5G smartphone will offer.”
As part of the agreement, FIH Mobile will design and manufacture the smartphone, while OnwardMobility will conduct product planning and market development. BlackBerry, on the other hand, leverages its name and reputation. It remains to be seen how far forward can the name survive on its own.Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite 5G announced with Snapdragon 765G and 48MP camera
Earlier today, Xiaomi announced the Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro. These are the company’s latest flagship devices with high-end specifications such as the Snapdragon 865 SoC, 108MP cameras, and 90Hz displays. The company also announced a more affordable phone, the Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite 5G. Let’s take a look at what this device has to offer.
Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite 5G Specifications
|Specifications||Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite 5G|
|Dimensions & Weight|
|Display||6.57-inch AMOLED|
|SoC||Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G|
|RAM & Storage|
|Battery||4160mAh, 20W fast charging|
|Fingerprint||In-display|
|Rear Cameras|
|Front Camera|
|Android Version||Android 10|
|Colors||White, Gray, Blue/Green|
As you can see from the chart above, Xiaomi did not share all of the specifications for the Mi 10 Lite 5G today. What we do know about the device is pretty compelling. Like the Nokia 8.3 5G announced earlier this month, the device features the Snapdragon 765G with 5G connectivity. Xiaomi is also including the company’s LiquidCool system to help with performance.
In terms of display, we know it’s 6.57-inches, AMOLED, and has a waterdrop notch. Xiaomi did not share the resolution or refresh rate of the display. Speaking of the notch, the Mi 10 Lite 5G has a 16MP selfie camera and there is an in-display fingerprint scanner as well. As this is a budget device, it’s most likely an optical scanner.
The Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite 5G has a quad-camera setup on the back, but we only know the details of the main shooter. The primary camera is 48MP and it’s joined by three other cameras with unknown specifications. We assume there will some combination of a wide-angle camera, telephoto camera, macro lens, or depth sensor. Some of the features of the cameras can be seen in the graphic below.
Lastly, Xiaomi says there will be 64GB and 128GB storage options. The battery is 4,160mAh and it supports 20W fast charging. The color options will be white, gray, and a blue/green gradient. The last, and maybe most important, detail that was announced was the price. Xiaomi will be offering the Mi 10 Lite 5G for just €349 ($387) starting on April 7th and 15th in parts of Europe.Shortly after the OnePlus 8 Series was unveiled earlier this year, the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro officially went on sale in the US through OnePlus' website, Amazon, T-Mobile, and Verizon. While users on other carriers could purchase unlocked devices from OnePlus' website or Amazon, the lack of carrier partnership meant that users had...Android Pay Tests Notifications for All Credit Card Purchases
Android Pay, Google’s contactless payment method, allows for ease of purchase of many goods and services in many countries across the world and in partnership with thousands of banks. Google offers a similar service in the form of Tez in India, and there are other contactless payment providers in various different countries. Now Google is looking to enhance their Android Pay service once more by testing notifications for all credit card purchases.
If you’ve ever bought anything with PayPal while the PayPal app is installed on your device, you’ll know that when you purchase an item through your PayPal account that you will receive a notification saying that you paid a certain amount to whatever company it was. It’s a security feature and also a pretty neat way to tell how much you paid when you purchase things in other currencies, as it will also convert it to your local currency. This is by and large a security feature, however, and Google will now be implementing it too, along with a little extra.

As can be seen in the screenshots above, not only are there some notification configurations for your purchases, but Android Pay actually shows you non-Android Pay transactions depending on the bank that you’re with. This allows you to keep track of your transactions easily, and manage purchases too within the same app as you presumably may use the service when out and about. As you can see, there are quite a lot of options including loyalty and gift card notifications too, and a notification telling you that you’re actually near an Android Pay supporting store! All of this should help you stay aware of how much you’re spending, and keep track of how that money is being spent. It can also help you spot suspicious activity should someone get access to your credit card details. This feature does not seem to be out for everyone yet, but hopefully it’ll make its way to your device soon!

Motorola burst back into the flagship scene earlier this year with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865-powered, 5G-enabled Motorola Edge+. Alongside the Edge+, Motorola also unveiled the slightly cheaper Edge with the upper mid-range (but still 5G-enabled) Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G. And about a month ago, Motorola had announced an even more affordable 5G-enabled smartphone in the form of the Moto G 5G Plus. Now, Motorola is bringing over this smartphone to the USA in the form of the Motorola One 5G.

The Motorola One 5G is a rebranded Moto G 5G Plus, but we’re okay with the rebranding because that was a terrible name in the first place. One of the highlights of this device is its 21:9 aspect ratio display. Motorola mentions that 87% of its users preferred a 21:9 aspect ratio, so that is what it adopted on this smartphone. You do get a 90Hz refresh rate, though the panel is LCD — but since this phone is not aiming to be a flagship, this specification isn’t judged as harshly. The smartphone itself has a humble design made largely out of polycarbonate, so most of the 207g weight is coming from the beefy 5,000 mAh battery.
Moto G 5G Plus / Motorola One 5G XDA Forums
On the inside, you get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G, which should help keep things running smoothly despite not being an 8-series flagship SoC.
The Motorola One 5G comes with Android 10 out of the box. The OS is largely left unadulterated, but you get a few Motorola touches like the “chop to launch flashlight” feature and the Moto Power Touch feature that lets you reassign the double-power-button press. The power button also integrates the fingerprint sensor.
Motorola is only committing to one year of Android OS updates and two years of security updates at this moment.
Pricing and Availability
The Motorola One 5G will be a sub-$500 device in the USA and will be available through AT&T (sub-6GHz) and Verizon (with mmWave) in 4GB + 128GB configuration. The AT&T model will launch later this month while the Verizon model will launch in October, the latter presumably at a higher price due to the added costs of mmWave antennas and RF components. There will not be any unlocked versions of this phone in the USA.
Update 1: AT&T
The AT&T Motorola One 5G is launching September 18th at a retail price of $444.99. “Well qualified customers” can pay $5 a month for 30 months to get the device at over half off its retail price when adding a new line on an AT&T unlimited wireless plan. The device will be available on AT&T in its Oxford Blue color.
Update 2: Verizon
On a blog post, Verizon confirmed that the Motorola One 5G can be picked up starting today for a retail price of $549.99 or $22.91 a month for 24 months on a device payment plan. The device is compatible with Verizon’s 5G Ultrawide Band (mmWave) and new 5G Nationwide (sub-6GHz) network.XDA Coordinated Disclosure Policy

In the world of mobile payment systems, Google had a bit of an identity crisis until earlier this year. Their services once included Android Pay, Google Wallet, and Pay with Google. The Android Pay app was a digital wallet that used NFC to make payments. Google Wallet was a peer-to-peer payment service for people to send and receive money. Pay with Google used the Google Payment API to allow users to make payments via Google Assistant or web browsers with any card on file with their Google account. To reduce confusion, Google introduced the “Google Pay” brand at the beginning of 2018 to unify these services. However, Google Wallet remained a separate app (though it was rebranded as “Google Pay Send”). Now, it seems that the Google Pay Send features are nearly ready to be integrated into the main app.
Google Pay services. Source: Google.
We were told this integration would be happening back during the initial rollout of the Pay service. Specifically, the integration would be rolling out “within the next few months,” though we haven’t heard any further news in the four months that have passed. Regardless, it appears that the former Google Wallet features are already fully functional in the standard Pay app, and furthermore, the peer-to-peer payments even work in the United Kingdom (the Pay Send app doesn’t work in the U.K.)
The integration was discovered by XDA Recognized Developer Quinny899 (Kieron Quinn of Mighty Quinn Apps) and confirmed by us. With the Google Pay Send app uninstalled, we were able to activate the peer-to-peer payment functionality within the standard app and successfully send a payment. As you can see in the screenshots below, a new “send money” tab appears in the bottom toolbar. Tapping on this brings us to a page where we can send or request money from either an existing contact or new contact. Even a group request can be made on this page.
Once this feature rolls out in the U.S. and U.K., you’ll no longer need to install the separate Google Pay Send app to take advantage of the peer-to-peer payment functionality. For now, you’ll have to keep both apps installed if you want to send or receive money to or from other people.
We’ll keep an eye out on any new Pay features that we spot. The service continues to become more useful over time with new features like support for mobile boarding passes and event tickets (…almost like a wallet, no?) and sending money via Google Assistant.YouTube App Prepares to Add Additional Filter Options in Search Results
Google’s Android YouTube app has been lacking several of its desktop counterparts feature-set for some time (though the desktop version itself lacks from pretty major features), but it seems that Google is prepared to introduce some new filter options within the YouTube’s app’s search feature that will now allow you to filter by rating, relevance, and view count. These new features were pulled from strings found within the most recent YouTube app update, version 11.20.54. However, we haven’t seen these new filter options show up within the app itself, so it’s anyone’s guess when these new options will roll out to users.
Disclaimer: The evidence we dig up from the APK file of an app is not definitive. Google may choose to pull these features without any indication in a future release.
YouTube Filter Options
On the YouTube desktop website, you have a much wider variety of filter options available to you. On the Android version however, you only have the ability to filter by date, duration, content type, or quality. Digging into the APK file for the recent YouTube app update reveals the following strings:
<string name="by_rating_search">Rating</string>
<string name="by_relevance_search">Relevance</string>
<string name="by_view_count_search">View count</string>
These are all fairly straight-forward to decipher, but it’s nice to see that we’ll soon be getting additional search options within the YouTube app. Being able to filter videos by rating, relevance, and view count should open the door for users to take control of what kinds of videos they’re shown and ensure that only highly popular and/or well-liked videos are shown in your search results.
Before, the search options were woefully inadequate on mobile devices, which is major issue for Google seeing as according to their own official statistics over half of all views on YouTube come from mobile devices.
That’s all we’ve found in the latest YouTube update. Stay tuned for future posts in our series when we investigate what’s new and what’s coming in Google’s Apps.OnePlus 7T Kernel Sources are now available
Whether you like OnePlus as a brand and for their recent pricing strategies, or not, one cannot deny that OnePlus devices are one of the easiest-to-mod devices currently available in the market, with a thriving community existing for even older releases. OnePlus has been receptive towards the needs of the developer community, promising timely kernel source releases, among other things. OnePlus released the kernel sources of the OnePlus 7 and the OnePlus 7 Pro shortly after their release, and the company is keeping up with the tradition with the OnePlus 7T by releasing its kernel source as well.
OnePlus 7T XDA Forums
OxygenOS on OnePlus comes with its own thoughtful additions and features, but even then, it may not be enough for the needs of every single user. OnePlus recognizes this possibility, thus allowing users to easily unlock their bootloaders without any wait times or without voiding their warranty, and allowing very easy methods to root the device. Further, timely kernel source releases allows developers and power users to dive deeper into the code that runs the device, figuring out different ways (and even better ways in some cases) to achieve different goals. Kernel source releases are also helpful for the device bring-up process for AOSP-based custom ROMs such as LineageOS as well as for custom recoveries like TWRP, which in turn forms the base for further custom ROM experiences.
The kernel sources for the OnePlus 7T are now available on this Github page.
The OnePlus 7T comes with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus SoC, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB/256GB of UFS 3.0 storage. The highlights of this new device is the 90Hz 6.55″ FHD+ AMOLED display with HDR 10+ support, and a new triple rear camera module now comprising of a 48MP main sensor, as well as a 16MP wide-angle camera and a 12MP telephoto camera. You can know more about the device in Mario’s review or Sandeep’s camera overview.

The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is one of the most popular streaming dongles from Amazon. It not only unlocks 4K video capabilities for connected devices but also brings support for HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos. Earlier this year, the device even received support for Miracast screen mirroring via an update and now, developers have been able to successfully unlock its bootloader, opening up even more possibilities.
In a recent post, XDA Senior Member k4y0z highlights the exploit using which you can unlock the bootloader of your Fire TV Stick 4K. However, the process isn’t as simple as you may think. The method, which makes use of a boot ROM-exploit discovered by XDA Senior Member xyz, requires you to open up the dongle and make some hardware changes.
The exploit works pretty much like the one used for the Fire TV Stick 2nd gen and to begin with you’ll have to open the device, remove the heat shield on the side without the antennas, and then short specific points on the board. Additionally, you’ll need a patched Linux-kernel on your PC which has conveniently been included in a live-ISO. You can download the ISO from the post and burn it to a CD or USB flash drive before proceeding with the instructions.
In a nutshell, the process involves downloading the ISO, connecting your Fire TV Stick to a computer with a USB cable and running some commands. The shorting essentially puts the device in a state where it’s capable of receiving said commands and can easily be achieved by holding something conductive to the point marked DAT0 in the image above.
Since the process is a bit tricky and requires physical modification, it’s safe to say that it isn’t meant for beginners and will most definitely void the warranty. The developers also advise that users should disable OTA updates, even though TWRP will allow full updates to install without any issues. Users are also advised to steer clear of apps and methods that flash boot and recovery images from within FireOS. Users in the thread have reported success with rooting via Magisk.

Android Messages is Google’s default messaging application on its Nexus and Pixel devices. The app is also the avenue through which Google is pushing for the next evolution in messaging: RCS. Recently, the third-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, Huawei, announced that they would integrate Android Messages on their smartphones. With all of this in mind, there’s a lot to be excited for once RCS support starts rolling out more broadly. And within Android Messages 2.9 are hints at more major features that may be coming: a web interface for sending messages on desktop Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers, and possibly the ability to make payments directly in the app.
Android Messages 2.9 Hints at Web Interface for Sending Messages
Perhaps the most significant new feature hinted at in this recent update is a web interface for Android Messages. Google Allo received a web interface for sending messages, but a web interface for Messages would be far more significant since it would potentially allow you to send actual SMS on your desktop or laptop device.
According to the strings, you will scan a QR code in order to pair your phone with your PC (much like how Google Allo’s web integration functions.)

We managed to partially enable the feature which brings up the feature in the app, but actually clicking on it causes a crash (which according to the logcat is caused by a null pointer exception, telling me it hasn’t been fully implemented yet). I also attempted to enter the new interface by manually starting the new unexported “
com.google.android.apps.messaging/com.google.android.apps.messaging.ui.ditto.DittoActivity ” activity, but that results in the same crash.
The desktop web browsers that this new interface will support include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Apple Safari. That’s the list for now, though notably there’s a category for “other” and “unknown” so it’s likely that many more browsers will work with this feature.

<string name="delete_all_paired_desktops_dialog_title">Sign out of all computers?</string> <string name="delete_paired_desktop_button_content_description">Delete paired desktop: %s</string> <string name="delete_paired_desktop_dialog_title">Sign out from %s?</string> <string name="delete_paired_desktop_negative_button_text">Cancel</string> <string name="delete_paired_desktop_positive_button_text">Sign out</string> <string name="desktop_browser_type_chrome">Chrome</string> <string name="desktop_browser_type_edge">Edge</string> <string name="desktop_browser_type_firefox">Firefox</string> <string name="desktop_browser_type_ie">Internet Explorer</string> <string name="desktop_browser_type_opera">Opera</string> <string name="desktop_browser_type_other">Other</string> <string name="desktop_browser_type_safari">Safari</string> <string name="desktop_browser_type_unknown">Unknown</string>
One of the strings tells us that there will be a foreground notification telling you that you are connected to a desktop computer. This suggests to me that you’ll have to manually connect to your PC each time you want to send messages over a web browser; it sounds annoying at first glance, but it was probably done for security reasons.
<string name="ditto_foreground_service_notification_title">Connected to desktop</string>
Fortunately, it does seem like it will remember any computers you paired with last time, so you may not have to scan a QR code each and every time—just authenticate yourself by enabling the feature in the Android Messages app.

Sending Payments over Android Messages
It appears that a future update may make it easy to send payments to services via text messages. We’re not sure exactly how it would work, but it is likely that it would integrate with Google Pay.
<string name="rbm_bot_turned_off_from_preferences">To send messages to %s, turn on chat features</string> <string name="rbm_payments_activity_name">Payments Summary</string> <string name="rbm_payments_checkout">CHECKOUT</string> <string name="rbm_payments_summary_order_title">Order summary</string> <string name="rbm_payments_summary_total">Total</string> <string name="wallet_buy_button_place_holder">Buy with Google</string>
There’s a new activity associated with this which will show you your payments summary. I was unable to access this because it crashes, unfortunately, so I cannot show you what it would look like.
New strings also show that you can send and request money from other users, which isn’t a new feature of messaging apps, but with how ubiquitous Google’s messaging app is, it would open up such a system to millions of new users.
<string name="c2o_gpay_money_request_button_text">Request</string> <string name="c2o_gpay_money_send_button_text">Send</string>
Google Enhanced Messaging Features
Finally, there are hints at new chat features that may be separate from the existing smart reply feature or the other advanced features that RCS already offer such as sending messages over WiFi, seeing responses in real time, and having read receipts. The strings state that you can share photos in high-quality, and possibly enable other features in Settings –> Advanced –> Chat features. It isn’t yet clear what these features may be, though, and it’s unlikely we’ll find out anytime soon.

Conclusion
That’s all that we found in the latest Android Messages app. If we find anything else, we will update this article accordingly. We don’t expect any of these mentioned features to roll out any time soon—if at all. Google Allo’s web interface was teased in February of last year and it took several months to roll out—Messages’ web interface hasn’t even gotten to the teasing part.
Still, we’re hopeful that Google’s standard messaging app becomes more useful in the future. With encroachment by the likes of Amazon, competitors in the messaging space such as Telegram and Whatsapp, and the continued shift towards enterprise with Hangouts, Android users desperately need a well-integrated messaging solution.
You can download the latest version of the app from the Play Store which can be installed on any Android device, but keep in mind the update will be rolling out incrementally to all users. It’s too bad there’s no “check for updates” button in the Play Store like there is in settings!

Samsung is gearing up for a rather busy 2017. The inevitable launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 is enough reason to keep Android enthusiasts excited, but Samsung seems to have more in store for their fans.
Samsung Pay – Coming soon to India
A new report from Mashable mentions that Samsung is working to bring Samsung Pay to India soon. For those not in the know, India has undergone demonetization of a very large part of its currency creating a short term liquidity crunch in the country. This was the perfect situation for the launch of a digital wallet platform, as can be demonstrated by PayTM and their meteoric growth post-demonetization.
The short term liquidity woes in the country have been relieved in urban areas, so Samsung might have missed the prime time. Nonetheless, India does not play host to other global digital wallet solutions like Apple Pay or Android Pay, which still works in Samsung’s favor.
Samsung Pay is tipped to be launching in the first half of 2017. Samsung has partnered with American Express (Amex) for the initial launch while collaboration efforts are underway for Visa and MasterCard as well. Samsung Pay is limited to higher-end devices in the Galaxy lineup, though, which could be a limiting factor in its success. However, Samsung does have MST technology to rely on, which is one of the most commonly found payment terminal technology in urban India.
Samsung Pay Mini – An Online Solution
The next bit of news actually comes directly from Samsung. Samsung has officially announced Samsung Pay Mini for Android in South Korea, with the service launching in the country within Q1 2017.
Samsung Pay Mini will work with any Android device as long as it has an HD or higher resolution display and Android 5.0 Lollipop or higher, both of which are easily met requirements.
The difference between Samsung Pay and Samsung Pay Mini is in offline payments. Samsung Pay Mini is restricted to payment for online services, while necessary Samsung hardware in the form of a supported Galaxy device is needed for regular Samsung Pay and offline service payments.
Samsung Pay Mini will be undergoing a pre-trial test on February 6th in South Korea. The service will eventually roll out to other regions, but there is no time frame mentioned for its release.
What are your thoughts on Samsung Pay launch in India, and the concept of Samsung Pay Mini as a watered-down payment solution? Let us know in the comments below!

SARS-CoV-2, also known colloquially as just the coronavirus, has wreaked havoc across the world. Many countries shut down large parts of the economy in order to contain the spread of the virus. As countries reopen their economies, many health experts fear a “second wave”, ie. resurgence, of COVID-19. To prevent a second wave, public health experts are advocating that nations adopt contact tracing, ie. tracing all the people who have recently come into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 and then undertaking steps to isolate those individuals. Contact tracing is difficult to implement correctly without violating an individual’s privacy. The threat to personal privacy was severe enough for Google and Apple to collaborate on an API that developers of public health agencies can use to implement app-based contact tracing solutions. This contact tracing API, which Google and Apple call the Exposure Notification API, is designed to respect user privacy and security.
Once a user downloads an app that uses the Exposure Notification API and opts in to contact tracing, their device starts generating “proximity identifiers” that are changed every 15 minutes (on average). Via Bluetooth Low Energy, these “proximity identifiers” are periodically shared with nearby devices whose users have also opted into contact tracing. The proximity identifier is then processed on-device and does not reveal information about a user’s location or other personally identifiable information. Once a user confirms a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, they can share their diagnosis with the app they installed, which will then inform other users who have come into close contact with them in the last 14 days. For more information on how the Exposure Notification API works, we recommend reading our initial coverage.
Google first rolled out the Exposure Notification API for Android devices on May 20, 2020, as part of an update to Google Play Services, but its use is restricted to apps that have been developed by official public health agencies (for obvious reasons). However, neither Google nor Apple has made details public about the list of apps that have been whitelisted for using this API, so unless you’re constantly keeping up with the news, it’s hard to know which countries have adopted the API. We’ve previously covered some of the countries that have adopted the Exposure Notification API when we talked about the various open-source contact tracing projects that are out there. In this article, we have compiled a list of official contact tracing apps from designated health agencies from various countries that are using Google and Apple’s Exposure Notification API. Our list contains COVID-19 contact tracing apps that have been released or are currently in development.
We discovered Google’s hidden whitelist of application package names for the API. Subsequently, these package names were traced back to apps, their listing, and the countries they belong to. The information is compiled below in a table for easy reference. We have also added Google Play Store and Apple App Store links, if the app has been publicly released, as well as the source code and the official website link, wherever available. We will update the following tables as more countries/regions adopt the API.

Google Pixel smartphones are widely considered the iPhones of the Android world. Google controls the experience from the top down, just like Apple does. The software on Pixel smartphones showcase what Google believes Android should be, and as such, the software is often well-received by enthusiasts. The hardware, on the other hand, has always left a bit to be desired in one or more aspects. With the launch of the Google Pixel 5, the company changed things up a bit and instead opted to pack a mid-range Qualcomm chipset instead of this year’s flagship Qualcomm silicon.
Having used the Google Pixel 5 for a week, I don’t think Google is giving us any reason to treat this phone as anything less than a flagship. Embedded below is my video review of the Pixel 5, but keep scrolling for the full written review.
About this review: I received the Google Pixel 5 for review from Google Ireland on the 8th of October, 2020. Google did not have any input into the contents of this review.

Google Pixel 5 Forums
Preamble – Is the Google Pixel 5 a flagship despite the Snapdragon 765G?
Before getting into all of the Pixel 5’s details, I wanted to talk about why I think Google has changed things up this year. 5G is expensive, and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 is expensive as well. We’ve seen that there are practically no “flagship killers” this year, and that’s down to the very basis of a flagship 2020 smartphone being more expensive than previous years. Google has seen the runaway success of its “a” series thanks to their affordability, so I imagine that the Pixel 5 was also an attempt to capitalize on the potential boost in sales performance at a lower price. In a bid to keep costs low, I imagine this is why Google opted for the Snapdragon 765G instead. Despite being of a lower-tier, the Snapdragon 765G handles pretty much all of your day-to-day tasks with ease, and there was pretty much no indication that I was using a smartphone without the latest and greatest Qualcomm chipset throughout the course of this review.
Regardless of the chipset, the Google Pixel 5 is a flagship. It’s Google’s latest addition to its top-end smartphone line, which I say makes it the flagship. Should it be compared to the flagships of other companies, too? Of course. Smartphones are more than the sum of their parts, and the software experience plays a huge role. The Pixel software alone is worth getting any Pixel phone, and having the latest Android 11 release on board is wonderful as well.
Google Pixel 5 Design
The design of the Google Pixel 5 is basic for a 2020 flagship, but it’s far and away better than anything we’ve seen from previous Pixel devices. Google executed the rectangular-slab-with-a-square-camera-bump-and-hole-punch-cutout design remarkably well. The most stand-out design aspect is that the bezels on all sides of the screen are equal—there’s no “chin” of any kind. The back is a textured rubber/cardboard kind of hybrid, which is why Google says that the Pixel 5 has a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure. Unlike other aluminum phones, the Pixel 5 can wirelessly charge as well, thanks to a small cutout leaving space for a plastic bio-resin. This build makes the Pixel 5 feel like no other phone I’ve felt before, and it still feels sturdy.
On the back is a slightly indented fingerprint sensor, along with the square camera module on the top left. The fingerprint sensor is at the exact same level of indentation as on the Pixel 4a, meaning it could be easy to swipe against it accidentally depending on your usual finger placement. Accidental swipes haven’t been too much of an issue for me so far, though. For what it’s worth, the sensor is extremely quick to react, and I have had zero issues with recognition.
There’s no brightly colored power button this time around—it’s just a straight metal power button, though it can shine a bit in the right lighting. The Pixel 5’s power button is not as clicky as the one on the Pixel 4a, which if I’m honest, is a little disappointing. It’s not that it’s weak, it’s that it now feels about as clicky as any other smartphone’s power button. Speaking of comparisons to past Pixels—the haptic feedback engine is still powerful, but I’ll admit it’s not quite as sharp as the one on the Pixel 4a. It’s still one of the best I’ve used in any smartphone, but it’s just something to note.
The Google Pixel 5 has a 6-inch, flat 90Hz OLED display that’s interrupted only by a hole-punch camera cutout on the top left. The hole is not too big so you won’t notice it in general usage, but it’s a design departure from the last flagship Pixel. The Pixel 5’s screen gets pretty bright, especially with auto-brightness on, and is more than capable on a bright Irish day. Disclaimer though: A bright Irish day is still considerably darker than most bright days elsewhere. I don’t think it’ll be an issue on really bright days though. On the other hand, the Pixel 5’s display also gets really dark—perfect for using the phone in dark rooms or at night! The 90Hz refresh rate experience is just as good as on competitors, but you can drop it down to a standard 60Hz refresh rate in the display settings if you want the added battery benefits.
Onto the speakers, there’s one at the top (under the display) and another on the bottom. I was disappointed but not surprised that the Pixel 4a actually has the better speakers. The Pixel 5’s speakers sound quite tinny, and the under-display speaker means the bottom-firing speaker has to do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to audio quality. The top speaker is forward-facing, but that doesn’t really matter when it’s under the screen. Not having a visible speaker grille up top is kind of cool once you notice it, but I don’t think it’s worth the trade-off in sound quality. It’s fine for voice calls though, and I didn’t have any issues understanding the person on the other end.
Is the Google Pixel 5 too small? In my opinion, it’s definitely not. I came from the OPPO Find X2 Pro which is, by comparison, a monster phone. It has a 6.7-inch display which is considerably bigger than the 6-inch one on the Google Pixel 5, making it a two-handed unwieldy beast for me. I picked up my OnePlus 8 Pro a few days ago—which also has a 6.7-inch display—to try out its new Android 11 update, and I was shocked by the sheer weight and the size of it. If anything, going from a large phone to a small phone has been really easy, sans the adjustment of typing on a smaller screen. I have smaller hands, so if I’m honest, I prefer a smaller phone. I just wish I could squeeze the sides of this tiny phone to bring up the Google Assistant — yes, you read that right, there’s no Active Edge support on the Google Pixel 5. The Pixel 4a was the first Pixel to ditch the feature (the original Pixels didn’t have it), so it’s ultimately not surprising to see that carried through.
Google Pixel 5 Camera Quality
If Pixel smartphones have mainstream recognition for any particular feature, it’s definitely because of their cameras. The Google Pixel 5 has the exact same primary image sensor as the Pixel 4, which used the same sensor as the Pixel 3… the 12.2MP Sony IMX363. It’s an older camera sensor, but Google understands it extremely well, so they’ve been able to optimize it year-after-year. It still gets the job done, and in fact, I would consider the Google Pixel 5 to be one of the best smartphone cameras around today. The Pixel 5 has been a pleasure to use in pretty much all situations that I encountered, and the Google Camera software yet again demonstrates its superiority over other camera stacks.
The one thing that bothers me about the camera experience is the fact that there isn’t a dedicated gallery app—instead, you need to use Google Photos. Google Photos feels quite bloated for just quickly looking at pictures I just took, so I felt the need to install a third-party gallery app. I realize I might be in the minority when it comes to this, though, so if you’re used to the Google Photos app, then you won’t have any issues with it on the Pixel 5.
Sadly, due to Ireland’s increasing COVID-19 restrictions, I haven’t really been able to take the Pixel 5 out for proper photo sessions. I’ve been taking photos in and around my house, but that’s about the best I’ve been able to do recently. I’ll be updating the below Flickr albums with more photos over time as I get them, but for now, I hope there’s a decent selection so that you have an idea of what you’re getting. Rest assured though, if there’s a phone you want to buy and you expect its camera will be one of the best around, you can’t go wrong with the Google Pixel 5. Photos process quickly and the Google Camera app is still one of the best camera apps around.
Comparing wide-angle, primary sensor, and 2x zoom
I’m including a comparison of all three shooting modes here, as I’m sure many were concerned at both a potential mismatch in color between sensors and a deteriorated quality without a telephoto lens for 2x zoom.
Astrophotography
If you look at just one photo that I’ve taken with the Google Pixel 5, make it this one. I took this with the Google Pixel 5’s Astrophotography mode on a pretty starry night, simply by pointing it up at the sky while it sat in my tripod. I took a whole album of these, but the above is my favorite that I have taken with the Pixel 5 so far. I am incredibly impressed.
Wide-angle lens
The wide-angle lens is a new addition to the Google Pixel line of smartphones, and thankfully they’ve nailed it too. The colors look the same as the primary lens, and photos look fantastic through it as well. Check out the Flickr album below to see a couple of photos that I’ve taken, and I’ll be adding more over time.
Video samples
You can check out the XDA-Developers YouTube review for a 1080p60FPS video sample, however here is a slow-motion 1080p sample and a 4k60FPS video sample too. As you can see, video performance is excellent and the stabilisation does a brilliant job on both the 4K60FPS clip and the 1080p60FPS clip. Audio quality is great too, and overall the Google Pixel 5 definitely gets the job done.

This is the section I’m sure many people have come to this review for. The Google Pixel 5 has been balked at by the enthusiast community because of its mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chipset. Google decided not to go for a flagship chipset this year, and many assumed that this would be at the expense of performance. Obviously, there will be a difference, but such differences have been overstated by the community. In general use, I have not seen any difference between the Pixel 5 and the many Snapdragon 865-equipped flagships I’ve used this year, and the real-world tests I performed have more than proven that.
The Snapdragon 765G packs plenty of CPU and GPU power for pretty much all day-to-day usage that you’ll get out of a smartphone. I’m a pretty heavy power user of my smartphone, and I intend to stick with the Google Pixel 5 as my daily driver, despite having plenty of Snapdragon 865-powered options to choose from. Everything is pretty smooth on the Pixel 5: From the previously-laggy sharing menu to multi-tasking between multiple apps, the Google Pixel 5 has impressed me.
UI Stutter/Jank test
The Google Pixel 5 has a 90Hz refresh rate display, but how well does the phone actually maintain 90 FPS? I’ve perceived the Pixel 5 to be incredibly smooth, without too many “microstutters” or noticeable frame rate drops. While the phone will lower the refresh rate to 60Hz when a video starts playing, I tested scrolling through Facebook or Twitter, and videos in the feed do not drop the refresh rate to 60Hz. This means you can scroll on social media and not have jarring switches between 60Hz and 90Hz all of the time. If you notice it happening in apps anyway, you can enable an always-on 90Hz mode in the developer options, which I later did after all of my testing.
To quantify how well the Google Pixel 5 can maintain 90 FPS in real-world scenarios, we ran a modified version of Google’s open-source JankBench benchmark. This benchmark simulates a handful of common tasks you’ll see in everyday apps, including scrolling through a ListView with text, scrolling through a ListView with images, scrolling through a grid view with a shadow effect, scrolling through a low-hitrate text render view, scrolling through a high-hitrate text render view, inputting and editing text with the keyboard, repeating overdraws with cards, and uploading bitmaps. Our script records the draw time for each frame during the test, eventually plotting all the frames and their draw times in a plot along with several horizontal lines representing the target frame draw times for the 4 common display refresh rates (60Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz, and 144Hz.)
I compared the Google Pixel 5 to the OnePlus Nord, as I felt that it was only apt given the fact that both phones share the same chipset and OnePlus’s penchance for optimizing the performance. The Google Pixel 5 blew the OnePlus Nord out of the water in these UI smoothness tests, and you’ll see that as the Nord frequently drops below 90 FPS (and even 60 FPS) while the Pixel maintains 90 FPS with ease. While some of this may be attributable to the Google Pixel 5 featuring Android 11 instead of Android 10, I doubt this discrepancy can be entirely explained away by that. Furthermore, the Google Pixel 5 also smokes the OnePlus Nord in our next test, which leads me to believe that it’s more than just an Android 11 versus Android 10 thing.
App opening speed
XDA’s Mario Serrafero and Mishaal Rahman created an app launch speed test script using Android’s ActivityManager shell interface to measure how long it takes for the main Activity of 11 applications to launch from a cold start (ie. when not in memory). These 11 applications are Google Chrome, Facebook, Gmail, Google Maps, Messages, Netflix, Google Photos, Google Play Store, Twitter, WhatsApp, and YouTube. We launched these 11 activities for 30 iterations (and killed each app between launches) to reduce the variance. I’ve included both the OnePlus Nord’s and the Samsung Galaxy S20’s results to show comparisons against a comparable and presumably higher-tier device.
Please note that the scales of the below bar charts are different, however, it’s clear to see that the Nord falls far short of the Pixel 5 in this test. You can read the average time it took to launch at the bottom, with the numbers above each of the bars showcasing the variance of values.
In the case of many apps such as Google Maps and Google Messages, the Google Pixel 5 launches them much faster than the OnePlus Nord. The variance is much lower too, and app opening times are much more consistent on the Google Pixel 5. I knew that using the Google Pixel 5 felt like I was using a flagship, but seeing these results made it obvious why it felt that way. If you want an even bigger shock, compare it to the Samsung Galaxy S20 with the Snapdragon 865.
Again they are shockingly close, and the Google Pixel 5 punches well above its own perceived weight.
Gaming
The Google Pixel 5 is definitely not a gaming-oriented smartphone, and its Adreno 620 GPU is definitely not the cutting-edge of graphics performance in Android smartphones. Nevertheless, some will almost certainly want to play games on their shiny new Google Pixel 5, and it will deliver good performance in most games you throw at it. Here’s a test of PUBG Mobile with HD graphics and high frame rate enabled; the Pixel 5 is clearly capable of handling this game.
The performance was generally consistent, and there were no noticeable hiccups. Interestingly, the MAD* was actually lower than the OnePlus Nord, despite the percentage of frames that dropped below 29 FPS being higher. This means that the frames were generally more consistent, even if they fell slightly more often.
*Why we calculate MAD
We calculate MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) to replace Variance. Why? For different FPS ranges (i.e. 60 FPS vs. 144Hz games), Variance becomes less intuitive. The formula for Variance has errors (distances of samples from sample mean) grow quadratically, so for 144Hz games, the sum of errors quickly explode. Our MAD statistic is much simpler: We calculate the collection of absolute errors from the mean (not median, for our case), then grab the median of the collection. In the context of games, we can interpret this as “the middling value of all the FPS fluctuations”. As a quick example, if we have a sample of [49, 60, 51, 52, 60, 60, 59], the sample mean is 58.5. So the absolute errors become [9.5, 1.5, 7.5, 6.5, 1.5, 1.5, 0.5], and the median of that collection, our MAD value, is 1.5. This means that our game is running at 58.5 FPS on average, and half of frame fluctuations are equal to or lower than 1.5. Since the mean FPS in our samples is typically super close to the target FPS, then MAD gives us an approximate idea of what most framedrops look like.
Sustained performance and thermals
The Google Pixel 5 performs well, clearly, but how does it perform under sustained loads? Does it get really hot? If I’m honest, in general usage, I didn’t notice it getting hot that much at all. Even when playing PUBG during that previous test, the device itself felt warm to the touch, but it definitely didn’t feel like a finger-burner. I ran the CPU Throttling Test to see how it held up in sustained performance, and after about 12 minutes it did start to throttle a bit. I couldn’t get any thermal readings of my Google Pixel 5, but it still didn’t feel that hot to the touch and was comfortable to still use. It maintained a respectable average of 129 GIPS (billion instructions per second), however, it throttled quite heavily to 69% of its total performance capability. This is one of the more disappointing tests for sure, but I never would have known that it throttles this much had I not run this test.
Battery life and charging
The battery life of the Google Pixel 5 has been nothing short of phenomenal, and it’s one of the longest lasting smartphones I’ve ever used. From morning until night, the Pixel 5 lasts me the entire day with plenty of battery to spare, and I’m not exaggerating. Here are two consecutive days of usage that I had with the Google Pixel 5, shortly after receiving it. These battery stats were taken on the 10th and 11th of October. I had a couple of late nights where I was using the Google Pixel 5 quite a bit, and I was impressed by how long it lasted. On both of these days, I will admit that the phone was left to sit on the home screen with the screen on for about an hour, but nevertheless it’s been impressive for my use. These are also with the always-on display switched on, meaning that standby drain is even higher than it would be with it off.
In PCMark’s battery test, the Google Pixel 5 hit a respectable 7 hours, 53 minutes at 100% brightness with 4G and Wi-Fi both on. 90Hz was enabled too. This is a theoretical minimum battery life with constant usage, which is much more improved over the previous Google Pixel 4. There’s also an extreme battery saver option now too, that should extend it even further.
Charging time
The Google Pixel 5’s charging time is marred by the fact that it packs an 18W charger in the box, and that’s as fast as it gets. While I respect the dedication to a single-standard in the support of USB Power Delivery, it is a bit of a hard pill to swallow when you switch to the Google Pixel 5. At the very least, it is helped by the fact that the Google Pixel 5 does offer long-lasting battery life. On top of that, it will charge from 0% to 100% in roughly an hour and a half to two hours, so it’s not the worst charging time. It’s usable, but don’t be expecting to toss this on the charger for 10 or 15 minutes and get a whole day’s use of battery out of it. It does get a little bit warm when it’s charging, but again it’s not uncomfortably hot.
Wireless charging
The Google Pixel 5, just like its flagship predecessors, supports wireless charging. The charging coil is right in the center on the back and will work on pretty much any Qi wireless charger that you have lying around. It supports up to 12W charging on a wireless charging pad, which means it charges at around 2/3 the speed of wired. The Pixel Stand is only a 10W wireless charger, so you won’t even max out the wireless charging capabilities of the Google Pixel 5 on its official charging stand. The charging coil is in the center on the back of the phone, and that’s where you can also reverse wireless charge at 5W speed. Reverse wireless charging (dubbed “Battery Share”) will charge any Qi-enabled devices and can be useful in a pinch.
Pixel-exclusive features
AI features
The Google Pixel 5 is packed full of AI features. App recommendations show up not just in your app drawer, but on a dedicated app bar on the bottom of your home screen. When you’re texting in certain chat apps, you’ll also get smart recommendations for messages to reply with. Not every app is supported, and you do need to use Gboard, but it’s surprisingly useful.
Multitasking menu options
The multitasking menu on the Google Pixel 5 is interesting and has its uses, thanks to the select and screenshot options that are added. Taking a screenshot here isn’t too different (except it doesn’t show any of your notification icons), however, choosing “Select” lets you highlight text and images from within any app. I’ve gotten a surprising amount of use out of it, as it’s great for copying content from one app to another. It also makes copying easier, too. For example, on Twitter, you can only copy a full Tweet’s text or nothing at all. However, you can choose exactly what you want to copy with this tool instead.
Now Playing
One of my favorite features on the Google Pixel 5 is its “Now Playing” song identification. Ever been in a shop, and a song starts playing and you scramble to open up Shazam on your phone? Maybe I’m a bit of a music nerd, but it’s happened to me quite a few times. Now Playing uses the microphone to listen for music around you in an attempt to identify everything that it picks up. It works entirely on-device, so nothing is ever sent to Google’s servers. This is also why it may not identify every song—it works by downloading a regional database of songs that are then compared on-device to whatever is playing around you. When it finds a match, it displays it on the lockscreen, always-on display, and saves it in a Now Playing section in your sound settings.
You can verify it’s not sending anything to Google servers by testing it entirely offline. I turned off both mobile data and Wi-Fi to test whether or not it would identify a wide range of music that I put in a Spotify playlist and played in order. To my surprise, it recognized a sizable chunk of the songs that I played. I was surprised by some that it missed, but others I kind of expected for it to miss. For all of the songs that were recognized, they were recognized within a minute. I also tested a Jedward song, as they are not really known or popular outside of Ireland. I was quite surprised the Pixel 5 recognized them, but that goes to show that it works regionally. Bell-X1 is an Irish band, too.

New Google Camera
The Google Camera app has been redesigned entirely, with new buttons and a new UI.
You can access the top settings menu by either tapping the arrow or pulling down from the arrow towards the shutter button. All of the same options are available as before, but several of the options now have picture tutorials to let you know how the features work. You can still shoot in RAW and edit in something such as Snapseed or Lightroom on your phone if you’d prefer!
New live wallpapers and fonts
The Google Pixel 5 brings a number of new live wallpapers, all of which are animated based on different scenarios on your smartphone.
All of these live wallpapers react to whatever is going on on your device. The black statues one moves as you tilt your phone, while some of the colored wallpapers react to music or the time of day. There are other classic favorites too, such as the Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Font-wise, there are now 7 to choose from. The 7 I found when going through the Google Pixel 5’s system files are as follows. The names are taken from their package names on the device.
Call Screening and Hold For Me
Sadly, I couldn’t test either of these features as they do not work outside of the US. However, Mishaal Rahman was able to get the Pixel 5’s new Hold For Me feature working on his Pixel 4. You can read his embedded thread to see how it works!

Google Recorder 2.0
The new Google Recorder app has a brand new feature, and that feature allows you to export a recorded audio clip as a video. You can switch on a waveform and even include a transcript that highlights words as you speak.
For recordings that are longer than 150 words, Google will attempt to spot important keywords and add a scrollbar at the bottom which highlights their location. You can also remove audio based on what you highlight in the transcript, as Google knows what is being said when. You can also fix transcripts that are incorrectly heard too, but I’ve left in the mistake below to show that it isn’t perfect. It picked up “at” instead of “out”, which was the only mistake it made in the transcript.
The @madebygoogle #Pixel5 has a really cool new voice recorder app, and you can effectively use it to generate voice tweets! Might start using this one quite a bit 👀#teampixel pic.twitter.com/5fByB7bKqZ

One feature that I tried to get working was desktop mode, but sadly, the Pixel 5 does not support DisplayPort Alternate Mode, meaning it cannot output video over USB-C.
Fabric case
Google also sent us out one of their fabric cases for review, and I’ve had it on my phone a lot of the time. It’s comfortable to use and doesn’t add too much bulk. However, it still feels extremely protective of the phone which surprised me. You can wash it a few times like you would wash clothes without ruining it in case it gets too dirty. While I think the fabric case is definitely one of the Best Pixel 5 cases that you can get, there are many others on the market too!
Conclusion
I feel that the Google Pixel 5 has earned an unfair reputation before it has even launched, thanks to its mid-range chipset. The Snapdragon 765G is clearly capable of competing where it matters. Is it the best smartphone in benchmarks? Absolutely not. However, if your apps launch quickly, are smooth to use, and the battery lasts all day, then why does it matter if you’re not getting the best benchmark scores? Phones are more than the sum of their parts, and the Google Pixel 5 demonstrates that better than any other smartphone on the market. If you’re looking for a fantastic software experience with good performance, the Google Pixel 5 is definitely worth looking at.
Google Pixel 5 ForumsDescendant X custom ROM for the Xiaomi Mi A1 and Mi 9 adds “Guardia,” a background permission monitor
The open, no-walled-garden design of Android gives users the freedom of customization. Thanks to the vibrant aftermarket development community, Android users can enjoy plenty of features that are otherwise not implemented by Google or OEMs. Take the example of Android’s new advanced permission management control system called Permissions Hub— something that was present in early leaked Android Q builds but Google didn’t ship in public releases. The relevant code snippets do still exist in AOSP, which have later been forked by the LineageOS team, and now it is accessible to regular users via LineageOS 17.1. XDA Senior Member Dil3mm4 has now taken another shot at enhancing the permission mechanism in their own way. Dubbed “Guardia”, the new background permission monitor is part of the latest build of their custom ROM, Descendant X.
For those not familiar with Descendant X, it is an Android 10-based Generic System Image (GSI) maintained by Dil3mm4 that has its roots in the AOSP GSI by XDA Recognized Developer phhusson. Descendant X is also available in the form of device-specific ZIPs similar to any other custom ROM. The developer has yet to update the GSI builds with Guardia, but you can access the permission monitor feature right now by flashing the newest Descendant X package for the Xiaomi Mi 9 and the Mi A1.
Descendant X Download and Discussion Thread: Mi 9 ||| Mi A1
Mi 9 XDA Forums || Mi A1 XDA Forums
Users can find Guardia under Settings > Privacy. After turning on the function, Guardia will start running in the background and notify you of apps requesting permissions. You can customize the alert types for different scenarios (e.g. location access and camera), and even place Google apps and/or system apps into an allowlist so that you are not getting hammered by hundreds of such informative but annoying alerts.
Given that Google is going to introduce a plethora of OS-wide permission related changes in the upcoming release of Android 11, we hope the developer will further improve Guardia by integrating the component on top of those revisions.
Apart from the background permission monitor, the newest build of Descendant X (version 10r40) also brings in July 2020 security patches, a handful of ClockFlow themes, and the fan-favorite notification ticker. Here is a video showcasing all the changes in this release:

And about a month ago, Motorola had announced an even more affordable 5G-enabled smartphone in the form...Acer Halo is a Google Assistant-powered smart speaker with DTS audio
Acer has joined the smart speaker party with an impressively specced first offering—the Acer Halo. The speaker, which hits American shelves in early 2021, is among the first to offer DTS sound processing at a surprisingly modest price tag, which should give it a competitive advantage over the competition.
The Halo promises to offer “high-quality audio that is projected in 360 degrees to fill any room”. An impressive boast, and to add visuals to that sound, there are RGB lights on the base and a customizable dot matrix-esque display behind the speaker fabric. This will require an additional app that should be ready in time for release, which will let you adapt that display to be a clock, weather forecast, emoji, or another pixelated but motivating image.
Acer points out that the lights and display can be switched off, but more importantly, there’s also a slider for the microphone if you want some privacy. Other controls on the top of the unit cover Play/Pause, Volume +/- and a Google Assistant button that also acts as power control. You shouldn’t need the latter though, thanks to the two far-field microphones for voice control.
From everything we’ve been told, there are still a few things about the Halo that remain a mystery—its exact size and weight (we think it looks around the size of an OG Amazon Echo) and whether two units can be paired for a stereo array (we assume so as most Google Assistant speakers are configured for this).
Assuming these hunches are right (and we’ll update this article when we know more) this looks like a strong entry into the third-party Google Assistant canon. The proof will be in the listening, but from what we’ve seen, this shows promise.
The Acer Halo launches in North America in Q1 of 2021, priced at $109, but lucky European readers may find it in stock in time for Christmas. Initial stocks will be found on the Acer website.The Recording Industry Association of America, Inc.

Google is testing new features in its Google Phone app, the default dialer app on Pixel phones which recently became available for everyone. The new features that are in development include Caller ID announcements and auto-deleting Call Screen transcripts. While the features sound pretty self-explanatory, they’re still worthy of discussion. If anything, it’s always nice to hear about new features designed to improve the quality of life of users.
When enabled, Caller ID announcement will announce the name or phone number of whoever is calling. Meanwhile, the new Call Screen option will allow the Phone app to automatically delete Call Screen transcripts and audio recordings after 30 days.
We were able to manually surface these two features in the Google Phone app, but the features are not available to users just yet, either via an update or a server-side flag. It’s unclear when they’ll be available to test out by a wider audience, but it’s possible they’ll go live alongside the launch of the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5 tomorrow.
These features aren’t monumental additions to the Google Phone app, but they are welcome tweaks nonetheless. When the features do officially become available, they’ll join a host of other new features that have been recently added to the Google Phone app, which is now available to non-Pixel devices. The Google Phone app is capable of detecting spam and fraud calls, recording calls (depending on the region), and even supports a convenient “Flip to Silence” feature. On Pixel phones, the app also supports the Call Screen feature to screen robocallers and other unknown callers.Thanks to power hungry applications and hardware, our devices have a bad tendency of running out of power in the middle of important tasks.

The European variant of the LG V40 ThinQ is scheduled to receive its stable Android 10 update in Q3 2020, while the company is planning to deliver the same a bit early in their home country. Matter of fact, LG has already published the Android 10 kernel source code for this device, which clearly indicates that the development stage is over. Confirming the speculation, the AT&T variant of the LG V40 (LM-V405UA) has now picked up the Android 10 OTA.
LG V40 ThinQ XDA Forums
While AT&T itself has yet to officially list the new build on their device-specific update tracker, several users on our forums have confirmed that they’ve started receiving the update on their units. The software version of the Android 10 firmware is V405UA30b, which is a rather a steep jump from the last Android Pie-based build from AT&T, i.e. V405UA21a. The update should introduce all the new features that Google delivers with Android 10, like gesture navigation and smart replies, but the lack of a proper changelog has made it difficult to list these enhancements as well as the Android security patch level of the new build.
It is worth mentioning that the LM-V405UA model of the LG V40 ThinQ is being used by both Verizon and Sprint, thus cross-flashing the aforementioned Android 10 firmware on those carrier variants is theoretically possible. The T-Mobile variant, despite being entirely different (LM-V405TAB), should also receive the taste of Android 10 pretty soon, as LG has uploaded the corresponding kernel source code on their repository.
In case you are not satisfied with LG’s custom skin, LG UX 9.0, and want to give vanilla Android 10 a try, you can flash unofficial builds of Lineage OS 17.0 or Paranoid Android Quartz on your LG V40 ThinQ. Don’t worry about the restriction on bootloader unlocking, as most of the US carrier variants of this phone (except the T-Mobile one) can be unlocked with the help of a leaked engineering bootloader.

Google has been rapidly expanding the availability of their mobile payments service across the world. Not as fast as Samsung has been able to do with Samsung Pay, but still, the company has been steadily working with a number of countries to make the service available for as many people as possible. Along with making the service available in countries from around the world, they’ve also been adding support for a large number of banks and credit unions in the United States.
Pali Bhat, the Senior Directory of Product Management at Google, has just announced the launch of Android Pay in Hong Kong. Google says their mobile payment service is now available in over 5,000 retail locations, and highlights stores including 7-Eleven, Circle K, Fortress, Mannings, Maxim’s Cakes, MX, McDonald’s, Pacific Coffee, PARKnSHOP, SmarTone, Watsons, and Wellcome.
Just like in other countries, those who choose to use the service in Hong Kong will also be able to store your gift cards, loyalty cards and other special offers directly within the app. Speaking of apps, Google says they have partnered with a number of popular apps within Hong Kong so they can integrate Android Pay as a payment option. Google highlights a few apps that have already integrated the service including Boutir Collect, Deliveroo, Kaligo, Klook, Snaptee, and also tells us that Uber will be adding support for Android Pay in Hong Kong soon.
We’re told that Android Pay in Hong Kong works with Visa and MasterCard credit cards from banks including BEA, DBS, Dah Sing Bank, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, and Standard Chartered Bank. Then reminds us that you can add an unlimited amount of credit cards to Android Pay, so you don’t have to worry about carrying them around all the time.

The report mentions that people who own smartphones spent over $585 billion using mobile payments services in 2016. This includes Android Pay, Samsung Pay, Apple Pay and all other mobile payment solutions that are available. This means we could see an increase of more than 25% in this year alone.
Even though Google is pushing Android Pay fairly hard, TrendForce’s research believes Samsung Pay and Apple Pay are the two system who have an advantage over the current competition. The company was impressed with how Android Pay entered the Japanese market though, as it has been a tough market for other foreign services to crack. Still, they feel the advertising arm of Samsung and Apple are big enough that they will be the two to dominate the mobile payment market next year.
TrendForce revealed some details regarding Google working with Sony to incorporate FeliCa into an NFC-enabled IC card. FeliCa is an RFID smart payment solution that Sony has created. The idea is that this NFC-enabled IC card will work with smartphones and could help strengthen Android Pay’s presence within the country. Google is also said to be working with eMoney, Visa, MasterCard, and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ as well as other payment services and financial institutions.
TrendForce believes this year will see some much-needed security improvements for the mobile payment market. We’ve been seeing shifting momentum toward the integration of different hardware technologies in encrypted chip design that has improved the security aspect of mobile payments. But the report also mentions that advances in encryption algorithms and multi-factor authentication methods will help to increase efficiency when verifying the user, confirming payments, and securing the transfer of data.

While Xiaomi does offer flagship smartphones in a few markets, its entry-level and mid-range devices are what it’s known for. In fact, the company’s Redmi brand is so popular that it now even offers affordable flagships like the Redmi K20 Pro. Recently, the company launched the Redmi 8 and Redmi 8A in the budget-segment, offering great hardware specifications for the price. In order to provide users with a common platform for discussions related to these devices, we’ve now opened forums for the Redmi 8 and Redmi 8A.
Redmi 8
The Redmi 8 was launched in India early last month at a price of ₹7,999. The device features a 6.22-inch HD+ LCD display with a waterdrop notch that houses the 8MP front-facing camera. On the back, you get a dual-camera setup with a 12MP primary lens and a 2MP lens for depth perception. The smartphone is powered by a Snapdragon 439 chip, coupled with up to 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. It’s backed by a massive 5,000mAh battery with 18-watt fast charging support over USB Type-C.

Redmi 8A
The Redmi 8A, on the other hand, was launched earlier this year in September and offers similar specifications as the Redmi 8. It also has a 6.22-inch HD+ LCD display with a waterdrop notch on the front that houses the 8MP selfie shooter. On the back, however, it features a single 12MP f/1.8 camera. The Snapdragon 439 chip can also be found on this device, with up to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Powering the device is a 5,000mAh battery which also has 18-watt fast charging support over USB Type-C, but you only get a 10-watt charger in the box.

Google Play Store Version 6.8 is now rolling out with hints suggesting a possible upcoming change within the Google Play Music Family Plan. Currently, subscribers to the Play Music Family Plan are unable to share individual purchases among family members, as noted in the help page:
Each family member will still have separate Google Accounts, playlists, libraries, and offline content. Any content family members purchase or upload won’t be shared between family members.
During this year’s Google I/O, we were promised the ability the share our application purchases with up to 6 family members under a Google Play Family Library. The go-live date after which every application purchase will be eligible for sharing under a Family Library is July 2nd. That date is quickly approaching, however, it doesn’t look like Google intends to only allow families to share application purchases. Indeed, much like Apple’s iCloud Family Sharing, perhaps Google will soon roll out the ability to share individual music purchases with your family members.
Disclaimer: The evidence we dig up from the APK files of an app are not definitive. Google may choose to pull these features without any indication in a future release.
Sharing Music Purchases
Admittedly, there is not a lot to go off of here. Within the latest Play Store app, there is but a single string indicating the existence of such a feature.
<string name="family_music_upgrade_text">You can share your Google Play purchases with your family group.</string>
This text will appear in a small bottom sheet/snackbar presumably after you upgrade to a Google Play Music Family Plan within the Play Store app, at least according to the family_music_upgrade_bottom_sheet.xml file. The bottom sheet layout file explicitly mentions the Family Library, so we’re hoping that Google takes a page from Apple and does indeed implement this feature.
Improved Data Pre-Loading
Previous teardowns of the Play Store app revealed that Google would begin pre-loading data to reduce network consumption by the Play Store app. With Google Play Store version 6.8, it appears that they will be increasing the amount of data cached from 20MB to 30MB.
<string name="lite_mode_settings_description_info">Preload up to 30 MB on your device, over Wi-Fi</string>
A very small, but welcome change for those people who suffer from poor performance within the Play Store app. By giving you a larger amount of preloaded data while on WiFi, you will be loading fewer common assets that the Play Store typically loads up each time you launch the app. This should result in a slight speed bump when you’re trying to quickly see something on the store, but you don’t have a stellar data connection.
That’s all we’ve found within the latest Play Store update. Stay tuned for future teardowns into the latest Google app updates!AppGallery is Huawei’s alternative to Google’s Play Store on Android
Huawei has been in the spotlight in recent months, for reasons that have frankly been out of its control. The trade restrictions that the USA has put on Huawei and its business partners such as Google has deeply impacted all involved stakeholders. Google had been forced to revoke Huawei’s Android license for future smartphones, which meant that the Chinese OEM will be unable to install the Google Play Store, Google Play Services or any other Google app on its new smartphones. The same statements had resurfaced in relation to the upcoming Huawei Mate 30 series, wherein a Google spokesperson had been attributed saying that the Huawei Mate 30 cannot be sold with the licensed version of Android or Google apps and services. With the launch of the Huawei Mate 30 series, the statements have turned out to be true, as the phones have been launched without Google apps and services.
Because of the open-source nature of AOSP, Huawei is not completely debarred from using Android on its smartphone, though an argument can also be made to that end. Huawei has stressed that Android still remains its first choice, and its recently released HarmonyOS has always been pitched as a “Plan B” for its smartphones. During the Huawei Developer Conference 2019, the company had also mentioned that they will “lay the foundations for Harmony OS in the Chinese market” first before expanding it to the global market — which means that we are still some time, and some options, away from seeing HarmonyOS on a commercially sold smartphone outside of China. For now, Huawei is likely to use a Google-less Android with EMUI on its smartphones rather than Huawei releasing an Android-less smartphone.
But with the Google Play Store no longer an option, Huawei faces the same challenge it does on a Google-less Android as it does on HarmonyOS: how exactly do you deliver third party apps to end-users in a reliable yet convenient manner? The answer to this question rests with AppGallery, an app that Huawei had the foresight to develop for EMUI for quite a few years now.
Huawei AppGallery
AppGallery was officially launched in China way back in 2011 before any of these political situations came into the picture. AppGallery was, and is, essentially an application distribution platform, or an app store as these services are more commonly referred to. In China, recognizing the different needs and expectations of the market, AppGallery performed and continues to perform functions beyond what we outside of China expect out of an app store. For instance, Chinese AppGallery integrates features related to forum-based social networking spaces for specific games which can serve as a resource for users. Functions like these served the target audience very well, and continue to be present in the solution for that region. AppGallery also flourished in China without the presence of Google and its Play APIs, but that has been an inarguably unique situation.
With the launch of the Huawei P20 series in the first half of 2018, Huawei introduced AppGallery to the world outside of China. Huawei’s app store came pre-installed on the Huawei P20 and the Huawei P20 Pro, but it was later on rolled out to other existing smartphones within Huawei and Honor’s lineup. While the content on the app store at launch was primarily targeting users in Asian markets with featured apps like Amap and WeChat, AppGallery can now be considered as a global store with a coverage spread of over 170 countries. Over the months and years, AppGallery evolved to include complete billing capabilities, in addition to allowing in-app monetization, subscriptions, and ad-based monetization solutions for developers.
The evolution story for AppGallery finds similarity with that of the Huawei Consumer Business Group — at the very beginning, Huawei focused its efforts on early budget phone segments. But over the years, the company did go on to occupy top spots in segments like SoC, camera, hardware, and design. With the impending launch of new Huawei phones, we explore the current state of AppGallery with regards to its merits towards developers and consumers, as this could very well shape up to be the future of the App Store on Huawei and Honor devices running on Android.
For Developers
AppGallery is of particular interest to app developers because of the impending fragmentation within the Android ecosystem as a repercussion to the trade war and resultant political decisions. In an ideal world, a second app store would be redundant in many ways if the primary app store performed its job well. But in our current situation, the lack of the Google Play Store on Huawei and Honor devices means that AppGallery no longer watches from the sidelines, but instead, plays an active role as the primary means to distribute apps on these devices moving forward.
The app also comes preloaded on existing Huawei and Honor devices that also bundle in the Google Play Store, so the presence of your app on this medium presents an additional surface for discovery for end users. As a developer, you do want to reach out to as many users as possible for your app with as little effort. While getting on to AppGallery does take effort, even if just a little, we still need to keep in mind that this might be the only way to reach future Huawei and Honor devices. Plus AppGallery is based on Android so developers will find themselves using a different (but still familiar) SDK. If your app doesn’t reach users, something else will take its place, and that is a situation that established apps would like to avoid as much as possible. Shipment figures from Huawei indicate that the company has shipped as many as 400 million smartphones over the last 2 years — these EMUI/Magic UI based phones still have unhindered access to Android. This means that you still have an existing userbase to tap into, even if you roll with the (rather insane) presumption that no one will buy any more Huawei or Honor devices.
There is also a case to be made for the presumption that Huawei’s ban is lifted in the future and the company is allowed to preload the Google Play Store again, and all status quo is restored. Huawei and Honor devices running Android through EMUI or Magic UI will likely continue to come with AppGallery preloaded alongside the Play Store. In such a case, developers could decide at that stage whether they need to continue maintaining their app on this store, depending on how their app performs. Keep in mind that AppGallery also provides an opportunity for developers to publish their apps in China, something that the Play Store currently misses out on. This decision would thus vary from app to app, and from developer to developer because of its intrinsic commercial nature — it just might turn out to be financially viable and even profitable for certain developers to maintain their app across both distribution channels, especially if your app does not make use of a lot of Google Play APIs. For game developers, especially those who rely on Unity, the quantum of work to maintain both Google Play and Huawei AppGallery versions would be even lower.
AppGallery also comes with some of its own selling points. By mid-2019, Huawei claims that it has had over 370 million monthly average users, with a growth of 195% year-on-year, and over 350 billion cumulative app downloads up from 180 billion in July 2018. Unfortunately, we do not have the means to verify such claims; nor does Google release similar statistics for the Play Store for us to compare. Nonetheless, past, present and future Huawei and Honor devices are a significant chunk of smartphones to target, if you so decide.
Huawei also claims that they are using a “global SDK” for services like billing and monetization, which essentially facilitates developers in western regions to launch their apps in China without needing further country-specific development. This is a two-way street, so developers in China can also target users in other western regions with relative ease. There are also claims of Huawei attempting to be more (app) developer-friendly, with support teams being present to aid developers through the publishing process. At least for Huawei, it is in the best interest of the Chinese giant to attract more and more developers, unlike Google and its established Play Store, so there just might be enough substance behind these claims. Huawei is also attempting to follow a contextual discovery model for content discovery on the store, instead of a “Top Grossing” model where the pole positions enjoy a positive feedback loop for discovery. So if you do not know exactly which app you need, Huawei’s AppGallery may just present a solution that is superior to the one presented by the Google Play Store.
For Users
As previously stated, AppGallery might just be the only way an average user could reliably and easily install third-party apps on future Huawei and Honor devices, with “official” backing. There won’t be much choice at play in this situation, which is an unfortunate consequence of the mess the smartphone world is in because of political decisions. While one would obviously prefer having the established Google Play Store as the primary option, Huawei AppGallery isn’t that bad of a choice in this particular situation and has been in development for years, prior to the current political situation.
Huawei AppGallery is a first-party solution for Huawei and Honor devices, so users need not worry about compatibility issues with the Store itself. All the content is claimed to be curated, and everything goes through a thorough review before it is launched in order to guarantee the safety of the app for its users. This curation activity also aims to remove the duplicate, low-quality clones that tend to clog search results, which thereby helps users by giving out better content and also protects the intellectual property of the developers. AppGallery also claims to be family-friendly, and Huawei is also working on a better “kid-friendly” section within the store for more kid-centric content. AppGallery also features feature localizations that are unique to the local region, based upon the needs and expectations of that particular region.
AppGallery also has elements that reward users in various ways — a gift section within the store features free in-game rewards like coins and unlocked exclusive content like Fortnite skins; a “Play and Win” section which rewards user loyalty for the store with Huawei smartphones as rewards. There will also be a “Lucky Draw” section which will allow users to earn prizes by downloading and trying new apps. All of these “features” are designed to keep users engaged and satisfied with the store in a way that they would prefer it over a competing solution. The intention is pretty clear here — AppGallery wants to be your top choice, and it is willing to make efforts towards that end.
Recommended Apps Screen, as displayed in different regions
What I disliked about AppGallery is the fact that at the very start, the app presents users with a list of apps that they are recommended to install on their device. This list is reminiscent of the list that I have seen on Xiaomi’s MIUI in the past, a list that most users just mindlessly tap through and then subsequently end up with a host of unnecessary apps. The Home button is on the left, and the Install button is highlighted and on the right, indicating that this is where users should tap to proceed.
In Huawei’s defense, this screen appears only once to the user and never again, and only half of the displayed apps are pre-selected, and those pre-selected can be deselected with ease. The list appears to be showcasing popular apps in that region, which should theoretically work for the benefit of less tech-savvy users who would otherwise not be comfortable with (or even capable of) exploring curated lists and hunting for apps.
Concluding Note
Huawei’s AppGallery is the direction that the Chinese company will adopt for the future. We still expect Huawei to deliver some exceptional hardware in the form of the Mate 30 series and other future devices within Honor as well. It remains to be seen how much of an impact not shipping Google’s Android will have on Huawei. Will users find the hardware appealing by itself to overlook the lack of Google support? If they do, AppGallery is ready and in position to deliver on their app content needs. The store still has a long way to go — like for instance, delivering more diversified content than just apps and games, and making it easier to find paid content — but it needs to start from somewhere for the Western market, and where it is right now is a good position, even if not the most ideal. AppGallery in China already sees such diversification with other content like quick apps, eBooks, online courses and more — we hope to see similar efforts and results for the Western market too in the near future. For now, it would be a mistake to write off AppGallery without giving it a fair chance.

With rumors swirling about Android Pay’s expansion into more countries, Google has started taking steps towards preparing for those launches. Unfortunately, most of the preparations happen behind closed doors where we can’t see them (negotiating with banks, helping the banks put forth Requests For Proposals to find implementers, navigating each country’s legal framework, etc.), but some are publicly visible.
One such public facing step is the localization of help pages for each country, and Google just added a slew of them. Localization often isn’t strictly required (although some countries like Canada can get very prescriptive about requiring support for all official languages), however companies often won’t launch a product without it. Localized help pages can be a very small thing, but having the spelling that you are used to on them (not to mention them being in your language) can make a huge difference for how comfortable you are using them, and for customer satisfaction.
While Android Pay has already launched in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Australia (and has the appropriate localizations for each of them), both Canada (English and French) and Ireland have been there for a couple months now without any public action being taken on them. That would indicate that talks are in progress for those countries, but are coming along slowly (for Canada in particular, Apple Pay ran into some trouble launching, and Samsung Pay is also seeing some delays compared to when they originally hoped to launch).
The interesting new additions are Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, Polish, and Traditional Chinese. This would indicate that Google may be hoping to reach Hong Kong before Samsung pay launches there later this year, and Spain and Brazil are likely also on Google’s agenda for the near future (both of which already have Samsung Pay).
The two countries that stand out the most however are South Korea and Poland.
South Korea is Samsung’s stronghold. Samsung Pay launched there in August 2015, and Samsung holds around half the smartphone market all by themselves. It’ll be interesting to see how Google approaches the South Korean market. Will they focus more on LG (who are supposedly working on their payment solution) and other phone manufacturers? Or will they try to take Samsung head-on?
None of the major smartphone payment solutions have targeted Poland yet, however their high adoption of EMV tap to pay terminals could result in them being a fantastic choice for Android Pay’s expansion. We’ll have to wait and see if any real announcement about Poland comes forth, but it could be a fantastic first step into continental Europe.
Where do you think will see Android Pay first? What countries should Google target that they haven’t yet? Sound off below! Source: RedditAPK TEARDOWN Posts on XDA

It’s been a while since the last stable update of Navigation Gestures (1.15.10), and even longer since we’ve posted about an update. We’re here to change that. This post marks the release of Navigation Gestures 1.18.4 to stable. You might be wondering: what happened to 1.16 and 1.17? Well, we can assure you we know how to count. You may not have seen these versions on the stable channel, but we’ve been hard at work releasing betas.
In those betas, we decided to concentrate more on stability instead of new features. While there are a couple of new options, most of the changes since 1.15.10 are to improve performance, prevent crashes, and fix bugs. Think of it like Google’s Project Marble, but hopefully more effective.
Release Highlights
- Performance should be noticeably improved on older and lower-end devices.
- Navigation Gestures is less likely to be killed in the background.
- We’ve added an option to put the pill on top of the software navigation bar, so it has a dedicated space.
Hopefully, 1.18.4 will provide a much better experience. If you still run into any issues, make sure to report them at support.xda-developers.com. To make things easier for everyone, please include your device model, app version, and Android version if you make a report.
Now, here’s everything that’s new:
New Navigation Gestures Features
- Overlay Navigation BarWhile it can be nice to have the extra space gained by hiding the navigation bar, it’s possible for the pill to interfere with app elements near the bottom of the screen. If you have this problem, try out the new “Overlay NavBar” option in the Experimental Settings. It will place the pill on top of the software navigation bar and blackout the navigation buttons.If you’d like to keep your navigation buttons, you can deactivate the “Blackout” option.Make sure to turn off “Hide Navigation Bar” before enabling this.This option only works for devices that have a software navigation bar.
- Per-App Pill ColorSince we released this app, we’ve been getting requests for an option to automatically color the pill based on what’s behind it. Unfortunately, we can’t do exactly that. However, we’ve added a new Experimental Setting called “Per-App Pill Color” which lets you set the color of the pill on a per-app basis. Any apps not selected will use the color set in Appearance.
- Accessibility Button Action (Root)The release of Android Oreo brought an accessibility button to the navigation bar. Unfortunately, Android doesn’t allow normal apps to invoke this action. If you have root access, though, you’ll see two new actions: one to open the chosen accessibility interface, and another to select which one to show.
- Keep AliveWe’ve done a lot to make sure Navigation Gestures isn’t killed by Android, but some devices have incredibly aggressive battery management. If you’ve been noticing that Navigation Gestures is killed on your device a lot, the new “Keep Alive” option may help. Found in the Compatibility settings, enabling it will start a foreground Service, which should keep the app alive.
- Restart AppSometimes the app gets unstable. We know it; you know it. We’re working on making it better, but it’s never going to be perfect. If you find yourself running into problems with Navigation Gestures, open the app and tap the “Problems?” button. Scroll down and tap the first option in the “Something else?” category to restart the app.When restoring settings from a backup, Navigation Gestures will also prompt you to restart the app.
Bug Fixes
- Crash FixesSince the last stable release, 1.15.10, we’ve been working hard to fix as many crashes as possible. If everything has gone to plan, you should notice fewer (or even no) crashes using 1.18.4.
- “Don’t Hide NavBar on Lock Screen” and “Don’t Show on Lock Screen” FixesOn some devices (notably those running EMUI 3.x), there is a weird issue where Navigation Gestures thinks the device is always on the lock screen. This version should fix this issue, although we don’t have any EMUI 3.x devices to test with.
- Performance ImprovementsWe’re not Snapchat, so we’re actually going to explain a little bit of what our performance improvements are.On older and lower-end devices, animations should be smoother.On all devices, battery usage should be lower.
- Navigation Bar Height on Android 10With Android 10’s new gestures, it’s possible to change the navigation bar height to be much shorter. Navigation Gestures 1.18.4 is now able to detect the change in the navigation bar height, so it can properly hide the navigation bar.
- Switch Keyboard Action on Android 10If you’ve got a device running Android 10, you may have noticed that this action was broken on 1.15.10. We’ve fixed it in 1.18.4, so it should work properly again. We also added a notice that the action requires you grant Navigation Gestures the WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission if you haven’t already.How to force 120Hz refresh rate for a smoother experience on the POCO X3
The POCO X3 is one of the best value for money mid-range smartphones you can buy right now. Building upon the success of the POCO X2, the latest POCO X smartphone from Xiaomi’s spin-off brand offers much better battery life, a modest processor upgrade, and a refreshed design. Just like the previous model, the showstopper feature continues to be the 120Hz display, providing a fluid scrolling experience across system UI and first-party apps. Similar to the POCO X2, POCO controls the refresh rate using what it calls its Dynamic Refresh Rate feature, which intelligently adjusts the display refresh rate to maximize the battery life.
POCO X3 Forums
This has been a point of contention for many POCO X3 users as even when the 120Hz mode is explicitly selected, the phone would fall back to 60Hz in certain scenarios to save the battery. For example, the Dynamic Refresh Rate feature would dial down the refresh rate to 60Hz while watching a video and to 50Hz for static images. Conversely, the refresh rate would jump up to 120Hz if you’re scrolling or playing a supported game. When this Dynamic Refresh Rate switch happens, it results in noticeable stutter and jank, disrupting an otherwise buttery smooth experience from time to time, much to users’ frustration.
But rest assured, XDA Member Slim K has you covered. The user has found a way to disable Dynamic Refresh Rate, unlocking the super-smooth 120Hz refresh rate in all apps.
If you are a proud owner of a POCO X3 and want to have your display render everything at a smooth 120Hz refresh rate all the time, even if that means sacrificing battery life, we have put together a small guide to walk you through the steps. Before you proceed, it should be noted that your POCO X3 must have an unlocked bootloader and rooted with Magisk v21.0. With that out of the way, here are the steps to unlock the persistent 120Hz mode.
- Download the following pieces of software:
- Open the terminal app and run: “su“
- Next up, run: “props”
- From the list, choose option 5: “Add/edit custom props”
- Choose n “New custom prop”
- Now type in the following line of code:
ro.vendor.dfps.enable
- The default value is true. Type false.
- Now choose 2 “post-fs-data”
- Choose n, but don’t reboot yet.
- Type in the following line:
ro.vendor.smart_dfps.enable
- Again, the default value is true, which indicates the Dynamic Refresh Rate is enabled. Type false to disable it.
- Finally, choose 2 “post-fs-data”
- Reboot. Your device should now be consistently running at 120Hz.
The developer has only tested this workaround on stock MIUI, so it might not work if you’re running a custom ROM — you’re welcome to try, though.
It goes without saying that enabling a persistent 120Hz refresh rate will severely tax the battery life — the user’s personal testing indicates anywhere between a 10 to 18% reduction in screen on time. But if that doesn’t sound too bad to you, by all means, give this workaround a try to unlock the forced 120Hz mode. For more details, check out the original thread by the user at the link given below.
Disable Dynamic Refresh Rate for POCO X3AutoResponder for Instagram helps you automate your DM responses
Instagram by Facebook, the photo and video-sharing social network, has become the social network of choice for many users, boasting of over 1 billion users as of May 2019. Because of the sheer number of casual users it attracts, Instagram has become a popular way for businesses to attract new customers and interact with them. Instagram also has its own set of “influencers” – users with very large followings that can leverage their social reach to promote brands and products. Needless to say, Instagram is a serious business for many, and every business can benefit from tools that can automate some of the workflows. AutoResponder for Instagram takes automation to your DM (Direct Message) responses, allowing you to maintain interaction with your users.
As the name implies, AutoResponder for Instagram lets you respond to Instagram Direct Messages with custom messages of your own. There are a fair few customization settings available, allowing you to set your own filters to which messages you want to respond. You can either choose to respond to all messages, or messages that have some similarity to the rule you have set, and filter out the responses to either just Individual DMs or group messages or both.
AutoResponder can further narrow down the responses to be sent only to specific contacts, or not be sent to specific contacts. All such functionality is available in the free version, but you can also expand functionality with the Pro version upgrade. This brings along features such as multiple replies in one rule, AI features with Dialogflow.com, Tasker integration for much more automation versatility as well as the ability to import backed up rules.
AutoResponder for Instagram — XDA Thread
Do note that the app uses the Notification access permission to respond to notifications, as it does not directly access Instagram.Snoozing Reminders will finally return with Google Calendar v5.5.9
Many people use and rely on Google Calendar to help organize their life. However, there are many things that we want to vaguely keep track of but that aren’t really well-suited to be marked on a calendar.
Weekly reminders, goals, or minor tasks that need to be done are better handled separately from your main calendar, which is why Google Calendar added tasks and reminders to accommodate more use-cases. Fans of Google Calendar’s reminder feature probably noticed that you used to be able to snooze reminder notifications.
Unfortunately, for some reason the feature seemed to have disappeared when Google Calendar was bumped up to version 5.0. We’re not sure exactly why the feature wasn’t made available when Calendar received its complete Material Design make-over, but we were hoping that eventually it would return in a future release. Today, Google Calendar v5.5.9 is rolling out and a teardown of the APK file strongly hints at the return of the reminder snoozing feature.
Eh, I’ll do it Later
Within the APK file, we’ve found strings and the actual code that will be used to implement the feature (meaning, it’s not just there to prepare for a future release, but rather should already be fully functioning) that were not present in prior versions of the Google Calendar app. The below strings clearly point towards the return of the feature, but it doesn’t seem like snoozing will function exactly the same as it used to before Google Calendar v5.0.
<string name="task_snooze_failed_message">Failed to snooze the reminder</string>
<string name="task_snooze_label">Snooze</string>
<string name="task_snooze_message" formatted="false">Reminder snoozed for <g example="Today" id="date">%s</g>, <g example="11:20am" id="time">%s</g></string>

<string name="task_snooze_tomorrow">Tomorrow</string>
<string name="task_snooze_weekend">This weekend</string>
Indeed, if you notice within these strings there are indications that you will be able to select from multiple times until which the notification will be snoozed. Previously, you were only able to snooze the notifications for a default time of 15 minutes (which was not adjustable, unfortunately). The feature will not only be making a return, but we believe it will be improved upon.
Furthermore, the reason we believe the feature will be coming sooner rather than later is due to the existence of classes and methods found within the decompiled APK such as SnoozeActivity.smali and especially SnoozeFindTimeAsyncTask.smali which both directly indicate the ability to manually select a time until which to snooze your notification.
Unfortunately, though, the returning snooze capability in Calendar doesn’t seem to be as robust as the snooze feature in Google’s Inbox which allows you to select a particular location until which the reminder is snoozed. Nevertheless, for those of us who still prefer using Gmail + Google Calendar over Google Inbox, this update is definitely welcome.

Reddit is often known as the front page of the internet, deriving its spontaneity and popularity from communities focused around varied topic segments. The system in place lets individuals post content, and then others can upvote or downvote the content depending on its fit around the topic segment and their viewpoint. These upvotes and downvotes decide how much attention the content further gets. The individual is thus at the center of Reddit’s functioning. Some users might not appreciate the fact that Reddit can personalize recommendations. To cater to this specific need, Reddit’s official app is introducing an Anonymous Browsing mode.
As the name implies, Anonymous Browsing allows users to browse content on the Reddit mobile app without associating activities like searches and viewed communities with the user’s Reddit account. The official announcement lays down that in Anonymous Browsing, Reddit will not:
- Save your browsing or search history to your Reddit account
- Use your Reddit activity to personalize your recommendations
- Use your Reddit activity to send you personalized notifications
Of course, when a user is browsing anonymously, they will not be able to post, vote, comment, or take other actions that would need an account. But switching between a logged-in profile and Anonymous Browsing is easy and painless, so one can always swap back over when there is a need for interaction. If the Anonymous Browsing session is inactive for 30 minutes, the session will end and the user will be switched back to the profile that was last active.
The announcement post has further detailed how this feature is different from simply logging out, and from the previous anonymous browsing mode (which was simply emulating logged-out behavior):
New Behavior
- When you start an Anonymous Browsing session, the session is assigned a new set of unique IDs, so that there’s no connection between that session and your Reddit account. It’s like you’re creating a new account with a new set of IDs every time you start an Anonymous Browsing session.
- Because of the unique IDs, Reddit’s personalization engine resets every time you enter and exit the mode (to the engine, during an Anonymous Browsing session, you look like a newbie, with no search history).
- While in Anonymous Browsing, you also won’t get personalized push notifications based on your Reddit activity during the session (any personalized notifications you receive during Anonymous Browsing would be related to prior activity associated with your logged-in Reddit accounts).
- When you exit an Anonymous Browsing session, you are returned to the account you were previously using, and Reddit clears and deletes the browsing and search history for the session off the device you’re using. Any data collected during the session is only connected to the unique IDs, not your Reddit account.
Anonymous Browsing is rolling out on the official Reddit for Android app. To access this feature, tap on your profile picture and then tap on the username to open a list of accounts, and select the new option.
While most Redditors prefer different third-party clients to access the website, the official app has continued to grow in popularity ever since its launch. The official Reddit for Android app has received several key updates in the past, like spoiler and NSFW tagging, account switching, ability to view subreddit wikis, showing warnings before posting on highly moderated subreddits, dark mode, and more.

For a long time now, trying to use Google and Amazon services on their respective platforms has been a frustrating experience. Amazon’s Prime Video apps have never supported the Chromecast, and for a long time, you couldn’t buy Chromecast devices from Amazon.com. Google removed YouTube from the Amazon Echo Show and Fire TV back in 2017. Thankfully, it appears the relationship is thawing.
According to Engadget, the main YouTube app will finally be available on Amazon Fire TV devices in the “coming months.” YouTube TV and YouTube Kids will also be available on the platform sometime afterward. Unfortunately, it still will not be available on the Amazon Echo Show or Kindle Fire tablets, so there’s is still room for improvement. This information comes from a Google spokesperson.
The news gets even better if you watch Amazon Prime Video without a Fire TV device. Prime Video will finally get the ability to cast to Chromecast. The report also mentioned Android TV support, but the Prime Video app has been available for the NVIDIA Shield TV and other devices for a while already. This is great news for consumers. The rocky relationship between Amazon and Google was a big pain to people who use both ecosystems.

Update: Rolling out
After announcing their truce back in April, the previously announced Amazon/Google platform cooperation is now rolling out. That means the YouTube app is back on the Amazon Fire TV and Prime Video is available for all Android TV devices and Chromecast. Prime Video was previously available on a select few Android TV devices.
YouTube is available on the Fire TV Stick (2nd Gen), Fire TV Stick 4K, Fire TV Cube, Fire TV Stick Basic Edition, and Toshiba, Insignia, Element, and Westinghouse Fire TV Edition smart TVs. Prime Video can be downloaded on most Android TV devices and it works with Chromecast and Chromecast built-in devices. This is a huge win for users of both ecosystems.

Location Information
We and our service providers may automatically collect location information, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) from your computer or mobile device. If you access the Services through a mobile device, we may also ask you to share your specific geo-location information with us. The Services use this location information to provide customized location-based services, content, promotional offers and other information that may be of interest to you.

We may also use location information to improve the functionality of the Services and our other products services. We and our service providers may also collect other information based on your location and your device’s proximity to “beacons” and other similar indoor proximity systems, including, for example, the strength of the signal between the “beacon” and your device and the duration that your device is near the “beacon.” If you do not wish to have this location information collected and used by us and our service providers, you may disable the location features on your device. Please note that if you disable such features, you will not be able to access or receive some or all of the services, content, features and/or products made available via the Services.

What is Personalized Content & Advertising?
Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the “Cookies and other electronic technologies” section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you. For example, the Google Trusted Store badge displayed on some of the Services is served to you through the use of cookies. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here.
If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.
Tailored Advertising
We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
In connection with the foregoing, we may work with DigiTrust to set a first-party cookie in your browser to enable us and DigiTrust Partners to collect web viewing data that includes visits to the Services and non-affiliated websites over time. This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other users, and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences. Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of our Services. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form and content that you share publicly when using the services (e.g., user-generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies, including DigiTrust, may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link , the opt-out page of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, or TrustArc’s Preference Manager to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. You may also use the links available in advertisements that appear in the Services and learn more about our advertising practices through the About Our Ads link available through the Services.
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored.
When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. We also may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. You can opt-out from third-party interest-based advertising on some Android devices and Google apps by visiting Google Settings, Ads and then click on ‘Disable ads based on interests.’ You can also opt out of some interest-based advertising on your mobile device by downloading the TrustArc Privacy App available at: https://www.trustarc.com/consumer-resources/privacy-app/.
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. n that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform online services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide links to the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out pages, as well as choices provided by Google Ads, Google Analytics, and TrustArc. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here
What are my rights and choices?
You may review and update certain information through your relevant account settings on the Services. For additional assistance with reviewing or modifying information provided to us, contact us as described below.
If you have provided contact information through the Services and decide that you do not want us to use that information for marketing purposes in accordance with this Policy, you can opt out of future use at any time by: (a) going to the link provided at the bottom of any email you receive and opting out of receiving future information; or (b) contacting us via the email address at the bottom of this page. Please note that you may not be able to opt out of emails about your transactions and relationship with us, such as emails regarding your account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and/or services.
Individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and many other jurisdictions have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them, and to obtain its correction, update, amendment, or deletion in appropriate circumstances. You may also have rights to object to our handling of your personal data, restrict our processing of your personal data, and to withdraw any consent you have provided. To exercise these rights, please contact us at the email address below with the nature of your request. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal information. This proof of identity will typically take the form of your e-mail address and any password submitted upon registration. While we strongly encourage you to first raise any questions or concerns about your personal data with us, you also have a right to contact the relevant supervisory authority.
Many of the rights described here are subject to significant limitations and exceptions under applicable law (e.g., objections to the processing of personal data, and withdrawals of consent, typically will not have retroactive effect).
Will We Disclose Your Information?
We may disclose and/or share your information between members of KC Online Media, LLC, and to or with any non-affiliated third parties under the following circumstances:
- Consent. We may disclose your information to any third parties based on your consent to do so.
- Service Providers. We may provide access to or share your information with select third parties who perform services on our behalf and for any other legitimate business purpose. These third parties provide a variety of services to us, including without limitation billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market research, customer support, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, and legal services.
- Business Partners. We may provide your information to individuals and companies with whom we have business relationships to provide you with special coupons, discounts, or promotions, or to offer products and services to you for purchase. We encourage these partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.
- Protection of XDA Developers and Others. By using the Services, you acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your information, including, but not limited to, any user content, if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce our Terms of Service, this Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of XDA Devlopers, its agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.
- Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such transactions, e.g., due diligence) user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.
- Public Forums. Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs and community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Please also remember that if you choose to provide information on public features of the Services, individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it’s information you want to share with the public.

[email protected]Lately, we have seen a rather drastic shift in the world of mobile device gaming. The infamous Angry Birds series has tried to reinvent itself again and again, attempting to continue reigning supreme over all else. However, it seems that it was not really enough, and it makes sense. After all, just how many times can you possibly...The Sony PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller works with Android devices and PCs
PCs and Android devices provide robust support for a number of peripherals, including Xbox and Stadia controllers. If you were wondering whether or not that includes the DualSense controller from Sony’s upcoming PlayStation 5, then the answer is yes—mostly.
Thanks to Austin Evans on YouTube, we have confirmation that the next generation controller is capable of connecting to PC and Android. In an in-depth video of the DualSense controller’s hardware, which also reveals a neat textured design on the back featuring small triangles, squares, circles, and crosses, Evans demonstrates the controller working out of the box with a Surface Laptop Go over a wired connection (at about 6:20 in the video).
Evans also manages to wirelessly connect the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller to his Google Pixel 5 via Bluetooth (at about 6:50 in the video), and he then plays a game streamed over Microsoft’s Xbox Game Streaming. Bluetooth compatibility can be a mess on Android, especially when it comes to latency and keymapping, so it’s nice to know that it just works. There is a caveat, though, namely that when he connected the controller to his PC and Android device, Evans wasn’t able to experience any of the controller’s new features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.
He also tries to connect the PS5’s DualSense controller to other devices, including a PlayStation 4 Pro and an Xbox Series X, but he didn’t have much luck getting the controller to do much. Neither console recognizes button presses from the DualSense controller, but that could change with future firmware updates (though don’t count on support being added to the Xbox).
Sony says the PS5’s DualSense controller is only compatible with its upcoming console, but the video clearly shows otherwise. The PlayStation 5 is set to launch on November 12, so it won’t be much longer before we can all connect the DualSense controller to our own Android devices. After all, the best controller is the one you have on you.UK could ban the sales of locked phones
Locked phones might soon be a thing of the past in the UK as the country’s communications regulator — Ofcom — is proposing a rule to ban carriers from selling phones that are locked to their network. Currently, carriers like O2, Sky, Three, Virgin Mobile, along with some smaller carriers offer unlocked phones. However, carriers like BT Mobile/EE, Tesco Mobile and Vodafone don’t offer unlocked phones in the country. With the new rule, Ofcom aims to change that and prompt such carriers to offer customers better clarity regarding the locked/unlocked status of their devices.
As reported by Engadget, Ofcom wants to level the playing field to give users a better experience. Research indicates that around 50 percent of people in the country face issues while unlocking their devices. The problems arise due to long wait times for unlock codes or faulty unlock codes that further delay the process. Customers have even claimed that they lost service until they received an unlock code to switch between carriers. Ofcom suggests that problems like these can discourage customers from switching to another network.
To fix the issue, Ofcom has proposed two approaches. The regulatory authority wants carriers to either seel devices that are already unlocked or make it easier for customers to unlock their devices themselves. As part of the second option, the authority wants carriers to unlock devices automatically and inform customers over text. In case that’s not possible, Ofcom wants network providers to proactively send unlock codes along with directions to help customers.
Due to the complexities posed by the second option, the regulator prefers the first option which would save customers both time and effort. Ofcom is currently holding a consultation on its proposal that runs until early March. If the authority decides to ban locked devices, the ban will be imposed 12 months after its announcement.

Via: EngadgetWell, whew. Techtober is still at full steam, and we have started to see several exciting technology announcements in the last few weeks. Apple’s iPhone 12 lineup brings 5G to the mainstream and also brings several generational improvements over the previous iPhone 11 series. The Huawei Mate 40 Pro shows that the company can still manage to innovate despite the hardships they’re facing. We’ve just opened forums for the new iPhone 12 series — a first in XDA’s long history — as well as forums for the new Mate 40 Pro.
But that’s not all. We’ve also opened forums for the Lenovo Legion Duel, a gaming smartphone that’s uniquely designed to be held horizontally, and the OPPO Reno4 5G series, a trio of premium-looking, upper mid-range smartphones.
Apple iPhone 12 Series
I’ll address the elephant in the room first because I know that this will be pointed out in the comments. Yes, we now have forums for Apple devices, starting with the iPhone 12. While we’ve never been a site devoted to just Android (XDA is older than Android, after all), we’ve typically shied away from iPhone discussion because of Apple’s walled-garden approach to software and hardware. While that hasn’t changed, there is still a thriving community of iPhone jailbreakers. We’ve even seen devs boot Android on a jailbroken iPhone.
Now, flashing LineageOS on the iPhone 12 is a very long shot, but who knows what interesting developments will arise in the future? Not to mention, we’ve typically still opened forums for phones without an officially unlockable bootloader, because we feel it’s still worth providing a space for users to discuss tips, tricks, accessories, apps, and mods. There are more people browsing XDA from an iPhone than you might think, and if you’re one of them, you can check out the new iPhone 12 forums below for general device discussion.
Apple iPhone 12 Forums
Huawei Mate 40 Pro, Lenovo Legion Phone Duel, and OPPO Reno4 5G Series
As for the other devices, if you’re planning on getting a Mate 40 Pro, the Reno4 5G series, or the Lenovo Legion Duel, we have also opened forums for all of those devices. Whether you want to try and sideload Google apps on your Mate 40 Pro, potentially unlocking the bootloader of your shiny new Lenovo and modding it to hell and back, or install a Google Camera mod on your Reno4 Pro 5G, we have a space for you to talk about all of those things.

The Amazon Fire TV is a really solid streaming box if you want something that’ll stream 4K content, have access to a strong selection of apps, offer some decent games to play, and look fairly sleek on your TV stand. Dig a bit deeper into the Fire TV though, and you can do some pretty neat things with this little guy.
We’ve seen previous mods for the Fire TV that allow you to install GApps onto it, and while that’s great if that’s all you want to do, XDA Junior Member SimLynks recently created a thread over on the Forum to introduce a new mod that allows you to essentially transform your Amazon Fire TV into an Android TV.
The mod is called, “Playing With Fire”, and it requires root access, the Xposed Framework, Build.prop modifications, changes to the system partition, and (of course) very careful reading of all the instructions that SimLynks has provided. Going through all of these steps will require a bit of time, but seeing as how this mod changes pretty much every single thing about the Fire TV, that’s to be expected — make sure to be very, very careful when following these instructions.
Once you do get everything up and working, you’ll have access to the full Android TV user interface, OpenGApps with almost everything working (Live Channels, USB Tuner, Leanback Launcher, etc.), the ability to install and run apps from both the Google Play Store and Amazon’s App Store, automatic updates for Google Services and from the Play Store, button remapping, and much more.
This mod is not for the faint of heart, but if you’ve got a rooted Fire TV or TV Stick (both version 1 and 2 should work) and a bit of spare time on your hands, this is certainly one of the most interesting developments for the platform that we’ve seen yet.
You can head over to the thread on the XDA Forums via the link below, and while you should’t have any issues as long as you follow everything step-by-step, you can always reach out to the community for assistance should you run into any bugs or issues.
SimLynks’ Guide on XDA ForumsBack in December, Samsung announced both the Galaxy A71 and Galaxy A51. The A series of smartphones from Samsung tend to be more budget-oriented, with a feature or two which aims to help them stand out against the competition. Shortly after both of those aforementioned devices were announced, the company quietly revealed another addition to the A series...Android 11 includes a host of new features, both for the end-user and developers. On top of that, Google also included several improvements for features that were released with previous versions. We talked about one such feature, called Smart Keyboard Suggestions, earlier this year, which streamlined the platform's autofill experience.Here are the 4 types of...Nokia 2 V Tella is an $89 budget phone for Verizon with the MediaTek Helio A22 SoC
HMD Global’s Nokia smartphone lineup is pretty straightforward: the lower the model number, the lower-end the device. For example, the Nokia 1 is the lowest-end device from the company, while the Nokia 9 PureView is the company’s highest-end model. But there are also secondary models that branch off from the main line, and the differences between these devices can get pretty confusing. Case in point, the new Nokia 2 V Tella: A new budget smartphone announced today that’s available for Verizon Wireless customers in the U.S. The Nokia 2 V is essentially a rebranded Nokia 2.1, so the new 2 V Tella seems to be more of the same. For its price, it seems to actually be a pretty decent phone for Verizon customers in the U.S. who have a lower budget.
The Nokia 2 V Tella isn’t exactly what you’d call a speed beast. After all, it is focused on the essentials only. The MediaTek Helio A22 system-on-chip is fabricated using a 12nm manufacturing process and has a quad-core CPU configuration consisting of four ARM Cortex-A53 cores clocked at up to 2.0 GHz. It is a pretty outdated chip, having launched in mid-2018, but it’s not a bad processor for the price. Because of the modem in this chip, you obviously won’t find fancy features like 5G connectivity. This is the same chip that is found in the Nokia 2.2 and Nokia 2.3, after all. The other new Nokia 2-series device, the Nokia 2.4 brings a slightly better MediaTek Helio P22 chip.
As for the rest of the specs, you have a 5.45″ HD+ resolution display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, so no fancy bezel-less design will be found here. Its dimensions measure 5.93″ x 2.82″ x 0.36″ and it weighs 6.35oz. The phone has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. The 3,000 mAh battery is hardly impressive considering the Nokia 2.3 had a 4,000 mAh one, but it should still be able to provide decent battery life considering the device’s internals. Plus, it’s apparently removable. Surprisingly, the phone has a USB Type-C port, which you sometimes still don’t see at this price point. The phone supports charging at 10W, though only a 5W charger is included in the box. Unsurprisingly, though, the phone has a 3.5mm headphone jack, which you do still see at this price point. There’s a dual rear camera with an 8MP and 2MP sensor, as well as a 5MP front-facing one. Finally, the device is running Android 10 out-of-the-box and has a Google Assistant key.
What is great, though, is the price: HMD Global says the Nokia 2 V Tella will be available on Verizon for $168 in a blue color. What’s a bit confusing, though, is that HMD Global’s press release mentions that the device will also be available at Walmart for $89. We’re not sure why there is a discrepancy, but the phone has already been listed on Walmart.com at this price, so we don’t think it’s a mistake. Regardless, this is a fairly decent price for a carrier phone in the U.S., as you’re getting a dirt-cheap device that will work straight out of the box on Verizon’s network.

If you want the most purchasing ease, then Amazon is the way to go. Of course, you might need to pay for the convenience, as Amazon doesn’t have much in the way of discounts. Still, it’s hard to argue with Prime shipping and an 18-month payment plan if you have the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card.
Samsung
Of the unlocked phone options, the Samsung Store has the best deals. You can get up to $650 in trade-in credit with an eligible phone. Also, with Samsung Financing, you can finance the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra over 36 months at 0% APR, giving by far the lowest monthly payments out of all the retailers. It’s a good option if you plan to hold onto this one for a while!
Best Buy
If you activate your Galaxy Note 20 Ultra with Best Buy, you can save big if you activate today. If you want an unlocked phone, you can save $50. However, if you go with any of Best Buy’s carrier options (AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint), you’ll save $200! Since you’ll probably be going with one of these carriers even with an unlocked phone, it’s a pretty good deal.
Best Carrier Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Deals in the US
If you have a US carrier in mind for your phone, you can get some great Galaxy Note 20 Ultra deals from Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile. Some of these deals are even better than the unlocked Galaxy Note 20 Ultra deals, depending on what you’re looking for!
Verizon
Verizon, as usual, has a whole slew of deals you may (or may not) be able to take advantage of, including trade-in credit, gift cards, and more. Here’s the breakdown:
- Buy one phone, get another (with a new line) up to $700 off
- Get up to $500 off with trade-ins
- Get a $250 Verizon e-Gift Card when you switch from another carrier to Verizon
- Get Verizon Stream TV for free
- Get Marvel’s Avengers for free
If you’re switching to Verizon, you’ll get the best deals, but there is something there for even current Verizon customers to take advantage of!
AT&T
For AT&T, both new and existing customers can get up to $700 in trade-in value if they pick an Unlimited data plan. Samsung’s trade-in program comes close, but AT&T wins for the best trade-in deal for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra! Additionally, when buying any Samsung phone, you can save $50 on the Galaxy Buds Live at check-out.A major reason for the rise in popularity of mobile gaming is that most of them are free of cost. Of course, they come at the expense of advertisements or in-game purchases, but the real essence of the game seems mostly intact. Take, for instance, PUBG. Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds is originally a PC and console game,...Download the live wallpapers from the Google Pixel 5 on any device
The Google Pixel 5 is now officially out, and the reviews are raving wild, including our own. It serves as Google’s best flagship value proposition in years. While the device doesn’t carry the latest and greatest Snapdragon 800-series processor—the first “premium” Pixel to not feature a flagship processor—it still features all of the camera prowess that Pixel phones have been known for, the amazing 90Hz display featured in the Pixel 4 (in a much more modern form factor with a hole-punch display), and the Snapdragon 765G still delivers good performance. But it’ll set you back $700 in the U.S., which, while less than previous Pixel phones, is not exactly cheap either.
Google Pixel 5 Forums
If you can’t afford the Pixel 5 right now (or you’re just not planning to get it), but you still want some of those sweet looks for your Pixel device (or really any device), XDA Recognized Developer Pranav Pandey has ported the all-new live wallpapers to other Android smartphones. This Google Pixel 5 live wallpaper port should work on any device running Android 7.0 Nougat or higher. You also have two live wallpapers to choose from: Moving Shadows and Stepping Stones. And both of these live wallpapers has 4 different variants to choose from.
There’s also evidence of a third live wallpaper called Conveyor Belt, but sadly, it’s not fully implemented yet. The best we could do was extracting a still preview of it.
If you’re a diehard Google fan and looking forward to the Pixel 5, then these are definitely worth a look. And they work with Android Nougat and up, so you can actually check them out on basically any device—it doesn’t even need to be a Google Pixel phone.
You can download the live wallpaper from Pranav Pandey’s forum post linked below.

While their growing 5G network doesn't boast the same throughput as Verizon's Ultra Wideband mmWave 5G, AT&T's sub-6GHz provides far better coverage. Today, the carrier announced they've reached a big milestone....Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick Devices are being Infected with Cryptocurrency Malware
Several users in our forums have reported that their Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV Stick devices have suddenly become very slow to use. This sudden slowdown coincides with the appearance of an app simply called “test” that keeps popping up randomly. Not only is the popup annoying, but it also causes video playback to stop and apps to stop responding, making it very difficult to continue using the device normally.
As it turns out, this “test” app is actually cryptocurrency malware that is infecting Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick devices. The Test APK with the package name “com.google.time.timer” autostarts itself to execute a variation of the infamous ADB.Miner malware. Once a device is infected, the virus begins to use 100% of the device’s processing resources to mine Monero using CoinHive. To make matters worse, the malware spreads itself to other Android devices on the same network using ADB, making it difficult to deal with the situation.
Is my device infected?
Amazon Fire TV devices that are infected are slowed down drastically, with apps taking really long to load and all actions responding lazily. The Test app will also randomly pop up on the screen and make interaction with the UI difficult.
Simply checking for the Test application in the application list or in the application management settings doesn’t work as the app does not appear in these lists. Instead, use an app like Total Commander from the Amazon App Store to check. The Test app can appear even on devices that have not sideloaded any apps themselves, as the malware can spread itself to other devices over the network.
The exact source application of the malware is currently uncertain. However, it would not be far-fetched to pin the blame on sideloaded apps that aid in piracy of movies and TV shows.
Cleanup Solutions
If one of your devices is infected, there is a high chance that other Android devices (and not just Amazon Fire TV devices) on the same network are infected too. Before proceeding for cleanup, ensure that you disable ADB Debugging on all your devices, infected or otherwise.
Factory Reset
The most effective solution is to factory reset the infected device, as well as all other devices on the same network. Factory reset can be found in system settings. It will erase everything on the device and start from scratch. Make sure to back up anything important before doing a factory reset.
Uninstall Modded Virus
This solution is not recommended because the extent of the virus and the modifications it does on your system are unknown. You should only consider this option if factory resetting your devices is absolutely not an option.
You can delete the virus files using the following ADB commands:
shell rm data/local/tmp/ufo.apk shell rm data/local/tmp/lock.txt shell rm data/local/tmp/smi shell rm data/local/tmp/endat shell rm data/local/tmp/nohup uninstall com.google.time.timer reboot
Install a modded virus
This solution is inferior to factory resetting your device and hence, not recommended. You can install a modified virus application, created by XDA Member innovaciones, which “turns off” the mining function of the virus. This is achieved by substituting the run.html file in the virus with a blank page that does not have a mining script. Other changes fool the virus into reporting success, while in effect, the virus will not be generating any revenue. You can then hide the application.
You can find the modified virus attached in this post in our forums.
To prevent a re-infection, be careful of the applications that you install on your devices, and turn off “ADB Debugging” when not in use. Even if your devices are not showing a sign of infection, it would be prudent to check for the existence of this app and to keep ADB Debugging disabled until you actually need it.
Source: Fire TV Forums Story Via: AFTV NewsWe're nearing the time of year when OnePlus refreshes their smartphone lineup. The company already revealed when they will be announcing the OnePlus 7 series (multiple devices this year). Since we know this will be a popular device in our community, the XDA Forums for the OnePlus 7 are already open and ready!
OnePlus is going...Privacy has always been a concern, and has somewhat heightened by recent revelations. And although I doubt any government would resort to using apps to 'maintain national security,' there are still dodgy 'developers' out there you need to look out for. So to help out with that, XDA Senior Member jacksparao introduced Who is Tracking.Who is Tracking...Limited by Your HTC U11’s Edge Sense? Try Edge Sense Plus For More Shortcuts and Features!
Launchers in general are what make Android (and really any OS outside of iOS) as special as they are, at least when you look at it from a non-coder, end user perspective. Every device manufacturer in this day and age has their very own flavor to separate themselves from the competition. However, if it wasn’t for the aid of the community, most launchers would likely still look like the barren desert that used to be the Windows Mobile home screen. With this in mind, our community keeps on finding creative ways to improve on the design of manufacturers by using feedback from power users and the likes of people who would squeeze the juice out of devices like the HTC U11. This is how Edge Sense Plus was born.
Arguably, the one who started the trend of improving launchers was HTC back in the yester-years of Windows Mobile with the release of their TouchFLO interface. At that time, they needed something new and refreshing because Apple had just showed the world that there was life beyond Windows Mobile. On top of that, a few other manufacturers had started getting into the PDA-Phone game (namely Sony, Toshiba, LG, and Samsung). Some launchers for the now-defunct operating system were available from 3rd parties and even a few from communities like ours, but none came close to the graphical beauty that was HTC’s offering.
Having said this, TouchFLO was limited (and sometimes purposely crippled depending on which variant of the device you looked at). So, after many iterations and device releases, Sense was born. This was a unique interface, which combined app-like items on the home screens, which we now know as widgets, shortcuts, action buttons, and gorgeous 3D animations for things like photo gallery and e-mail previews. Oh yes, Sense was the pinnacle of perfection, or was it? Despite all the aforementioned, people wanted more out of Sense. For instance, more on-homescreen shortcuts were always sought after. Not too long after that came one of our site’s most infamous members, XDA Retired Recognized Developer Co0kieMonster, who brought us C0okie’s Home Tab for Sense. This was an add-on to Sense, which extended its core functions substantially.
Fast forward to today (about 7 years later), and HTC is out and about with their brand new offering in the Sense UI, attempting to innovate by means of the hardware offered in the new HTC U11 and the squeezable frame which, in all reality, is HTC’s take on edge/second screen tech offered by competitors. While it is a good and refreshing take on the “getting more out of your device” concept, our devs figured that it can be taken a few steps further. So, with that in mind, XDA Recognized Developer j to the 4n came to the rescue with Edge Sense Plus.
So, what can you do with this? Well, if you ever wanted to choke your device and make it squeal out of pure frustration, you can now do that. One of the more “fun” features that this app adds to the UI is the ability to play a specific sound file (ie mp3) when you trigger the feature by squeezing. Alternatively, you can also experience the joy that Homer Simpson feels when he gets to choke Bart, while yelling “why you little?”
There are, of course, more useful things that one can do. For instance, according to XDA Recognized Themer Basil3, Edge Sense Plus allows you to perform 27 different actions, use a Sidebar (like the Edge panel), play sounds (as described above), and even use the G-Sensor in some inventive way.
Custom actions:
Currently you can choose from 27 different actions, including:
- Sidebar
- Custom App
- Shortcuts – e.g. to make direct calls!
- Recent Apps
- Toggle Autorotation
- Autobrightness (6 states: Auto, Min, Low, Mid, High, Max)
- Split Screen
- Expand/Collapse Statusbar
- Split Screen
So, if you own an U11, head over to the Edge Sense Plus thread and start playing with the endless possibilities that this mod adds to the user experience.

It might not be the juggernaut that is Google Chrome, but Samsung Internet has gained a dedicated following thanks to the extra features that it offers on top of Google’s browser. Just recently we reported on the new Samsung Internet 8.2 beta that brought features like parallel downloading for faster file downloads and Do Not Track mode. In the first Samsung Experience 10.0 build based on Android Pie for the Samsung Galaxy S9+ that we found, we were able to get an even newer version of Samsung Internet. Samsung Internet 9.0 brings a major redesign to the browser with the new rounded corner UI found in Samsung Experience 10.
This new update brings a redesigned quick access menu. This quick access menu allows you to request a desktop site, turn on night mode, change text size, and control your add-ons (the content blocker and tracker blocker). Night mode is a cool feature which will dynamically change background and text color on websites without changing any pictures. This shortcut does not connect to the new system-wide night mode in the Android Pie update for the Galaxy S9+, so you will still need to manually enable it.
This new design language in Samsung Internet 9.0 really speaks to what Samsung is trying to do with their Android 9 Pie update and Samsung Experience 10. The new rounded edges match those of the actual Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S9. I am personally a fan of the rounded design.
You can install this for yourself by downloading it from our AndroidFileHost page. This app will not install on Samsung phones running Android 7.0 or later. However, it will install on any other Android device running Android 5.0 Lollipop and newer. We successfully installed it on a Google Pixel 2 XL and OnePlus 6 running Android 9 Pie, for instance. On non-Samsung devices, it will work just like how it does on Samsung phones except without Samsung Pay integration.

It’s fair to say that since the last couple of years, there has been no buzzword having as strong a marketing impact as the word 5G. The word signifies so much that the industry has been promoting it every nook and corner. New smartphones support 5G. New carrier deployments talk about 5G services. Chip vendors talk about 5G modems and SoCs. Device makers upsell 5G as the “next big thing” that will “change users’ lives.” Depending on who you talk to, you’ll hear different things about 5G. Is it mildly upgraded 4G mobile broadband, or is it the technology that will connect industries and services, power a massive number of IoT devices, and serve as the backbone support for future innovation? What is 5G, exactly? Is it worth the hype?
5G will be a big part of the mobile era in the 2020s, and it will be tough to separate the wheat from the chaff. What do consumers need to be aware of? This is our in-depth guide to 5G where we’ll lay out the answers to these questions.
What is 5G?
5G is the fifth generation mobile network. 5G NR (New Radio) is the air interface that powers 5G, succeeding 4G LTE. The 5G specification was developed by the 3GPP, an industry standards body. Release 15 of the specification was completed in 2018, while Release 16 was completed in June 2020.
Similar to 4G, 5G is a cellular mobile network that powers mobile broadband. It uses different radiofrequency (RF) waves than 4G, but the underlying principle is the same: networks are divided into cells, and devices get cellular connectivity by connecting to radio waves emitting from a carrier-installed node. The big benefits of 5G over 4G are increased capacity, higher bandwidth, and higher speeds.
The background
Every ten years or so, mobile networks get a technology upgrade in terms of the standard. The 1G networks of the 1980s were analog networks. The release of 2G GSM was a big milestone back in 1991, as 2G networks were digital networks. 2G networks, for example, brought support for SMS texting. There were two types of 2G networks: GSM and CDMA2000. The 2G GSM networks later brought rudimentary and slow mobile data in the form of GPRS and EDGE (2.5G and 2.75G respectively). Browsing the web with 2G meant waiting minutes for a web page to load, but this was only the beginning of mobile Internet.
The first commercial 3G networks were rolled out in 2001. While 2G signified digital voice calling, 3G signified mobile data. Just like 2G, 3G was of three types: WCDMA (which was used in global phones), and EVDO Rev A. It took a long time for 3G networks to proliferate across the world; India, for example, didn’t have 3G networks until 2010. While mobile Internet was a viable venture with 3G, data speeds weren’t that good, as 3G UMTS only had a 144Kbps data speed target in the beginning. HSPA and HSPA+ (3.5G) did improve data speeds, but for the most part, browsing the web on 3G was a slow experience with speeds ranging from 1Mbps to 10Mbps on average.
Then came 4G LTE networks, starting in 2010. 4G was the standard that made fast, usable mobile data a reality. It had a data download speed target of 100Mbps, but most 4G networks these days have only 10-50Mbps download speeds because of congestion. It unlocked new industries such as ride sharing. It brought IP-based telephony in the form of Voice over LTE (VoLTE). 4G LTE was the successor to both global 3G (WCDMA/UMTS/HSPA) and EVDO Rev A. 4G networks were the best yet, and smartphones featuring 4G were more powerful than ever. 4G has been iterated upon by LTE-Advanced, and advancements in 4G keep happening with new modem chips being released every year. 4G is a mature technology, one that has changed the world.
With ever-increasing data requirements, though, 4G couldn’t keep up. 4G networks were starting to become congested, and as more consumers used them, data speeds started falling.
The time for a new cellular generation had arrived.
5G networks and modems have been in development for four years now, but commercial 5G only started to became a reality in 2019. In 2020, more 5G networks were rolled out, and more 5G devices were released on the market. 5G is still not a mainstream reality for more than half of the world, but over the next five years, that will change. The roll out of 4G networks is nearly complete, and so, carriers will now turn their attention to 5G.
The applications of 5G: cellular data and voice, enterprise solutions, and IoT
5G is a broad term. Generally speaking, it has applications in three fields:
5G for smartphone users deals with the first field. The enterprise sector will, no doubt, benefit from it as well, with applications in industries such as driverless cars, smart cities, uses in the medical sector, smart machinery, smart manufacturing, etc. With respect to the third field, IoT, the telecommunications and mobile industries have been proclaiming for years that 5G will connect Internet of Things (IoT) devices in massive numbers. Everything around us will be connected. Will it happen? Possibly. For smartphone users, the latter two fields are academically interesting, but it’s the first field—mobile data and voice—which actually matters for end users.
For smartphone users, 5G refers to faster data—much, much faster in some cases. The new networks also promise incredibly low latency, on par with wired broadband. This will be a big deal for use cases such as multiplayer cloud gaming which rely on extremely low latency. While 4G networks have never managed to get latency down to wired broadband levels, 5G is promising just that.
5G will also have much higher bandwidth and network data capacity. Supposedly, it won’t be as overwhelmed as 4G was when a huge number of users begin using the network. For carriers that have overwhelmed 4G networks, 5G will represent improved quality of service, less downtime, and a better customer experience.
It’s all about the speeds, though. The 5G specification targets 20Gbps maximum downlink speeds, which is ten times more than the highest 4G LTE modem chip (which go as high as 2Gbps). Of course, 20Gbps is only a theoretical target so far. The best modem chips released by chip vendors Qualcomm and Samsung can go as high as a theoretical maximum of 7.5Gbps (when using millimeter wave 5G) and 5Gbps (when using sub-6GHz 5G). In the real world, some mmWave 5G networks have gone as high as 1.5Gbps downlink, while sub-6GHz 5G networks have gone as high as 600-700Mbps.
With these speeds, consumers will naturally expect 5G to be an order of magnitude faster than their existing 4G LTE networks. It’s more complicated than that, though. Networks such as T-Mobile and AT&T’s low-band 5G networks are only slightly faster than 4G networks, to the extent where some are calling them 4.9G. In some cases, they may even be slower. A 5G network doesn’t necessarily mean it will be substantially faster than a 4G network, because it’s all about the radiofrequency spectrum. The rabbit hole here is quite deep, so you can have 5G networks with data downlink speeds of only 30-50Mbps, while other mid band 5G networks can go as high as 500-600Mbps. Networks vary. Network types vary as well.
The technology behind 5G: OFDM, spectrum, and modes
Speaking broadly, 5G is powered by the same technology that powers 4G: orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). I’m not going deeply into technical specifics here. OFDM is a type of digital transmission and a method of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies. It’s robust and efficient, so it’s the technology of choice. 5G incorporates both frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) technologies, just like 4G (FDD-LTE and TDD-LTE).
The key characteristic that separates 5G from 4G is spectrum. Spectrum is the range of electromagnetic frequencies that are used to transmit data through the air. 5G can use a broader spectrum of RF waves than 4G, which gives it the ability to provide higher speeds and higher data capacity. 10-20MHz of 5G spectrum in a low band such as 600MHz will give speeds ranging from 50Mbps-100Mbps, but with more spectrum, the speeds go rapidly up.
4G spectrum can also be re-purposed thanks to a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS). This is what carriers such as AT&T is doing in the U.S. The highest 5G speeds will only be achieved with different spectrum, though.
There are two modes of 5G: non-standalone mode (NSA) and standalone mode (SA). Right now, nearly every carrier is relying on NSA 5G. Here, the 5G network is dependent on 4G base stations and 4G core network. The data link transfer in such networks is using 4G network facilities. NSA is easier for carriers to deploy as they can reuse their 4G core networks and network facilities. The disadvantage here is that it’s dependent on 4G so speeds won’t be as high, while latency won’t go as low as it can go in SA mode.
The SA mode is the true 5G dream that has yet to be widely realized. A few mobile network operators like T-Mobile in the U.S. have started to flip the switch for SA mode, but a broader roll out will happen in 2021 for more carriers. SA 5G networks are completely independent of 4G, as they use a 5G core network and independent network facilities. The data link transfer here doesn’t rely on 4G, which means SA networks can promise much higher speeds and much lower latency.
Newer smartphone releases powered by the latest modems support both modes, meaning they support future SA networks in addition to the current NSA networks.
Network bands explained
Sub-6GHz – Low band and mid band
There are two types of 5G. One is sub-6GHz 5G, which can be thought of as the true successor to 4G LTE. The other is millimeter wave 5G (mmWave). When you read about 1Gbps downlink speeds and line-of-sight to node requirements, you’re reading about mmWave. When you read about reliable 5G networks that actually work indoors and with real-world speeds of 100-500Mbps, you’re reading about sub-6GHz.
Most consumers will only experience sub-6GHz, because globally, carriers have been intelligent enough to treat mmWave with caution. In some countries such as the U.S., though, carriers have (cynically, in my opinion) launched mmWave first because of the initial lack of available sub-6GHz spectrum. While countries such as Russia, Japan, and South Korea have joined the mmWave bandwagon, the vast majority of the world has chosen to play it safe with sub-6GHz.
What do these terms mean, though?
Sub-6GHz 5G (also referred to as sub-6) means the radio frequencies of the network bands are lower than 6GHz. (As an aside, all 4G bands are sub-6GHz.) mmWave, on the other hand, means the radio frequencies of the bands are higher than 6GHz. mmWave bands range from 24GHz all the way to 100GHz, but in practice, carriers have rolled out networks ranging from 26GHz-39GHz so far.
Sub-6GHz is of two types: low band and mid band.
Low band 5G is similar to the FDD-LTE bands that are used in 4G networks today. These bands have the lowest radio frequencies of the 5G “layer cake” dubbed by T-Mobile. T-Mobile has a 600MHz “nationwide” 5G network in the U.S., for example, while AT&T has a similar 700MHz network. Low radiofrequency bands like these are the best at penetrating obstacles like buildings, trees, and reaching as far as geographically possible from a given carrier-installed node. This makes these bands the optimal choice for providing great indoor coverage. Conversely, however, their low frequencies means they have the lowest capacity to carry data, which, in turn, means speeds won’t be that great.
Common questions on Google Search are already asking: “Why is 5G so slow?” To some extent, that’s a U.S.-specific issue. The U.S. has gone all-in with low band and mmWave, missing the crucial mid band part of the equation. Both T-Mobile and AT&T’s nationwide 5G networks are available to hundreds of millions of people, but their data speeds aren’t impressive at all. At most, they can reach 225Mbps, but in the real world, it’s far more likely for them to reach 50-100Mbps, with speeds going as low as 20-30Mbps, which is indistinguishable from average 4G.
5G networks in other parts of the world, such as South Korea, Japan, and the UK, don’t suffer from this issue as they have emphasized the need for mid band. Low band networks will continue to be a part of the layer cake, but for now, the U.S. is placing too much emphasis on them. The problem is compounded by the fact that carriers lack the critical spectrum necessary to enable these low band networks to achieve their full potential in terms of data speeds.
Mid band is the optimal choice for building a 5G network. Mid band frequencies such as the popular 3.5GHz band as well as the 2.5GHz band aren’t the best at penetrating obstacles unlike low band frequencies nor can they carry as much data as mmWave frequencies. They aren’t the best for either indoor coverage or for the highest data speeds, but they are the best all-rounder. Mid-band coverage is acceptable as long as carriers are willing to install the appropriate number of nodes at any given location. Also, data speeds aren’t an issue as long as there is enough available spectrum for carriers to use. After all, 4G bands such as TDD-LTE band 40 (2300MHz) are also mid band, and carriers like Jio and China Mobile have used them with success in India and China respectively.
The spectrum issue is where the U.S. carriers ran into a roadblock. Up until now, none of the three major carriers in the U.S. have rolled out a mid band network for hundreds of millions of people. After merging with Sprint, T-Mobile has started building a mid band network, but it’s available only in a few cities so far. Verizon and AT&T have yet to roll out mid band 5G networks because they don’t even have the available spectrum. The U.S. FCC freed up valuable spectrum in the C Band earlier this year, much later than other countries. Both Verizon and AT&T have stated they plan to roll out their mid band networks in 2021. Consumers can only wait.
Consumers of mid band 5G networks in countries like South Korea have reported great speeds, and that’s the model the rest of the world should follow.
The controversial nature of mmWave
mmWave 5G is an entirely different matter. It turns out all the objections that many informed people in the telecommunications industry had to mmWave were correct. Yes, it does bring incredibly high speeds—speeds can regularly break the 1Gbps barrier for downlink. Yes, it does have low latency. However, none of that matters to any appreciable extent when you consider the limitations of the technology.
mmWave requires a line-of-sight to the carrier-installed node. The mmWave bands use incredibly high radiofrequencies, starting at 24GHz. These frequencies are blocked by obstacles like buildings, trees, and even a user’s hand. Even rain will degrade the signal. The geographical reach of these frequencies is only about 500 meters. It means that unless carriers install nodes in every lane, street, and neighbourhood, an mmWave signal will never be available to most consumers. You can use beanforming and place multiple antenna modules in a phone, but you can’t overcome physics at the end of the day.
Yes, these limitations are because of physics. There is a reason why so much spectrum was unused in these high frequencies. Using them for a mobile network that actually depends on radio waves reaching as far as they can is a bad idea. It’s a bad idea in principle, and carriers are only now starting to realize that. In the U.S., for example, T-Mobile has stopped promoting its mmWave 5G network that is available in select locations in select cities in the country. AT&T’s mmWave network isn’t even available to general consumers as it’s restricted for businesses. It’s only Verizon that has kept bragging about its mmWave “5G Ultra Wide Band” network, but once the novelty factor of 1Gbps speeds wears off, there is precious little utility to these newfangled networks.
The argument can be made that mmWave 5G works best when intended for crowded settings like landmarks, stadiums, meeting halls, etc. I would still disagree, as mid band 5G is just a far better compromise. Which sounds better: 1Gbps 5G with a signal that disappears as soon as you walk away from the public landmark, or 600Mbps 5G with a signal that actually keeps up when you head indoors? I know which one I would choose. Besides, it’s a far easier choice for carriers as well: spend less money on installing mmWave nodes, and have a network that can be used by more people over a wider geographical area.
Thankfully, as I mentioned, the vast majority of carriers have stayed far away from mmWave. 5G roll-outs in places like Saudi Arabia, Europe, and China are all based on mid band, and in some cases, complemented with low band.
The 5G ecosystem
The technology itself is nothing without its ecosystem. The 5G ecosystem consists of carriers that roll out 5G networks, network chip manufacturers, chip vendors that sell modem chips to enable smartphones to connect to these networks, and device makers that sell phones to end consumers. Other stakeholders in the industry include governments and their anti-trust bodies, contractors, and more.
Carriers
In June 2020, 35 countries had rolled out some form of a 5G network up until now. There are 195 countries in the world, so there is still quite a way to go before 5G networks are available in even half of the world’s countries. At this point, Qualcomm will point out that 5G adoption has been faster than 4G LTE so far. Quite a few more networks are stated to go live in 2021.
In some countries like China, South Korea, and the U.S., 5G networks are available for millions of people. In contrast, there isn’t a single live 5G network in India, for example. Generally, the roll out of 5G has started earlier in developed countries, while emerging markets are taking their time. An optimistic argument can be made that within five years, most of the world will have it. Right now, though, for many places, it’s still a far off dream.
Examples of carriers that have rolled out 5G on a meaningfully substantial basis include China Mobile, SK Telecom, T-Mobile, AT&T, EE, and more.
Chip vendors
Now, there are two kinds of chip vendors. Vendors like Huawei, Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung, and ZTE sell 5G network chips to carriers to build base stations and carrier nodes. Thanks to political and security allegations, Huawei has been blocked from selling or having any part in the 5G networks of most Western countries, especially the U.S. This leaves Ericsson and Nokia to carry the mantle. On the other hand, it is generally accepted that Huawei has a technological advantage in network chips, and China’s 5G networks have been built by Huawei. With the trade ban on HiSilicon, though, it’s unclear how things will proceed in the future.
The other type of chip vendors are those that sell modem chips to smartphone device makers. Qualcomm is the prime example here, but Samsung Systems LSI and MediaTek also play a part. Huawei’s HiSilicon Group’s modem chips were used by Huawei itself, but with the coming dissolution of HiSilicon, this seems to be coming to an end.
Qualcomm’s first-generation X50 5G modem-RF system was announced back in October 2016, and it powered the first wave of 5G phones in early 2019. The 7nm second-generation X55 modem-RF system powered a few late 2019 Snapdragon 855-powered phones, but it came into widespread use in 2020. It’s paired with the flagship Snapdragon 865 SoC, which doesn’t have an integrated modem of its own. The 5nm third-generation X60 modem was announced by Qualcomm in February 2020, and it will likely show up in phones launching early next year. It brings innovations such as carrier aggregation of different 5G modes, higher downlink speeds, and more.
Qualcomm also brought 5G to the upper mid-range price tier with the launch of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 in December 2019, which had its own integrated Snapdragon X52 5G modem. It had lower specifications, but supported both sub-6GHz as well as mmWave. In June 2020, the company then brought 5G to the lower mid-range price tier with the announcement of the Snapdragon 690, which supports sub-6GHz 5G (and not mmWave).
Samsung Systems LSI’s first 5G modem was the Exynos 5100, which powered the first 5G Exynos phones last year. It was succeeded by the Exynos 5G Modem 5123, which is used in the 5G Exynos 990-powered variants of the Galaxy S20 and Galaxy Note 20 series. The mid-range Exynos 980 SoC is also 5G capable. Apart from Qualcomm, Samsung is the only chip vendor that produces and sells mmWave 5G modems. The 5G Exynos variants of the Galaxy S20 and the Galaxy Note 20 have mmWave support.
MediaTek, on the other hand, entered the 5G era with the launch of its new 5G Dimensity series of SoCs. The first SoC to be announced in this series was the Dimensity 1000 in November 2019. It has followed that launch by launching the mid-range Dimensity 800, the upgraded Dimensity 1000+ and Dimensity 820, as well as the lower mid-tier Dimensity 720 in 2020. MediaTek’s 5G modems choose to forgo mmWave support, opting to stick with sub-6GHz.
HiSilicon’s first 5G SoC was the Kirin 990 5G, which powered the 5G variants of the Huawei Mate 30 series, the Huawei P40 series, as well as Honor’s affordable flagship Honor View 30 and Honor 30 series. The company is gearing up to launch the Huawei Mate 40 soon, which will be powered by what will seemingly be the last HiSilicon flagship SoC for the foreseeable future.
Device makers
As of late 2020, an increasing number of device makers are selling 5G phones. The elephant in the room—Apple—has just announced its first ever 5G-powered iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro series. Samsung, Huawei, Honor, OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi, OnePlus, Realme, LG, Sony, Motorola, ASUS, Lenovo, ZTE, Nubia, iQOO, and more have all released 5G phones.
In 2019, 5G phones were restricted to the flagship tier as only the Snapdragon 855 had the necessary modem support. In 2020, thanks to the Snapdragon 765, 5G can now be find in upper mid-range phones as well. At the end of this year, we should start seeing the first lower mid-range phones powered by the 5G Snapdragon 690 as well. It will take quite a bit longer for the technology to proliferate in budget phones, as expected.
The current state of the 5G ecosystem and future outlook
Last year, the 5G ecosystem was immature and unfinished. It was relegated to phones costing above $1,000. In 2020, the ecosystem has matured a lot in terms of device availability, the quality of 5G networks, the quality of 5G modems, and the scale of the networks themselves. Some of the first-generation 5G phones were so immature that bizarre situations developed. The Sprint variants of the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G, the Galaxy S10, and the LG V50 ThinQ can no longer connect to any 5G network because of T-Mobile’s merger with Sprint. The first-generation mmWave 5G phones that launched on T-Mobile can’t connect to the carrier’s nationwide low-band network. Carriers use different network bands, so device makers have to incorporate the most number of bands they can to have unlocked phones compatible with all networks.
The immaturity of 5G has meant that some device makers are launching separate 5G and 4G variants of their phones. The 4G variants of these phones are almost certain to be outdated from a network connectivity perspective as soon as a 5G network launches in the particular region where they are being sold. 5G phones have different variants for different regions. The OnePlus 8 Pro’s Indian variant, for example, supports only a single 5G band, which may not even be used in a commercial Indian 5G network.
All of this is region-dependent. If you’re living in the Indian subcontinent, none of this matters to you right now because no carrier has rolled out a 5G network yet. Countries like India have yet to even hold 5G trials, although Jio is optimistically proclaiming it will roll out a 5G network in 2021. Vast regions of the world such as South Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, East Asia, and South America have yet to experience 5G.
In particular, the mass population of any region won’t experience 5G until it’s available in lower mid-range and budget phones, because budget and lower mid-range phones are the ones that sell in the highest volumes. That’s yet to happen. The course of that story will start in 2021, and will continue in the years ahead. We will keep our eyes on the interesting developments in this space.
Conclusion
5G is a complex subject. In this article, we have only scratched the surface of the different sub-topics of 5G. Other sub-topics not covered here include the potential of 5G as a home broadband replacement, the power efficiency of 5G modems, the impact of 5G on flagship smartphone pricing, the cost structure of 5G services, and much more. Future articles will attempt to detail each of the aforementioned topics, and will go deeper into the topics that we have briefly explained.
A lot has been written about 5G, and a lot more will continue to be written about it until it is inevitably succeeded by the next wireless generation. There will be a lot of debates about the need and efficacy of 5G. There will be a lot of marketing jargon. There will be a lot of upselling. The industry has converged around 5G because there is a lot of money to be made here. Like it or not, it seems 5G is here to stay.Back during Google I/O 2016, Google announced that they would be rolling out an update to the Android Auto app to bring a driver-friendly user interface without needing an Android Auto compatible vehicle.

Android Pay might not be as feature-rich as some of its competitors, but Google’s paid the contactless payment app a lot of love lately. In October, Google rolled out transaction notifications that show basic information about recent purchases, and in May, the Moutain View, California-based company launched Android Pay in Canada.
Google launched Android Pay in September 2015 in the United States. Since then, the application’s rolled out to ten other regions around the world including New Zealand, U.K., Australia, Japan, Poland, and Hong Kong, Russia, Spain, Brazil, and Taiwan. But it’s not particularly popular; according to Payments.com, Android Pay usage peaked at 1.8 percent of all mobile wallet users in 2017. With any luck, the new territories and banks will help turn that number around.

Earlier this month, we opened forums for three new devices, including the Realme 7, Realme 7 Pro, and the ZTE Axon 20 5G. Since then, OEMs have launched quite a few interesting devices, like the OPPO Reno4, Moto G9 Plus, and Moto E7 Plus. On top of that, OnePlus has also announced that it will be unveiling its next flagship — the OnePlus 8T — next month. To promote third-party development and discussions for these devices, we’re now opening forums for the OnePlus 8T, OPPO Reno4 4G, Moto G9 Plus, and Moto E7 Plus.
OnePlus 8T
While OnePlus is yet to announce the OnePlus 8T, we’ve already learned a few key details about the upcoming device. Leaked specifications of the device suggest that it will pack in Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 865 Plus SoC, coupled with a 6.55-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The device is expected to feature a quad camera setup on the back, with a 48Mp primary camera, a 16MP wide-angle camera, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. We’ve also seen renders of the device, which reveal a new rectangular camera module on the back, a flat display with a hole-punch cutout in the top left corner, and a USB Type-C port at the bottom. OnePlus is expected to announce the device on October 14th and you can catch the launch event live on OnePlus’ YouTube channel by following this link.

There are times in life when making the wrong decisions can have major repercussions in all the spheres that surround you. These repercussions can be so severe that they can literally turn your life upside down and nothing you say or do can change the self-consuming spiral that they set you on. Smartphone company IUNI learned this the hard way, and as a result they’ve finally decided to comply with the GPL.
This was the case for a relatively small Asian manufacturer called IUNI, which was a small subsidiary company of the much-larger Gionee. As was the case with many Eastern OEMs, IUNI was the proud manufacturer of entry to mid range devices, with phones closely resembling those from Xiaomi, which coincidentally also resembles other manufacturers as well (plagiarism is the ultimate form of flattery after all). The company, unfortunately had a rough start, which ultimately led to its impending doom and eventual demise about a year ago.
One could attribute the death of the brand to the fact that every business has ups and downs, particularly during the first years when most start up companies do whatever they can to break even. IUNI was rather promising with a few devices at very decent and competitive prices and they were, in fact, beginning to make an impact. However, due to the saturation of the Asian market with similar business models, the company couldn’t hold on for too long before giving up. Stake holders began losing their patience, and the rest is history.
If you have read up until this point in the article, you are likely wondering why the closure of a relatively unknown cell phone manufacturer is relevant to GPL. As you are probably aware, GPL is the very foundation on which the entire Linux kernel is based on, which happens to power our devices. This wonderful piece of software is the result of years of world wide collaboration of coders.
Every person who has improved the kernel in any way, shape, or form has shared the fruits of their labor with other coders, who in turn, improved it a little further, and so on and so forth. The continued growth of this chain is what has gotten us to the point where we stand today. We at xda-developers have upheld the GPL and the spirit of open source since Android first came to be almost a decade ago.
Having said all that, there are some people who, due to completely different (and some would say twisted) view of the world, believe that things like the Linux kernel (and really most open source code) is there for the taking. We all know who to blame and because it would take a rather long time to mention all of them in this piece, we will not be focusing on individual companies. However, as I stated at the beginning, actions have consequences. IUNI thought it would be simple to just grab the open source code that makes Android what it is today, add their own modifications, close it off, and try to profit from it. After all, lots of bigger players were doing that at the time. Lo and behold, two years into it and the company went under — perhaps not from wholly-related reasons, but went under all the same. Closing themselves in like that in this case prevented, though, the company from having the necessary reach into the open source community, which ultimately is what made the very thing they were working on.
While this may seem like it is my personal opinion on the matter, it isn’t (although, I completely agree with it). The reason for this article altogether is because a few days ago, a representative from the (now defunct) company reached out to us, and this is what he had to say:
We want to convey to the community that we had unfairly kept the open source code instead of sharing it.
If we had shared it from the start we would surely not be there right now.
The IUNI U3 would surely have been the biggest One Plus rival at this time if the sources had been released.
We might not be dead at the present time…
However, before completely disappearing, we must repair injustices.
We release the source code of devices that we still have in possessions:
https://gitlab.com/iuni
And we call on the former developer to share the sources of the society in their possessions to the community.
Download it, distribute it, study it, modify it and let the company keep on living through sharing!
Finally, we have a game, a challenge to launch to the community!
If using these sources you (the community) manage to bring the IUNI U3 to the latest version of android stock we will share a last surprise that will be grand before we completely disappear.
For it is in uniqueness that we forge our own personality.
That each of us is unique.
With love,
IUNI
There are several points to take away from such a message. The first, and likely the most obvious one, is that despite the fact that the company went under, people working on IUNI were conscious enough to understand that what they were doing was fundamentally wrong (more than likely due to directives from the top of the food chain). Most open source coders understand this concept, no matter where they are from. Choosing to follow the correct path is what separates the ones who continue on from the ones who do not.
Whether or not this particular offering (speaking strictly about the U3) would have been a direct contender to OnePlus is something that we cannot really answer (not without having done a side by side comparison anyways). However, on paper, it could have given OP a run for their money (big emphasis with the “on paper”). The openness of manufacturers like OnePlus with the open source community is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the main reasons behind the company being where it currently sits and not buried along the rest of the lesser Asian OEMs. It helped them tremendously with word-of-mouth, and it continuously enables the company to “secure” a subset of customers interested in modifying their devices. If IUNI wanted to be like OnePlus, but missed that crucial community-building element, then not abiding by the GPL might’ve negatively impacted their strategy.
Last but not least… the challenge. At this point in time, IUNI has absolutely nothing to lose (nor to gain), so they figured they’d release all the source code they had to feed back into the open source community.
So, moral of the story: the GPL (and open source in general) is there for a reason. It can be your best friend and together you may grow old together. However, if you cross it (and all the millions of coders behind it), you will likely fail the endeavors you try to embark on — especially if you think you can attract customers interested in mod-friendly devices.

Whatever your style, there's a Galaxy Note 20 case for you!
The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is here, and with a starting price of $1299, it’s definitely an investment. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the heaviest Samsung smartphones to-date, and trust me from personal experience, the added weight and large proportions of my similarly-sized Galaxy S20 Ultra resulted in more than one drop. Thankfully, I had a case on it and it survived, and some of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra cases featured below could also save your shiny new phone. We’ll be updating this post with new options as they pop up so check back frequently!
Samsung's official leather cover remains the best choice, and there's this year, your color choices include black, brown and green. Based on previous Samsung leather covers, this one should also survive many months of use.
If you want something truly custom that also protects your phone, the dbrand Grip Case fits the bill. It's extremely protective, but you can customize the design using one of the many skin types available.
When it comes to cases, you've probably heard of Spigen. The company has a lot of popular products, but the Liquid Air brings added grip and a beautiful symmetry and uniformity that really appeals to us.
If you're looking for a case that really protects your phone, the Incipio DualPro is designed with protection in mind, including a drop test rating of 10 feet, shock-absorbing inner core and raised bezels to protect your screen.
The Ringke Fusion X is one of the company's most popular case line-ups, combining a clear back so you can show off your stunning new smartphone with protective features like a raised lip and rugged exterior.
Instead of a thick case, show off your phone's natural beauty while keeping it protected with this beautiful Caseology Skyfall case, which is available in 3 colors. I've used one before and it's a fantastic case!
Want a case with some grip that matches the color of your phone perfectly? Look no further than Samsung's official silicone cover, which comes in Black, White and 'Brown', which is actually Pink in color.
Being able to prop up your phone while you're out and about is one of the big selling points for this case. Others include raised screen and camera bezels to protect against scratches, and additional grip.
If all you want is a super-slim case, look no further. This won't provide you a lot of protection against drops, but your phone will still remain sleek. It's also available in gorgeous Red and Blue colors.
The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is a large phone with a considerable amount of weight to it, so you’ll want to factor this in when deciding which case to buy. The larger size also means you’ll want to look at how much grip a case provides. If you’re set on a slimline case, the Ringke Air-S case provides protection without being too bulky. Our favorite pick is the Samsung Kvadrat Cover which looks stylish while protecting your phone.
If you need something a little more rugged, the Incipio DualPro comes with some serious claims, including being able to withstand a 10-foot drop and helping to protect against scratches with raised bezels. Considering the $1300 starting price tag of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, this might be the most protective case for your investment.

It was a big day when Google Fi, previously called Project Fi, opened up support for more devices, including those from Apple, OnePlus, and Samsung. A few years later, and the service is expanding even more by introducing support for Samsung’s latest 5G phones, including the Galaxy Note 20.
The full lineup of newly certified “Designed for Fi” Samsung devices is as follows:
Fi’s 5G network is already nationwide, so most people should get coverage in their area. If you’re concerned about specific 5G coverage in your particular area, you can check out this coverage map, which will let you search across the U.S. It’s worth noting, however, that 5G is only on the T-Mobile network, and factors such as speed and performance depend on things like carrier network capabilities, device configuration, and more. You’ll need a 5G capable smartphone that can connect to T-Mobile’s sub-6GHz network, for instance.
Bringing your own device to Google Fi usually means you can’t get features like network switching, smooth transitions between Wifi and cellular, or spam blocking, but picking up a Designed for Fi phone ensures you’ll get all of these features. Starting today, you can pick up these Samsung 5G phones straight from Fi. You’ll get $300 in Fi credit if you purchase the new Note 20 or Note 20 Ultra, save $300 if you buy a new Galaxy S20, or save $150 if you buy the Galaxy A71 5G.
In addition to bringing support for Samsung’s latest 5G phones, Google Fi has certified Google’s latest Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G as Designed for Fi phones, both of which were recently unveiled at Google’s Launch Night In event. The Pixel 5 is set to launch overseas on October 15 and then in the U.S. and Canada on October 29.NFC, short for Near Field Communication, is a short range wireless communication protocol that is nowadays mostly used at contactless payment terminals. The NFC Forum is also working on a wireless charging solution that will let you charge your devices via NFC chips instead of dedicated wireless coils. However, smartphone manufacturers often drop NFC support...Samsung is shipping two different cooling systems in the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but there’s no reason to worry
There's no proof yet that one is better than the other
When reviews of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra hit the web earlier this month, some outlets reported that the device ran a little hot when performing certain intensive tasks. Multiple teardowns of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra then revealed that Samsung was shipping two different cooling systems: One consisting of a copper vapor chamber and another consisting of graphite thermal pads. Some users were understandably concerned about whether or not they were getting the short end of the stick; after all, you shouldn’t have to worry about ending up on the losing side of a hardware lottery when you’re spending $1,300 on a phone. There’s no reason to worry right now, though, because there’s no evidence yet that one cooling system is better than the other.
To recap, iFixit confirmed the presence of a multi-layered graphite thermal pad during their teardown of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, as opposed to the copper vapor chamber cooling system that Samsung has typically used (and marketed) in its older devices. As iFixit pointed out, some Galaxy Note 20 Ultra models still do feature a copper vapor chamber system, and there’s no indication that the different cooling systems are tied to the region in which the device is sold. For example, Zack from JerryRigEverything had an international (Exynos) unit with a graphite thermal pad, much like iFixit’s U.S. (Snapdragon) unit.
iFixit argues that you shouldn’t worry about whether or not your Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has a copper vapor chamber or graphene cooling pads, though. For starters, just because your phone feels hot doesn’t mean it’s actually overheating. If your phone feels warm, then that means heat is being effectively dissipated from the CPU and GPU. The cooling system is meant to protect the internal components from heating to dangerous levels, which in turn means the components will last longer and also be able to maintain peak performance for longer.
It should be noted that right now, none of the complaints about the phone overheating have been followed up by a teardown to confirm which cooling system is in use. There’s no other known way to confirm which cooling system is used; the information is not displayed on packaging, on the outside of the phone, in the software, etc. Thus, you can’t attribute any perceived overheating problems to either the copper vapor chamber or graphene cooling pad systems.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Forums ||| Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Forums
iFixit concludes that Samsung trusts both cooling systems enough to use them interchangeably. The vapor cooling system was something that Samsung touted heavily a few years ago, but perhaps Samsung saw that graphene cooling pads are just as effective at dissipating heat, so they’re comfortable using both systems. While Samsung hasn’t offered its own statement yet, iFixit’s Greg Kramer, a thermal systems engineer, states that “there is little difference in performance between [vapor chambers] and the graphite. As long as you take the gap tolerances into consideration, it can be simple enough to swap them out for each other.”
Dual sourcing is actually common practice in the industry, especially when dealing with large volumes of products. Companies need to make sure that they have a secure supply of components to meet the demand for their devices, so they sometimes source components from multiple vendors to meet volume. This is usually not a problem because companies want to make sure that both components offer the same performance. If you think about it, there’s no reason for a company to want to intentionally screw over a portion of their buyers—a substantial gap in performance would trigger outrage when discovered by consumers, as we’ve already seen from users reacting to Samsung’s shipping its (arguably inferior) Exynos chipsets in certain regions.
Even though Samsung’s marketing of the Galaxy S10+’s vapor chamber cooling proved effective, iFixit notes that the solution has some drawbacks, such as being delicate during installation and being vulnerable to swelling if it’s heated up slightly past its limit. Notably, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra isn’t even the first Samsung phone to feature the alternative graphite-based cooling system as iFixit notes that the system can actually be found in the first-gen Galaxy Z Flip. So if you’re worried about what cooling system will end up on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra that Samsung ships to you, then don’t be. If evidence emerges that one solution is in fact superior to the other, we’ll of course update this article with that information.Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra “Clear Cover” TPU Case Review
To case or not to case? That is the question.
We have the shiny new Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra in our hands, a phone that costs a cool $1,300. That much money gets you a very good smartphone, but many users would still like to put a case on it for the added peace of mind on such an expensive purchase. There’s no dearth of options when it comes to cases for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and in this article, we’ll be taking a quick look at Samsung’s Clear Cover “case” to see how good of a case it actually is. Should you get it? Probably not. Should you still read this review? Please do.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Forums
Look & Feel
The official Clear Cover case for the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is soft and clear. That’s it. This isn’t exactly a fancy case, nor is it meant to be. Samsung’s soft TPU case is meant to offer basic protection while letting you still enjoy how your phone looks. That doesn’t mean it looks bad, though. Since it’s transparent, it doesn’t really look like anything from most angles.
If you’re someone who doesn’t like cases because they hide your phone, this (or any transparent) case might be for you.
Now for how it feels. Again, this is a pretty basic case, and the material is a soft plastic. So you’re not going to get the “premium” glass feel you would without it. But it being soft plastic also means it’s grippy. You won’t have to worry about your phone sliding out of your hand or off a smooth surface when it’s in this case.
It’s also comfortable to hold. Since it doesn’t add much to the phone’s dimensions, it feels almost like you’re just holding the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra without a case.
Fit
This is an official case by Samsung for Samsung devices, so it obviously fits perfectly. The dimensions are perfect, and all ports and sensor remain accessible and functional.
It’s easy to put on and take off, too. I’ve had annoying experiences with TPU cases in the past where once installed, they fit fine, but actually getting them onto the phone is a nightmare. And I can say the same for taking them off. Samsung’s managed to provide both a good fit and a good installation/removal experience. Putting this Clear Cover case on is plenty easy, and once it’s on, it fits snugly without any annoying air gaps.
Durability
One of the more important reasons for using a case is protection. Everyone drops their phone at some point, and a case is meant to at least somewhat reduce the chance of something breaking. Will Samsung’s TPU case do that? Well, I don’t particularly want to go outside and drop my $1300 phone onto cement to find out, so I’m going to have to be a little more theoretical here.
This isn’t a cover/folio/wallet case, so it doesn’t really provide much in the way of screen protection. The sides of the case do come up over the screen a little bit on the edges, but since the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s screen is curved, most of the screen is still completely exposed.
That doesn’t mean there’s no protection here, though. If you drop your phone and it hits a corner, you’ll probably be fine. The soft plastic should provide enough cushioning to give the phone a fighting chance to simply bounce instead of crack. There’s also a ridge around the camera module cutout, which should shield the camera glass from direct hits on a flat surface.
Overall, this isn’t the most protective case out there, but it’s probably better than nothing.
Features
I’ll be short: this is a piece of plastic. There are no special features, at least not intentional ones.
There is one thing I’ve noticed from using this case, though: it almost completely eliminates accidental touches on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. With no case, at least for me, it’s almost impossible to do anything without my hand hitting the edge of the screen and tapping something I didn’t want to tap.
With this TPU case installed, that almost never happens. As an added bonus, it’s even easier to reach the other edge of the screen (say, for dragging out a navigation drawer) using the case.
Conclusion
If you have the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and you’re in the market for a super simple case with super simple protection, this is the one for you.
Of course, if you’re not in the US, this case probably came in the box with your phone. And if you’re looking for something more protective, then you’re gonna want to find something else.
These are the best cases for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
But if you like the way your phone looks, and you’re not too concerned about breaking it, and you’re in the US, then you can get the Clear Cover for a cool $20.Huawei P40, P40 Pro, and P40 Pro+ announced with the 5G Kirin 990, 50MP RYYB camera sensor, and Huawei Mobile Services
Back in December, Huawei made plans to announce the P40 series in March. Suffice to say a lot has changed in the world since then, but Huawei is still moving forward with their announcement. The company has now officially revealed the Huawei P40, Huawei P40 Pro, and Huawei P40+ during an online launch event.
The Huawei P40 series was actually kicked off back in February with the P40 Lite, but today we’re finally seeing the flagship offerings. These are Huawei’s latest high-end smartphones for 2020 and they pack tons of features into attractive packages. The display sizes range from 6.1-inches to 6.58-inches, but in general, the family shares many of the same specifications.

Huawei P40 series: Design
As you would expect, the design of all three devices is fairly similar. They all have rectangular camera modules positioned in the top left corner on the back. All three also feature hole-punch displays with the hole placed in the top left. Speaking of the display, the Pro and Pro+ have 90Hz displays, and Huawei has included what they are calling an “Overflow display” on these.
The Overflow display is a full edge-to-edge display. The edges of the display are curved on all four sides, creating a very smooth transition anywhere you touch. The usable area of the display curves ever so slightly over the edges, but it is far from the “waterfall” display of the Mate 30 Pro. This creates a stunning bezel-less feel without sacrificing usability. The Huawei P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ have 6.58-inch displays, while the P40 has a smaller 6.1-inch flat display.
The display is home to Goodix’s “ultra-thin” optical in-display fingerprint sensor as well. This sensor is 30% bigger and 30% faster than the sensor on the previous generation. Huawei also has some fancy new animations to go along with it. Goodix has also provided the AMOLED touch controller and smart audio amplifier for the P40 series.
Sticking with design, there are a number of color options available. All three models will be available in Ice White, Deep Sea Blue, and Black with glossy finishes. There is also Silver Frost and Blush Gold colors available in a matte finish. The P40 Pro+ has a ceramic back and is available in black and white.
Cameras
If the giant camera modules didn’t give it away, the Huawei P40 series has a lot going on in the camera department. The headliner on all three devices is a 50MP RYYB 1/1.28” “Ultra Vision Sensor.” This camera boasts the highest light intake, higher dynamic range, and lower noise compared to the 40MP sensor on last year’s P30 series.
To go along with the bigger sensor, the Huawei P40 series also has a new HD Image Engine. This is the company’s 3rd generation AI image engine and it has a number of improvements. It goes pixel-by-pixel looking at lossless image separation, optimizing every scene possible, and it does this at any focal length. You can take large photos and chop them up into smaller photos without losing quality.
Another cool trick is “Super Resolution.” The phone takes information from the main camera and telephoto lens and merges them together to create a boosted resolution image. The features work with the XD Fusion Engine so you can zoom in and crop to create crisp images at any time of day.
Speaking of zoom, the P40 series has plenty of abilities when it comes to zoom. The standard P40 can do 3X optical zoom, which is good for portraits. The P40 Pro can do 5X optical zoom with the SuperSensing SuperZoom Lens. The P40 Pro+ has short-range, mid-range, and long-range versatility. It can do 3X optical zoom and 10X optical zoom, plus it claims to smoothly transition between them.
All three devices have a 32MP camera on the front, but the Pro and Pro+ also have an IR depth sensor. In addition to the 50MP main camera, the P40 Pro has a 40MP wide-angle camera, 5MP telephoto lens, and a TOF lens. The P40 Pro+ has, in addition to the main 50MP and 40MP wide-angle cameras, dual 8MP telephoto lens, and a TOF lens.
While the hardware is impressive, it combines with the software to yield much more versatility and function. On the Huawei P40 series, you can take studio-like shots regardless of complexities in the lighting thanks to Multi-Spectrum Color Temperature Sensor with AI AWB Algorithm. The Golden Snap Moment feature takes multiple shots before and the shutter button is pressed and presents you with the three best shots to save; while such a feature has been around on other phones for a while, the presence of this feature on the P40 series is impressive because of the newer camera hardware. The software also enables neat editing tricks such as eliminating photobombing passerby from the image and eliminate reflections when shooting across glass. There’s a Handheld Super Night Mode onboard too.
For video recording, the devices are capable of a fair few things. You can shoot in HDR, 4K 60fps, 4K timelapse, 7680fps super slow motion, super-steady telephoto video recording with OIS plus AIS. The phones are also capable of audio zoom thanks to the 3 stereo microphones. Of course, there is Pro Mode on the camera too for video recording.
Performance
Let’s talk about performance. The P40 series is equipped with the Kirin 990 5G SoC, which includes the 16-core Mali-G76 GPU. The P40 Pro+ has a 4 layer SuperCool system, 3D graphene film, and a super-thin Vapor Chamber cooling system. The P40 has a 3,800mAh battery, while the P40 Pro and Pro+ have 4,200mAh batteries. All three have 40W wired charging, while the Pro+ also has 40W wireless charging with the Huawei charging pad. The P40 Pro supports 27W wireless charging.
Software
The Huawei P40 series comes with the company’s EMUI skin, which in this case is EMUI 10.1 based on Android 10. Huawei is including a new preloaded app called “MeeTime.” This is a video/audio calling app similar to FaceTime and Google Duo. It claims to have the best resolution in poor network bandwidth situations. Some of the other features include background changing, screen sharing, and tablet support.
Google apps are obviously a big topic with Huawei devices and the P40 does not include them. Huawei has 3,000 engineers working on HMS Core (Huawei Mobile Services) development. They partnered with Qwant for Search in Europe. Huawei also has its alternative to Instant Apps called “Huawei Quick App.”
Huawei also has its own Voice Assistant on EMUI 10.1 on the P40 series, called Celia. You can summon the voice assistant with the command “Hey Celia”, or by holding the power button for a second. Celia can help you with regular daily tasks, such as initiating phone calls and texts, setting up calendar appointments and reminders, start voice recording, translate sentences, play music, videos, toggle device settings and flashlight, and of course, search for information such as sports, weather, and more. Celia is compatible with HiVision AI Lens and AI touch-shopping. Celia will be available in UK, France, Spain, Chile, Mexico, and Colombia in languages such as English (UK), French, and Spanish.

Samsung launched Bixby Voice almost a year ago. Since expanding to over 200 countries, the service hasn’t received many feature updates to compete with Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. Samsung’s rumored Bixby Speaker and upcoming 2.0 update launching with the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 may turn things around but for now, Bixby Voice remains the worst voice assistant in the race. Now, Samsung has announced that they are terminating the “My Bixby Level” service on August 10th, 2018 which was only used for unlocking new backgrounds or earning Samsung Pay rewards points.
This service was used to unlock different backgrounds for the voice assistant user interface. Samsung has not said if these backgrounds would be available after the termination of the My Bixby Level service, but they said users who have already unlocked them can still use them. If you want to be able to unlock these, you need to level up by asking questions or telling it to do tasks. You have until August 10th to unlock these backgrounds.
Along with these backgrounds, the My Bixby Level service also allows for users to unlock Samsung Pay rewards points with each level. The number of points you could earn at each level would change depending on how high the level is. The rewards points could be spent on sweepstakes or on Samsung Pay Visa gift cards. This feature was added when Bixby was first released to encourage users to use the service but was kept in because users stopped using the service once the feature was removed. The rewards points you earned during the period in which you could unlock them will be kept in your Samsung Pay rewards points balance. To unlock more Samsung Pay rewards points, you can make purchases with Samsung Pay.
I had personally leveled up to level 11 before giving up on Bixby. The leveling service did encourage my use of Bixby but I personally don’t think it’s a compelling reason to keep using it. Sure, the rewards points are nice but paying users to use a feature just doesn’t seem like a reliable way to continue business. Thus, it’s no surprise to see the service being canned. You have until August 10th, 2018 to unlock everything before the service is terminated.The Google Pixel 3 and Google Pixel 3 XL were announced earlier this week.

Amazon’s Fire tablets are some of the most popular Android tablets in the world. While the OS looks nothing like what you’d find on an Android phone, it is indeed Android. The latest generation of the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet was announced today with minor updates. The tablet is shipping with Fire OS 6, which is based on Android Nougat, and was originally launched on the Fire TV.
The main specs are identical to last year’s model: 8-inch 1280×800 display, quad-core 1.3GHz processor, 1.5GB of RAM, and expandable storage. The big hardware update is the 2MP front-facing camera. On the software front, this is Fire OS 6 Android Nougat. Permissions need to be checked at runtime now. Adoptable storage is now present and Doze will help improve battery life. Amazon reminds developers to not use Google services on Amazon Fire Tablets. They must use Amazon’s Apps & Games Services SDKs. Alexa can also be used hands-free now, which does take a hit on battery life.
Specs and software features are not the reason why people buy Fire tablets. They’re cheap and you can access a wide variety of books, movies, TV shows, and more from Amazon. The Fire HD 8 only costs $79.99 There is also a Kids Edition with a big easy to grip bumper case. The specs are nothing special here, but if you’re looking for a cheap Android tablet to tinker with, the Fire HD 8 looks decent.

OnePlus 8T Forums
Design – A treat of a phone
In terms of hardware design, the OnePlus 8T presents one of the more radical departures from traditional OnePlus aesthetics that we’ve seen in a while. These changes on the outside look of the phone coincide with both a software redesign of OxygenOS as well as the company embracing a revamped identity through a new, more modern logo. What’s different here, why is it significant? And, more importantly, are the changes for the better?
The OnePlus 8T comes in Aquamarine Green and Lunar Silver. Our review unit sports the supposedly “green” coat, though you’d be forgiven for calling it a sort of cyan-blue. It really depends on the lighting, though, as very strong direct sunlight can reveal a greener hue as shown in the pictures below. Indeed, the back of our OnePlus 8T review variant features a strikingly colorful glass back. Unlike flashier OnePlus back designs featured in previous iterations, the OnePlus 8T comes off as more reserved, with a matte-frosted finish that’s almost totally smudge-resistant. This is a wild detour from the Interstellar Glow OnePlus 8, which took flashy glass backs to a new level. Even then, though, the OnePlus 8T is by no means discreet: It’s a sweet-looking phone, as in, sometimes its back reminds me of colorful glossy candy. It gleams and scatters light very cleanly, with rather subdued color changes at extreme angles and a near total tonal and textural shift when struck by strong and direct light. It’s a very exquisite color, but while I’m quite fond of it, in the end, it does feel like another pretty blue(-ish) phone in a sea of pretty blue phones.
This is the same phone, but under different lighting condition.
And opting for a blue(-ish) glass back isn’t the only thing that makes the OnePlus 8T’s design feel more derivative than ever before. The body of the device has seen important changes in its layout, curvature, and dimensions which make it the biggest departure from the mainline that the “T” revisions have offered. The phone feels a bit “boxier”, in part because it has opted for a corner-mounted rectangular camera array, unlike the centered cameras that OnePlus has featured in every other iteration. In terms of dimensions, the 8T is a bit taller and wider than its predecessor, while maintaining the same thickness despite increasing battery capacity. In the hand, the phone remains very comfortable with smooth edges and a gentle curve near the sides of the back plate. I’ve had no issues handling this phone without a case, and while a glass phone is always a bit slippery, the lack of smudges and fingerprints on the back almost force you to keep the phone naked so as to show off its bright color.
If you do opt for a case, OnePlus does offer a variety of excellent cases as always. With the reviewers guide, we found the traditional sandstone case in cyan, as well as a transparent “quantum” case that’s fairly cringey in my opinion.
The rest of the phone’s design follows what you’d expect. You’ve got the alert slider on the metal rail surrounding the phone, both of which feature a nice and shiny chamfer. You’ve got dual speakers (front-facing and bottom-firing), and OnePlus claims that the chin’s size has been reduced by adopting a “chip-on-panel” solution. Finally, the screen no longer features curved edges, something which I’ll describe further in the display section.
Ultimately, the OnePlus 8T is a really beautiful phone that’s comfortable to hold — nothing you wouldn’t expect from the latest OnePlus release. At the same time, the boxier design, corner-mounted camera and even this new matte glass back all make this new OnePlus phone feel more derivative than ever before. I praised the OnePlus 8 for its distinctly-OnePlus back design, but the OnePlus 8T breaks with many of the company’s aesthetic traditions. This is bound to displease some fans, but also attract a new set of customer eyes that, in my opinion, will find quite the treat to look at.
Software – Meet the New OxygenOS
Since the company’s conception, starting with the One’s CyanogenMod S ROM, OnePlus phones have always packed software that’s fairly close to “Stock”. There have been many updates over the years that have in fact altered the look of OxygenOS, with updated iconography, different accent colors, and layout changes — but even then, it remained “Stock-ish” enough to warrant consistent praise from reviewers and users alike. Unlike many competing phones (particularly from China), OnePlus devices aimed to keep the user experience simple, lean, fast, and smooth with only very few and thoughtful features sprinkled in. This has of course changed over the years, and OnePlus devices have felt a lot more bloated in recent memory. The newest Android 11 OxygenOS update is probably the most divisive one yet, as it dramatically alters both the look and feel of the entire operating system.
We’ve written extensively about this new OxygenOS design, which is designed to simplify one-handed operation at a time when phone screens are on average larger than ever. Similarly (very much so, in fact) to Samsung’s OneUI, this new look attempts to tackle the difficulties in one-handed operation by dramatically shifting and reorganizing every layout in such a way that most interactive content remains close to the thumb, while informative content remains close to the top. The new OnePlus Gallery app is perhaps a perfect example of this, as the lower half of the screen is where all the folders and previews are found when first launching the app. This new design philosophy prioritizes scrolling and swiping from side to side along the middle of the screen, getting rid of as many buttons near the top of the display as possible.
Accessing various submenus will bring up more traditional layouts at which point the user has to engage with both hands again, but most surface-level app activities are well-tuned to one-handed operation. OnePlus apps and key areas of the phone UX like the settings menu all feature this new design, while the system apps remain fairly consistent. One common criticism of this approach is that the top portion of the display tends to be fairly barren, and this is indeed the case in OnePlus default and system apps like the Gallery and the Settings — all you get near the top of the display is a few very large words, in turn making some of the screen real estate feel wasted (at least until one begins scrolling around).
There’s no getting around it — this latest OnePlus UI is very far from stock Android now in almost every way. That said, I personally got used to the new look and flow rather quickly. I don’t particularly love it, but I also found that a lot of my preconceptions and worries when first seeing the new layouts were totally unwarranted. I’ve had more issues with the core Android 11 update than the new OxygenOS changes, for example, which ended up surprising me. All the great OnePlus features remain as well, so in the end, the user experience manages to feel familiar even with such a radically different user interface. I’ve written extensively about the OxygenOS features in my OnePlus 8 review, so in the next few paragraphs, I’ll cover only what’s new in the 8T. Surprisingly, there’s a bit more to cover than what’s usually seen on “T” releases — but you might have to wait for all of the features to arrive.
OxygenOS now features a proper always-on display feature, instead of its traditional ambient display. This is by far one of my favorite features, and this device offers a robust set of features to complement it. You get to choose from several clock options, including a slick “Insight AOD” option that shows you how many times you’ve unlocked your phone as well as your usage throughout the day in a simple design. As usual, you also get to check your notifications and remaining battery or charging status. In the upcoming November update, OnePlus 8T users will also receive Canvas AOD, which first surfaced in the betas; this lets you set your AOD to a stylized contour of one of your favorite portrait shot images. The update will also bring a “Bitmoji AOD” option that’ll have your Bitmoji avatar reflect your current activity as well as “what’s happening around you”.
Another two significant features that are coming with the November update are Straighten Doc and Voice Note. The former will be accessible from the camera and the gallery apps, and it will automatically improve the readability of text in photos by straightening the angles, detecting the document edges and getting rid of unwanted shades on the paper, and sharpening the text. This isn’t a revolutionary feature, as many third party apps offer this functionality, but it’d be nice to see such a useful feature baked into the camera app. Voice Note isn’t revolutionary either — similar to what Google’s been doing with its own Notes, it allows your Notes app to convert and transcribe your voice memos into text.
Finally, the company has updated its “Zen Mode” wellbeing app. On top of offering Android’s typical Digital Wellbeing features, the OnePlus 8T’s Zen Mode lets you voluntarily lock yourself out of your phone, and focus on other things, for 20, 30, 40 and 60-minute sessions. I personally have no need for Zen Mode, though those who do enjoy the feature can also keep track of their total time in this mode, how many notifications were muted, and how many days it’s been used. You can also save these stats as screenshots or share them directly from the app to let everyone know how much you are not using your new phone. With the Zen Mode 2.0 update, users can now invite their friends to a “group Zen Mode” session, such that they can all stay focused on a conversation or task together.
Display and Performance – Faster is Better
I’ll tackle these together, given that the biggest change to both of these aspects of the phone emanate from the same upgrade. The OnePlus 8T features a “Fluid” 6.55-inch AMOLED display with a decent (but unimpressive) resolution of 1080p, with a faster refresh rate of 120Hz putting it in-line with the OnePlus 8 Pro as well as other high refresh rate flagships. This is more than a welcome change, as at XDA we’ve always said that high refresh rate panels are some of the best upgrades that Android flagships have received in recent memory. The difference between 90Hz and 120Hz isn’t nearly as crucial as the jump from 60Hz to 90Hz, but it’s nonetheless noticeable.
The other specifications – chipset, storage – remain the same; since we’ve written plenty about the performance of these components in other phones (including OnePlus devices), we’ll mainly focus on the faster display and overall performance. There is no Snapdragon 865 Plus here, which some fans might find a bit of a bummer given that “T” revisions have frequently brought the best silicon available. In practice, this doesn’t make a gigantic difference in day-to-day performance, and if you were looking for the best of the best in terms of a gaming phone, you would be inclined to look elsewhere for other reasons anyway. That said, while not a gigantic compromise, it would have been a nice upgrade.
If you still haven’t experienced a high refresh rate panel, and you are due for an upgrade, do not consider a flagship without one. It makes such a significant difference that you don’t want to miss, and in this regard, the OnePlus 8T performs in line with other high refresh rate phones, and in some ways better. This is in part due to the performance pedigree that OnePlus has been known for: Every year we review their phones and find that they are (and have remained) some of the fastest that Android has to offer, if not the fastest.
Scrolling and swiping in your apps is super smooth, and the touch latency is minimized thanks to the higher touch screen polling rate. The OnePlus 8 already featured really great performance, but the OnePlus 8T manages to surpass it even if only by virtue of the slightly-faster display. As we’ve seen before, the OnePlus 8T dynamically switches between refresh rates depending on the content — for example, it can lower the refresh rate when watching videos or static content. However, the refresh rate can only switch between a few panel modes and is not as variable and adaptive as the solutions found on the Note 20 Ultra and Fold 2. The company also introduced a new feature they call “smooth chain optimization”, which they claim helps ensure smoother frame rates and lower latency, though we didn’t get the full breakdown in time for this review.
In-game performance is thus extremely impressive, with the OnePlus 8T sustaining near-perfect frame-rates in PUBG and Genshin Impact. The former allows OnePlus users to take advantage of their high refresh rate panels (though only on the lowest settings), while the latter is such a graphically-demanding game that maintaining even 60 frames per second is a tough task for all flagships. The OnePlus 8T also features a “multi-layer game-grade cooling system”, a string of marketing terms to describe the vapor chamber, graphite, thermally conductive grease that are all too common inside phones with gaming chops today. In my experience, the OnePlus 8T only got warm while playing PUBG (at the highest settings), at no point hitting uncomfortable temperatures even during long gaming sessions, or any sort of real-world usage for that matter. Genshin Impact managed to push the thermal envelope a lot further, though, causing the phone to become slightly uncomfortable after the end of a 20-minute session. The sample shown above features several dips that mostly correspond to combat scenes (explosions setting grass and enemies on fire) as well as small stutters when transitioning in and out of cutscenes.
Is there anything else that’s different on the display side? Luckily, yes, several small upgrades and changes managed to address two of my bigger problems with recent OnePlus devices. First, the 2.5D “flowscape” display features nearly flat edges like the 7T and unlike the OnePlus 8. While I don’t have a strict preference, I know many among you disliked the switch to curved panels in some recent OnePlus devices.
The OnePlus 8T also features a high peak brightness of up to 1,100 nits, as well as 8,000 brightness adjustment levels with 2 environmental light sensors, and the Pixelworks i3 visual processor which we’ve detailed in a previous article. If you’ve read any of my OnePlus device reviews, you might recall that I constantly criticized the auto-brightness which I always found to be too inaccurate and slow to adapt. Luckily, the OnePlus 8T seems to finally get auto-brightness right, and while I still found myself cranking up the brightness every now and then, I never had to outright turn the feature off like on other OnePlus devices.
Finally, the OnePlus 8T’s calibration seems to be better than that of the OnePlus 8. In my OnePlus 8 review and Dylan’s OnePlus 8 Pro review, we both criticized OnePlus’s then-latest displays for regressing on a few aspects, mainly for black crush. This made consuming darker content much worse, ensuring that tons of videos (and basically the entire Horror movie genre) lost a lot of detail. Side-by-side comparisons show the OnePlus 8T doing better in this regard, though. OnePlus claims a JNCD ratio of under 0.55 (we will have to verify this), and the display features full DCI-P3 color gamut and HDR10+ support, all of which makes it great for media on paper. In practice, I overall found the display to be pleasantly calibrated for content consumption. As expected from an AMOLED display, colors are bright and punchy, and the screen is sharp enough at 1080p resolution.
The display is thinner, too, and coupled with its newfound flatness, it feels even “closer” to the surface than other panels, slightly reinforcing that “sticker” or look common to modern AMOLED displays. There is no Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation (MEMC) like on the OnePlus 8 Pro, however, which is a bit of a bummer given how we found it to be a very welcome addition in that device. Another feature that didn’t make the cut is Comfort Tone, but the OnePlus 8T features “Vision Comfort” to manually or automatically adjust the color temperature and lightness of the display.
Camera Performance – Better Results, Same Old Problems
The camera has typically been where OnePlus stumbles the hardest — that is, until the OnePlus 8 Pro managed to surprise us earlier this year. But while the Pro variant did so well thanks to its excellent sensor, the regular OnePlus 8 was arguably a step back in both software and hardware. It packed the same Sony IMX586 sensor as the 7T, but I found the new software to produce more saturated, faker results. Moreover, the OnePlus 8 featured the exact same color indecisiveness issues as the 7T and many other past OnePlus devices, something I’ll expand upon in a minute. Its 2MP macro camera also produced results with very poor detail and a lot of noise even in the most favorable lighting conditions.
The OnePlus 8T luckily improves upon the hardware with a quad-camera system that offers a wider 16MP ultra wide-angle camera with an impressive 123-degree field of view, as well as a 5MP macro camera and 2MP monochrome sensor to assist the rest of the array. Even though the primary rear shooter uses the same Sony IMX586 sensor as the OnePlus 8 and 7T, I immediately noticed a difference in the way that the OnePlus 8T processes images compared to the 7T, even in the viewfinder.
I took the OnePlus 8T on a road trip to Teal Lake in Wisconsin, which was a great opportunity to see what this camera was capable of. I was able to click some great pictures that feature really appealing (if a bit saturated) colors, as well as good contrast and dynamic range. The portrait shots above, for example, were surprisingly good considering they were taken on a moving boat with the very strong sun (making for very dark face shadows). OnePlus also features a fairly robust Nightscape mode.
You can also find some comparisons with the OnePlus 7T, OnePlus 8, and Pixel 3 XL — it’s interesting to see how the same sensor can produce such different results with different software from the same brand. OnePlus claims that they didn’t just “grab the same code and optimizations” from the OnePlus 8 and instead tried to drive enhancements across the board, and that the addition of a 2MP monochrome sensor helps drive more light information. This time (and unlike the jump from the OnePlus 7T to OnePlus 8) I would say that the changes result in an overall improvement (if small), but even with the new camera array and revamped software, the same issue I’ve had with OnePlus phones for years remains: inconsistency and overly fake colors.
This clip above how the OnePlus 8T struggles to make up its mind about whether the image should be very warm or very cold. The actual scene in real life lived somewhere in the middle, but the OnePlus camera software struggles to figure out what exaggerated view of the world it should capture. Sometimes, the way in which OnePlus processes images is comically fake, like the picture above that features a neon-blue sky, an issue that I also found in the OnePlus 8. I’ve had many, many consecutive pictures show totally disparate color profiles, and in many cases, I’m able to find the exact “decision boundary” that has the software pivot between two completely different schools of color science. To say that this is frustrating is an understatement — it’s borderline unacceptable in such an expensive phone. The OnePlus 8T can absolutely capture some beautiful shots, but its inconsistency is so absurd that you are forced to take multiple shots and play around in the viewfinder to make sure that the software will properly capture the scene.
Regular video performance has been very good, and I’ve found the audio recording in the clips to be much better than that of the OnePlus 8. However, I’ve had several slow-motion clips feature tremendous flickering that wasn’t present on competing phones recording the same overall scene from the same angle.
Overall, I think that the camera remains a weak point of this device, even if it can take some really good photos every now and then. I’ve pointed the aforementioned inconsistency to OnePlus multiple times – sometimes in private feedback, sometimes in person, and many times in reviews – and I can still find these problems in every phone of theirs I test. Some people will appreciate the way that OnePlus processes their images as of late, and I will concede that it makes for some very “shareable” shots a lot of the time, but I personally have grown tired of the inconsistent post-processing and the occasionally oversaturated results.
Battery life and Charging – Great Results!
Since the OnePlus 3, the company has offered Warp Charge (then called Dash Charge), one of the best fast-charging solutions in the market. Even with very minor upgrades throughout the years, Warp Charge remained one of the fastest charging methods, but the OnePlus 8T brings a ridiculously massive upgrade in Warp Charge 65. In order to arrive at faster charging speeds, OnePlus packed two batteries on the 8T, both of which can be charged in parallel. This 65W (10V/6.5A) charging method is enabled by the special Warp Charge 65 brick included in the box, which can also be used at up to 45W with other compatible devices, and it allows one to fully charge the battery in just under 40 minutes. Our tests do indeed confirm this result, and just like Dash Charge did a few years ago, this brought an immediate change to my charging patterns.
Since the bulk of the charging rate benefits happen at the early percentages, Warp Charge 65 allows one to get “a full day of charge” in just 15 minutes according to OnePlus, and in my experience, this is about right. This stems from both the fast charging and the very good battery life I’ve gotten out of the OnePlus 8T. In the screenshots below, you can find several examples of the kind of battery life I got out of the OnePlus 8T. My usage includes a lot of social media (Reddit, Facebook, Instagram), at least one long video call per day (on Instagram, Messenger or Hangouts), camera usage, some Chrome, and a lot of YouTube — several hours with both the screen on and off, which isn’t reflected on the screen on time. In short, I managed to squeeze out around or over 4 hours of screen-on time every day, with a peak of 7 hours of screen-on time, across 24 hour periods, even during the days I was on the road with little access to Wi-Fi. I never felt like I was struggling to get to the end of the day, even during days where I’d use the phone for over four hours; and if for some reason I did need to charge, I knew that even just a few minutes would do the trick.
This really does change the way one charges their phone. For instance, I can quickly top up the OnePlus 8T while getting ready to leave, which is perfect since I’m always in a rush. Near the end of my weekend road trip, for example, I realized that we were about to depart and I had nearly no battery left. Just ten minutes later, I was at 50%, which I was confident would be enough to last the whole ride. A few more minutes of charging would take me to 80%, making that a near certainty. I also never have to worry about overnight charging, which to be fair is less common across all flagships today, but on the plus side, it also means that one doesn’t have to worry about “trickle charging” when juicing up overnight, further impacting battery longevity even if indirectly.
There is no option to lower the charging speed for those that feel a bit worried about battery longevity, but OnePlus does offer an optimized charging feature to make overnight charging safe by only charging from 80% to 100% some minutes before you are set to unplug the phone according to your alarms or calendar. On this note, Oneplus claims that internal testing shows 800 charging cycles still leave the battery at over 80% of its original capacity.
Sadly, there is no wireless charging like what’s found on the OnePlus 8 Pro. This is a shame given how fast their wireless charging solution is, and it’s not impossible to have both 65W charging and 30W wireless charging, but the company claims that adding the wireless charging coils would have made the phone thicker.
Conclusion – The OnePlus 8T is a Good Buy
The OnePlus 8T is, on the whole, a much better phone than the OnePlus 8. This might not be so much a compliment to the 8T as much as it is a critique of the OnePlus 8, as we found that phone to not offer enough to beat the value proposition of its predecessors. The OnePlus 8T, on the other hand, brings some key additions and surprises that overall raise the bang per buck and make it a more competitive device.
The updated design is a bit derivative, but it’s undeniably pretty. The colorful gleamy back is a treat that you can comfortably hold and show off without fear of smudges ruining the look. Not including the Snapdragon 865 Plus feels a bit like a compromise given the company’s track record of packing in the fastest hardware, but at a time where some flagships don’t offer the expensive Snapdragon 865 at all, this isn’t that big an issue. What is disappointing not to see, though, are some of the features introduced by the OnePlus 8 Pro such as MEMC for the display and wireless charging. Warp Charge 65 is definitely an amazing upgrade, but at least some users will prefer more charging options than a single excellent charging method, especially when battery life on the OnePlus 8T seems to be very good. And finally, it would have been really nice to see some of my long-standing issues with the company’s camera software finally addressed.
OnePlus 8T Forums
In the end, the OnePlus 8T brings as many welcome upgrades as omissions, given that for a phone that promises to offer few to no compromises, it manages to not deliver many of the niceties that OnePlus prided itself just half a year ago. The resulting package is still an outstanding phone, with great battery life, a competent (yet often frustrating) camera, a nice screen and excellent performance. In my opinion, this is an overall better buy than the OnePlus 8. But starting at $749, it still has to contend with very strong options from competitors like Samsung (with its Samsung S20 FE) and Google (with its Pixel 5) among many others in a similar price range. Unlike the OnePlus 8, I can recommend the OnePlus 8T, though given that there’s no shortage of great options at the moment, I would urge those interested to look at all available options very carefully.Advertise with XDA

The iPhone 12 series is Apple’s largest lineup ever, with four models, each fitting neatly into a particular market segment: the iPhone 12 Mini is for those who’ve been lamenting the escalating size of phones; the iPhone 12 is for those who do not want to spend too much; the iPhone 12 Pro is the more premium variant; while the iPhone 12 Pro Max is the super-sized, highest spec variant of them all.
The wide variety on offer is great, but it’s likely the standard iPhone 12 that will sell the best. At 6.1-inches and starting at $799, it’s arguably the goldilocks iPhone — neither too small nor too large and not too expensive (relatively speaking). Even the naming suggests this: there’s no need for signifiers like Mini or Max; it’s just the iPhone for this year.
I’ve been testing the iPhone 12 (along with the 12 Pro) for the past four days, and here are my impressions, 96 hours later.

I find this design slightly less comfortable to hold than the rounded edges of the iPhone 11, but I think the boxier look gives off a more mature, professional vibe. Plus, they allow the iPhone 12 to stand on its own on a flat surface, making my job of taking product shots easier.
I also enjoy how light the standard iPhone 12 feels at 164g since the most recent Android flagships top 200g.
The bezels around the iPhone 12 are supposedly slightly thinner than last year’s iPhones, but I couldn’t tell. It may be because I don’t have an iPhone 11 to see side-by-side with the 12, and instead, I’m comparing the iPhone 11 Pro Max with the 12.
But go beyond looks, and the iPhone 12 improves on the iPhone 11 quite a bit, more so than the 12 Pro improves on the iPhone 11 Pro. The iPhone 12 display gets upgraded to OLED display (or, as Apple calls it, Super Retina XDR) from last year’s LCD panel, and the main 12MP camera also enjoys a larger f/1.6 aperture for better light intake. The 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera’s hardware remains the same as before, but it now supports night mode for significantly better low light ultra-wide shots.
The biggest upgrade is in the silicon: the Apple A14 Bionic is built on 5nm technology. It’s still early days, but it definitely feels very powerful when editing videos (more on this later). On the Geekbench app, the A14 Bionic scored a 1,596 single-core and 4,027 multi-core, while the Snapdragon 865 Plus in my Galaxy Fold 2 scored 883 and 2,179, respectively.
The iPhone 12, like all the other iPhone models this year, supports 5G. This, technically, is the biggest new feature of these new iPhones, but the fact I waited this far down in the article to mention it should show you what I think of it. 5G isn’t ready for prime time right now. In Hong Kong, I tested the iPhone on local carrier CSL’s sub-6 network, and while I got good reception throughout many parts of the city, speeds were just a tad faster than 4G LTE even on the best day. I haven’t tested 5G in the US in 2020 so far, but I highly doubt results would fare much better there. Still, Apple adopting 5G is important for the industry, and I suppose now that carriers have Apple’s backing, we’ll see 5G improve sometime next year.
MagSafe
Another new addition to the iPhones this year is they all support MagSafe charging. Those familiar with the older generation of Apple MacBooks will know MagSafe as the proprietary magnetically attached connector that powered MacBooks from 2006 to 2016. The new MagSafe charger is part of a collection of different MagSafe accessories and resembles a small wireless charger that magnetically attaches to the back of the iPhone 12. The MagSafe disc can also top up several of my Android phones, including the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and Galaxy Fold 2. Apple’s official press material doesn’t reveal many details about the tech behind MagSafe other than the fact it can charge the new Apple phones at 15W speeds. It is Qi-compatible up to 7.5W for other phones and accessories. I’ll do more testing in the coming days.
It does work quite well: the MagSafe disc clips onto the iPhone 12 with a satisfying snap, and charging begins just like that. It does bring slightly more freedom than wireless charging, as I can lift up the phone and keep charging. However, I could also achieve the same effect by simply plugging in a wired Lightning cable.
iPhone 12 Camera: Dolby Vision!
As mentioned earlier, only the main wide camera of the 12 received any significant hardware upgrade, with a lower/faster F-stop that Apple says boosts low light intake by 27% over last year’s iPhone 11. The difference in photos captured by the iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 Pro Max is virtually negligible during the day. In the below set of photo samples, the 12’s image is slightly better lit all around than the iPhone 11 Pro’s shot — you can see the area under the shading in the bottom right of the photo is slightly brighter sharper — but differences are minimal. I’ve included a shot by the Galaxy Z Fold 2 to compare.
But where you’ll see the biggest bump is ultra-wide-angle photos taken at night. This was a weak point of the iPhone 11’s ultra-wide last year, but now with night mode, the difference is almost literally night and day.
In fact, Apple has improved all the cameras’ software algorithms to find a better balance in real-time. I took this challenging shot (standing under heavy shading while pointing at harsh sunlight) with the iPhone 12, iPhone 11 Pro, and Galaxy Z Fold 2 (in this order below). The 12’s image has the best exposure, not blowing out the bright sunlight leading to the ocean while also keeping the heavily shaded area well lit.
I’ll focus more on still photography in the full review, but in the meantime, check out some more iPhone 12 photo samples captured over the past few days.
I think, for the most part, this phone makes incremental upgrades over last year’s cameras in terms of dynamic range and exposure, but it isn’t a huge noticeable jump — in still photo, that is. In the video department, the iPhone 12 is the first phone in the world to shoot in Dolby Vision, an HDR standard that dynamically adjusts metadata on-the-fly. So if a scene’s lighting or exposure level shifts, the metadata changes too to adapt.
And here’s where that A14 Bionic power I mentioned comes in: the iPhone 12 can also edit these Dolby Vision clips within iOS’ native Photo app. And I’m not just talking about basic editing like trimming the length of a video or applying a filter, but you can crop or rotate a video and have it processed within the Photo app. Check out some Dolby Vision video samples captured by the iPhone 12 in the clip above. Near the end of the clip, you’ll see a side-by-side video comparison against the Galaxy S20 FE. Although Samsung’s video capabilities are excellent, you can see the Apple’s video had better stabilization, more natural colors, and found exposure quicker as I shifted from an indoor shaded scene to outside under heavy sunlight.
Other random tidbits and Early Impressions
Battery life has been okay so far, meaning it’s neither great nor bad. I’ve been using the iPhone 12 heavily every day with 5G connected, and it only managed to go an entire 14-hour-day on a single charge two of the four days of testing so far. On one particular heavy usage day, I left the house at 10 am and shot videos for an hour, streamed Spotify while surfing the web for another hour, and made a couple of WhatsApp voice calls; my battery drained to 25% by just 4 pm. Samsung phones.
It sounds weird to say this during the middle of a pandemic, but $800 for the iPhone 12 seems like a good value compared to the $1,000 iPhone 12 Pro (I’ll have a piece comparing these two side-by-side soon), or the $1,400 Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Now, of course, there’s the matter of the fact that iPhone’s OS is entirely different from Android, so if you’re an Android enthusiast reading this — it’s all a moot point anyway.

Huawei has been blocked from using Google apps for a while now, but the company hasn’t slowed down its smartphone launches. The Huawei P40 series was announced earlier this year, but a few of the models were not available outside of China. The Huawei P40 Pro+ was one of those devices and now it’s available for pre-order in more markets.
The Huawei P40, P40 Pro, and P40 Pro+ were all announced in March, but we only saw the P40 and P40 Pro launch outside of China. The P40 Pro+ is the model with the powerhouse of cameras. The main lens is a 50MP RYYB sensor and it’s joined by a 40MP wide-angle camera, 8MP 10X optical zoom periscope lens, and 8MP 3X optical zoom telephoto lens.
Huawei P40 Pro+ XDA Forums
Besides the cameras, the Huawei P40 Pro+ has all the high-end flagship specifications you’d expect. That includes the Kirin 990 5G SoC, a 4 layer SuperCool system, 3D graphene film, and a super-thin Vapor Chamber cooling system. It has a 6.5-inch 90Hz display, 8GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, a 4,200mAh battery, 40W fast charging, and Android 10. What it doesn’t have, however, is Google Play Services.
The Huawei P40 Pro+ is now available for pre-order in Europe for 1,399 Euro (~$1,588), and in the United Kingdom for 1,299 GBP (~$1,654). It will officially launch on June 25th from the Huawei Store and select retailers. Customers can get it in Black or White ceramic and it will come bundled with a Huawei Watch GT2 (46mm, Pebble Brown) and a Huawei SuperCharge Wireless Charger Stand (40W).

For years, Amazon has been known for being the undisputed biggest online retailer out there, but more recently they’ve started dedicating efforts into their ecosystem of services, which include a virtual assistant (Alexa), an app store of their own, and, of course, their own fleet of Android-based devices. Amazon has released their own lineup of tablets and phones running their own Android-based operating system, but this fleet of devices also include TV-oriented products like the Amazon Fire TV. Being based on Android, all of these devices are, of course, rootable as evidenced by devices such as the Fire HD 8 and the Fire 7—but not as easily as you may think.
Thanks to an exploit found in the 2015 Amazon Fire TV 2’s MediaTek processor, the device has been successfully rooted, and without any specific procedures. If you want to check it out, head over to our forums now, but be mindful that this method is highly experimental and still needs testing.

Two weeks ago we informed that Android Pay is launching in Taiwan. The report is now officially confirmed, as Google plans to expand its Android Pay to Canada, Russia, Spain, Brazil, and of course, Taiwan. The announcement took place during one of the conferences at Google I/O 2017.
The reports in Russian media suggest that Android Pay will be available for the following banks: Sberbank Rossii, Alfa-Bank, Raiffeisenbank, and Tinkoff Bank. Android devices are incredibly popular in Russia. Russia’s largest mobile phone retailer – Euroset – estimates that 87 percent of smartphones in Russia is powered by Android. Users of these banks should soon have an option to utilize the NFC for the mobile payments.
It’s not yet confirmed which banks will support Android Pay in Canada, Spain, and Brazil. We should expect more information about this in the coming weeks. We can only assume that not all banks will add the compatibility right off the bat. Canadian version of the Visa website for a brief moment confirmed that Android Pay comes to Visa cards. The web page has been pulled out shortly after. Luckily, the Wayback Machine portal managed to capture the site, so you can take a look here.
Android Pay was officially announced at Google I/O 2015. Since its release, it has become one of three services that offer mobile payments. The other two are Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. According to the analysis made by IHS Markit, 3.4 billion smartphones will be ready for Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay by the end of 2017.

Today,...The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Will Be Announced on August 23
Every year, Samsung has two big product launches – one for the new S-series flagship held in the first quarter of the year, and one for the new Note device towards the second half of the year. So far this year we’ve gotten the beautiful Galaxy S8/S8+, and soon, the Galaxy Note 8 will be here to follow it up.
Samsung has just sent out invites for its latest press event that’s being called, “Unpacked 2017: Do Bigger Things”. The image sent alongside this invitation shows an S Pen drawing out the Samsung’s Infinity Display setup, making it quite obvious that the star of the show will be the Note 8.
Current rumors have the Note 8 shaping up to be a pretty impressive piece of tech, but more importantly, this will be the direct sequel to the explosive disaster that was the Note 7. The chances of the Note 8 running into similar issues are very slim, but Samsung’s going to need to use this event to communicate to its fans that there’ still a reason to love the Note line despite 2016’s mishap.
For its rumored specs, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will pack in a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or an Exynos 8895 depending on the region of sale. This will be complemented by a healthy 6GB of RAM, though this could see some regional variation. The display on the phone will be 6.3″ in size, but the Note 8’s 18.5:9 aspect ratio and Infinity Display setup with dual curves will help keep the actual device footprint in check. One of the highlights of the device will also be the dual rear camera setup comprising of two 12MP sensors with independent OIS.
The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 event is set to take place on August 23 in New York City, and we at XDA-Developers hope to be there to see just what Samsung is bringing to the table. Source: SamsungAndroid Software Update Download Links Repository
OEMs tend to roll out software updates to their Android smartphones in a phased manner, which can be annoying to users who do not like to wait. But thankfully, some OEMs do provide easy methods to sideload the latest Android update, which can come in handy if you cannot wait to install the newest update for your device. These update files can also come in handy if you ever need to restore your device to an older version for whatever reason, so providing a list of download links comes in handy in such a situation. This is our attempt at providing download links to software update packages from different OEMs.
Check out individual device pages for download links for region-specific update packages, as well as for instructions to install them. We do recommend checking out your device’s XDA Forums and other device-specific instructions before proceeding to install/sideload any update.

Motorola is back to the flagship smartphone market with the Motorola Edge and the Motorola Edge+. While the Motorola Edge is more of an upper midrange device sporting a Snapdragon 765G, the Motorola Edge+ brings the flagship might we haven’t seen from the company in years. With a combo of bleeding-edge features with a Snapdragon 865, a 108MP rear camera, a waterfall display, and much more, Motorola is pulling no punches with the Edge+. LG, meanwhile, is preparing to launch the LG Velvet, part of a completely new smartphone line (that might eventually replace LG’s G series). It is confirmed to come with a Snapdragon 765 processor with 5G connectivity support and will be touting an all-new design language different from what the company is currently doing with phones like the LG V60.
These phones have a couple of things in common, though, with one of them being that they all come with a 5G modem and, thus, support 5G connectivity. While the Motorola devices have already been announced and will be coming to the market very soon, the LG Velvet has not yet been announced properly. Another thing they have in common is that both LG and Motorola have had a good reputation in the modding space, or at least they used to have in the past. This means that people will inevitably attempt to mod these phones, subject to support from the OEM.
If you’re a developer and you’re planning to do some modding with any of these phones when they’re available for purchase, you now have a place to share your work. We’ve now opened official XDA forums for the Motorola Edge, the Edge+, and the LG Velvet. Here, you’ll be able to find mods, custom kernels, and custom ROMs for these devices as and when they become available. Meanwhile, you can use the forums to discuss these phones and whether they are good enough to switch over to.

Back in January 2020, Google had mentioned its intent to phase out third-party cookies from Google Chrome within the next two years. Initiatives like the Privacy Sandbox are believed to be the drivers of a healthy, ad-supported web that would render third-party cookies obsolete. While we are still far from reaching that goal, Google is now showcasing its proposed alternatives to third-party cookies: trust tokens.
A cookie, in the context of the Internet, is a piece of data that is stored on the user’s device when the user accesses a website. The cookie stores data related to the user’s interaction with the website, such as items added to a shopping cart, login data, form data, and much more. First-party cookies are cookies that are created by the visited website itself and are necessary for the website to track your activity as you move from page to page. Third-party cookies, on the other hand, are cookies that are created by a party other than the visited website or the user; these usually refer to cookies created by external content, such as advertisements. Since average users often have little or no control over the advertisements that providers can serve them, they inadvertently allow these ad providers to track and build the user’s profile based on their browsing history across websites that have ads from the same provider. For an ad provider, tracking the user is an important task as it allows them to serve users with ads that are more relevant to the user’s taste, and therefore, have a higher probability of attracting the user’s attention and interaction. While this goal sounds reasonable on the surface, in practice, third-party cookies have been used for much more nefarious purposes, trampling upon user privacy with little concern.
Unlike cookies, trust tokens are designed to authenticate a user without needing to know their identity. The idea behind a trust token is to differentiate between a user and a bot, and not to track every individual user. As Google mentions, the web ecosystem heavily relies on building trust signals to detect fraudulent or spammy actors, and this coarse segmentation is crucial for the ad-industry which receives a large amount of invalid, fraudulent traffic. Trust tokens are non-personalized and cannot be used to track users, but they are cryptographically signed, so they cannot be forged by bad actors either.
Google’s announcement does not go further into the workings of trust tokens, but there is an explainer document available if you are interested in further details and implementation. Trust tokens are available for testing by developers through the API. If all goes well, we should see them become popular on the web before Chrome’s migration away from third-party cookies.

Story Via: The Verge5G – it's not all hype anymore. Sure, reception areas for high-band or mmWave (the speedy type) are not as widespread as we'd like, and mid- and low-band (the slower, sub-6 type 5G) doesn't quite reach true game-changing speeds. However, when the stars align, and you get optimal coverage and get that fifth-generation, 500Mbps+ network...Samsung Pay Touch turns your Galaxy phone into a payment terminal
With the advent of Google Pay and similar services, mobile payments are fast overtaking cash and card payments. The convenience of using your phone instead of having to carry cards cannot be overstated. Of course, now that we can send payments via mobile, it only makes sense that the next step should be the ability to receive payments via mobile. This has been semi-possible for some time. Services like Stripe and SumUp offer card small-scale terminals that can be paired with your smartphone via Bluetooth to receive payments. Now, Samsung has one-upped such services by launching Samsung Pay Touch.
Samsung Pay Touch is a relatively new app that takes compatible Galaxy smartphones and turns them into PoS (point-of-sale) terminals that can be used to receive contactless payments. In essence, Samsung is extending its Samsung Pay service from customers to merchants. That doesn’t mean that all merchants with Samsung devices will be able to use the app. Currently, the only supported models are the Galaxy S8/S8+, Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S9/S9+, Galaxy Note 9, and Galaxy S10/S10e/S10+. It’s also a safe bet that the Galaxy Note 10 will support the feature when it is released. Furthermore, it seems to be limited to users in Canada.
The service isn’t free to use. Credit card transactions will earn Samsung 2.6% per transaction. Debit cards, on the other hand, will set you back $0.10 per transaction for Interac Flash cards. Transfers aren’t immediate, they can take up to 48 hours. There is a limit of up to $100 on transactions, which is a little disappointing. Seeing as the app is more than likely targeted at smaller businesses, it means they’ll still have to invest in a dedicated terminal if they’re handling larger transactions, which renders the app somewhat obsolete.
Samsung Pay Touch isn’t lacking in features, however. There’s support for multiple devices being linked to one account, and business owners can create individual staff accounts to track sales for each staff member. This is really useful for companies whose pay is commission-based. On top of that, receipts can be sent via email, and products can be customized with photos, names, and prices.
The app is not without its flaws, however. Many reviews on the Google Play Store mention issues with registration – though to Samsung’s credit they seem to have replied to most of them with explanations. On average, the app has a 2.3/5 rating, which is less than impressive. However, if Samsung can fix these sign-in/sign-up issues, and get it working in more countries, they’re definitely onto something.
Via 1: SamMobile | Via 2: RedditGoogle Stadia can now play games over 4G and 5G mobile data
Google Stadia launched last year as the company’s ambitious entry into the growing market of cloud game streaming services. Understandably, Stadia was limited to Wi-Fi networks at launch. After all, streaming games from the cloud racks up data usage very quickly. If that doesn’t matter to you, though, it’s now possible to play games over 4G and 5G mobile data.
Streaming games over 4G and 5G comes to the platform via a new Stadia Experiment that launches today. Users who wish to be able to play games on-the-go can opt-in to the Experiment in the settings section of the Stadia app for Android. Tap your avatar in the top right corner, select Experiments, and then choose Use Mobile Data. 9to5Google estimates that Stadia consumes 2.7GB per hour, which suggests that the streaming quality is 360p.
Google didn’t reveal what the actual streaming quality will be, but we’d hope to see better than 360p over 5G. Carriers boast about all the amazing capabilities of 5G, but that doesn’t mean much if services are limiting streaming quality. This is just the beginning of mobile streaming for Stadia, though, so we’ll have to wait and see once people actually try it out.
One side effect of playing games over 4G and 5G is that you can’t use the Stadia Controller. The controller must be on the same Wi-Fi network as your phone, which obviously makes it impossible to use on-the-go. You’re stuck with the on-screen controls or another wired controller. The option is still rolling out to the Android app, so hang tight if you don’t see it yet.

Earlier this year at CES 2020, Lenovo announced the Yoga 5G 2-in-1 convertible laptop. This laptop featured the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx, Qualcomm’s highest-end ARM-based SoC designed for “Always On, Always Connected” PCs (ACPCs). As such, the Lenovo Yoga 5G runs Microsoft’s Windows 10 on ARM, much like the Microsoft Surface Pro X and Samsung Galaxy Book S. Unlike the Surface Pro X and the Galaxy Book S, however, the Yoga 5G will support 5G NR connectivity (hence the name). Today, Lenovo has announced that they have partnered with Verizon to bring the Yoga 5G to the U.S. under the name “Lenovo Flex 5G.”

Like the Surface Pro X and Galaxy Book S, the Lenovo Flex 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx 5G compute platform. The Verizon version of this laptop is designed to support the carrier’s Ultra Wideband mmWave 5G NR network in addition to sub-6GHz 5G networks.
Looking beyond 5G, the Lenovo Flex 5G is a very attractive laptop. It has a sleek design with a 360-degree hinge and touchscreen. It weighs just 2.97 lbs and has a 14-inch 1080p display with very slim bezels on three sides. The Flex 5G packs 8GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. In terms of ports, you’re looking at two USB-C 3.1 ports, a headphone/microphone combo port, and a nano-SIM slot. The battery is rated at 60Wh and Lenovo claims “up-to-24-hour” battery life. There is also a fingerprint scanner for biometric security.
Pricing & Availability
The Lenovo Flex 5G will be available in the U.S. on June 18th at Verizon for $1,399 or $58.33 per month for 24 months on the Verizon Device Payment Plan. The Lenovo Yoga 5G will be available later this year outside of the U.S. through Lenovo.com and carriers including EE in the United Kingdom, Sunrise in Switzerland, and China Mobile in China.
Verizon is launching some new 5G plans to coincide with the launch of the Flex 5G. The new 5G Ultra Wideband Connected Device Plan starts at $30 per month.

LineageOS is a popular free and open source operating system. It was forked from CyanogenMod in 2016. The LineageOS custom ROM officially supports more than 180 Android phones and has been installed over 1.7 million times.There have been many rumors and running jokes over the years that XDA would, and probably should, make a phone. Our history with alternative platforms such as LineageOS (and CyanogenMod that came before it) has meant that XDA has been at the forefront of helping develop viable alternatives to the primary platforms available on smartphones.

One of the biggest casualties with the Android Oreo update was Google’s infamous blob emoji (a.k.a. “blobmoji”). The update introduced a redesigned emoji pack with more traditional round faces. Many of the fan-favorite critters were updated as well. Some people were happy to see the blobs get the ax, but a lot of Android users are still upset. Google is now bringing them back as a sticker pack in Gboard and Android Messages.
Almost exactly a year ago, Google added the blob emoji as a sticker pack in Allo. The only problem is Allo is not very popular and development has been put on hold. Now the blobs are available in the more popular Gboard and Android Messages apps. The pack (called “The Blobs Live On”) includes a variety of static emoji as well as some very fun animated stickers.
A sticker pack is not as universal as system-wide emoji, but putting it in keyboard app does make it more widely available. You won’t be able to use the stickers in every app. For example, they aren’t supported in Facebook Messenger Lite. There’s a Magisk Module that brings back the blobs as the system emoji if you’re interested. We’d love to see Android get the ability to choose the system emoji. For now, most people will have to live with the blob sticker pack.
The sticker pack is rolling out now to both apps now. I was able to find it in Gboard but not Android Messages yet.
Via: The VergeVerizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile come together to launch the ZenKey password authentication tool
Wouldn’t it be nice if passwords simply didn’t exist? Some companies like Google are moving away from them, but it’ll take a seismic shift in the industry to get more people and services on board. It’s a future envisioned by a new initiative known as ZenKey, a collaboration between Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile.
Essentially, ZenKey is like one of those “Sign in with” buttons you often see on websites, but there’s a little more security behind ZenKey’s process. The service uses multi-factor authentication when someone tries to sign in, including a user’s phone number, SIM card details, account tenure, phone account type, and user credentials.
You’ll need to download your carrier’s ZenKey app and then setup a PIN or provide biometric authentication before you begin. As of now, only a few apps and services support the service, including mobile apps for LiveXLive and Verizon My Fios. Websites for AT&T TV, DIRECTV, myAT&T, and AT&T Now also support ZenKey sign in.
In the initial setup, your phone and carrier is verified and your carrier is notified of registration. To register with an app or website that supports ZenKey, your wireless carrier will pass along the information that you choose to share. Then, once you try to login using the green “Sign in with ZenKey” button, a confirmation request is sent to your wireless carrier to verify your device and check for suspicious activity. Once your carrier confirms that you’re trying to sign in, it’ll send validation, automatically logging you in. A similar system has been setup for making transactions, like in a banking app. Your wireless carrier will confirm that you’re giving consent and then ask you to confirm the transaction.
Notably, ZenKey will allow users to control what personal information is shared with apps and accounts, such as name, phone number, and email. Apple’s “Sign in with Apple” offers similar privacy controls, allowing users to hide their email and prevent tracking.
ZenKey’s premise is interesting and could potentially be a lot more secure than the traditional password and SMS authentication, the former of which is often exposed as part of security breaches and the latter of which is often hijacked via social engineering SIM-jacking methods. But until ZenKey is widely supported by services and apps, there’s not much incentive to use it. The service does promise, however, that more apps and websites are in the process of integrating ZenKey, with plans to trial or go live in the coming months.
If you’re interested in trying ZenKey, here’s the user guide.Google Duo’s auto-framing feature is coming to Samsung Galaxy devices
Samsung Galaxy owners who use Google Duo will soon be able to use the video application’s auto-framing feature, which was previously exclusive to Google’s Pixel 4. Auto-framing is a feature that automatically keeps you front and center during a video call.
Google Duo’s auto-framing feature first arrived on the Pixel 4 at the end of last year. The same software update also introduced a Portrait Mode to Google Duo, allowing users to blur out the background for a less distracting experience.
Android Police was first to spot Google Duo’s auto-framing feature working on the Galaxy S20 Ultra. Google has since confirmed to the outlet that auto-framing is no longer exclusive to the Pixel 4, although the company didn’t reveal what other devices will get auto-framing in the future.
The publication checked to see if auto-framing was available on the Galaxy Z Flip, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Note 20 Ultra, but the devices don’t appear to have the feature — at least for the time being. For what it’s worth, Google’s support page still lists Google Duo’s auto-framing feature as a Pixel 4 exclusive, but that’s obviously no longer accurate.
As Android Police points out, exclusive Google features often come to Samsung devices, like Google Duo integrated directly into Samsung’s dialer app. Galaxy S20 users can also trigger a Duo video call in 1080p with the right data connection with up to eight people. In other words, seeing this feature on a Samsung Galaxy device is no real surprise.
If you’ve never used Google Duo’s auto-framing feature before, it’s especially convenient when chatting hands-free. That way, you can go about your business while Google’s video calling app keeps you in the center of the frame. It’s almost like having your own personal cameraman.While many people are still skeptical about 5G, Verizon continues its rollout plans. Today, the company flipped the switch for four new cities: Atlanta, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Washington DC. Verizon is already selling a couple of 5G devices, but the list of available cities is still relatively small. So the continued expansion is good news.

Xiaomi’s sub-brand Redmi just launched the Note 9 Pro and Note 9 Pro Max in India, featuring Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 720G chip, an impressive quad-camera array, and support for up to 33W fast charging. The devices pack in up to 8GB of RAM, up to 128GB of internal storage, and a massive 5,020mAh battery, making them the most premium devices in the Redmi Note series by far. As with older devices in the Redmi Note series, we expect the Note 9 Pro and the Note 9 Pro Max to be among the best selling devices this year. In case you’re planning on purchasing a Note 9 Pro or Note 9 Pro Max, you’d be glad to know that we’ve now opened forums for these devices where you’ll be able to keep a track of third-party development and customize the devices as per your needs.
Redmi Note 9 Pro XDA Forums || Redmi Note 9 Pro Max XDA Forums
Along with the Redmi Note 9 and Note 9 Pro Max, we’ve also opened a forum for the recently launched Nubia Red Magic 5G — the latest gaming smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer. The device packs in some impressive specifications, along with an interesting design and a compelling price, which lead us to believe that it’ll be quite popular among mobile gamers. As you’d expect, the Red Magic 5G features Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 865 chip, coupled with up to 16GB of RAM, up to 256GB of storage, and a 4,500mAh battery with 55W fast charging support. If you’re looking to buy the device and plan on customizing it, be sure to keep an eye on the Red Magic 5G forum linked below.

Additionally, we’ve also opened our forums for the upcoming Google Pixel 4a, which was recently spotted in a leaked hands-on video. While Google is yet to officially announce the device, leaks suggest that it will pack in Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 730 chip, coupled with 6GB of RAM and a hole-punch display. We expect the Pixel 4a to be more popular than Google’s flagship Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, which means that it will create quite a stir on our forums as well. So be sure to check out our forums for the latest discussions and development for the Google Pixel 4a.
Google Pixel 4a XDA Forums[Update: Settled] Sprint is suing AT&T for misleading consumers with “5G E” branding
The 5G Wars are already heating before anyone really has the ability to use it. That’s thanks in large part to AT&T’s bogus “5G E” marketing. We previously wrote about AT&T Samsung phones getting a “5G E” icon with the Android Pie update. AT&T has also been using the “5G E” term in recent advertisements. T-Mobile and Verizon have both pushed back against this in their own way. Now Sprint is taking things to the next level.
Sprint has filed a lawsuit in federal court against AT&T, claiming their “5G E” branding is misleading consumers. According to a survey commissioned by Sprint, 54% of consumers believe “5G E” networks are the same as or better than 5G and 43% believe buying an AT&T phone today will be 5G capable. Sprint argues that AT&T practice is damaging the reputation of 5G while they work to build a “legitimate early entry into the 5G network space.”
For those who don’t know, “5G E” stands for “5G Evolution,” but it’s still 4G LTE. AT&T has simply added some technology that can potentially deliver speeds slightly faster than LTE. It is not related to legitimate 5G in any way. It’s not hard to see how this can confuse consumers. I have personally already encountered AT&T customers who believe their Samsung phone now has 5G. That doesn’t mean Sprint will have an easy case. We’ll be watching this closely as it develops.

Samsung has announced the next evolution of mobile payments with Samsung Pay. These features will make the shopping experience more holistic for everyone using the service. Samsung Pay is arguably the best mobile payment app because of its support for MST, which lets users use their phones at payment terminals that don’t support NFC payment.
Bixby Shopping is the latest feature coming to the Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+. This will allow users to use Bixby Vision and scan a product with the camera. It will then find the products from one of Samsung’s partners and allow you to purchase the item using Samsung Pay. Someone can see a product they like in the real world, hold their phone up to it, and then find the product and purchase it without needing to use multiple apps to do it.
They have also announced a Cash Back rewards program. This allows for the user to get direct cash back rewards at certain partnered retailers. These could be exclusive offers on certain products with cash back or just cash back for making a purchase. The feature will also work with the current Samsung Rewards system. Samsung compares this feature to the way an airline gives miles back so you can save up for another ticket with miles.
These features are a great addition to Samsung Pay. It will create a more holistic shopping experience. By adding more features, Samsung hopes to bring more users into the platform and hopefully convince more companies to partner with Samsung to make Samsung Pay even better. With the combination of Bixby Vision, MST, and Samsung’s brand name, they could create the best and biggest mobile payment platform.

Canonical has announced the release of Ubuntu 20.10, aka ‘Groovy Gorilla’. The big news in this release is a newly optimized stack that brings Ubuntu Desktop and Server to the Raspberry Pi range. Since the launch of the Raspberry Pi 4 in 2019, the diminutive computer line has been increasingly sympathetic to being used as a desktop alternative, and the arrival of a tailored version of the biggest Linux GUI (Android excluded, of course) is a significant step on that road.
“In this release, we celebrate the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s commitment to put open computing in the hands of people all over the world,” said Mark Shuttleworth, CEO at Canonical. “We are honored to support that initiative by optimizing Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi, whether for personal use, educational purposes, or as a foundation for their next business venture.”
Ubuntu 20.10 can also run on RP 2 and 3 variants but only with 4GB RAM and above – if you go lower than that, you’ll probably get a smooth installation but a glitchy experience. You’ll also see improved support for 2-in-1 devices with on-screen keyboard modes, and more devices of all form-factors now support fingerprint readers under Linux.
“From the classic Raspberry Pi board to the industrial-grade Compute Module, this first step to an Ubuntu LTS on Raspberry Pi with long term support and security updates matches our commitment to widening access to the very best computing and open-source capabilities,” said Eben Upton, CEO of Raspberry Pi Trading.
For more advanced users, edge on-demand computing gets a big boost with a ‘micro cloud’ stack, combining MAAS, LXD, MicroK8s, and Ceph, offering lightweight, low profile cloud instances for a variety of use cases from AI to smart city management.
Ubuntu 20.10 is available now, free of charge for most users, with images for desktop, server, cloud and IoT, as well as a dedicated Raspberry Pi build, available to download from the Ubuntu website.

Updated Applications
Updated SubsystemsWarden is an open source app from the developer of Aurora Store that lets you disable trackers/loggers [Root]
It’s no secret that we’re constantly tracked while on the Internet. While marketers and organizations contend that tracking users help them understand their behavior and preferences so they can improve their services, many users find this degree of tracking to be invasive. Many users may even end up divulging more information about their browsing habits than they intended to, often by browsing some insecure or untrustworthy websites. While its commonly believed that most of the tracking online happens while browsing the Internet on our PCs, there are hundreds of Android apps out there that come with built-in trackers to not just store information about you but also share that information with potential third-party clients such as advertisers.
If you take privacy more seriously than the average user and absolutely want to deter being tracked by apps on your phone, you should try out a new open-source app called Warden that claims to block trackers and loggers hidden within apps. Warden is created by XDA Senior member WhyOrean who is notable for his work behind the Aurora Store, a popular, unofficial, open-source Google Play Store client. Using root access, Warden allows the user to disable all detected trackers and loggers contained within apps. It also features a profile-based “debloater” that supports scripting. The app supports Android version 5.0 and above.
The Warden App Manager uses a static list of trackers and loggers compiled by French non-profit Exodus Privacy. It reads the dex (Dalvik Executable) files within each app installed on your phone to see if any of the class names match a known tracker or logger from the aforementioned list. Loggers, in this context, means “all utilities which are used to log user activity on an app or logcat in general.” WhyOrean notes that not all loggers are evil and some might be used to log users’ activities for various (legitimate) purposes. However, there are a few logging tools “like ACRA, xLog” that are powerful tools that can “send user data to devs without user’s consent.”
Besides offering an insight into pesky trackers, Warden comes with a “De-Bloater” and “Nuke it!” mode, both of which require root access. While the De-Bloater allows users to disable, hide, or uninstall apps with fishy trackers, the Nuke it! feature allows users to scan all apps installed on the device and disable all known tracker components (Activities, Services, Providers, and Receivers) automatically. Both “De-Bloater” and “Nuke it!” are considered experimental features at the moment, so be sure to visit the below thread to give feedback to the developer in case you experience any issues or have any suggestions.
Download Warden – App ManagerAlexa is Coming to the Amazon Android App (This Week)
Not to be confused with the Alexa standalone app
Amazon’s Alexa is available on a wide array of different platforms, and starting this week, the virtual assistant is now making its way to the Amazon app on Android.
iPhone users have been able to use Alexa in the Amazon app since March, and from what we’ve seen so far, Alexa for the Android Amazon app works just like it does over on iOS. In other words, you can use Alexa to see what the weather’s like, catch up on the week’s biggest stories, order an Uber, turn off your connected lights, etc.
This added functionality is certainly cool, but having it within the Amazon Shopping app is slightly odd. Amazon’s proven time and time again that Alexa is one of the world’s most powerful virtual assistants to-date, but is the company’s shopping app the right place for it? Given it could be integrated with, you know, shopping… then yeah, it might be.
Looks like Alexa was just added to the Amazon app for Android! Who wants to try playing Deal or No Deal from their Amazon app? 🙂 pic.twitter.com/vnxBW11pA8
— Nick Schwab (@nickschwab) July 20, 2017
The Amazon app has previously featured basic voice commands for adding items to your cart, searching for products throughout Amazon, and tracking previous orders. The features could be access by tapping the microphone icon in the upper-left-hand corner of the app, and this is what Alexa will be replacing. You’ll still have those voice features present in an unobtrusive manner, but now tapping on that microphone will allow you to do much more than basic product tracking and ordering.
Alexa’s presence in the Amazon Android app was first spotted by Twitter user Nick Schwab, and shortly after this sighting, Amazon confirmed to TechCrunch that Alexa will be rolling out to all Android users throughout the remainder of the week.
I currently don’t have Alexa on the Amazon app on my Google Pixel, but I’ll be sure to keep checking throughout the weekend. I’m more of a Google Assistant guy myself, but it might be fun to play around with Alexa every once in and while – even if I will be tempted to buy more things I don’t need when opening up the Amazon app to use it.
Via: TechCrunchThe Asus ZenWatch 2 (49mm) is Finally Getting Android Wear 2.0
After months and months of waiting, the Android Wear 2.0 update is finally starting to roll out to the Asus ZenWatch 2 (at least the 1.63-inch variant).
This news comes by way of an update to the Android Wear Help Forum in Google’s official Product Forums, and users on Reddit and Google+ have confirmed the update as well.
At this time, it appears that only the 1.63-inch (49mm) version of the ZenWatch 2 is being updated to Android Wear 2.0. A smaller 45mm model was released alongside the larger 49mm one, but an exact date as to when it will be getting the AW 2.0 love is unknown.
Earlier this month, Asus said that the ZenWatch 2 would be updated to the latest Android Wear software at some point in August, so at least for the 49mm variant, the company is ahead of schedule. The ZenWatch 3 recently started getting the Android Wear 2.0 update last week, so hopefully it won’t be too much longer before the existing ZenWatch family is all up to speed.
The OTA update for Android Wear 2.0 for the 49mm ZenWatch 2 should be hitting your wrist soon, but if you don’t have a lot of patience, you can get the files you need to sideload it via the link below.

T-Mobile recently became the world’s first telecom service provider to offer a commercial nationwide standalone (SA) 5G network. With this move, the company expanded 5G coverage by 30 percent and gave high-speed 5G access to nearly 250 million people across 7,500 cities and towns in the United States. However, in order to access T-Mobile’s new SA 5G network, users may have to get a new SIM card from the company.
According to a recent post on T-Mobile’s support page, subscribers won’t be able to use the company’s new 5G network unless they have a SA 5G capable SIM card. While the company is providing a compatible SIM card with all recently purchased T-Mobile 5G compatible devices, users will need to activate the new card by following the steps given in this post.
In case you aren’t sure if you have a compatible SIM card or not, T-Mobile has shared a reference image (attached above) that you can use to identify the same. ith R15 wSIM cards written in pink are compatible with the new SA 5G network, while SIM cards with the letters ‘TM’ followed by four numbers are not. In case you’ve lost the new SIM card that came with your 5G device, you’ll have to contact T-Mobile or visit a nearby store for a replacement SIM.
In all, you’ll need these three things to access T-Mobile’s SA 5G network:
- A T-Mobile 5G compatible device that has received a software update to be compatible with SA 5G.
- A T-Mobile SA 5G compatible SIM card.
- A location with SA 5G coverage.
In case you have any further queries regarding the new SA 5G network, you can check out the FAQ section below.
FAQ
- What is Standalone 5G vs. Non-Standalone?Non-standalone (NSA) relies on a mid-band LTE signal to access the 5G network. The device must connect to both LTE AND 5G. Standalone (SA) operates independently of the LTE network. With SA, the device connects to LTE OR 5G, whatever is the appropriate core network. SA allows full access to the benefits of 5G without the limitations of legacy LTE.
- Who is eligible for Standalone 5G? Will I have to change my plan or pay more?
- Are there any technical requirements to access SA 5G besides a compatible SIM?Yes, your device must receive a software update from the manufacturer to work on 5G SA. All 5G capable devices will eventually be sent the software update; for some devices this has already happened while others will come at a later date. T-Mobile doesn’t currently have information from the manufacturers to know when. If your devices haven’t received the update yet, it will still work great on our LTE network and on the Non-Standalone (NSA) 5G coverage, so you will see 5G when you travel to other locations. Once the software update is available, you’ll pick up the new 5G technology at your location too!
- What benefits can I expect with Standalone 5G?SA is a major milestone as it’s essential to unlocking truly transformational 5G in the future. Currently, Standalone 5G allows T-Mobile to expand 5G coverage and performs similar to NSA that already exists today. Down the road, Standalone 5G is expected to deliver the capacity, data speeds, and lower latency that will fuel future innovation. As 5G apps and innovations are introduced, they will be optimized on Standalone 5G technology.
- Is standalone 5G faster than Non-Standalone?Currently, Standalone 5G performs similar to NSA that already exists today. Down the road, Standalone 5G is expected to deliver the capacity, data speeds, and lower latency that will fuel future innovation. As 5G apps and innovations are introduced, they will be optimized on Standalone 5G technology.
- Is Standalone the only 5G coverage on the T-Mobile network?No, the majority of our nationwide 5G network is on NSA. We have started lighting up Standalone 5G in select areas and will roll out additional SA as we continue to expand the T-Mobile 5G network.
- Where can I access Standalone 5G? Can I see it on your coverage map?We’ve just started rolling out SA so it’s only available in select areas. The coverage map shows our nationwide 5G footprint so you’ll notice the expanded 5G coverage, especially in some rural areas and indoor locations where there wasn’t 5G coverage before. The map does not, however, distinguish SA from NSA. A T-Mobile care or retail sales associate can help identify if there’s SA in your area – if you’d like to learn more, please visit a T-Mobile retail store or call 611 on your mobile device.
- Can Sprint customers with a 5G capable device access Standalone 5G?Sprint 5G devices cannot access our newest Standalone 5G technology. These devices can, however, access our Nationwide 5G (NSA) coverage.
- Can Metro customers with a 5G device access Standalone 5G?Yes, customers on Metro by T-Mobile who meet the technical requirements can access Standalone 5G. Capable device required; coverage not available in some areas. While 5G access won’t require a certain plan or feature, some uses/services might.

Google is making its smart displays more receptive to touch, and it appears the update may be part of a larger initiative to make these devices less reliant on voice interaction. According to a new video from Jan Boromeusz (via AndroidPolice), the same person that brought us an early look at the new smart display UI, Google is reportedly testing a presence detection feature for invoking the Assistant. If this feature goes live, users will no longer have to always say, “Hey Google” before uttering a command.
Presence detection will seemingly be made possible thanks to ultrasonic sensing features present in the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max. On Nest Hub displays, a high-frequency noise is sent through the speakers; the displays then listen for the noise to bounce back, detecting people up to five feet away.
Google has previously used presence sensing to tailor the interface on Smart Displays accordingly. If you’re farther away, elements on the screen, including alarms, timer, fonts, and other graphics, will get larger. Presence sensing features were initially rolled out to the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max at the end of last year.
A video demonstrating the new presence detection initiation for Google Assistant was uploaded to YouTube. Whenever the author approaches his Nest Hub Max, the Assistant pops up and wait for their command — all without using any of Assistant’s familiar hotwords. If no command is made, the Assistant will eventually go away.
As mentioned, a feature like this would make Google’s Smart Displays a little less reliant on voice. Instead of invoking Assistant manually, users can simply approach their Nest Hub. Combined with the new UI Google recently unveiled, Smart Displays are suddenly much more touch-friendly. That ultimately makes them more accessible, too.
Of course, adding more presence sensing features to Smart Displays does raise privacy concerns, but it’s worth noting that this feature isn’t live for everyone, and it may never see the light of day. The user who uploaded this feature somehow got their hands on internal firmware for the Nest Hub Max, with a settings page for several dogfood features. While this feature has yet to be introduced, you can always disable ultrasonic sensing on your Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max if it truly makes you uncomfortable.The Huawei P40, P40 Pro, and P40 Pro+ were launched in an online event last month. These are the latest flagships from Huawei, bringing along some very enticing hardware technologies to the average consumer. There are design changes on board, better displays, better cameras, and much more, giving users plenty of reason to be excited...Google this year has made some big changes to Assistant, Meet, and its suite of productivity apps. Now, at the company’s Search On event on Thursday, Google detailed several changes coming to some of its other major services, including Google Search, Google Lens, Google Maps, and Google Duplex.Google Search
Google said Search is making the biggest...Two New Amazon Fire TV Models Releasing Soon
The Amazon Fire TV is Amazon’s answer to Android TV boxes and the Google Chromecast. Capable of playing games, streaming content and showing off the Alexa virtual assistant, the device was certainly no slouch. It came in the exact same form as a standard TV box. Soon after the Amazon Fire TV, the Amazon Fire TV Stick came out, following the exact same form-factor as the Google Chromecast. As it was a small device which plugs into your HDMI port on your TV, it was a direct competitor to the Chromecast. Both devices had decent specs.
Now, according to a report from AFTVnews, Amazon is coming back within the next few months with two new Amazon Fire TV models. The first is just an upgraded Fire TV stick with better specs, but the actual TV box steals some ideas from the Amazon Echo line of products.
The Amazon Fire TV has similar technology to the Amazon Echo. With far-field microphones, speakers and an LED light bar, the device is effectively a TV box with Amazon Echo functionality built right in. There is also reportedly an IR output built in.
According to a leaked benchmark, the Fire TV Stick will come with 1.5GHz quad core CPU with a Mali 450 MP GPU. There will also allegedly be 2GB of RAM and 8GB internal storage. The Amazon Fire TV box looks a lot more premium, though no specs are released yet. The initial leak claims “that it essentially combines the functionality of a Fire TV, an Echo Dot, and an IR emitter”. The Amazon Echo Dot controls can be found on the top of the device.
The reporter claims we should see the Fire TV Stick announced sometime in this or next month, while the flagship TV box is to be announced at an unknown later date. Competitors are always good in an industry, and a real Chromecast or Android TV competitor could be exactly what is needed to improve both platforms. Check out the source of the news below!

And at first, I thought it was too. It seems like two phones just stuck together. The device may not seem all that interesting...Pentastic is a new Good Lock module to theme the Galaxy Note’s S Pen
Samsung’s Good Lock app offers a great set of first-party customization tools that lets you personalize almost every aspect of your Galaxy device. It packs in a ton of different modules with which you can customize everything from the lock screen to your device’s theme. And the best part is that the company keeps introducing new modules ever so often, which give you access to even more personalization options.
Earlier this year, the company updated Good Lock to support devices running One UI 2.0 based on Android 10, and shortly thereafter, the company updated the LockStar, Clockface, and NavStar modules to support the new software release. Since then, the company has rolled out new features for the One Hand Operations+ module and introduced the new Home Up module for One UI Home customizations. Now, just a few weeks after the Galaxy Note 20 launch, the company has released a new module called Pentastic for S Pen customizations.

— Max Weinbach (@MaxWinebach) September 3, 2020
The new Pentastic Good Lock module has started rolling out on the Samsung Galaxy Store, and it lets you theme the S Pen experience on your device. The module gives you the option to change the look of the Air Commands menu, choose a new on-screen pointer for the S Pen, play a different sound when you pull out the S Pen, and customize a Double tap shortcut.
The Pentastic module includes 4 Air Command menu choices, six pointer options, and six sound effects. It also has a custom option for the pointer and sound customizations, which will let you use a custom pointer and play any sound effect when you pull the S Pen out of the device. The Double tap shortcut option lets you launch an S Pen feature by double-tapping the pen on the display while holding the S Pen button or launch any app of your choice.
If you’re interested in trying out the new Pentastic Good Lock module on your Galaxy Note device, you can either download it from the Galaxy Store or sideload the APK from the APKMirror. The module works as intended on the new Galaxy Note 20 series and the Galaxy Note 10 series from last year. In case you have an older Galaxy Note device lying around, be sure to let us know if the module works on your device in the comments section below.

Huawei...New YouTube Update finally brings Promised Support for Mobile Live-Streaming, but it isn’t yet Active
A little over a week ago, the YouTube creator blog announced that content creators who have enabled the ability to live stream on their accounts would soon be able to run a stream straight from their mobile device. Initially, Google announced that only 5 of their YouTube partners would be able to use the feature. But now it appears that the promised support for livestreaming will indeed be rolling out soon to more users, if the latest YouTube 11.25.55 APK is any indication.

We’ll Do it Live! … Finally!
Our source for the imminent roll-out are strings within the latest YouTube APK indicating support for the feature.

While these strings would not constitute concrete evidence when tearing down other Google apps, we already know that Google will soon be offering this feature due to their official announcement. We can’t give an exact date on when the feature will actually be rolled out to all users, though, as the switch seems to be on the server-side. We could not find the actual button to begin a live stream anywhere within the latest YouTube APK on any of our test devices. Nevertheless, we do know what the button will look like when it does start showing up for all users, as indicated in the gallery_fragment.xml file inside the APK’s asset layout.

Miscellaneous Features Found in the Teardown
Besides the principle “go live” feature that we all knew was eventually coming to Youtube, there are a few additional features that may be coming in the near future according to some additional strings we found within the latest YouTube update. First up, we’re seeing some evidence that YouTube will allow you to retry saving offline videos that failed to save the first time you attempted to offload the content. This will likely be useful mostly to users who like to save large amounts of content for when they travel, only to see that something went wrong when they tried to save certain videos or playlists.

<string name="offline_retry_failed_videos_menu_item">Retry saving failed videos</string>
Finally, we’re seeing evidence that YouTube will soon provide additional playback options for videos. Currently, the only options available to users are Previous/Next, Play/Pause, and Close.
Soon, we may be seeing the ability to Stop and Retry playback of a video. More playback options are always welcome to satisfy everyone’s use cases, although the current offerings are more than enough for the majority of people.

Google recently updated Android Auto’s settings UI with a couple of new elements designed to simplify the connection process. The update added a new ‘Connect a car’ button, instructions to help users connect using a USB cable, and a button to connect wirelessly. Now, Google is rolling out another update for Android Auto with an interesting addition.
Android Auto v5.7.603944 doesn’t include any noteworthy user-facing changes. The update only brings some improvements for the Do Not Disturb functionality, optimizations for the Dark Mode, and a few bug fixes. But a teardown of the latest APK has unearthed strings of code that point towards an upcoming feature that will make Google Assistant on the app even more useful.

The strings suggest that Google is working on adding a shortcut to a Google Assistant command in Android Auto. Our Editor-in-Chief, Mishaal Rahman, has managed to enable the feature manually, and here’s what it looks like:
These screenshots show the setup process for adding a new shortcut for an Assistant Action in Android Auto. The feature will let you pick an Assistant command and Launcher icon label for the shortcut during the process. Once the shortcut is set up, you’ll be able to perform your custom Assistant Action from within the app.
It’s worth noting that although Mishaal was able to enable the onboarding process for the feature, he wasn’t able to get the feature to actually work. This suggests that the feature is currently in its early stages of development, and Google may flesh it out in an upcoming Android Auto update. As of now, we have no official information from Google regarding the feature or its release timeline.Forums are open for the Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite and Galaxy Note 10 Lite
Ahead of CES 2020 in Las Vegas next week, Samsung took the wraps off the Galaxy S10 Lite and the Galaxy Note 10 Lite. The timing of this launch and the mere existence of these two devices is a peculiarity, to say the least, but one thing is clear about the duo: They’re Samsung’s best bet to compete with value flagships from brands like Xiaomi and OnePlus. The Galaxy S10 Lite features a triple rear camera setup, a centered punch-hole 6.7-inch display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC, a 32-megapixel camera setup, and more. The Galaxy Note 10 Lite features similar dimensions but a smaller punch hole, a now 2-year-old Exynos 9810 processor, and an S-Pen.
These two smartphones are notably cheaper than the other devices in Samsung’s flagship line up. The Note 10 Lite starts at €599 while the S10 Lite starts at €649. If you can’t afford the full-fledged flagships in the S10 or Note 10 series, these two phones could be worth considering. If you get one, you might as well get started with modding it and tweaking it so it’s really your phone. To aid in that, we’ve opened forums for both the S10 Lite and the Note 10 Lite so you can find the latest on custom ROMs, rooting, modding, and more.
If you’re planning on getting one of these phones, then be sure to check out the forums now!
Galaxy Note 10 Lite XDA Forum | Galaxy S10 Lite XDA ForumHow OPPO’s ColorOS 11 Makes the Most out of the Mid-range F17 Pro
As flagship phone prices have started to climb well over $1,000, mid-range phones are looking more attractive than ever. As the world’s economy starts to head in a downward trend, more affordable phones are taking center-stage. In 2020 budget-friendly phones were some of the most sold phones on the market. Consumers are watching their wallets and want to get the best phone they can at a reasonable price. Now with the release of Android 11, OPPO aims to make the most of mid-range hardware, with the ColorOS 11 update.
As one of their more affordable phones in 2020, OPPO launched the OPPO F17 Pro. This phone ships with ColorOS 7.2 (Android 10) but will be one of the first OPPO devices available for the ColorOS 11 update in the future. For now, we are running the beta version of ColorOS 11 running on Android 11. In this article, we will take a look at this budget-friendly phone and see how ColorOS 11 makes this mid-range device both smooth and versatile.
|OPPO F17 Pro||Hardware Specifications|
|Display||6.43″ 1080 x 2400 pixels|
|Chipset||Mediatek Helio P95 (12 nm)|
|RAM||8GB|
|Storage||128GB|
|Main Camera||48+8+2+2MP|
|Selfie Camera||16+2MP|
|Battery||4015mAh|
|OS||ColorOS 7.2|
Improving Gameplay
When you’re working with a more moderate chipset like the Mediatek Helio P95, you want to make sure you are able to run your favorite games properly. In ColorOS 11 you can use the included Game Space feature to improve your gaming performance. The app is able to block notifications and reject calls to make sure your game goes uninterrupted. Furthermore, you’ll be able to monitor your CPU and GPU usage, as well as FPS rate. In PUBG, the live monitoring of this data will help you adjust your graphics settings to get the best performance possible.
Game Space comes with three different game modes. Low power mode will limit your phone performance in favor of battery life. Balanced mode is your standard options and Competition mode will max out your hardware for gaming priority. With these tools, even the phones with lower specs can adjust their settings for better gameplay.
The best way to play is with the new Immersive mode. This mode can be selected from the quick-access bubble for the game space. Blocking all notifications, calls, and alarms let me focus more on the game. The immersive mode can also lock navigation gestures and quick settings, preventing you from accidentally navigating away from your game.
Another fun feature that’s super helpful to the gamers is the Quick Return Bubble, which is a small floating bubble popping up on the screen. When you switch to other apps while gaming, the Quick Return Bubble displays key information (e.g. respawn count down or in-cabin time) as a floating bubble, and it allows you to switch back to gaming with one easy tap on the bubble.
Despite the fact that I’m running on mid-range hardware, I am able to have a smooth gaming experience on the OPPO F17 Pro. I was able to consistently get around 30FPS on many graphics-intensive games. This benefits from OPPO’s Hyper Boost technology, which pre-allocates more resources to the game when necessary. On average, this prevents game sluggishness and increases frame rate stability by 38%. Hyper Boost also tackled touch sensitivity, and came up with solutions for the fast power consumption and overheating during gaming.
UX Performance
When OPPO developed ColorOS 11, they made it a point to try to stick to a stock Android experience. Of course, you can find personalization settings throughout the system, but there are no heavy intrusive themes or bloatware slowing your phone down. Performance throughout the system is as good as you’d expect from a flagship ColorOS device.
System animations perform without issue on the OPPO F17 Pro – actually with the new OS, I feel F17 Pro is the smoothest mid-range device I’ve used in 2020. ColorOS 11 is optimized to run without lag on devices with fewer hardware resources. So even on the budget devices, ColorOS 11 will still perform well.
Battery Guard
When you’re buying a phone on a budget, the lifetime of the phone might be something very important to you. Smartphone batteries degrade over time and eventually, they are unable to hold a charge. One of the things that cause this is the overcharging of your phone. ColorOS 11 has a new feature called Battery Guard. This feature will let you toggle the “Optimized night charging” setting, which will make your phone begin to learn your daily routine. Your charging will then be optimized to charge slowly overnight and proceed to make sure you have a 100% charge by the time you wake up.
By using this feature, you’ll be protecting the health of your phone’s battery. Over time you’ll have a battery that degrades at a much slower rate. You’ll have a healthy and long-lasting battery with this improved charging method.
There’s a new Super Power Saving Mode on ColorOS 11, and once it’s turned on, the battery will begin to drain much slower. Even with this setting activated, you’ll still find yourself having a smooth performance.
Multitasking
When a phone has low-to-mid range specs, multitasking is an area that can suffer. So it’s up to OEMs to optimize their devices for proper RAM management. With the OPPO F17 Pro running ColorOS 11, I am able to leave the PUBG game menu frozen in the background, while I work on Google Docs, use Twitter, watch videos, and more. Afterward, I can go back to the game to find it’s still running and ready for a new match. Multitasking performance is done especially well for mid-range phones, and the credit should go to the operating system.
This is a great example of how an OEM can add useful features to their software without it coming in the form of bloated and intrusive apps. ColorOS 11 is currently going through beta testing on OPPO devices including the FindX2 Series, Reno3 Series, and more. For those early adopters, you can apply for the beta version. For those who are not so familiar with beta smartphone OS releases, I would suggest waiting until the stable version. From my point of view, the OPPO F17 Pro performs very well as a mid-range phone and takes full advantage of Android 11.

The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE grabbed plenty of positive headlines late last month for its $699 price tag while keeping a flagship-level screen and SoC. While we in the Android enthusiast space are keen to pit the Galaxy S20 FE against other recently-launched, similarly-priced Android rivals in the OnePlus 8T and the Google Pixel 5, in the real world — to average consumers — the biggest (and perhaps only?) challenger to the Galaxy S20 FE is the iPhone 12.
Apple’s device is $100 pricier, but it’s still considered a good deal in developed, high-spending markets such as North America, Western Europe, Japan, and Samsung’s home country of South Korea. I’ve been using both of these phones over the past few days, so let’s see how they stack up against each other.
Display
Both the iPhone 12 and Galaxy S20 FE have gorgeous, arguably best-in-class OLED panels. They both get about equally bright to my eyes and are perfectly fine to use even under harsh sunlight. And despite the fact that Samsung’s panel refreshes at twice the speed of the iPhone’s 60Hz panel, the actual real-world fluidity in UI isn’t as wide as one may think.
Chalk this up to Apple’s SoC, and a synergy between hardware and software that Android brands can’t match, or the touch panel response rate, but whatever the case, the iPhone still feels very smooth despite its “outdated” 60Hz panel. Sure, animations on the Galaxy S20 FE appear faster and zippier, but it’s hard to pick up the iPhone 12 and have much to complain about in terms of animations and UI fluidity. You can check out the video below to see me moving around both phones’ UI.
However, I’m still giving the win to the Galaxy S20 FE’s panel because it doesn’t have a giant notch. Apple fans can argue all they want about the benefits of Face ID — and I admit, logging into websites by just scanning my face feels damn cool — but the notch was unsightly and large in 2017 and even more so today.
Design and in-hand feel
The iPhone 12 is a glass sandwich phone, but not a typical one. Its display panel uses something Apple calls “Ceramic Glass,” meaning it’s a glass panel that has been infused with bits of ceramic, which Apple claims makes it 4x harder and shatter-resistant than last year’s iPhone panels. The Galaxy S20 FE uses Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3, which is not the best Corning has to offer. I haven’t dropped either phone (and don’t plan to), but on the spec sheet, it seems like the iPhone’s glass panel should be sturdier.
Around the back, it’s not even close: the iPhone 12 has a premium feeling matte glass panel while the Galaxy S20 FE has a plastic back. The chassis on both phones are made of aluminum, but you can feel it more on the iPhone because it is larger and flatter. On the Samsung device, you’re feeling mostly glass and plastic, as the aluminum railing is quite thin. However, despite the Galaxy S20 FE being larger, it “fits” into my palm more comfortably due to curved back whereas the iPhone 12 has a boxy design with sharp edges.
Camera – Photos
The Galaxy S20 FE is equipped with a triple camera system consisting of a 12MP, f/1.8 main camera, along with an 8MP telephoto zoom lens and a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera. The iPhone 12 has a dual-camera system featuring a 12MP, f/1.6 main camera, and a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera. The lack of a telephoto zoom lens means the Galaxy S20 FE wins in zoom shots, as can be seen in the Bruce Lee statue 3Xxsample shots below.
iPhone 12 at 1x vs Galaxy S20 FE at 1x; iPhone 12 at 3x vs Galaxy S20 FE at 3x
Generally speaking, both cameras are excellent with dynamic range and are very fast to focus. If lighting conditions are good, it really comes down to a matter of personal preference in terms of which phone has a better main camera.
iPhone 12 vs Galaxy S20 FE
With the ultra-wide, the iPhone 12 pulls ahead during the day with a generally sharper image and better dynamic range. But at night, I prefer Samsung’s cooler tones than the iPhone 12’s overly warm color science — at least when shooting Hong Kong buildings at night.
Camera – Video
Both phones can shoot video up to 4K/60fps, but the iPhone 12 can shoot in Dolby Vision, and it really shows in high contrast scenes or when I’m switching from a shaded indoor scene to outdoor under the sun. In the video below containing both front-facing and main camera video footage, notice the iPhone consistently exposes a bit better and has slightly better stabilization all around. The iPhone has been the smartphone video king by consensus and the iPhone 12 keeps the lead.
SoC and Overall Performance
It should be no surprise that Apple’s brand-new A14 Bionic is more capable than the seven-months-old Snapdragon 865 powering the Galaxy S20 FE. Benchmark scores are a lop-sided win for Apple, but really, in real-world performance scenarios such as launching apps or running basic apps, I don’t see much of a difference, as the Snapdragon 865 is still very, very powerful. However, for more intensive tasks like editing 4K video clips, the iPhone 12 consistently processes and loads faster. But since they run on different OSes and I’m editing videos using different apps, it’s an apples and oranges comparison.
Battery
The Galaxy S20 FE, despite having a faster refresh rate, seems to have better battery life. The 4,500 mAh battery of the Galaxy S20 FE has been consistently able to last me an entire 14-hour day, while the iPhone 12 did not make the full 14-hour day in two of the four days I’ve had with it so far. I need to do more testing, however, as I was using the iPhone 12 a bit more on those days it couldn’t hang.
Final thoughts
The Galaxy S20 FE has a better screen, more focal length versatility, and better battery life. The iPhone 12 meanwhile is better at capturing videos and has a better ultra-wide camera, along with a more premium build. Ultimately, there’s no point in declaring a winner here, since they run different eco-systems and each base has loyal fans that are firmly entrenched. Each of these phones will easily satisfy — it’s great the world’s two most prominent smartphone brands are giving us such great value at $800 or less.Unless you've been living under a rock, you're probably familiar with the LineageOS custom ROM.

Chinese OEM TCL unveiled the TCL 10 series earlier this year in April, featuring three new devices — the TCL 10L, TCL 10 Pro, and TCL 10 5G. At the time, the company had announced the pricing and availability details for the TCL 10L and TCL 10 Pro in the U.S., however, the company had said that the TCL 10 5G would be released in the U.S. at a later date. Almost five months down the line, it seems like TCL is finally ready to launch the TCL 10 5G in the U.S. as the device has been now been spotted in an FCC certification listing with the model number TCL T790S.
We can confirm that the recently certified device is the TCL 10 5G, as a device with the model number T790S is listed as a variant of the TCL 10 5G on the Bluetooth SIG website. The FCC listing also includes a diagram that further confirms that it’s the TCL 10 5G. In case you’re not familiar with the device, the TCL 10 5G is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G powered mid-range smartphone, which features a 6.53-inch FHD+ display with a hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera.
The device comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and it packs in a 4,500mAh battery with support for 18W fast charging. In the camera department, the TCL 10 5G features a quad-camera setup on the back, with a 64MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide sensor, a 5MP macro sensor, and a 2MP depth sensor. Over on the front, the device features a single 16MP selfie shooter. The smartphone runs TCL UI based on Android 10 out of the box and it’s priced at €399 in Europe.
Along with the diagram showcasing the TCL 10 5G’s design, the FCC listing includes an image that highlights its dimensions and the location of the mmWave antennas. The listing further reveals that the device will support 5G NR on bands n2, n5, and n66 (all sub-6GHz), along with n260 and n261 (mmWave). It’s also worth noting that since Verizon is the only major carrier in the U.S. still heavily marketing phones with mmWave on its network, we believe that the TCL 10 5G is headed to the carrier.

Sleek, slim and stylish with no added bulk
The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is here, and your shiny new $1300 investment needs protection. You don’t necessarily need the best protection, but just something to give it a bit of an extra grip in your hands. I don’t really like big, heavy cases, but I also wouldn’t use a phone without one, as I’ve definitely dropped a phone or two in my time. Some of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra thin cases shown below will offer the bare minimum in protection, while still looking good and without adding extra bulk!
Why put a thick case on a thin phone like the Galaxy Note 20? Keep those sleek curves and guard against scratches with this minimalist case from Ringke, which protects without being too bulky.
Otterbox is synonymous with tough. If you are looking for a case that protects with a hint of style, this is for you. This case is also available in black, clear, and light grey.
Slim-line and mighty fine!
When it comes to cases, you've probably heard of Spigen. The company has a lot of popular products, but the Liquid Air brings added grip and a beautiful symmetry and uniformity that really appeals to us.
Prop your phone up anywhere!
Being able to prop up your phone while you're out and about is one of the big selling points for this case. Others include raised screen and camera bezels to protect against scratches, and additional grip.
Instead of a thick case, show off your phone's natural beauty while keeping it protected with this beautiful Caseology Skyfall case, which is available in 3 colors. I've used one before and it's a fantastic case!
If all you want is a super-slim case, look no further. This won't provide you a lot of protection against drops, but your phone will still remain sleek. It's also available in gorgeous Red and Blue colors.
Another Spigen entry, the Spigen Ultra Hybrid offers good protection without compromising on the aesthetics of your device. Show off in style with this see-through protective case - without any of the bulk!
Want a case with some grip that matches the color of your phone perfectly? Look no further than Samsung's official silicone cover, which comes in Black, White and 'Brown', which is actually Pink in color.
DBrand is a trusted brand of cases and skins, and they have something most of the competitors don't--the ability to customize your case. DBrand offers a bunch of different colors for your case back, while still keeping your device slim.
This Torras case can prop up your phone while providing a simple plastic shell to keep your Note 20 Ultra safe. It also has a three year warranty, so if anything goes wrong you can replace the case for free.
The Crave cases have a unique advantage of being very colorful, and sometimes you just want something different looking. The Dual Guard Protection series has six colors available, is nice and slim, and even PowerShare compatible.
Wallet cases are so bulky, but you can still grab a thin case that can fit a couple cards in it from Spigen. If you like travelling light, this case will help you do it.
Out of the cases above, there should be something for everyone. Want to still see your new shiny device’s design? Definitely grab the Spigen Ultra Hybrid. Want something a little bit unique that you can use to prop your phone up? Grab that ESR Metal Kickstand case. If you just want to go with what Samsung has on offer, there’s nothing wrong with going with the Samsung Silicone Cover either.
There are so many options, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is a pretty big and heavy phone. Nobody wants a case adding even more bulk to what is already a really bulky phone!Amazon’s Silk Web Browser is Now Available for Select Fire TV Devices
Beaming an old webpage to your TV is harder than it looks, which is why it’s sometimes helpful to have a built-for-TV web browser at your disposal. Sure, it’s probably easier to pull up the troublesome website on your smartphone or tablet, but there’s no substitute for the big screen. That’s why Amazon brought Silk Web Browser, its in-house browser for Fire OS devices, to its Fire TV set-top box lineup this week.
Bing is the default search engine for the Silk Web Browser on the Fire TV, and it’s the first thing you see after you launch the application. (Luckily, you can change it to Yahoo! or Google’s homepage by digging through the settings menu.) Otherwise, the experience on is a dead ringer for the Silk Web Browser on Amazon’s Fire tablets, especially when it comes to playing videos — you get a full array of playback controls including play/pause, fast forward, and rewind, which map to the Fire TV remote’s physical buttons.
Silk Web Browser has been in the works for a while, it turns out. Evidence emerged in March of this year, when a few crafty folks discovered that you could sideload the tablet version of the Silk Web Browser onto Fire TV devices and it would work with the remote control. A few months later, an official beta version of the Silk Web Browser prematurely appeared in the Amazon Appstore.
Unfortunately, Amazon hasn’t made a lot of progress on compatibility in the interim. Silk Web Browser only supports the 1st and 2nd generation Fire TV, the 2nd generation Fire TV Stick, and all version of Element and Westinghouse’s Fire TV Edition televisions. The 3rd generation Fire TV is the odd one out, oddly, but it’s a safe bet that Amazon’s working on a fix.
Source: AFTVnewsAT&T’s sub-6GHz 5G network is now available across the U.S.
The major US carriers are duking it out to offer the best 5G networks, and AT&T is, of course, one of the main contenders. While their growing 5G network doesn’t boast the same throughput as Verizon’s Ultra Wideband mmWave 5G, AT&T’s sub-6GHz provides far better coverage. Today, the carrier announced they’ve reached a big milestone. The carrier’s sub-6GHz 5G network is now available nationwide.
Now, in the context of coverage, the FCC dictates that “nationwide” means more than 200 million people in the U.S. are blanketed in coverage. AT&T activated 40 new markets today, bringing the total number of covered people to 205 million (and 395 markets). So while not everyone in the country is truly covered, it’s enough for the company to say their 5G network is nationwide.
AT&T is still a bit behind T-Mobile’s 5G coverage both in terms of speed (especially after the latter’s acquisition of Sprint’s mid-band frequencies) and coverage. Both are a bit behind Verizon when it comes to speeds. AT&T and T-Mobile, however, are focusing on the mid- and low-band, while Verizon has the faster and more limited mmWave. Verizon currently doesn’t offer anything in the mid- to low-band spectrums, in contrast. Of course, all of this is somewhat of a moot point since the vast majority of people don’t have 5G-capable phones yet.

Source: AT&T | Via: EngadgetIn yet another example of why American consumers have such little faith in AT&T and Verizon Wireless, the two companies are being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice over whether they colluded to sabotage the eSIM standard. An embedded SIM, or eSIM, is a standardized SIM chip that allows users to switch between carriers without changing a SIM card. eSIMs are commonly found in smartwatches but have recently been added to a few smartphones such as the Google Pixel 2. The main benefit of eSIM technology is consumer freedom, which is exactly why certain telecommunication carriers have allegedly sought to block its adoption.
According to the NYTimes, AT&T and Verizon have been accused of working with the GSM Association (GSMA), the organization that is responsible for standardizing the technology used in the mobile telecommunications industry, to “establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology.” The development of such a standard would be antithetical to the benefits of an embedded SIM, and if passed, would effectively sabotage the technology which is poised to be the successor to the SIM card. The NYTimes report claims that the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the alleged collusion after an unnamed carrier and Apple filed a formal complaint.
Representatives from Verizon Wireless and AT&T acknowledged the inquiry by the Justice Department, with a Verizon spokesman telling the NYTimes that the issue was “much ado about nothing.” When reached for comment, the GSMA confirmed the development of the new eSIM standard that would allow for locking a device to a network. The GSMA has issued a statement in response to the story which announced that the organization has halted development of the eSIM standard until the ongoing investigation is completed.
The GSMA is a powerful standard-setting organization. The organization is responsible for creating the Universal Profile for Rich Communication Services (RCS), which is the underlying technology for the new ‘Chat‘ standard by Google. If the allegations against the two largest mobile carriers in the U.S. are true, then the future of eSIM technology may be in jeopardy. In a private meeting, Verizon is said to have called for the changes to the eSIM standard to “prevent theft and fraud.” In my view, if that truly was their reasoning, then there wouldn’t be a need to develop these changes to the eSIM standard in secret. Given the optics of such a change, however, it’s possible that the companies didn’t want to seem to be behind such changes even if it was for consumer protection. We’ll have to wait for the conclusion of the investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice before we pass judgment, though.

Another country is officially joining the shortlist of places that support Google’s Android Pay program. After the official announcement during Google I/O 2017, support for Android Pay in Canada is finally rolling out starting today. This confirms earlier rumors that stated Google would unveil Android Pay support on this exact day.
If you are an Android user in Canada, you can now download and install the application from the Play Store. At launch, BMO, CIBC, Banque Nationale, Scotiabank, Desjardins, President’s Choice Financial, ATB Financial, and Canadian Tire Financial Services will work with Android Pay on devices running Android KitKat 4.4 or higher. Google stated support for American Express cards and Tangerine will be coming soon. Similar to Apple Pay, the wireless wallet app uses the tokenized system to create a secure transaction for payments when an Android phone is tapped against an NFC-supported terminal. It’s a fast, reliable, and most importantly secure method of payment.
Android Pay was launched in September 2015 in the United States. Since then, Google rolled out the program to 10 other regions including New Zealand, U.K., Australia, Japan, Poland, and Hong Kong. In the next few months, we should see the program expanding to other areas such as Russia, Spain, Brazil, and Taiwan.
If you live in Canada and have an account with one of the listed banks, you can try Android Pay already by downloading the app from the Play Store link below. Please note that your device needs to be pass SafetyNet checks to make it work. If your device is rooted or has an unlocked bootloader, that means you’ll need to have Magisk and Magisk Hide enabled. Instructions for how to install these two modifications can be found here.

Back in December last year, Xiaomi’s sub-brand Redmi launched the Redmi K30 and K30 5G in China. Out of the two devices, the higher-end Redmi K30 5G featured a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G SoC, coupled with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. Building up on the design of its predecessor, the Redmi K30 5G featured a 6.67-inch FHD+ 120Hz refresh rate display with a dual-punch hole cutout for the front-facing cameras, a quad rear camera setup with Sony’s latest 64MP IMX 686 as the primary sensor, and a 4,500mAh battery. The device was released in four color variants at a starting price of CNY 1999 (~$284), making it one of the most affordable 5G devices in the market at the time. While Xiaomi is yet to release the Redmi K30 internationally, we’ve now opened up our forums for the device for discussions and development once it’s launched.
Along with the Redmi K30 5G, we’ve also opened up our forums for the upcoming POCO X2 which is scheduled to launch in India early next month. The device is also expected to feature a high refresh rate 120Hz display, liquid cooling technology, and Sony’s IMX 686 sensor. We have reason to believe that the POCO X2 is nothing but a rebranded Redmi K30 4G. And if that’s the case, the device will most likely feature a Snapdragon 730G SoC, coupled with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Much like the Redmi K30 5G, the POCO X2 will also feature a 4,5000mAh battery with support for 27-watt fast charging. If you’re planning on getting one of these devices, then be sure to check out our forums right away!

It’s Bad News Wednesday for developers and power users alike. A pleasant day was punctured by several reports coming in that a new update to Android’s SafetyNet not only caused existing su hiding mechanisms to stop working (normal case scenario), but also started giving adverse results on devices which were not even rooted!
Initiating from Reddit’s Nexus 6P forums, and then being echoed around at several places including the Reddit Android forums, our own Nexus 6P forums and threads for suhide and Magisk, users are finding that the latest update to SafetyNet is causing devices to fail checks if they have an unlocked bootloader. Users have tried out different combinations of modification scenarios and masking methods, but the common factor for failure in most cases boils down to the bootloader being unlocked.
Unlocking the bootloader is the first step for unofficial modifications for most devices. If the latest SafetyNet update does indeed check for the bootloader status, this might mean the end of the days where one could run Android Pay and other SafetyNet based apps in conjunction with root and Xposed by employing masking techniques.
Magisk developer topjohnwu commented on the early situation, pointing that SafetyNet might be a lost cause after this update:
“Keep in mind, in the latest update of Safety Net that just happened in a few hours, Google seems to step up the game, and it might got to the point that no modifications are allowed, and might be impossible to bypass.
Currently on my HTC 10, no matter what I did to the boot image, even just a repack of 100% stock boot image, Safety Net will not pass under any circumstances. On the other hand, my Nexus 9 running stock Nougat seems bypass without issues, with root and modules all enabled and working fine. The boot verification might vary from one OEM to another, HTC’s implementation might just be one of the first included into Safety Net, but eventually all major OEMs’ method will be included, and at that time I think any Android “mod”, including custom kernels, will pretty much break Safety Net. These verification should be coded deep into the bootloader, which is not that easy to crack. So the conclusion is that I will not spend that much time bypassing Safety Net in the future.”
Back when suhide was released, Chainfire had predicted something along the same lines:
Ultimately, information will be provided and verified by bootloaders/TrustZone/SecureBoot/TIMA/TEE/TPM etc. (Samsung is already doing this with their KNOX/TIMA solutions). Parts of the device we cannot easily reach or patch, and thus there will come a time when these detection bypasses may no longer [be] viable.
Since the situation is still developing, things might be more complex than what they appear on the surface. We will keep our readers posted if there are new developments on the matter.Google Assistant smart displays are getting a brand new UI with dark mode and multi-account support
Several years ago, it used to be that Google software could only, or mostly, be found on your PC or on your smartphone. Fast forward to 2020, though, and you can have Google help you out on almost every corner of your house. Whether it’s a smart speaker or a smart display, you can just ask the Google Assistant for answers to your burning questions wherever you are. Smart displays are a really interesting case as they serve as hubs that connect your whole home, and you don’t need to necessarily use them with your voice. They also allow for light media consumption as well as video calls.
Google offers its own self-branded Assistant smart displays in the form of the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max, though there are other Assistant-enabled smart displays from other brands. Starting today, Google is introducing a new, more interactive UI to these Assistant-powered smart displays. In an official blog post, Google detailed this new “visual experience” rolling out to smart displays, though we already caught a glimpse of the new design a few weeks back.
The new UI is touch-centric, with tabs and contextual panels as well as a central “Your Morning” home screen that sums up relevant information about your day, such as the weather, calendar events, and frequently used smart home shortcuts. There’s a “Media” tab that will give you suggestions for new movies and shows to watch from services like Disney+ and Netflix. The “Home control” page lets you control any Assistant-enabled smart home devices you’ve added to your account.
On the “Communicate” page, you’ll be able to start a meeting, call a contact, or broadcast to another Assistant device. Speaking of meetings, Zoom is coming to these smart displays, giving you more options to communicate with friends, co-workers, and acquaintances. Google Meet on the Nest Hub Max will automatically keep you in-frame, and on other smart displays, you’ll be able to pin specific persons, change to a four-person grid, cancel and reschedule meetings, send messages, and later this year, pinch-and-zoom.
The new “Your evening” page (available with the redesign) and Sunrise alarm (coming soon) help you get to bed with relaxing sounds and calming visuals. Lastly, you can check out the “Discover” page to learn more about the features of your smart display.
Next, Google Assistant smart displays are gaining a dark mode with this redesign, a feature that has already rolled out to Android on smartphones and other Google products and services. The classic Light theme will still be there, but there will also be an “automatic” setting that will let the display adjust the screen naturally based on the ambient light or sun cycle. Last but not least, there’s multi-account support for having a more personalized experience for all users. This is especially helpful if you have a separate personal and work account, so you can access your calendar details without switching profiles. Google says multi-account support is available on all Assistant-enabled devices, including your phone, smart speakers, and now smart displays.
This update is expected to make it to most Google Assistant smart displays in the coming weeks, though you’ll likely see it first on the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max.Google on Wednesday published a blog post all about security, reminding users that it takes precautions, like Safe Browsing, to keep people safe everyday. The company also took an opportunity to announce some new privacy features, including a “Guest mode” for Google Assistant that's set to arrive in the coming weeks.

The Sony Xperia XZ2‘s theme engine was one of the best available on Android phones. As part of stock on Marshmallow or Nougat on older Xperia devices, you could theme nearly everything. When the Android Oreo update came, though, many of these older devices lost their theming abilities. Only the wallpapers, accent, and home launcher were able to be themed. That’s in comparison to what was previously possible, which was basically the full SystemUI. However, on the Sony Xperia XZ2, Sony brought back this complete theming functionality. Thanks to XDA Recognised Developer/Themer niaboc79, you can now re-activate this lost functionality on older Xperia devices.
The install instructions are different per device, but you can check out the XDA thread below to see if it’s supported by your device. Go check it out!
Download the Sony Xperia XZ2’s Theme EngineAndroid Pay Prepares to Show a Map of Nearby Locations that Accept Payments
Android Pay version 1.4 is now rolling out to all compatible devices on the Google Play Store and in the official changelog there’s very little information about what’s been changed apart from additional translations. While it’s nice that Google is able to tell you in a dozen more languages that Android Pay won’t work for you in certain countries, what we’re all really hoping for are new features.
Thankfully, Google has left some hints within the APK file of the latest update that point towards a new feature that will use your current location and pull up a map activity to show you nearby stores that accept Android Pay. Though Android Pay still has a long way to go before it will replace your physical cards, it’s nice to quickly pull up a map of the closest places you can try out Android Pay in case you want to cash in on the next promotion they run (when in doubt there’s always a Subway or Starbucks you can fall back on).
The Evidence
Within every APK file there are a list of strings that define all of the possible text messages that can be shown to the user on the screen. Whether or not you can access the proper menu to see these strings depends on whether or not the feature has been activated within the actual code that makes up the app. But the mere existence of the string, coupled with a few other files that are new to the Android Pay app, point towards the existence of this new feature.
<string name="nearby_merchants_empty_message">Can’t find any stores near you that accept Android Pay</string>
<string name="nearby_merchants_feature_highlight_body">Tap the icon to see nearby stores that accept Android Pay</string>
<string name="nearby_merchants_feature_highlight_header">Find stores near you</string>
<string name="nearby_merchants_network_error">Couldn’t connect to the network</string>
<string name="nearby_merchants_permission_error">Android Pay can’t access your location</string>
<string name="nearby_merchants_permission_missing">Android Pay requires access to your location in order to show nearby shops. You can enable the Location permission in: Settings -> Apps -> Android Pay -> Permissions.</string>
<string name="nearby_merchants_permission_rationale">To show stores near you, Android Pay needs to access your location</string>
<string name="nearby_merchants_retry">Retry</string>
<string name="nearby_merchants_title">Nearby stores</string>
<string name="nearby_merchants_unexpected_error">An error occurred</string>
First up, the strings themselves. Android Pay will soon display an icon that you can tap that will bring up the option to show you nearby stores that accept Android Pay. This new feature will require enabling the location permission (obviously) so it can show you a map of nearby Android Pay-accepting-locations. We’ve installed the app ourselves but we haven’t been able to find the icon to enable the feature, however, after further digging into the APK file we’ve found what the icon will look like.
This icon will show up in the cards menu of the app (ie. three-dot overflow menu). It will be at the top of the list, so you’re bound to notice it when the feature goes live.
We also found a nearby_merchants_activity layout file that points to the fact that a maps activity may be called when the icon is clicked, and if it’s anything like other Google services it will probably just pull up a custom Google maps activity that is set to only display those stores in its database that are known to accept Android Pay. We’ll have to wait and see when and if this feature rolls out, but it’s definitely a small step forward in getting people to at least try out Android Pay once.The LG V50 ThinQ is the company's first 5G phone and it launched last month on Sprint and EE in the UK.

Samsung has a history leaking its own products through app updates. This time, the upcoming U.S. launch of the Samsung Galaxy A50 is being hinted at through an update for the Samsung Pay app. The update notes for the app’s listing on the Google Play Store states that Samsung Pay now supports the “A50 US” which we presume to mean the U.S. Samsung Galaxy A50 – a smartphone that has yet to launch.
We’ve heard rumors that the Samsung Galaxy A50 will launch in the U.S. In fact, the presumed U.S. models for the Samsung Galaxy A20, A50, and A70 have all been certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance, and the U.S. Galaxy A50 has already been certified by the FCC. While the Samsung Pay app’s changelog doesn’t tell us if the device will launch on all 4 U.S. carriers, notable leaker Evan Blass says that it will. (Evan’s Twitter account is now private.) He shared a render of the device which shows the date June 21st, so that’s the likely U.S. launch date.

Along with the new devices, Huawei also announced a slightly upgraded version of its custom Android 10-based skin, called EMUI 10.1, at the event. Shortly thereafter, the company shared...[Update: Added in Q Beta 3] Android Q will give carriers more ways to SIM lock phones
It has been just a week since we put out an exclusive on the early build of Android Q. According to the build we’ve got, the latest iteration of the operating system includes some long-awaited features like system-wide proper dark mode, revamped and more detailed permissions controls, and more. But, every version of Android includes a feature nobody asked for. This time, it is much more serious than unwanted navigation gestures from Android Pie or the stark white interface from Android Oreo. Apparently, Google is going to let carriers use easier methods to SIM lock the devices.
9to5Google noticed four commits on the Android Open Source Project Gerrit about the changes. All of the commits are called “Carrier restriction enhancements for Android Q”. 9to5Google reports that after looking at the sources, they could verify that Android Q will let carriers include a blacklist and whitelist of carriers. Starting from the soon-to-be-released version of Android, carriers will also be able to restrict the dual-SIM functionality of the device. They will be able to completely lock out the second SIM slot unless there is a verified (added in the whitelist by the carrier) SIM card in the first one.
I think this is the time to officially start recommending unlocked phones over the carrier-locked ones. True, they have good plans which sometimes sound too good to be true, but I think one shouldn’t sacrifice bootloader, SIM slot, update speed, network reliability, hotspot capabilities, and many other features for just saving a buck. All these ‘restriction enhancements’ will definitely make it harder for developers to provide custom ROMs, kernels, and other kinds of mods for certain devices. As you know, unlocking the bootloader is mostly in connection to a SIM lock.
Android Q is still in the early days of development, so it’s possible these features won’t be present in the final build. We will keep an eye on things. Via: 9to5Google Source: AOSP Gerrit
Update 1: Added in Q Beta 3
New fields added in the TelephonyManager class, especially “MULTISIM_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_CARRIER,” confirm that Android supports carrier restrictions on multi SIM devices. The description for the aforementioned integer field states:
The usage of multiple SIM cards at the same time to register on the network (e.g. Dual Standby or Dual Active) is supported by the hardware, but restricted by the carrier.
We’ll have to wait and see if this increases the frequency of multi SIM devices locked by carriers. Most devices sold in the US have a single SIM, so this could be a way for dual SIM devices to be sold by carriers while retaining control.About a month or so ago, XDA Forum Member biktor_gj posted an entire unlock and NAND access method for the Nokia Lumia 800 and 710 series of devices, which are the next of kin in Nokia's entry into the world of smartphones (being hand held by Microsoft themselves). The complete unlock was accomplished thanks to the collaboration of...Hangouts Meet, the video/audio-calling service that Google launched in March, has finally gained support for in-call messaging.

Here’s why that happens.
Have you noticed that the volume dialog that appears when you press the volume buttons takes a bit too long to disappear on its own? When you first got your Android phone, the volume dialog would automatically dismiss after a few seconds without your intervention. Then, sometime in the past few days, weeks, or months, it would take a long time to go away unless you tapped on your screen. If you’re experiencing this problem and it infuriates you, you’re not alone.
In this article, we’re going to explain what’s going on and why it happens so you can either fix the problem yourself or send this article to a developer so they can get it fixed. Let’s first describe exactly what the problem is so it’s clear we’re referring to the same problem you’re facing.
The Problem
You press the volume button on your Android smartphone or tablet to change the volume, but the volume dialog that appears takes a long time to go away on its own unless you tap on the screen to make it disappear. How long does the volume dialog stay up on its own? Exactly 20 seconds.

A popular thread over on Reddit’s /r/GooglePixel subreddit had many users chiming in that they were facing this problem. However, not everyone was having this problem. Some users stated that their volume dialogs remained on screen for only 3 seconds, which is the normal behavior. So what was causing this issue? For most users in that thread, it turns out the reason was an app called Signal Spy – though some users in that thread said that other apps were causing this behavior too.
Signal Spy is an app that’s popular among subscribers to Google’s Project Fi service. Project Fi users love the app because it supports analyzing your current network connectivity and supports automatic switching between Sprint and T-Mobile. The best part? It doesn’t need root access to switch between the networks. Signal Spy uses an Accessibility Service (a service that uses Android’s Accessibility APIs which are normally used for assisting users with disabilities but are also used in hundreds of regular apps) to automatically switch between carriers by inputting dialer code shortcuts.
Signal Spy’s ability to automatically switch between carriers on Project Fi is incredibly useful, but it’s also the reason Android’s volume dialog issue is happening. The one commonality between Signal Spy and the other apps like LastPass, Fingerprint Gestures, Zoho Vault, Amazon Assistant, and other apps which cause this problem to occur is that they use an Accessibility Service. Going to Settings –> Accessibility and turning off each Accessibility Service one-by-one is one way to solve this problem. Why, then, do only some apps’ Accessibility Services cause this issue to happen? Tasker, for instance, does not face this issue and neither does our very own Navigation Gestures app. You and many others on the Google Issue Tracker may think it’s a bug, but it’s actually not – it’s entirely by design.
The Explanation
As we discovered during development of the Navigation Gestures app, the problem arises when an Accessibility Service has the accessibilityFeedbackType set to anything other than FEEDBACK_GENERIC. When we set our Accessibility Service to use FEEDBACK_HAPTIC, the volume dialog would stay on-screen for 20 seconds. When we set it to FEEDBACK_GENERIC, the volume dialog stays on-screen for 3 seconds.
The reason this occurs is because of two methods in the volume dialog implementation in AOSP. The first method called computeFeedbackEnabled checks to see if there are any enabled Accessibility Services that are “non-generic.” If true, then the boolean mFeedbackEnabled is set to true. In the second method, computeTimeoutH, if mFeedbackEnabled returns true then the volume dialog’s timeout is set to 20 seconds, otherwise it is set to 3 seconds.
These methods were added in the Android 6.0 Marshmallow release and thus this volume dialog issue affects all Android releases since Android Marshmallow including Android Nougat, Android Oreo, and Android Pie. We’re not entirely sure why these methods were added as the commit descriptions weren’t clear. If I had to hazard a guess as to why this behavior exists, I would say that it’s to help users with certain disabilities handle the volume dialog with voice or other inputs because the default 3-second timeout is too short for them. If Android detects a user is using an Accessibility Service of a certain type, it automatically extends the volume dialog’s stay so the user has a better chance of interacting with it. Regardless, it’s clear that this issue is not a bug but is rather entirely by design. Unfortunately, that means there’s no “fix” for the issue outside of either persuading Google to alter this decision or convince app developers to not use non-generic feedback types in their Accessibility Services.
The developers of Signal Spy have already confirmed that they have fixed the issue in their next beta release, so if you experience the issue and want to see if fixed, you should point app developers towards this article so they’re aware of the problem (as many are not aware.) If a future version of Android changes this behavior, we’ll let you all know. At least you’re now aware of this issue and what causes it, so you figure out which apps are causing this issue for you.Huawei is among the leading pioneers of smartphone photography and it has proved this time and again with its P Series. Despite the hurdles due to the executive order passed by the U.S. President last year, Huawei has been launching new flagship phones, although in select markets.

5G connectivity is finally seeing mainstream adoption in 2020 as more and more smartphones and mobile SoCs add support for the next generation of telecommunications technology. The push for 5G has been very widespread in recent months, although some key markets may not have consumer 5G ready until next year. Nonetheless, that hasn’t stopped chip makers from pushing the envelope forward with bringing 5G down to lower tiers. Now, Qualcomm has announced its plans to bring 5G to even wider segments of users, promising new Snapdragon 4-series chips with 5G support in early 2021.
Today’s announcement from Qualcomm is bereft of a fair few details. While we can expect the modem to be integrated like on Qualcomm’s current 7 and 6-series 5G chips, we don’t know the supported bands, the theoretical download and upload speeds, the sub-6GHz bandwidth, and whether or not the modem will support mmWave 5G and/or standalone (SA) 5G. There are also other specs and features to be aware of, such as whether or not the chipset supports Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS), 5G dual SIM dual standby (DSDS), and Qualcomm’s proprietary 5G PowerSave, Smart Transmit, Wideband Envelope Tracking, and Signal Boost adaptive antenna tuning technologies. Whatever they do announce, though, heralds hope for a wider proliferation of 5G. Qualcomm’s promise of 5G connectivity support on its upcoming Snapdragon 4-series chips will bring 5G support to budget and lower mid-range smartphones across the globe.
“Qualcomm continues to pave the way for 5G commercialization at scale, and the expansion of 5G into our Snapdragon 4-series is expected to address regions that currently have approximately 3.5 billion smartphone users combined. The Snapdragon 4-series 5G Mobile Platform is designed to exceed expectations for the mass-market segment by bringing an assortment of predominately high- and mid-tier features to a broader audience. It will deliver on the promise of making 5G accessible to all smartphone users.”
Qualcomm’s current 5G-capable chipsets include the Snapdragon 855, 855 Plus, 865, 865 Plus, 765, 765G, 768G, and 690, with the 765, 765G, 768G, and 690 featuring integrated 5G modems. As is made apparent, there is a lack of 5G-capable chipsets on the lower end of Qualcomm’s chip portfolio. Qualcomm mentions that the expansion of 5G support to the Snapdragon 4-series will address regions where budget smartphones dominate, which includes approximately 3.5 billion users across the world. Not everyone may be ready to jump aboard right when new phones with the SoC arrive, but this would certainly shape the forthcoming months and years of smartphone evolution.
Smartphones with the 5G Snapdragon 4-series are expected to arrive from OPPO, Motorola, and Xiaomi, but we suspect many other OEMs to also jump on board sooner or later. The first batch of smartphones with the 5G Snapdragon 4-series is expected to arrive in Q1 2021.Google Play Store gets one-tap buttons to unsubscribe from betas, clear wishlists, and more
The Google Play Store, amongst all its features, allows developers to roll out multiple release channels for the same app. Users can easily opt into an app’s beta program and start testing unreleased versions of an app without much more hassle. There is also a number of other features you can easily opt-in to, such as adding apps to your wishlist, pre-registering for unreleased apps, and so on. But a very pesky thing about these opt-in features is how, if you want to opt-out of them, you would have to go the extra mile and remove them one by one, which sounds like a complicated and annoying task.
Well, luckily for you, you don’t have to do this anymore. As of the latest version of the Google Play Store, the app has added a new “Google Play preferences” section in the app’s Settings. This gives you four new buttons which will allow you to leave every beta program you’ve ever joined, wipe your wishlist clean, and unregister for both upcoming events and unreleased, upcoming apps you’ve pre-registered for. A reset button of sorts if you might call it like that. Whether there is a beta app bothering you or you just don’t want to receive any notifications, there are lots of scenarios where this may come in handy. As we said before, the functionality for opting out of these lists on a per-app basis has always existed, but it’s nice to have global buttons to clear these lists completely.
As the Google Play Store receives a massive overhaul of both the way the app looks and feels, features like these being introduced make perfect sense and are pretty useful for users. If you want to check it out, be sure to have the latest version of the Google Play Store installed—the Play Store updates by itself, so you don’t have to do much other than waiting.

With the T-Mobile/Sprint merger being finalized earlier this month, T-Mobile announced a number of updates for customers of both carriers. These updates are not part of the long-term plans that T-Mobile laid out, but they do offer some nice benefits for Sprint customers right away. However, it’s not all good news as some Sprint customers will be losing 5G access.
Part of the announcement from yesterday was Sprint Galaxy S20 5G owners gaining access to T-Mobile’s sub-6GHz (600MHz) low-band 5G network. The Galaxy S20 5G is not Sprint’s only 5G phone, though. What about the rest of the lineup? Unfortunately, the older Sprint 5G phones will not get access to T-Mobile’s 5G network and they will eventually lose Sprint 5G as well.
The devices that will be impacted by this are the OnePlus 7 Pro, LG V50, and Galaxy S10. T-Mobile is reframing Sprint’s existing 5G network, which will eventually shut it down. Since those devices lack the necessary hardware to connect to T-Mobile’s sub-6GHz low-band 5G network, they will be out of luck. Sprint’s 5G network is currently in ten markets across the US, including New York City, which will be turned off shortly before the redeployed network goes live.
The older 5G devices will still have access to Sprint’s 4G LTE network, of course. And along with yesterday’s news, they will be able to roam on T-Mobile’s 4G LTE network. T-Mobile will be alerting Sprint customers who own these devices about this upcoming change. They will be offering those users a number of incentives to get them on the Galaxy S20 5G.

When it comes to Android tablets, Samsung is one of the only OEMs that make flagship tablets that can compete with Apple’s iPads. The Galaxy Tab S6 from last year was among the best tablets team Android had on offer and it seems like Samsung plans on setting the bar even higher this year. We already know from previous leaks that Samsung might offer a larger 12.4-inch tablet this year, alongside an 11-inch model. The tablets are expected to feature the latest hardware, faster charging, Android 10, and predictably 5G support. While Samsung has still not released any official information about the upcoming tablets, we now know that they will be launched under the Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+ moniker.
The latest information about Samsung’s upcoming flagship tablets comes from a Bluetooth SIG listing that mentions the marketing name Galaxy Tab S7+ along with the model number SM-T976B. The model number falls in line with the aforementioned leaks, which suggested that the Galaxy Tab S7 and Galaxy Tab S7+ will go by the model numbers SM-T97x and SM-T87x. Other than that, the listing reveals that the Galaxy Tab S7+ will include support for Bluetooth 5.0.
While we currently have no further information about the exact hardware specifications of the Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+, we can safely assume that they will feature Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 865 SoC. Our resident Samsung tipster Max Weinbach suggests that the tablets will feature 5G support, but he wasn’t sure if Samsung will offer a 4G-only variant. We also expect Samsung to bring improvements in the camera department, support for faster charging, and higher RAM/storage variants in the upcoming flagship tablets.

Privacy and security are two of the biggest concerns when it comes to using the internet. With so many people looking to Chrome for their web browsing needs, Google is constantly making tweaks to make the internet safer and more secure. The company has announced several new privacy and security features that will be included in Google Chrome 83.
First up, Chrome will be rolling out redesigned privacy controls. The goal of the redesign is to make the controls easier to find and understand. Users can choose if and how cookies are used by websites, including the ability to block third-party cookies (even in Incognito mode) or block cookies entirely on some or all websites.
Controls in Site Settings have been reorganized into two sections for easier access. One section is for website permissions, including location, camera, microphone, and notifications. The second section is new and it shows the most recent permissions activity. At the top of the Chrome settings, users will now see “You and Google,” which is where the sync controls have been moved. Deleting browsing data has been moved to the top of the Privacy & Security section.
The next new feature is called “Safety Check.” This new tool will tell users if their passwords have been compromised and how to fix them. It will warn users before visiting a dangerous site or downloading a harmful app or extension if Safe Browsing is turned off. There’s also a new way to quickly see if Chrome is up to date with the latest security patches, and it can tell users how to remove malicious extensions.
In addition to never saving browsing history, information entered in forms, and deleting cookies every time you close the window, Incognito mode will start blocking third-party cookies by default. Each Incognito session will include a new control at the top of the New Page tab. Users can choose to allow third-party cookies for specific sites.
Google is adding a new puzzle piece icon to the Chrome toolbar for extensions. Clicking the icon will show you what data extensions can access on the current website. Lastly, there are two new security features that users can opt-in to. “Enhanced Safe Browsing” gives you more proactive and tailored protection from phishing, malware, and other web-based threats. If enabled, Chrome proactively checks whether pages and downloads are dangerous by sending information about them to Google Safe Browsing.
The next feature is Secure DNS, which can improve your security and privacy while browsing the web. “When you access a website, your browser first needs to determine which server is hosting it, using a step known as a ‘DNS (Domain Name System) lookup.’ Chrome’s Secure DNS feature uses DNS-over-HTTPS to encrypt this step. Chrome will upgrade users to DNS-over-HTTPS if their current DNS provider supports it.
Look for all of these features in Chrome 83 in the upcoming weeks.I rooted my US Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and here’s what I’m doing with it
This is XDA Developers and, contrary to popular belief, we do actually talk about a lot of stuff concerning development. This article is a little different from the more news or tutorial-related content. In this, I talk about my opinions on root and its utility in 2020 and show you my rooted Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. There might also be a link at the bottom pointing to instructions on how to root your own US Galaxy if you want, but you have to promise to read the entire article. Promise? Pinkie-swear? OK, good.
History
Back in 2018, I bought the Galaxy Note 9. But not just any Galaxy Note 9. I imported the Exynos variant through eBay. Why would I do something like that? For two main reasons. The US colors were kind of boring. I really wanted the copper color. The US variants also couldn’t be bootloader unlocked, and I like having root access. Bonus benefit: it was significantly cheaper than the US variants at that point.
I’ve got T-Mobile, so having an international Samsung phone wasn’t terrible. The band support wasn’t complete (no LTE Band 71), but WiFi calling and VoLTE worked fine. And I had root, so that was a worthy trade-off for me. The major issues were the underpowered and inefficient Exynos processor and the lack of an included warranty.
Fast forward to 2020, and things are a little different. T-Mobile’s LTE Band 71 is a lot more prominent in my area than it was in 2018, which means a compatible phone will get better coverage. Band support is also much more fragmented in the international Galaxy phones, thanks to the mess that is 5G. And it’s just not as easy to import an international Galaxy as it was in 2018, and the units available are usually more expensive than the US variants, which tips the scales.
Finally, I had a Note 9 to trade-in. Samsung was (and still is) offering a $550 trade-in value for the Note 9. That’s a lot of value. A random eBay seller wasn’t going to give me $550 off a Samsung phone if I sent them my Note 9, and selling it on Swappa to a prudent buyer wouldn’t have fetched this much.
I’m a big fan of the Galaxy Note lineup. I like having access to a proper active stylus when I need it, even if I don’t need it that often. So, of course, I wanted to get the Galaxy Note 20. The base variant may “only” be a $1000, but for all the compromises it makes, it just wasn’t worth it. So I got the Note 20 Ultra. Using that $550 trade-in, the ~7% student discount, and a 5% referral bonus, I got my purchase down to $700. And since I pre-ordered my unit, I also got $150-worth of accessories for free. I saved $600 on the phone and an “extra” $150 off some useful gadgets.
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Review: For Those Ahead of the Curve
Now, you may have a different opinion on this, but for me, having root really just wasn’t worth all the trade-offs this year. So now I have the US Unlocked Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (in Mystic Bronze, of course).
But I do have root! Why do I have root? How do I have root? You’ll have to keep reading to find out.
Why I like Root
First off, maybe I should explain a little bit about why I like having root access.
The first reason is convenience. I’m an app developer, and I make some pretty low-level apps for Android. A lot of them require special permissions that can only be granted through ADB…. or with root! It’s a lot quicker to just tap a “GRANT” button in the app than it is to plug into my computer, open a command prompt, and manually type out the ADB commands. It might not be worth the hassle if you need to do this a few times in a month, but any increase in frequency beyond this makes root a worthy step.
Secondly: theming. I know on Samsung devices, it’s possible to install custom themes without root using tools like Synergy. But it’s still a hassle. There are a lot of limitations, and a lot of steps, to install themes. If you’re theming third-party apps that get frequent updates, it just gets worse.
Theming with root is as simple as pressing a button and rebooting. I use my own app, OneUI Tuner, to work around a whole bunch of One UI’s annoyances, like adding more tiles to the quick settings header, or enabling clock seconds. I also use Swift Installer to make my notification shade transparent and give my apps a more unified look. That’s all possible without root, but it’s much more of a hassle.
Thirdly, I like to tinker. Root gives me access to the entire filesystem. I can use MiXplorer to poke around the various partitions and folders to maybe find something interesting. I can also use apps like Root Activity Launcher to open hidden or restricted Activities in installed apps.
The fourth reason is DSUs. Android 10 has a neat feature where, on bootloader-unlocked devices, you can temporarily load and boot a GSI. It’s an easy way to test out Android 11 without having to deal with clearing data or reinstalling a firmware. On Android 11, this likely won’t be necessary anymore, but I’m not on Android 11. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work out-of-the-box on the Note 20 Ultra. It installs but fails to boot. I’m sure it’s possible with some kernel modifications, but that’s not my area of expertise.
Yet another reason is ad-blocking. Sure, there are plenty of non-root ad blockers like DNS66 or NextDNS, but in my experience, none of them work nearly as well as root solutions like AdAway. The non-root apps constantly let through ads in Chrome and other apps, while AdAway’s method of overriding the system’s hosts file works perfectly. This method also has the advantage of not using any extra battery life.
Finally, it’s my phone! I want to be able to use it on my terms. After three years, I might flash an AOSP-based ROM, or a One UI port from a later device. Or I might not. That should be up to me, not Samsung.
Why others like Root
Now, it’s possible that my reasons for rooting and unlocking aren’t nearly as compelling to you as they are to me. And that’s completely fair. But these aren’t the only reasons to do so, and I’m not the only one to have gone through this process. Here are some reasons provided by the other people who’ve rooted their US Galaxy devices.
- Better audio tuning, for example with Viper4Android. – @mentalmuso
- Proper app debloating, where
pm disable just isn’t enough. – @mentalmuso, @perennialexhaustion
- Privacy features, like freezing or removing untrustworthy apps, and blocking intrusive services. – @perennialexhaustion
- Using custom kernels for better performance or battery life. – @klabit87
- Installing native Linux tools such as
iptables to make terminal-usage more powerful. – @perennialexhaustion
And here are some reasons I’ve come up with that aren’t particularly compelling to me, but are quite popular in the root space.
- Wireless ADB. Yes, I know this is native on Android 11, and you can enable it through wired ADB, but I’m on Android 10, and using wired ADB to enable wireless ADB kind of defeats the purpose.
- Custom ROMs, whether stock- or AOSP-based. Many people aren’t happy with the features included in their stock ROMs, or they just prefer a more vanilla Android experience.
- App reverse engineering. There’s a neat tool called Frida that helps you step through and reverse engineer Android apps. But it needs root.
- Kernel tuning. Not every change to the kernel has to be done with a custom one. Using apps like Kernel Adiutor, you can finetune the balance between battery life and performance to match your personal tastes.
- Enabling pre-release or hidden features. Google, for instance, is notorious for A/B testing new features in its apps. Root lets you force-enable those features for yourself.
- Xposed. Yes, Xposed still exists. But now it’s called EdXposed and works systemlessly thanks to Magisk.
In case you’re newer to the rooting scene (or you never really paid much attention to it), the Xposed Framework is a powerful customization and modification for Android. It allows module developers to override, add, and remove various behaviors in Android. This in turn lets you do things like make in-depth themes, add buttons to your power menu, move status bar icons around, basically whatever you want. Xposed has been around forever, and in its newest form of EdXposed, it’s still getting plenty of attention.
For instance, there’s an EdXposed module for One UI that’s like a OneUI Tuner on steroids. Instead of being limited to what resource overlays support, Firefds Kit lets you do things like enable biometric unlock after a reboot, or disable app signature verification.
Even with all that, it’s very possible that you’re still not convinced that root is needed. Which, again, is completely justified. If root isn’t for you, it isn’t for you. But I can tell you that at least 25 other people have unlocked at least one US Galaxy device with this method. There are dozens of us! Dozens!
Proof of Root on the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
Before anyone complains (even though this is 1300 words in already), I am actually rooted, and I can support that claim with evidence. Take a look at the screenshots and video below.
As you can see, I have Magisk v20.4 up and running, along with a build of TWRP for the international Snapdragon variant, and a custom kernel. The kernel and TWRP were made by mentalmuso, who will also soon have a bootloader unlocked US Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.
I’ve also switched my Recents provider to use Lawnchair instead of Samsung’s default or Good Lock’s Task Changer. And, of course, I’m using Swift Installer and OneUI Tuner to theme and customize my device. While Swift Installer and OneUI Tuner will both work without root, through the use of Synergy, they’re a lot easier to use with Magisk installed.
It’s still a Rooted Samsung smartphone
This isn’t some magical root exploit or anything. My Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is properly bootloader unlocked, and that means KNOX has been tripped. I can’t use Samsung Pass or Samsung Pay. The former detects that I’m rooted, just like it would on an international variant. Weirdly, Samsung Pay doesn’t complain about root. Instead, it seems to have some sort of server connection issue. Either way, it doesn’t work. And, of course, Secure Folder won’t work without being modded, but I don’t use that, so I don’t really care. Finally, OTAs are disabled. Attempting to check for updates results in a connection error. But with tools like SamFirm, Frida, or Samloader, that’s not really an issue for me.

But everything else works fine. Magisk Hide is still letting SafetyNet pass, so things like Google Pay work without issue. I can (and have) installed Magisk modules without any issues, and now I’ve got the experience I wanted, with full US compatibility and a proper warranty.Google introduced Quick Settings tiles to Android with Android 5.0 Lollipop (though it should be noted that this feature was available on Samsung phones before it made its way to AOSP). With Quick Settings, users can access many useful system toggles such as a WiFi, Bluetooth, Location, GPS, or Sound toggle without having to navigate...First Custom ROM Appears for the Nokia Lumia 710
About a month or so ago, XDA Forum Member biktor_gj posted an entire unlock and NAND access method for the Nokia Lumia 800 and 710 series of devices, which are the next of kin in Nokia’s entry into the world of smartphones (being hand held by Microsoft themselves). The complete unlock was accomplished thanks to the collaboration of several devs including XDA Recognized Developer ultrashot. Well, the best thing about having our devices completely unlocked is that it allows them to receive and accept unsigned code such as—oh, I don’t know—custom ROMs!
Thanks to the hard work by XDA Forum Member vova1609, we now have the very first custom Mango ROM for the device. For those of you who have never laid a finger on a WP device, they are locked down beyond all reasonable comprehension, and as such you are very limited in what you can do with it and to it. This custom ROM will allow you to do things such as install XAPs directly from Internet Explorer (for easier side loading than PC-tethered solutions), use various available fixes such as DFT’s Bluetooth file transfer and much more.
As it is the case with most custom work, particularly so on Windows Phone, there is always the chance of bricking the device, so make sure that you have a backup of your device in Zune in case of emergencies, and make sure that you follow the OP’s instructions completely to avoid problems. Please leave some feedback if you do run into bugs.
Change log:
- Full unlocked
- You can install XAP from Internet Explorer
- Bazaar has already installed
- Bluetooth File Transfer by DFT has already installed
- Exclusive wallpapers “metro ROCK”
- Added tethering
- Deleted Nokia’s apps, like Nokia Music
- Added Google and Yandex as search engine
- And more…

The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is Samsung’s answer to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumers aren’t so interested in buying $1,399 flagships anymore. With declining economies and a drastic reduction in purchasing power, consumers are more interested in getting the most bang for the buck than ever. This is the area where companies like Apple, OnePlus, and Xiaomi are focusing on this year, and Samsung wasn’t going to be left behind. Want the best of the Samsung Galaxy S20 at a cheaper price tag? Get the Galaxy S20 FE.
The Galaxy S20 FE seems to have it covered when it comes to the list of requirements of an affordable flagship in 2020: a standard size 6.5-inch 120Hz Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, a flagship SoC (Exynos 990 for the 4G variant, and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 for the 5G variant), enough RAM and storage, high-spec cameras (with the primary camera lifted from the Galaxy S20 and the Galaxy S20+), a big battery capacity (4,500mAh), fast wired and wireless charging, IP rating, microSD card slot, and a palatable price tag. However, it does miss out on a glass back (which could be a plus or a minus), a Quad HD+ Dynamic AMOLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and super fast wired charging provided in the box.
The phone also has to contend with a field of competitors that is getting more crowded by the day. For the same or similar price bracket as the Galaxy S20 FE, you could get the OnePlus 8T, OnePlus 8 Pro, Xiaomi Mi 10T, Mi 10T Pro, and the Mi 10, ASUS ROG Phone 3, Realme X50 Pro, Apple iPhone 11, and others. Some of these competitors may even have better specifications in a few areas, but at the end of the day, the execution of specifications matters more than the specifications themselves.
Can the Galaxy S20 FE hold its own against such a broad variety of competitors?
Let’s find this out in our review.
Review Summary
|Pros||Cons|
- The matte coating of the plastic back feels much nicer than the glossy plastic used in the Galaxy M-series and A-series.
- The cameras are versatile. It’s good to see all three types of cameras included (wide-angle + ultra-wide-angle + telephoto).
- The cameras have great image quality in daylight and outdoor low light scenarios.
- The real-world performance is great. App launch times and UI smoothness are up to par with flagship competitors.
- The optical under-display fingerprint sensor is faster and more reliable than the ultrasonic sensor used in the regular Galaxy S20 phones.
- The display’s angular color shifting is higher than Samsung’s flagship displays and other price competitors.
- The 120Hz mode has relatively poor battery life.
- The cameras still have issues with indoor image quality, facial smoothing, and over-processing in Night mode.
- Samsung doesn’t bundle a 25W Power Delivery 3.0 fast charger in the box; the 15W charger bundled in the box isn’t good enough for a 2020 affordable flagship.
- The Exynos 990 4G variant has inferior CPU and GPU performance and power efficiency compared to the Snapdragon 865 5G variant.

Samsung Galaxy S20 FE Forums
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE – Design
The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE’s design is fine and functional, but it’s not going to win design awards.
This is because of a few factors. First, let’s look at the build quality. The phone has a thin aluminum frame and a matte plastic back instead of using glass. For durability, this is a plus, as plastic won’t break like glass does. There is a potential for getting more scratches with plastic, but thankfully, Samsung has eschewed its traditional glossy coating in favor of a soft-touch matte coating, which should reduce the probability of scratches. The aluminum frame is thin because of the aggressively curved sides, but it’s durable as well.
The front is where the durability does hit a roadblock. The display is protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3, which is four generations old now. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (review) has the latest Gorilla Glass Victus, and while hoping for its inclusion in the Galaxy S20 FE would have been a bit too optimistic, Gorilla Glass 6 should have been featured in an affordable flagship for better drop resistance. As it is, users are advised to use a case to protect their phone.
The power and volume buttons have acceptable rigidity and actuation feedback, but phones like the OnePlus 8 Pro are ahead here.
In terms of in-hand feel, the Galaxy S20 FE feels nice to hold in the hand. Its 6.5-inch display-diagonal isn’t too big, the sides and the back are comfortably curved, and the phone’s volume doesn’t present an issue, as the thickness (8.4mm) and weight (190g) are kept at acceptable levels. The phone is appreciably lighter than the OnePlus 8 Pro, but the Samsung Galaxy S20+ manages to keep the weight even lower (186g) even with the use of a glass back and a bigger 6.7-inch display.
The matte coating of the polycarbonate back feels a lot better than the glossy plastic Samsung uses in its cheaper M-series and A-series phones. In itself, it feels premium. However, a glossy glass back as seen on the Galaxy S20+ looks and feels more premium, although they get a lot more fingerprints. At the top of the hill are matte glass backs, as seen on the OnePlus 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and others. All of the phone’s competitors use glass backs, so in terms of feel, the Galaxy S20 FE is admittedly at a bit of a disadvantage here. Ultimately, it’s up to users to determine which build material and coating they prefer.
The front design of the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is where Samsung lets us down. The phone features a small centered hole punch front camera cutout, which is good to see in itself. The cutout has a chrome ring around it, which could become distracting in certain types of lighting. It wasn’t a big issue for me, though. The centered location of the front camera is appreciable as it means primary status bar icons aren’t affected. However, the 84.8% screen-to-body ratio is puzzling to see, as it represents a disappointing regression from Samsung’s own previous affordable flagships, not to mention the price competitors in the market.
The bezels on all four sides are homogenously larger than what is seen on the Samsung Galaxy S20+, which has a 90.5% screen-to-body ratio. It means despite having a 0.2-inch smaller display (6.5-inch vs. 6.7-inch, both 20:9), the Galaxy S20 FE is just as tall as the Galaxy S20+ and is actually slightly wider. Its device volume is higher despite having less screen estate. The phone also doesn’t compare favorably here against competitors such as the OnePlus 8T (review) and the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro (hands-on preview).
From the front, the Galaxy S20 FE still looks like a 2020 phone, but its design just isn’t as modern as that of the Galaxy S20+, and it makes a practical difference in screen size and device volume as well.
When we move to the back, we find Samsung’s late 2020 design language in play. The triple camera enclosure is placed at the top left, with the camera lenses being noticeably large, just like the Galaxy Note 20 series as well as the Galaxy Z Fold 2 (review). Aesthetically, it looks more pleasing than the Galaxy S20+’s camera enclosure. The phone does feature a camera bump thanks to the 1/1.7″ primary camera sensor, but it’s not big enough to be an issue of concern.
It comes in Cloud Navy, Cloud Mint, Cloud Lavender, Cloud White, Cloud Orange, and Cloud Red. I received the Mint variant for review, and the color is subdued enough not to stand out too much, but it has understated good looks of its own. The variety of color options seen here is larger and better than what is seen on the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20+ (review), and Galaxy S20 Ultra (review). The Mint color uses a nice shade of green, and in terms of aesthetics, it looks just as good as anything else on the market.
The Galaxy S20 FE features an IP68 rating for water resistance, and it has a hybrid microSD card slot as well (dual-SIM or single-SIM + microSD). However, the phone lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, just like the Galaxy S20 series. Samsung doesn’t bundle a 3.5mm to USB Type-C adapter in the box, so if users need it, they will have to purchase it separately.
In terms of the contents of the box package, the Galaxy S20 FE makes an underwhelming case for itself. Wired earphones and a case are not pre-loaded in the box. The pre-loaded fast charger is a 15W Adaptive Fast Charger with a Type-C to Type-A cable, compatible with Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. This charger was pre-loaded with all Samsung flagship phones in the past, going all the way back to the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.
With the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and the Galaxy S20 series, Samsung finally moved on to providing 25W USB Type-C Power Delivery 3.0 chargers with PPS and PDO. The 25W charger provided with the Galaxy S20 series is also available in the box package of cheaper phones such as the Galaxy M31s and the Galaxy M51, but the more expensive Galaxy S20 FE gets short-changed here with the 15W charger. The phone does support 25W fast charging, but users will need to purchase the charger separately or use any other compatible 25W PD 3.0 charger. This is one area where the Galaxy S20 FE disappoints compared to its competitors. The OnePlus 8T, for example, comes with a 65W fast charger in the box, while the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro comes with a 33W fast charger. It’s strange to observe Samsung failing to keep up in such a basic area of competition.
Overall, the Galaxy S20 FE commits enough missteps with its design for it to be called slightly disappointing. Yes, it does pass the acceptability test, but it’s hard to deny that competitors are ahead here. In itself, the design and build quality aren’t bad at all—but at the same time, they are not going to be at the top of the design comparisons.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE – Display
The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE has a flat 6.5-inch Full HD+ 1080p (2400×1080) Super AMOLED display with a 20:9 aspect ratio and 407 PPI. The display features a 120Hz high refresh rate, which Samsung refers to as high motion smoothness. Unlike the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s adaptive variable refresh rate implementation, the Galaxy S20 FE’s 120Hz implementation is carried over from that of the Galaxy S20 series, as it uses two discrete screen refresh rate modes: 60Hz and 120Hz. Samsung ships the phone with 120Hz mode enabled out of the box, unlike the Galaxy S20 series. The absence of a curved display can be a plus or a minus, depending on users’ perspectives. For most users, a flat display represents a better compromise.
The Galaxy S20 FE has a Super AMOLED display, instead of having a Dynamic AMOLED panel. The older terminology means the display is not HDR10+ certified, unlike the flagship displays of the Galaxy S10, Galaxy Note 10, Galaxy S20, and Galaxy Note 20 series. It supports regular HDR10, as expected.
The Galaxy S20 FE’s display does lack QHD+ resolution. However, it should be considered that even the Galaxy S20 and Galaxy Note 20 series does not let you use the 120Hz mode with QHD+ resolution, as it can only be used with Full HD+ resolution (and the reason for that still remains unclear). It is generally agreed that 120Hz with Full HD+ resolution is a better experience than 60Hz with QHD+ resolution, so the absence of QHD+ is not a big issue on the Galaxy S20 FE because even if it did have it, you wouldn’t have been able to use it with the 120Hz mode. Yes, text and images won’t look as sharp as seen on the OnePlus 8 Pro (which does feature 120Hz support with QHD+ resolution), but the FHD+ resolution is still acceptable thanks to subpixel anti-aliasing.
The display of the Galaxy S20 FE features High Brightness Mode (HBM), which means sunlight legibility isn’t an issue, as the phone will be able to reach ~700 nits at 100% APL. The panel isn’t the latest-generation Samsung display, which means it has an older emitter. In turn, this means it won’t be able to go quite as bright as the displays of the Galaxy S20 and Galaxy Note 20 series, but usability even in direct sunlight shouldn’t be an issue as Samsung also switches to a special display mode with low gamma and increased display contrast whenever HBM is activated. When using manual brightness, the company continues to tune things conservatively as the maximum manual brightness is capped to ~350 nits at 100% APL. The minimum brightness of the phone is a positive as it can get very low, lower than the OnePlus 8 Pro, for example.
The contrast of the display is just as good as any other AMOLED display. The viewing angles, though, are disappointing because the display still features visible angular color shifting to blue as well as a rainbow out interference effect at extreme angles. Newer Samsung OLED panels have eliminated the rainbow out interference effect, and also reduced off-axis color shifting by a significant amount. The Galaxy S20+’s viewing angles, for example, are much better because the color shifting is much lower. Strangely, even the cheaper Galaxy M51 (review) doesn’t feature the interference effect issue (that is likely caused by the polarizer).
It’s also worth mentioning the display doesn’t feel as laminated to the glass as the Galaxy S20+’s display does. On the other hand, the oleophobic coating that Samsung uses continues to be excellent here, which means tapping and swiping on the display feels great.
The color accuracy of the Galaxy S20 FE should be perceptibly great for all but the most demanding content creators. The Vivid mode is set by default and it features saturated colors, but users are advised to change it to Natural to experience calibrated colors with respect to the sRGB and DCI-P3 color gamuts. There are still some weak points here and there, such as a too warm white point of the display, and black clipping that can be improved. On the other hand, the display gamma and grayscale accuracy here feels noticeably better than the Galaxy S20+’s display.
In terms of power efficiency, it’s more of the same as the 120Hz mode has been observed to require a substantial amount of power. The battery life with 120Hz mode is noticeably lesser than using the phone with the standard 60Hz refresh rate. Adaptive refresh rate displays will help here, but even then, the impact on power efficiency of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s variable refresh rate was only measured to be 8% by AnandTech. The Xiaomi Mi 10T series, on the other hand, features an adaptive screen refresh rate implementation with LCD instead of OLED. The Galaxy S20 FE doesn’t push any boundaries here, but users concerned more about battery life than motion smoothness will be glad to know that the 60Hz mode does result in longer uptime than 120Hz.
Overall, the Galaxy S20 FE’s display is marginally weaker than it should be. While it posts a strong showing in most areas, it’s let down by the higher amount of angular color shifting that is observed on the display. In this regard, even older Samsung displays such as the Google Pixel 3 XL are superior here, and even last year’s value flagship, the Galaxy S10e, has perceptibly lower color shifting. Samsung excels in areas such as brightness and color accuracy, but for the price point, the display of the OnePlus 8T, for example, will provide a better experience as it has HDR10+ support as well. The OnePlus 8 Pro’s display is probably the best in this price range, as long as users get a panel free from QA problems. The Galaxy S20 FE slots in below both of these competitors, while it remains to be seen how the Xiaomi Mi 10T series handles itself here.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE – Performance
The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 4G is powered by Samsung’s own Exynos 990 SoC, while the 5G variant of the phone features the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chip. We have compared both of these chips’ implementations in our OnePlus 8 Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy S20+ review comparison article back in July. We did an in-depth deep dive on the Exynos 990 in our Galaxy S20+ review, and took a brief look at its gaming performance in our Galaxy Note 20 Ultra review. Readers interested in learning more about the Exynos 990 stacks up against the Snapdragon 865 gold standard in the Android SoC market can check the aforementioned links.
The Exynos 990 is a triple-cluster chip consisting of two Exynos M5 big custom cores clocked at 2.7GHz, two ARM Cortex-A76 medium cores clocked at 2.5GHz, and four ARM Cortex-A55 little cores clocked at 2.0GHz. It features ARM’s Mali-G77MP11 GPU.
I ran a series of benchmarks to see whether there was any discrepancy in the scores relative to the Exynos 990’s implementation in the Galaxy S20+. It turns out there is, at least in some benchmarks. PCMark scores were slightly lower but within the margin of error, while the Geekbench 5 scores were indistinguishable. The 3DMark scores, however, were significantly lesser than what I obtained on the Galaxy S20+. The CPU Throttling Test benchmark refused at first to even complete a 15-minute run because according to the software, it was heating up the phone far too much. I had to do that again. The Speedometer score was a bit lower (59.9 vs. 61.7). The GFXBench results were mostly similar to those obtained on the Galaxy S20+, and they showed the same GPU throttling issue that occurred when running a series of tests one after the other. Finally, in AndroBench, the Galaxy S20 FE was able to post some excellent figures, even though it doesn’t have the latest generation storage specification (UFS 3.0 vs. UFS 3.1).
Ultimately, the conclusion of the performance benchmarks is that the Exynos 990 is an okay flagship SoC in its own right, but if the 5G variant of the Galaxy S20 FE is available for a higher price, I would recommend going for that as the Snapdragon 865 features superior CPU as well as GPU performance, while having much better CPU and GPU power efficiency as well.
UI Smoothness
To test how smooth the Galaxy S20 FE 4G runs, we run a modified version of Google’s open-source JankBench benchmark. This benchmark simulates a handful of common tasks you’ll see in everyday apps, including scrolling through a ListView with text, scrolling through a ListView with images, scrolling through a grid view with a shadow effect, scrolling through a low-hitrate text render view, scrolling through a high-hitrate text render view, inputting and editing text with the keyboard, repeating overdraws with cards, and uploading bitmaps. Our script records the draw time for each frame during the test, eventually plotting all the frames and their draw times in a plot along with several horizontal lines representing the target frame draw times for the four common display refresh rates (60Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz, and 144Hz.)
The test results are interesting. They quantify that as of current software, the Galaxy S20 FE is measurably less smooth than the Snapdragon 865 variant of the regular Galaxy S20. Even the Google Pixel 5 (review) with its mid-range Snapdragon 765G SoC is slightly smoother. The Bitmap Upload Test is where we are seeing the most variance between the Snapdragon Galaxy S20 and the Exynos Galaxy S20 FE (it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison since we don’t have both variants of the Galaxy S20 FE). The Exynos Galaxy S20 FE misses the 120Hz target in 97.1% of all frames in that test, which is a rather concerning result, while the Snapdragon Galaxy S20 does only so in 0.82% of frames. This could explain the stutters that can be felt sometimes in apps like Google Chrome when browsing particularly heavy websites.
However, to be fair, it should be noted that the phone does perform well in the other tests. The differences in all other tests apart from the Bitmap Upload Test are splitting hairs: you won’t notice the difference between 0.8% jank and 0.06% jank. The benchmark shows the importance of optimizing the software stack for high refresh rates. The Google Pixel 5 does a surprisingly good job here, while the ASUS ROG Phone 3 performs better than the Exynos Galaxy S20 FE but worse than the Snapdragon Galaxy S20. The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro (review) is the top performer that we have seen in this test. For the most part, all of these phones will remain perceptibly smooth nearly all of the time.
In terms of real-world performance, I was mostly satisfied with the Galaxy S20 FE, but there are caveats. In the default 120Hz mode, the phone is extremely fast and smooth nearly all the time. However, it can still show minor frame drops after heavy multiple-tab sessions on Google Chrome (this happens mostly when entering and exiting the tab switcher). The UI runs at a buttery 120fps, though, and in general use cases, the real-world performance differences between the Snapdragon 865 and the Exynos 990 variants are likely imperceptible, something that wasn’t the case in previous generations.
The phone has a thermal limit where, after reaching 40°C, it will automatically drop back to 60Hz refresh rate until the temperature goes down. This limit is 2°C lower than what Samsung implemented on the Galaxy S20 series. It means that after heavy use, you will need to keep the phone down for a few minutes to let it regain its 120Hz capability.
With Exynos chips, there are always thermal issues to consider. While the Galaxy S20 FE performs well for the most part with respect to thermals, it does seem to start getting hotter earlier than Snapdragon 865-powered flagships. The problem is definitely not as severe as what I observed on the Exynos 9820-powered Galaxy S10e (review), but it still exists.
The RAM management of the Galaxy S20 FE is excellent. Samsung seems to have improved its memory management policies, as the DontKillMyApp benchmark reports a 100% result, which is good to see. In practical use, One UI 2.5 has better RAM management than OnePlus’ OxygenOS, as a higher number of apps, Chrome tabs, and services can be opened at any given time.
The Galaxy S20 FE uses a Goodix-sourced optical under-display fingerprint sensor, while the regular Galaxy S20 series uses Qualcomm’s first-generation ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. The fingerprint sensor of the Galaxy S20 FE has worked quite well for me. It is a bit slower than the fingerprint sensors seen on OnePlus devices, but the accuracy and rate of success is great. In terms of accuracy, it is much better than the ultrasonic fingerprint sensors that Samsung uses in both the Galaxy S20 and Galaxy Note 20 series.
Overall, the Galaxy S20 FE’s performance is on par for the course. Yes, there are faster, smoother phones on the market, and some of these phones have better battery life as well. The OnePlus 8T and the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro will both offer better performance. Even so, Samsung’s decision to place the Exynos 990 in the Galaxy S20 FE 4G is more acceptable than placing the same SoC in halo flagship phones like the Galaxy S20 Ultra and the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.
The limitations of the chip are easier to forgive at this price point. Buyers will be aware, however, that Snapdragon 865-powered phones are now available for as less as ₹33,999, and the Xiaomi Mi 10T starts at ₹35,999. So users buying the Galaxy S20 FE 4G for performance alone are advised to head elsewhere, as it doesn’t head the CPU and GPU performance charts, although it does post excellent storage performance. For buyers interested in good-but-not-class-leading performance and who don’t place a top priority on GPU throttling and gaming performance, the Galaxy S20 FE will leave them satisfied.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE – Camera Analysis
Camera specifications
The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE has a triple rear camera setup. The primary camera is the same as the one used in the Galaxy S20 and the Galaxy S20+. That means it has a 12MP Samsung ISOCELL S5K2LD sensor (which is a 1/1.7″ sensor), 1.8µm pixels, f/1.8 aperture, 26mm equivalent focal length, Dual Pixel PDAF, and OIS. The key characteristic of this sensor is that it uses a regular Bayer color filter array. Its lack of a high megapixel count means it doesn’t need a Quad Bayer filter array. The pixel size is natively high at 1.8µm, which is the highest seen in 12MP smartphone cameras (the pixel size is bigger than the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s 1.7µm pixels, for what it’s worth). Having Dual Pixel PDAF is also a plus as most Quad Bayer sensors opt to forego the feature, and this is the reason why the Galaxy S20 and the Galaxy S20+ had superior autofocusing capabilities than the higher-end Galaxy S20 Ultra.
The ultra-wide-angle camera has a 12MP 1/3″ sensor with 1.12µm pixels, f/2.2 aperture, and 123˚ field-of-view (FOV). This sensor doesn’t have autofocus, which means Super Macro capabilities aren’t possible. It’s not the same sensor as the Galaxy S20 series, as those phones had a bigger 1/2.55″ sensor with 1.4µm pixels. The Galaxy S20 series also doesn’t feature autofocus in the ultra-wide-angle camera.
The third camera is a telephoto unit. It has an 8MP 1/4.5″ sensor with 1.0µm pixels, f/2.4 aperture, 76mm equivalent focal length, PDAF, and OIS. The 76mm equivalent focal length relative to the 26mm equivalent focal length of the primary camera lets Samsung provide 2.9x optical zoom, which the company passes off as 3x. In addition, the camera has Samsung’s “Space Zoom” feature, which, in this case, means digital zoom up to 30x. The camera takes photos in 12MP resolution and not at its native 8MP, and the reason for that is unclear. In contrast to the Galaxy S20 and the Galaxy S20+, the Galaxy S20 FE has a real telephoto lens. Those two phones featured a 64MP secondary wide-angle camera with 29mm equivalent focal length and 1.1x zoom, relying on crop sensor zoom to provide 3x “hybrid optic zoom”.
In theory, neither of these approaches is generally better than the other. The Galaxy S20 FE can have an advantage in daylight with real optical zoom, but in low light, it’s the 64MP camera and its crop sensor zoom that should end up on top as the poorer optics of the Galaxy S20 FE’s telephoto camera don’t let in much light.
Not having a 64MP secondary wide-angle camera means the Galaxy S20 FE misses out on giving users the option to take 64MP high-resolution Quad Bayer photos. These Quad Bayer photos can be variable; the Galaxy S20+’s 64MP image output was great, while the cheaper Galaxy M51’s primary 64MP camera took 64MP full-resolution images that had no advantage in detail over 16MP pixel binned photos.
Finally, the Galaxy S20 FE also skips on 8K video recording as it doesn’t have a high-megapixel sensor. This feature is a niche one currently, and its absence shouldn’t matter for most users.
On paper, the Galaxy S20 FE covers the requirement of three different focal lengths by providing wide-angle + ultra-wide-angle + telephoto cameras, something that the OnePlus 8T and the Xiaomi Mi 10T series miss out on by opting to forgo the telephoto camera. The Galaxy S20+’s 12MP primary camera took great photos in daylight and outdoor low light, so the Galaxy S20 FE has a strong foundation to start with.
The camera app of the Galaxy S20 FE is the standard One UI 2.5 camera app. I only have good things to say about it. To learn more about how it works, read our Galaxy Note 10 Lite review. In terms of autofocusing speed and shutter lag, the Galaxy S20 FE behaves well as most of the time, it takes photos with zero shutter lag (ZSL). In ultra low light, the Galaxy S20 series opted to forgo ZSL in favor of a mini-night mode with image stacking, but it doesn’t seem as if the Galaxy S20 FE does the same, at least in my testing. Samsung continues to make Scene Optimizer a user-configurable choice, and it’s enabled by default.
Image quality assessment – Daylight
Primary camera
The 12MP primary camera takes excellent photos in daylight, in general. However, the image processing here is different from what I saw with the Galaxy S20+, which had the same SoC and the same camera sensor. The dynamic range on the Galaxy S20 FE is narrower than the Galaxy S20+’s camera, which is a bit disappointing to see considering that dynamic range was such a strength of the Galaxy S20+’s camera. On the other hand, the Galaxy S20 FE retains the traditional Samsung strengths of great exposure, reasonably accurate colors and white balance, and well-defined shadow detail while retaining the highlights. On its own, the dynamic range here is on par with OnePlus cameras, but it doesn’t quite reach the lofty heights set by the higher-priced variants in the Galaxy S20 and Galaxy Note 20 series.
In terms of detail retention, the Galaxy S20 FE does well even in cloudy scenarios where there isn’t much light available. Samsung still uses aggressive noise reduction with low ISO levels, which means these photos are practically noise-free, at the cost of letting go of some fine detail. For the most part, though, they are sharp enough, even at 100% resolution. There isn’t much to complain about here. The OnePlus 8 Pro will take more detailed 12MP pixel binned photos at the cost of a darker exposure and lesser shadow detail. Both approaches have their plus points, but the Galaxy S20 FE remains competitive.
Ultra-wide-angle camera
The 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera has a wide 123˚ field-of-view. Its lower sensor size, pixel size, and lack of autofocus are all negatives, but in general use, the resulting photos come out bright, reasonably color accurate (the color science between all three cameras is the same, which is a plus), and with adequate detail.
At 100% resolution, the detail levels in photos do fall off quite a bit. When coupled with the lack of luminance noise thanks to aggressive noise reduction, the oil painting effect is, unfortunately, visible in some samples. It’s not the best ultra-wide-angle camera I have ever used, as the ultra-wide-angle cameras of the OnePlus 8 Pro and the Galaxy S20+ are significantly superior. However, the Galaxy S20 FE’s ultra-wide does do the job for all but the most discerning users.
Telephoto camera
As mentioned above, the 8MP telephoto camera of the Galaxy S20 FE takes photos in 12MP resolution for some reason. The 3x zoom samples have a good amount of detail, and the exposure is on point too. Despite the OIS, some of the samples came out a bit blurry. The dynamic range here is, as expected, worse than the other two cameras. The 3x zoom samples are, for the most part, as sharp as they should be.
3x is the optimal zoom level for this focal length. Jumping above 3x means the camera is simply zooming digitally. While digitally zoomed photos at 4x and 5x are still passable, the quality falls off dramatically at 10x zoom and above, as expected. The 30x Space Zoom feature is a gimmick, but this doesn’t come as a surprise.
Overall, the Galaxy S20 FE takes great photos in daylight. Its absence of a high-megapixel sensor means it can’t take 48MP or 64MP high-resolution photos, but 12MP should be enough for most users. The dynamic range of the primary camera is less than that of the Galaxy S20+’s camera, which is the one negative. The ultra-wide-angle camera doesn’t match that of its higher sibling but still takes acceptable photos. Lastly, the telephoto camera may not be as holistically useful as an ultra-wide, but its image output at the 3x zoom level is good enough for viewing at full resolution.
Image quality assessment – Indoors and low light
The Galaxy S20 FE’s camera performs very well in daylight, but it does start running into issues indoors. The issue it falls into is smoothing. Smoothing fine detail to remove luminance noise is a poor thing to do. While it doesn’t make a big difference when taking photos of objects, it does have an adverse impact when taking photos of humans. That is because Samsung still enables aggressive facial smoothing by default. Even when you disable it in the camera app, facial detail is smudged by aggressive noise reduction, which means photos of humans just don’t have as much detail as photos taken from the OnePlus 8 Pro or any Google Pixel. Instead, they look overly soft, which is disappointing to see.
Enabling Samsung’s night mode here only makes things worse. In this respect, Samsung has regressed from last year. The company introduced a good night mode for its time a few months after launching the Galaxy S10 series, and I reviewed it on the Galaxy S10e. Since then, the image processing of the night mode has gone backward, particularly when using it to take photos of people. Artifacts, over-sharpening, and unnaturally increased contrast are what you get from Samsung’s night mode on the Galaxy S20 FE, and it just reflects poorly on the company. The situation looks even worse when you consider that other vendors such as Google, OnePlus, Apple, and Huawei have it figured out. Google’s Night Sight is much better than Samsung’s new night mode, and they were actually quite close last year. It has to be hoped that Samsung can and will improve things in this respect with future software updates, because right now, the Galaxy S20 FE’s night mode is worse than the OnePlus 8 Pro’s Nightscape mode, for example.
In outdoor low lighting, the Galaxy S20 FE’s primary camera takes bright, detailed photos. The 1.8um pixel size shows its worth here. Photos do have luminance noise, but their detail levels and good exposure make up for that. The Galaxy S20 FE is not a low-light photography master, as Huawei, Google, and OnePlus are all ahead. However, the image quality is good in itself. Using night mode here increases the light intake but reduces fine detail to the point where you would be better off using the regular Photo mode instead.
Night mode is beneficial for the ultra-wide-angle camera in low light, though. The ultra-wide functions poorly in low light in the regular mode, but using night mode will rescue the image quality output from poor to something that is legitimately usable.
The Galaxy S20 FE lacks a dedicated macro camera and also doesn’t have autofocus in its ultra-wide-angle camera. This means it simply can’t get as close to the subject for Super Macro abilities. It’s a niche use case, but users hoping to see that feature here will be disappointed. On the other hand, regular macro photos come out great as the camera’s plane of focusing is wide enough for objects to remain in focus. It’s a better camera for food photography than the OnePlus 8 Pro, for example. The Live Focus portrait mode also does the job, as expected, even though it’s let down by facial smoothing, which was also expected.
Overall, the Galaxy S20 FE’s camera stumbles a bit in indoor and outdoor low lighting situations. The problem is that Samsung’s regression here was entirely self-inflicted. I can only help but imagine how much better the camera would be if Samsung figured out the issues with its 2020 night mode and got back to processing images in an authentic manner like Google’s Night Sight or even its own 2019 night mode. As it is, it still is a good smartphone camera for taking photos in low light, but there are better options available for only slightly higher price points.
In conclusion, the Galaxy S20 FE’s camera straddles the line between being called a “good flagship smartphone camera” and “a great flagship smartphone camera” for photos. With a better night mode, it would probably have been excellent, but as it is, there remains some work here for Samsung to do here even when considering that image quality in daylight is excellent.
Video recording
The Galaxy S20 FE is competent when it comes to video recording. It can record video in up to 4K at 60fps, and it supports recording in the HEVC encoder. Recording video with the ultra-wide-angle and telephoto cameras is supported. EIS + OIS is enabled in 30fps video recording modes, while OIS remains active in 60fps modes. The phone can record video in HDR10+ thanks to a Labs feature that is disabled by default. It supports Super Steady mode with both the primary and ultra-wide-angle cameras. Finally, super slow-motion video recording is supported at 1080p at 960fps, and regular slow motion is supported as well.
I recorded quite a few videos using different settings such as 4K at 60fps, 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 60fps, 1080p at 30ps, Super Steady 1080p at 30fps, and Super Steady ultra-wide 1080p at 30fps. These videos have been uploaded to YouTube and are available for viewing below.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE: Video Samples at various resolutions
Suffice it to say that the Galaxy S20 FE does a good job in video recording. Its videos aren’t quite as detailed as that of the Galaxy S20+ in 4K, but it still manages to establish itself in the upper tier. HDR10+ video recording remains a great feature, and Super Steady works well enough as well.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE – Battery Life and Charging
The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE has a 4,500mAh typical battery capacity, matching the battery capacity of the Galaxy S20+ while having a smaller, older-generation display. It features the same Exynos 990 SoC. Predictably, the results are quite similar.
Even after many updates, I was never happy with the battery life of the Galaxy S20+ in its 120Hz mode, and the same is true for the Galaxy S20 FE in the 120Hz mode. The phone can last for a full day (20-24 hours) of unplugged time with screen-on time ranging from four to five-and-a-half hours, although you could get as much as six hours of screen-on time or as low as four hours of screen-on time depending on your workload. Dropping the display refresh rate to 60Hz does increase screen-on time by a full hour, just as it did with the Galaxy S20+. What remains a fact is that this isn’t the battery life a user would normally expect with a 4,500mAh battery capacity. The power draw of the 120Hz mode coupled with the power efficiency deficit of the Exynos 990 isn’t a very good combination. Users of the Snapdragon 865-powered Galaxy S20 FE 5G are already reporting screen-on time in excess of six to seven hours, which shows the difference.
In terms of wired charging, the Galaxy S20 FE takes 1 hour and 10 minutes to charge from 15% to 100% using Samsung’s own 25W PD 3.0 charger, which was pre-loaded with other Galaxy S20 variants as well as the Galaxy M51. The charge time is acceptable with the 25W charger, but if you use the pre-loaded 15W charger, it should increase to about one hour and forty-five minutes.
The Galaxy S20 FE supports fast wireless charging (15W), and also supports PowerShare (9W), which is Samsung’s term for reverse wireless charging to charge smartwatches and TWS earphones.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE: Odds and Ends
- The stereo speakers of the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE aren’t quite as loud as those of the Samsung Galaxy S20+. However, audio quality is good, and there is no distortion at high volume levels.
- The vibration motor of the phone is also not as strong and well-defined as that of the Galaxy S20+ or other phones such as the OnePlus 8 Pro, OPPO Reno 10x Zoom, Google Pixels, and others. Haptic feedback when typing feels a little weak, and other price competitors are ahead of the Galaxy S20 FE here.
- The 4G variant of the Galaxy S20 FE doesn’t support 5G (obviously). This means it’s hard to make a futureproofing argument for the phone in regions where 5G is stated to arrive within the next couple of years, such as India. Some consumers will have moved on by then, but as it is, it would have been nice for Samsung to make both 4G and 5G variants available in all markets.
- The cellular call quality of the phone was good and on par for the course, as expected. Dual VoLTE and VoWiFi support is included.
- The phone runs One UI 2.5 on top of Android 10 out of the box. It’s slated to get an update to Android 11-based One UI 3.0 in the coming weeks and months.
Conclusion and Final Thoughts
The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a fine phone. While I was uneasy recommending the Galaxy S20+ because of its extremely high price of ₹73,999 (which has since increased to ₹77,999 in India), it’s a lot easier to recommend the Galaxy S20 FE. Of course, ₹49,999 in India, £599 in the UK and €649 in the EU isn’t a small amount to pay, even for an affordable flagship. Therefore, let’s look at the pros and cons.
The Galaxy S20 FE’s list of pros includes a fast and smooth 6.5-inch 120Hz AMOLED display, nice matte plastic back and plentiful color options, good real-world performance, appreciable camera image quality in daylight and outdoor low light, excellent video recording, accurate optical under-display fingerprint sensor, and feature-rich software. Its list of cons includes a relatively low screen-to-body ratio, off-axis color shifting in the display, GPU throttling, smoothing issues with facial detail and over-processing in the camera’s night mode, relatively poor battery life in the 120Hz mode, lack of the 25W charger in the box, and a vibration motor that isn’t quite as well-defined as some price competitors. It depends on users’ priorities, but it can be observed that for most users, the phone’s list of pros carries more weight than its list of cons.
For the price tag of ₹49,999 for the single 8GB RAM + 128GB storage variant in India, the Galaxy S20 FE has a strong value proposition. However, there are a few competitors that have even stronger value propositions. The phone is more expensive in the UK and the EU, as it starts off with a 6GB RAM variant and has a higher price tag as well.
The OnePlus 8 Pro, for example, is more expensive at ₹54,999 but has a bigger, higher resolution and better quality display, better performance, better design, better camera image quality, better battery life, and faster charging. The cheaper OnePlus 8T also has a better design, better display, and better performance, but falls behind the Galaxy S20 FE when it comes to camera performance and versatility.
Then we have the newly launched Xiaomi Mi 10T series, which currently offers the most value for users looking for an affordable flagship. The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro has a bigger 6.7-inch 144Hz adaptive refresh rate LCD, smaller bezels, better performance, a larger 5,000mAh battery capacity, and a 108MP primary camera that will probably go head-to-head or even beat the Galaxy S20 FE. It does miss out on a Super AMOLED display and a telephoto camera, but its price tag is only ₹39,999 – that is ₹10,000 cheaper than the Galaxy S20 FE for the same storage configuration. The regular Xiaomi Mi 10T carries over all of the specifications of the Mi 10T Pro except for downgrading the camera to 64MP from 108MP. We also have the ASUS ROG Phone 3 (review), which brings a 6.6-inch 144Hz AMOLED 10-bit HDR10+ display, Snapdragon 865 Plus chip, a huge 6,000mAh battery, and 30W fast charging. On the other hand, its camera system probably isn’t as good as that of the Galaxy S20 FE. If all you need is a flagship Snapdragon chip, phones like the Realme X50 Pro (review) and the iQOO 3 (review) provide the Snapdragon 865 chip for quite a bit less, even though they underwhelm in other areas.
Overall, a crowded field of great competitors makes it tough for the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 4G to differentiate itself. That it can even be talked of in the same conversation as value flagships from the likes of Xiaomi and OnePlus is a great achievement for Samsung on its own.
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE ForumsSprint and T-Mobile continue to shift things around as part of their merger that went through earlier this year. As expected, T-Mobile is now shutting down Sprint's 5G network. T-Mobile started this process back in April and has been refarming Sprint's 2.5GHz spectrum to augment its own 5G network.
We knew this day was coming and...There are a number of digital payment services out there and, of course, Google has their own as well.

This year alone it has added support for boarding passes, money transfers, event tickets,...Google's Android YouTube app has been lacking several of its desktop counterparts feature-set for some time (though the desktop version itself lacks from pretty major features), but it seems that Google is prepared to introduce some new filter options within the YouTube's app's search feature that will now allow you to filter by rating, relevance, and view count....
Google+ prepares to add Link Previews in Comments and the ability to show Low Quality CommentsGoogle Announces Google Pay, a Unified Brand for its Payment Platforms
Google’s launched a lot of digital payment platforms over the years, what with Google Wallet, Android Pay and Pay with Google. Now, in an effort to bring them under one roof, the search giant is rolling out Google Pay, a unified brand for its online and real-world wallets.
For most people, nothing is really changing. Any card or payment system you use with Google will be available across all of Google’s payment systems, such as online checkouts and applications. The Mountain View-based company says that a number of merchants already support this feature, including Airbnb, Dice, Fandango, HungryHouse, and Instacart.
In addition, the Android Pay logo at payment terminals will eventually be replaced by the new G Pay logo, the same logo that’ll be used for all of Google Pay’s online partners. And the same changes will come to Google Tez, an Indian payment application that’s akin to Android Pay. (That’s likely because of India’s requirements regarding the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which Tez supports.)
If you’re a developer looking to support Google Pay on your website, check out to Google’s payment FAQ site or the support pages from Google’s payment processing partners.

There are a lot of advantages to having a web browser on your big-screen television set, especially in social settings where there are multiple people around. Being able to pull up a website, video, or photo on your TV is much more entertaining than passing around a smartphone or tablet, but the user experience of web browsers on a big screen TV isn’t usually best. Mozilla, though, thinks it’s done things right with Firefox for the Fire TV and the Fire TV Stick.
The Fire TV and Fire TV Stick have a handful of web browsers at their disposal. Amazon’s been beta-testing the Silk Web Browser for Fire OS for the better part of this year, and last month finally released a stable a version for the first- and second-generation Fire TV, the second-generation Fire TV Stick, and all models of Element and Westinghouse’s Fire TV Edition televisions.
Now, Amazon’s teamed up with Mozilla to bring Firefox to Fire TV and Fire TV Stick devices. Mozilla says that most of the dev work focused on improving and optimizing the user experience for TVs. (Mark Mayo, Senior Vice President of Firefox at Mozilla, said it had to pass the “‘5 year old [sic] with the remote’ test”). It highlights web video content, but it puts web search and bookmark tools within easy reach.
Firefox is available on second-generation and newer Fire TV and Fire TV Stick devices from the Amazon Appstore, and while it’s localized for U.S. customers, it is available for anyone who wants to give it a whirl.

Google Pay has been rolling out across the world in the last few months after it replaced Android Pay and Google Wallet. It combines the two services, allowing you to save all of your payment details in one service that can be used for tap and pay and also online purchases. Google Pay is now going live in Germany, and with it comes support for four banks – Commerzbank, Comdirect, Wirecard, and N26. Support for online-based Revolut and LBBW will come in the future. Interestingly, one of the largest German banks, Sparkasse, has said that they will not be working with Google and will not be supporting Google Pay.
So where can you use Google Pay in Germany? ADIDAS, Aldi, Hornbach, Kaufland, Lidl, McDonald’s, MediaMarkt, and Saturn are among some of the officially supported brick and mortar retailers, with much more available online too. Anywhere that takes an NFC payment will support the service, so you simply need to look for contactless terminals and most will be able to support it just fine. You’ll be able to simply tap the terminal with your phone so long as your card is registered and the payment should go through. You don’t even need to be online, as everytime you go online the application will download a limited number of tokens that can be used offline for contactless spending.
If you want to get going and are on one of the four supported banks, you simply need to download the Google Pay application and add your cards. You’ll then have to confirm your identity with your bank and you’ll be good to go. You can also use Google Pay for online retailers too, so saving your card in the application will enable you to use it for online shopping retailers such as Ryanair, Deliveroo, and ASOS. If you can, give it a try by installing the application down below.Samsung Partners with PayPal to Add Support in Samsung Pay
PayPal has been busy over the last few months as they work to expand support for its online payment service to other popular alternatives. We recently saw some of these results when Google announced they were partnering with PayPal to let Android Pay users choice PayPal as a payment option. The next month, PayPal announced they were adding Venmo as a payment option within their own service, and today it looks like they’re making their way to Samsung Pay as well.
An announcement has been made on the Samsung Mobile Press website that shows the companies are working together to add PayPal as a payment option within the Samsung Pay application. As far as we can tell, this change hasn’t gone into effect just yet, and will likely come in a future update to the Samsung Pay application. This will allow PayPal users to use Samsung Pay to pay for purchases in applications, online and in stores anywhere Samsung Pay is accepted.
This will be huge for PayPal since Samsung Pay is so widely accepted all over the world due to its NFC and proprietary MST technology. The company has confirmed support for PayPal within Samsung Pay will be made available in the United States first. Samsung did go on to say that PayPal support within Samsung Pay will be coming to other countries “soon,” but did not give a list of where they have plans, or when this expansion could start.
This new partnership will also directly benefit Samsung as support for Samsung Pay will be coming to merchants who use PayPal’s Braintree Direct service. These online merchants will simply need to add a few lines of code to integrate Samsung Pay into their platform.
Are you looking forward to adding your PayPal account to Samsung Pay so you can use it as a payment option? Source: Samsung Mobile PressSamsung Galaxy Tab S7 Review: A Worthy Upgrade
When it comes to Android tablets, Samsung is one of the few OEMs still making products that can attempt to keep up with Apple’s offerings. The Galaxy Tab S6 from last year was inarguably one of the best tablet experiences team Android had on offer. But, due to the way Android works on tablets, it had its fair share of shortcomings. While Samsung has attempted to address some of these issues with its DeX Mode, my experience was quite lackluster when I reviewed the Galaxy Tab S6. This is where the new Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 and Galaxy Tab S7 Plus come in.
Samsung launched the Galaxy Tab S7 duo alongside the Galaxy Note 20 lineup earlier this year in August. And with its latest tablets, Samsung has attempted to fix most of the issues users faced on the Galaxy Tab S6. I’ve been using the Galaxy Tab S7 for about a month, and here’s my experience with Samsung’s latest flagship tablet.

Thoughtful design changes
At first glance, the Galaxy Tab S7 doesn’t look all that different from its predecessor. But upon closer inspection, you can tell that Samsung has put some thought into refining the design this time around. With the Galaxy Tab S7, Samsung seems to have realized that most people will use the tablet in landscape mode, be it for media consumption or productivity.
Therefore, the company has moved the front-facing camera to a more appropriate location, and it now rests at the top of the display when you’re using the tablet in landscape mode. An example of this new approach can also be seen on the back panel, as the Samsung and AKG logos have been adjusted in a similar fashion.
The back panel now also has a slim glass section to house the S Pen which is aligned with the camera module. Since this section is easier to differentiate from the rest of the back panel by touch, placing the S Pen back to charge is a simpler process than it was on the Tab S6.
The LED flash is another handy addition, which can come in handy while scanning documents with the tablet in less than ideal lighting conditions. Lastly, the Galaxy Tab S7 features straighter edges than the Tab S6, which looks cooler but makes the tab a bit less comfortable to hold for longer durations.
Still fantastic for media consumption
The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 features an 11-inch WQXGA (2560×1600) TFT panel that has an aspect ratio of 16:10 and a refresh rate of 120Hz. While it may seem like the display on the Galaxy Tab S7 is a step down from the AMOLED panel on the Tab S6, it’s anything but that.
Looking at the two displays side-by-side, you can easily tell that the one on the Galaxy Tab S7 is brighter and offers better color reproduction. Sure, the blacks don’t look as deep and the battery life may take a minor hit, but I’d much rather pick the faster refresh rate over deeper blacks any day. The display still offers HDR10+ support, and watching HDR content on the tablet is an absolute pleasure.
Much like the Tab S6, the Galaxy Tab S7 features a quad-speaker setup tuned by AKG. The tablet has two speakers on either side and they offer great stereo separation. The audio quality is top-notch, and the speakers can get fairly loud at max volume, making the Galaxy Tab S7 the perfect choice for anyone looking to buy a tablet just for media consumption.
Performance & Productivity
Powered by Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 865 Plus chip and 6GB of RAM, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 is no slouch when it comes to performance. The tablet feels snappier than my Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (Exynos variant) in day to day use, and I faced absolutely no performance issues no matter what I threw at it. As expected, the tablet performs well in synthetic benchmarks too and you can check out the screenshots below for some of the results.
Multi-tasking on the tablet was also a breeze, and I faced no major issues while using it for work for a couple of days. While Android still doesn’t offer a tablet experience as polished as iPadOS, Samsung’s One UI has some cool features that go a long way in making the experience better than stock Android. Over the last year, Samsung has made some significant improvements to its software, and I didn’t experience most of the issues I faced on the Tab S6.
Samsung’s DeX Mode has also improved significantly since the last time I used it. While Chrome still doesn’t open desktop versions of websites by default and prompted me to download Android apps for some Google services, Samsung’s built-in browser opened desktop versions of Google Docs, Slides, and Sheets with no issues. One thing I still missed while using DeX Mode was the ability to split browser tabs and open them in separate windows, which would require launching another instance of the app.
Although Samsung is taking steps in the right direction with DeX Mode, the Galaxy Tab S7 still doesn’t offer the same productivity experience that you can get on a similarly priced Chromebook. On top of that, the DeX Mode is pretty much useless without a keyboard, and the layout isn’t intuitive enough to use with just the touchscreen. So if you’re planning on using the tablet as a laptop replacement, you’ll have to invest in the optional keyboard cover.
A more comfortable typing experience
Speaking of which, Samsung has also updated the keyboard cover for the Galaxy Tab S7 and it’s remarkably better than the one for the Tab S6. First and foremost, Samsung has changed the way the keyboard cover attaches to the tablet. The company seems to have taken user feedback into consideration, and the keyboard cover now attaches to the tablet using magnets.
The keyboard itself has also received some improvements — it’s slightly bigger (thanks, in part, to the larger display on the tablet), the keys are better spaced out, the key travel is noticeably better, and the entire package feels more rigid. Using the tablet with the keyboard cover on an unstable surface still does not induce confidence, but it’s far more stable than the Tab S6 and it can get the job done in a pinch.
Samsung has also made thoughtful additions to the keyboard, and it now has a dedicated button to turn on/off DeX Mode and take screenshots (which can prove to be a bit of a hassle with the usual power button+volume down shortcut). Sadly, the keyboard for the Galaxy Tab S7 still doesn’t include a dedicated function row, but Samsung has added that on the keyboard cover for the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus.
Although I had a better experience with the keyboard this time around, the trackpad on the keyboard cover still needs some fine-tuning. While it is larger and supports multi-finger gestures, the trackpad lacks any form of accidental touch protection. This proved to be a major issue, especially due to the size constraints, and I constantly kept moving the cursor while pressing the Spacebar and Alt keys.
New and improved S Pen
Unlike Apple, Samsung bundles an S Pen with both of its flagship tablets. The S Pen that comes with the Galaxy Tab S7 is just a larger version of the S Pen that ships with the Galaxy Note 20 Series. It offers the same 9ms ultra-low latency and gives you access to the same suite of features that you’d find on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.
Since I’m not much of an artist, I can’t tell you how useful it will prove to be for professional use. But I definitely had fun coloring in PENUP, which comes preinstalled on the tablet. And while I did take some time to get used to writing with the S Pen, I had a great experience taking notes on the tablet during product briefings. As with the Galaxy Tab S6, the S Pen charges wirelessly when placed in its designated position on the back panel.
Decent battery life
The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 packs in a large 8,000mAh battery which was enough to keep it going through a typical workday. On the days when I exclusively used the tablet for work, it was able to deliver an SoT of about 9.5 hours with the refresh rate set to 60Hz and the brightness set to 75%. Switching to 120Hz dropped the SoT to about 7.5 hours with the same use. A typical workday for me usually consists of writing articles, some light photo editing, and checking Slack, Asana, and Gmail for updates in between. In case you do something more performance-intensive, your mileage may vary.
To give you a more objective measurement of the Galaxy Tab S7’s battery life, I also ran PCMark’s Work 2.o Battery Life benchmark. The benchmark was run with the refresh rate set to Adaptive and the brightness set to 75%. And the tablet consistently managed to deliver a score of around 12 hours in multiple runs. But because of the way the benchmark calculates these results, the tablet probably won’t be able to last as long in real-world use. For example, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra manages to deliver a score of 10 hours and 35 minutes in the same test, but my unit rarely ever delivers more than 6 hours of SoT.
As far as charging is concerned, the Galaxy Tab S7 offers support for 45W fast charging. But sadly, Samsung doesn’t ship the tablet with a 45W charger in the box. Instead, the tablet comes with a 15W charger that takes about 2.5 hours to charge the tablet from 10-100%.
Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7?
The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 is a marked improvement over the Galaxy Tab S6, and it still is a great buy for artists and people for a portable media device. But at a starting price of $649.99 / £605 / €681 / ₹55,999 for the Wi-Fi variant, it may seem a bit too expensive for that purpose. However, that’s a premium you’ll have to pay if you want a stunning 120Hz display, flagship performance, and amazing audio. In comparison, the 11-inch iPad Pro with 128GB of storage retails for $799 / £769 / €856.80 / ₹71,900, and that doesn’t even include the Apple Pencil.
If you’re looking to purchase the Galaxy Tab S7 as a laptop replacement, then you’ll have to shell out an extra $199.99 / £189 / €199.90 / ₹13,299 for the keyboard cover. And even then, you might find working on the tablet a bit frustrating due to software limitations. Instead, you can go for a similarly priced Chromebook, like the HP Chromebook x360 14c ($499 / ₹55,999), which will offer a significantly better experience for work thanks to Chrome OS. But if you can look past these software shortcomings, the latest additions in Samsung’s Galaxy Tab lineup remain the best tablets team Android has to offer.
You can buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 from Samsung.com or from Amazon in the U.S., India, the UK, Europe, and other regions. You can purchase the keyboard cover alongside the Tab S7 or independently.The amount of fun you can get out of Google Maps Street View is endless.

The advent of the smart TV gave us quite a few things to enjoy. It allowed us to consolidate (most) of our screen-on time on a single device (without the need to have side-by-side screens), and it has allowed us to do things on our TV’s that we couldn’t do before without the aid of overpriced gaming consoles or computer systems.
On top of that, this trend also gave birth to inexpensive solutions to turn “dumb” TVs into smart ones. One such solution was Google’s answer to Cupertino’s AppleTV, the Chromecast. The little device has not evolved a whole lot since its humble entrance to the market back in July, 2013 (and can be seen by doing a comparison with the latest incarnation of the HDMI dongle). However, it is because of developers like XDA Senior Member rundgong that the device (and owners) has gotten far more bang for the measly US$35 it costs.
The Chromecast is essentially useless without an internet connection, and Google has made sure of this by adding a large number of locks to prevent things like custom firmware. This is in fact, its Achilles’ heel… or at least it was. Enter rCast. This is a custom ROM that basically enables the user to make good use of the internal memory of the Chromecast by enabling local media playback. What is more, the device does not require an internet connection to be able to work. The dev goes on to explain that the ROM uses patched binaries to make the ping to Google servers to be directed to a local server instead.
– cast_shell and net_mgr makes http requests to google servers. I have patched those binaries so they make requests to the local web server instead.
– The device make a dns lookup sent to server 8.8.8.8. I have worked around that by creating an alias for 8.8.8.8 on the local host and run a dns server.
– The device will not finish booting until it has received an updated time from pool.ntp.org. This is fixed by adding pool.ntp.org as 127.0.0.1 in the hosts file, and locally running a sntp server.
Those workarounds will let the device start up normally even when network is missing.
Needless to say, the device must be able to flash custom firmware on it as this is an Eureka-based ROM. Go ahead and try it if you feel like doing something “fun” with your old Chromecast.
You can find more information and the full guide in the rCast original thread.Verizon introduces a new $30 Unlimited Plus plan with 30GB of LTE and 5G access
Verizon on Tuesday introduced a new Unlimited Plus plan for those who need more data on the go for connected devices like tablets. The plan offers 30GB of LTE, double that of the standard Unlimited plan, and access to Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband (mmWave) and eventually their 5G Nationwide (sub-6GHz) network for just $30 per month.
Verizon is angling its new wireless plan as something that will benefit those who are learning to adjust to remote work and education. “Rather than fighting for Wi-Fi, the extra data helps manage increased needs for remote learning or work with a secure and personal connection,” Verizon said in an announcement.
Verizon’s Unlimited device plans are offered in addition to the carrier’s regular wireless plans and are a great option if you need a data connection for devices like tablets, mobile hotspots, laptops and more. With people traveling far less often due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, an additional data plan may be unnecessary until life returns to normal.
Nevertheless, if you have a poor home Internet connection or you simply need a backup in case your connection goes down, Verizon’s new Unlimited Plus plan offers a lot for just $30. And it features 5G connectivity access, which Verizon has aggressively been expanding this year.
In addition to the announcement of Unlimited Plus, Verizon said they’re simplifying their smartwatch plans. You now pay $10 per month to connect your smartwatch to the network, whether it’s through a standalone plan or with NumberShare. Of course, this offer applies to all new smartwatches on the market, including Apple’s new Watch Series 6 and Watch SE.Forums are now open for the Samsung Galaxy A30s, A50s, A70s, M10s, and M30s
Samsung prominently finds itself in the news for its high-quality flagship releases within the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series. But for the rest of the world, Samsung is also synonymous for providing quality options over a wide range of price points. The South Korean company churns out multiple smartphones covering various use cases, hoping to provide the best fit, whatever the need. Earlier in the year, we saw Samsung release new devices in the Galaxy A and Galaxy M series, and these were recently refreshed with “s” releases that upgrade key specifications. In order to provide users with a common area for discussion revolving around these devices, XDA Forums have now been opened for the Samsung Galaxy A30s, Samsung Galaxy A50s, Samsung Galaxy A70s, Samsung Galaxy M10s, and Samsung Galaxy M30s.

Buy Samsung Galaxy A70s from Amazon IndiaFirst Custom ROM Appears for the Nokia Lumia 710
About a month or so ago, XDA Forum Member biktor_gj posted an entire unlock and NAND access method for the Nokia Lumia 800 and 710 series of devices, which are the next of kin in Nokia’s entry into the world of smartphones (being hand held by Microsoft themselves). The complete unlock was accomplished thanks to the collaboration of several devs including XDA Recognized Developer ultrashot. Well, the best thing about having our devices completely unlocked is that it allows them to receive and accept unsigned code such as—oh, I don’t know—custom ROMs!
Thanks to the hard work by XDA Forum Member vova1609, we now have the very first custom Mango ROM for the device. For those of you who have never laid a finger on a WP device, they are locked down beyond all reasonable comprehension, and as such you are very limited in what you can do with it and to it. This custom ROM will allow you to do things such as install XAPs directly from Internet Explorer (for easier side loading than PC-tethered solutions), use various available fixes such as DFT’s Bluetooth file transfer and much more.
As it is the case with most custom work, particularly so on Windows Phone, there is always the chance of bricking the device, so make sure that you have a backup of your device in Zune in case of emergencies, and make sure that you follow the OP’s instructions completely to avoid problems. Please leave some feedback if you do run into bugs.
Change log:
- Full unlocked
- You can install XAP from Internet Explorer
- Bazaar has already installed
- Bluetooth File Transfer by DFT has already installed
- Exclusive wallpapers “metro ROCK”
- Added tethering
- Deleted Nokia’s apps, like Nokia Music
- Added Google and Yandex as search engine
- And more…

Microsoft’s fledgling Xbox Game Streaming (formerly called xCloud) cloud gaming service could be coming to streaming TV sticks in 2021. The console-free arcade launched on Android back in September with dozens of Xbox games playable.
In an interview with Stratechery (via The Verge), Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s Head of Gaming and Xbox, hinted that ‘dongles’ could be part of the roadmap for Xbox Game Pass subscribers.
“I think you’re going to see lower-priced hardware as part of our ecosystem when you think about streaming sticks and other things that somebody might want to just go plug into their TV and go play via xCloud,” said Spencer. “You could imagine us even having something that we just included in the Game Pass subscription that gave you an ability to stream xCloud games to your television and buying the controller.”
As well as streaming sticks, Spencer also hinted at a Platinum tier for Game Pass, which would guarantee access to new Xbox hardware at release. This would be an evolution from the “Xbox All Access” offering, which pairs a console with a subscription.
With the battle for virtualized gaming now in full swing, thanks to the likes of GeForce Now from NVIDIA, Amazon’s Luna, and of course Google Stadia, the idea of a low-cost alternative to an Xbox console is likely to disrupt any projections those other companies had.
Microsoft already partnered with Samsung to promote Xbox Game Streaming, guaranteeing it a huge audience when it left Preview, but low-cost streaming sticks, as we’ve already seen with movies and TV, will drive a lot of interest from households who can’t afford, or don’t want, a full-service gaming console. And don’t think Microsoft has forgotten Apple—a web-based solution for iOS is in the works and due for rollout early next year.
The only problem then will be where to find an input for yet another HDMI port for your streaming stick.AT&T's misleading "5GE" campaign became part of Android when Samsung phones that were updated to Android Pie and One UI began showing the 5GE icon in the status bar. This was a dishonest practice from AT&T as this created the illusion that the technology being referred to in this case, is as superior as 5G,...Google pauses work on Allo in favor of “Chat,” an RCS-based messaging standard
Google’s experimentation with chat apps has turned into a meme among the Android enthusiast community. Just to name a few, there’s been Google Hangouts, Google Voice, Google Allo, Google Talk, and Google+. It seems like the company has tried over and over to dethrone Apple iMessage’s seamless integration across clients, only to fail each time. But now, the company is planning on a major new push it’s calling “Chat” that aims to fix Google’s messaging client mess.
In an exclusive feature on The Verge, Google has revealed that “Chat” will be based on the Universal Profile for Rich Communication Services (RCS). We’ve talked about RCS a few times in the past: The simplest way to describe it is that it’s an evolution of SMS. Google has long worked to get their Android partners and telecommunication carriers to support RCS by including support for RCS in Android Messages, offering the Jibe RCS Cloud Platform, and pushing to standardize the Universal Profile. And now, the company has decided to go all in on RCS with the introduction of “Chat.”
To start off, Google will be diverting all the resources it has invested in Google Allo into Android Messages instead. Android Messages will evolve over time to include support for “Chat” which isn’t a messaging client itself, but rather a carrier-based service based on RCS that brings features that are standard in messaging clients such as Whatsapp, Telegram, and Facebook Messenger to all users of Chat-supported clients such as Android Messages. Features such as read receipts, live typing indicators, high-resolution images/videos, and group texts are to be expected in the evolved Android Messages client and any other Chat-supported client.
Unfortunately, Chat itself won’t support end-to-end encryption, so it’s about as secure as SMS. That is to say, it isn’t secure at all. But it will be backward compatible with SMS, so if the user you are chatting with doesn’t have a Chat-enabled client then the messages will be sent over standard SMS. There’s no word on whether Apple will support this new Google standard for messaging, though The Verge reports that Samsung smartphones will support it through their own messaging app. So far, Microsoft has committed to supporting the RCS Universal Profile (though an RCS-based Windows chat client hasn’t been confirmed), as have a total of 55 carriers and 11 OEMs around the world.
In addition to all the features that RCS is expected to bring to the table, Google will also be upgrading Android Messages with the features that were introduced in Google Allo: Google Assistant integration and GIF search just to name a few. And the previously rumored Android Messages for Web client will soon make its official appearance.
Chat’s development will be led by Anil Sabharwal, the man who led the team behind the excellent Google Photos service. Android Messages, like Hangouts before it, has the user base to pull this off. Google giving up on Allo is long overdue, but it signals the company’s commitment to seeing this new initiative through. We hope that the company will finally be able to solve the problem they’ve faced for over a decade: How to make an easily accessible, yet feature-rich messaging client that everyone wants to use.How an Anime Game’s Root Detection led to the discovery of a Security Vulnerability in phones from LG, OnePlus, Huawei, Xiaomi, and others
The mobile Android operating system is used on over 2 billion devices each month by both regular consumers and tech enthusiasts. Although the number of people who unlock the bootloader and root their smartphones is relatively small when compared to the overall population of Android users, there’s still a lot of us out there on forums like XDA and Reddit. Magisk is an indispensable tool for the tinkering community. It provides systemless root access and has tools like MagiskHide to enable rooted users to continue using the apps, games, and services they enjoy without restrictions. However, a popular Anime game has been cleverly abusing a system security vulnerability to bypass Magisk’s anti-root detection. Here’s how that works and which devices are affected by this security vulnerability.
- A game has used a bug to detect if a device has been rooted. If the device is rooted, the game blocks the user from playing.
- The bug allows an app to read the status of other apps in memory, without needing any special permissions. The bug does not allow apps to steal any data from other apps. The bug is not severe and is fairly harmless.
- Google is already aware of the issue and has updated their testing tools to make sure that all devices are protected.
Background
A popular Anime game called Fate/Grand Order blocks rooted users from attempting to play the game. XDA Recognized Developer topjohnwu, the lead developer of Magisk, previously discovered a way to bypass Fate/Grand Order’s root detection, but his solution was not working on his OnePlus 6 despite his best efforts. Determined not to give up, the developer analyzed Fate/Grand Order to figure out how it was still detecting root on his OnePlus device. As he explains in his Medium post, this led him to the discovery of a security vulnerability that Fate/Grand Order was seemingly abusing to continue detecting root access on OnePlus devices.
Procfs and Android
On Unix-based operating systems, there’s a special filesystem called “procfs” containing information on processes (think apps) such as their memory usage (think RAM), status (whether the process is running, sleeping, etc.). On most Unix-based operating systems, the user and apps have easy access to procfs to see what kinds of apps and services are running on their system (think of it like Window’s Task Manager.) However, Google began to lock down access to procfs starting in Android 7.0 Nougat. Before Android Nougat, apps like SystemPanel were able to collect data on what apps were running without needing any special permissions. After Android Nougat, apps need to use APIs like UsageStats or AccessibilityService, both of which are gated by permissions that must be granted by the user.
Google prevents apps from reading the status of other apps via procfs by mounting /proc with the flag “hidepid=2.” By mounting procfs with hidepid=2, apps can only see the status of their own process. Thus, an app would need to use the accepted APIs like UsageStats or AccessibilityService to gain information on what apps and services are running on the device.
Vulnerability
What if procfs isn’t mounted with hidepid=2? Well, then apps would freely be able to read the status of other apps (and mount points) running on the system without needing any extra permissions*. Google mounts procfs with hidepid=2 on their own devices, but they don’t enforce this requirement on devices from other manufacturers. Several devices from LG, OnePlus, Huawei/Honor, Xiaomi, and others have not been mounting procfs with hidepid=2, which is what apps like Fate/Grand Order take advantage of to detect whether Magisk is present on the device.
*A security change in Android 9 Pie prevents apps from reading information outside of their own “SELinux context” because every app is now isolated individually. SELinux is a kernel module that acts as a gatekeeper of sorts, blocking apps and services from accessing files they’re not supposed to. A SELinux context is like a label for a file which has information like the user and role. Apps with the same SELinux context can read information about other apps in the same context if the hidepid=2 flag is not enabled for procfs. On devices running Android 9 Pie, only apps that are built targeting Android Pie will have Android Pie’s new SELinux changes apply to them. Apps that target Android 8.1 Oreo or below will use the old SELinux rules, allowing them to access information about processes in the same SELinux context so long as procfs is mounted without hidepid=2. Most apps running on your device should at least be targeting Android 8.0 Oreo thanks to new Google Play requirements, but many won’t have been updated to target Android Pie just yet.
The following screenshots show the consequences of not mounting procfs with hidepid=2.
How bad is this?
If we were to compare this system vulnerability to exploits like Fusée Gelée, Blueborne, KRACK, and Meltdown/Spectre, then this bug pales in comparison. Apps can’t use this to gain root access or steal your passwords. Your banking accounts are safe, and so are your credit cards. The worst an app can do is tell whether another app is running on your device, which has very limited uses. Remember that this is standard behavior on many GNU/Linux distributions and that Google only recently started blocking access to procfs with Android Nougat. This bug allows apps to bypass needing certain permissions to monitor other processes, but they still can’t break Android’s sandbox and steal data from other apps. Regardless, this is unintended behavior and breaks a privacy feature of Android, so it must be fixed.
Is my device affected?
Here is a list of devices that we have found to not mount procfs with hidepid=2:
|OEM||Device||Android Version||procfs Leaks|
|Asus||ZenFone 5Z||Android 8.0 Oreo||Yes|

|Xiaomi||Mi Mix 2S||Android 9 Pie||Yes|
|Xiaomi||POCO F1||Android 8.1 Oreo||Yes|
How to check if your device is affected
It’s quite easy to check if your device is leaking process information to other apps (in other words, procfs is not mounted with hidepid=2). While you can use shell commands like we did, you can also check using an app that topjohnwu developed. His app also allows you to remount procfs with hidepid=2, if your phone is rooted.

Will there be a fix?
Yes, this will be fixed. Google will now be requiring that all devices mount procfs with hidepid=2. They will enforce this by updating the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS), a set of tests that all devices must pass to be able to use Google Play apps and services. All OEMs (that want to sell devices with the Google Play Store pre-installed) must eventually issue an update to remount procfs with hidepid=2 in the near future. Since OnePlus devices were the first to be discovered with this issue, OnePlus has already been made aware and is working on a fix. We’ll update this article if other OEMs comment on this bug, but there’s no need to wonder whether your device’s OEM will issue an update. If they want their update to pass CTS, then they must fix this bug.Android Pay To Be Launched In Taiwan In June
Android Pay is scheduled to enter the Taiwanese market on June 1, according a Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN) report. Initially, Google’s mobile payment service will be supported by three local banks. Nevertheless, support for additional banks should expand in time according to the report.
Currently, customers in Taiwan can use Apple Pay for mobile wireless payments. The service has been available for seven local banks since late March, but Android Pay is poised to join the race two months later.
Android Pay was announced at Google I/O in 2015. The service uses NFC communication to transmit card information facilitating funds transfer to the retailer. Since its premiere, Google has successfully launched Android Pay in many countries, and if the report by EDN is true, then Taiwan will be the thirteenth country with support for Android Pay.
The most noteworthy part of this news is that Android devices are incredibly popular in Taiwan. According to the paper, 80 percent of smartphones in the region run this system. This is mostly thanks to the fact that Taiwan is the home market to the likes of smartphone giants HTC and ASUS.
Android Pay will be available for clients of CTBC Bank, First Bank, and Bank SinoPac, per the report. CTBC Bank alone issued six million credit cards, so there is a lot of market potential to be captured by Google. Clients of these banks will soon have an option to utilize the NFC in their devices for mobile payments.

They are also backed by either Woot!’s 90-day warranty or the manufacturer warranty, so if you happen to get a monitor that gives out after a couple of weeks, you can exchange it or get a refund, pain-free.

A lot of tasks and services these days are tied either to an email account or our phone number to authenticate our identity before proceeding. As a result, we often get a load of OTPs (One Time Passwords) through the weeks — for every time you log into the service on a new device, for when you access the service, and in several countries, whenever you make payments through internet banking, and credit and debit cards. These OTPs can start clogging your inbox and make it difficult to find messages that do warrant your attention at a later date. Google seems to have taken cognizance of this issue, as the latest Google Messages update prepares to let you automatically delete OTPs after 24 hours of receipt.
Google Messages v6.7.067 contains the following new strings:
<string name="otp_auto_deletion_promo_banner_body_text">Auto-delete OTPs after 24hrs</string> <string name="otp_auto_deletion_promo_banner_negative_button_text">No thanks</string> <string name="otp_auto_deletion_promo_banner_positive_button_text">Continues</string> <string name="otp_content_description">This message is categorized as a one-time password</string>
According to these strings, Google Messages is working on a feature that will automatically delete OTP messages after 24 hours from their receipt. OTPs by very nature are temporary in nature, with most of them being valid for a short time duration of 10 minutes or so, depending on the needs of the service. Once this validity period expires, there’s little use to be derived from keeping these messages around. Users may also not always remember deleting these messages once they are done, so automatically deleting them after a day seems to be a useful addition.
Other OEMs have resorted to decluttering the primary inbox by displaying OTPs and other promotional messages in a separate secondary inbox. Google’s approach to decluttering appears to be better as OTPs practically have no future utility. The feature will likely roll out as an option, so if you do want to keep your OTP messages around, you should be covered too.S Voice Back Again, the XDA Way
Earlier, we reported that the S Voice application that was ripped from the Samsung Galaxy SIII leak had stopped functioning. Now though, in what appears to be the final chapter of the S Voice saga, the application is back up and running, XDA-Developers style thanks to XDA Senior Member ithehappy.
Apparently the original application had a build.prop check that caused the unsigned version that was leaked to fail. Rather than griping to Samsung about the problem, ithehappy took it upon himself to fix the problem with his latest signed version here. By signing the application, it’s fooled into thinking that your phone is a Galaxy S3, so non-SGS3 users can once again use their
Siri clone voice command application in peace.
Head on over to the original thread, and check out all the other i9300 goodies that ithehappy has in store.The iPhone 12 is the rocket booster that 5G desperately needs
One of the things that have always impressed me about iPhones is the degree to which they are part of the mainstream cultural discourse. When Apple introduces a new iPhone, the news is covered not just by tech media, but even lifestyle or general news outlets. It’s a level of relevance that most other phone brands often fail to garner – although Samsung is often heavily covered, it seems like everyone has something to say when Apple makes an announcement.
And so, by the time you’re reading this, you will have heard that Apple has announced four models in the new iPhone 12 family, and one of their major new features is that they all support 5G.
This is great news for everyone in the mobile industry, from carriers to Qualcomm and even rivals like Samsung, because they’ve all been driving the 5G hype train — even if 5G isn’t quite ready for prime time. But now that Apple is doing it, 5G is going to get that much-needed boost.
5G is here! Well, kind of…
Technically speaking, 5G has been available in the US for over a year, but it’s partially here practically and realistically speaking. Speeds for sub-6 5G (used by T-Mobile and AT&T) are, for the most part, just a bit faster than 4G, and in some cases, slower. Then there’s the mmWave 5G that Verizon has deployed, and while it’s actually noticeably fast – we’ve received upwards of 2Gbps connected to Verizon’s fastest network – reception areas are extremely limited.
In fact, Verizon used the iPhone 12 launch show as a platform to announce it, too, is launching a sub-6 network, one that’s slower but will at least cover “nationwide.” It’s unlikely Verizon has magically been able to work out the kinks slowing down AT&T and T-Mobile’s sub-6 5G, so chances are, in the immediate future, the state of 5G remains mostly unchanged.
Normally, if something has been hyped this much and fails to deliver at even the most basic level, consumers would revolt. Imagine how mad you’d be if you purchased a Tesla that still needs gas or a Galaxy Fold that couldn’t fold. You’d flip out.
The fact that there hasn’t been much pushback against the sad state of 5G in the US shows that, for the most part, the average person doesn’t know much, nor do they care about 5G. Samsung, LG, and Motorola may have been releasing 5G phones stateside for well over a year, and every carrier and phone store in the US are plastered with banners advertising 5G. Still, for the most part, people don’t care yet — until the iPhone 12.
When Apple does something, the mobile industry follows
A couple of years ago, I interviewed the CEO of Anker, Steven Yang, and he told me he wishes Apple would make the switch to USB-C because, in his words, “once Apple does it, the entire industry follows and USB-C instantly becomes the norm.” it’s true. Think about FaceTime. Video calling had existed in various apps long before Apple introduced their take, but it wasn’t until Apple did it that video calling took off, at least in North America. The same can be said for true wireless earbuds. Almost a year before the AirPods made their debut, German brand Bragi and Chinese start-ups had already released wireless earbuds. But the market did not take off until after the AirPods.
Today, AirPods are synonymous with wireless earbuds and ubiquitous around the world. And since we’re on the topic of the AirPods, remember when the headphone jack was a no-brainer, must-include port in all electronic devices? Apple killed it; people, including media and fans, complained loudly; but ultimately, Apple won anyway — the headphone jack is dead in smartphones.
Now that the latest iPhones not only support 5G, but Apple is actively hyping it? It’s going to be a game-changer for the industry. The average person will want to know what 5G is now and perhaps start asking questions when their iPhone 12s are connected to 5G networks that don’t bring the noticeable improvements in data speeds that every carrier tries to extol as the benefits of 5G.
How will the iPhone 12 5G spur carriers into action?
Consider other features like visual voicemail, iMessage, and eSIMs. Each of these was a feature that Apple developed and received widespread support from carriers for almost immediately. Considering the sheer number of iPhones sold every year, the iPhone is the number one smartphone that can spur carriers into action.
The same will ultimately apply to 5G and the iPhone 12. The technology isn’t fleshed out, but until now, most people didn’t care about 5G. It’s a well-known industry secret that iPhone customers offer significantly higher Average Revenue Per User – one of the key metrics that partners and carriers look at – meaning Apple users spend more than Android users. This also means that Apple can exert a certain amount of influence over carriers – we’ve seen that with Apple’s tight control of pricing ever since the first iPhone. Now, they need to figure out how they can make meaningful improvements to 5G in a short space of time.
How can they do it? An AT&T spokesperson told the Washington Post it could aggregate more 4G spectrum for 5G to boost speeds (Sub-6 5G essentially share the same spectrum as 4G LTE right now). “Densification” of 5G signals – increasing the volume of signals in a given space – is another method that’s been proposed and is how Verizon has approached the ultra-wideband part of its network.
Whatever they end up doing, the pressure is now on for carriers to deliver data speeds that are actually, you know, fifth-generation. As the iPhone now supports it, Apple’s marketing arm will make the mainstream general public want it. As Steve Jobs once said, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them, and we can trust that Apple will make people want 5G.
