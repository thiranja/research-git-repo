<p> Top 10 Best Value Smartphones You Can Buy Right Now – July 2019 </p>
<p> With dozens of big manufacturers unleashing a slew of devices every year, choosing a new smartphone isn’t necessarily an easy task. Making matters worse, there seem to be fewer differences between any given gadget in terms of performance and features with each passing year. </p>
<p> Now, the best smartphone on the market for you isn’t necessarily going to be the one you need to throw the most money at to own — the flagships. Those flagship ‘top tier’ devices are increasing in price too, now often costing more than or close to $1,000 and that’s just not affordable even on wireless contract with a payment plan. </p>
<p> It bears pointing out that in the mid-range and value categories, the word “best” is subjective. Here at Android Headlines, we spend a lot of time playing with and examining every smartphone that hits the market. So while it’s a subjective matter, we’re also well informed about what’s great and what’s not so good. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So without further ado, here are the ten very best smartphones we could find that are available now and which fall below the somewhat restrictive, arguably unnecessary ‘premium’ cost barrier. </p>
<p> 10 Huawei P30 Lite </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At just $262.99 on Amazon as of this writing and powered by a relatively powerful Kirin 710 SoC backed by 128GB storage and 4GB RAM, Huawei's P30 Lite really deserves to be placed higher in the recommendations. </p>
<p> The reason it isn't ranked higher comes down to the fact that there is no guarantee the Huawei P30's more affordable sibling — or that more premium counterpart — will ever see sustained updates. Setting aside problems the OEM has been having in the west and its rollercoaster ride between being banned outright and allowed to do business with U.S. companies, this is a brilliant handset. </p>
<p> Beyond pure specifications, the Huawei P30 Lite delivers a long-lasting fast-charging battery, dual-SIM capabilities, and Android 9 Pie just for starters. A triple camera array allows the P30 Lite to follow in the footsteps of its pricier namesake gadget too, with modern amenities such as a fingerprint scanner and large 6.1-inch nearly bezel-free OLED display panel at the front. </p>

<p> While not officially available via any U.S. carriers, the global 4G LTE-enabled GSM variant is available to purchase in the region in all three of its style-savvy colors. </p>
<p> 9 Nokia 7.1 </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The oldest handset on the list, Nokia's Android One-equipped Nokia 7.1 is among the most premium gadgets Nokia has ever launched and released for sale in the U.S. but it only costs $299 on Amazon and brings quite a lot to the table with it. </p>
<p> The Nokia 7.1 features a capable mid-range Snapdragon 636 SoC and that's backed up by 4GB memory and 64GB storage running completely pure Android 9 Pie. Those aspects are going to be the biggest draws for users as is the fact that this handset will keep getting updates a while longer thanks to its participation in the Android One program and that includes regular security updates. </p>
<p> USB-C, NFC connectivity for quick mobile payments, Bluetooth 5.0, a fingerprint sensor, and a few advanced camera features are packed into the Nokia 7.1's full HD+ 5.8 PureView display-topped frame too. So despite only coming with reasonably decent cameras and moderate battery life, this is going to be a device that's still worth considering for those that don't want to spend quite as much as it will take to pick up other gadgets listed here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> 8 Xiaomi Mi 9 SE </p>
<p> Landing on the market back in February as the younger sibling of the Xiaomi Mi 9, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE is a mid-range handset powered by one of Qualcomm's best middle-of-the-road processors. It also comes bearing a fifth-generation in-display fingerprint scanner, a screen-to-body display ratio of 84.1-percent, and among the most unique color configurations available for those who want a gadget with real personality. Blue, Violet, and Dark gradients are available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With a whopping 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE is a bit more capable than others on this list in many ways — especially when it comes to truly intensive apps and multitasking. With a cost just short of $314 and a full HD+ screen size of just 5.97-inches it's among the least expensive and smallest, too. </p>
<p> The biggest caveat to the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE is that like many other Chinese-built handsets, it simply isn't widely available and it isn't meant for use in the U.S. in any official capacity. The above-mentioned characteristics of this device and its low cost coupled with a tri-camera setup at the back and a respectable 20-megapixel snapper at the front make this 4G handset one that's well worth considering, irrespective of that fact. </p>
<p> 7 Razer Phone 2 </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Razer Phone 2 is not only considered by many to be one of the best values in mobile. It's the only dedicated gaming smartphone with a price tag suitable for the value market — at just shy of $500. </p>
<p> Last year's premier flagship chipset, the Snapdragon 845, is also packed beneath the Razer Phone 2's metal and glass facade with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage with a wireless-charging compatible 4,000mAh capacity battery. The display that glass in question is topping is just an LCD panel rather than OLED or AMOLED but that's hardly going to be a big deal since the refresh rate comes in at a still-staggering 120Hz. </p>
<p> That all stacks up to drive an almost pure version of Android for super buttery visuals, especially when playing mobile games. A uniquely-styled frame, rated at IP67 for dust and water resistance means that play doesn't have to stop for a bit of rain or a windy day outdoors either. Meanwhile, a dual 12-megapixel camera is neatly accented by 8-megapixels at the front for more day-to-day use. </p>
<p> This is going to be the one to pick up if mobile gaming prowess is an absolute must without leaving the mid-range category. </p>
<p> 6 ASUS Zenfone 6 </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 6 is a smartphone that, at first glance, doesn't stand out from the crowd and its €499 price tag wouldn't seem to give any indication that it does either. </p>
<p> The device comes in a fairly standard candy bar shape, with a logo on the back just below the fingerprint scanner, a nearly bezel-free 6.4-inch full HD+ Gorilla Glass 6 screen. Also on the back, buyers will find yet another device for which the widely popular Sony flagship IMX586 48-megapixel dual Quad Pixel camera sensor is in play. </p>
<p> A closer inspection of this handset, which doesn't appear to have any official support in the U.S. but is available pretty much everywhere else, that camera isn't the usual fare though. Instead of a standard selfie snapper, ASUS stepped out of the box to place its primary shooter on a rocker that can be kicked forward completely or to a variety of degrees. </p>
<p> That makes the ASUS ZenFone 6 camera useful for selfies or for use with proprietary specialty shooting modes in other configurations. That also means that there's no traditional selfie camera taking up space in either a notch or a punch hole, giving this smartphone one of the highest screen-to-body ratios in its bracket — at 92-percent. </p>
<p> Moreover, that's rounded out with the best available smartphone chipset and a respectable amount of both RAM and storage. </p>
<p> 5 Sony Xperia 10/10 Plus </p>
<p> Priced at just under $350 and $430 respectively, the Sony Xperia 10 and 10 Plus are real contenders in the mid-range segment of the Android ecosystem. They're also not quite like the others on this list in that they envision large full HD+ resolution display panels — at 6-inches and 6.5-inches, in this case — quite differently from other OEMs. </p>
<p> The internal specs are nothing to scoff at with Sony's middle-of-the-road offerings either, thanks to the use of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 630 and Snapdragon 636 backed by either 3GB or 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. Batteries in the devices are laudable too at 2,870mAh and 3,000mAh for the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus but the screens are the real differentiator. </p>
<p> Those are significantly taller than other handsets at a ratio of 21:9, allowing for a more natural view when apps are used in multi-windowed modes. Sony's experience in other areas of the tech world shines through here too, with the company bringing together its various units to include some of the best audio and camera capabilities around. </p>
<p> 4 Samsung Galaxy A50 </p>
<p> Samsung’s Galaxy A50 is among the first of the South Korean tech giant’s 'A-series' devices to be brought to the U.S. and, aside from its $350 price tag, only just barely qualifies as a mid-range handset. </p>
<p> That's because the device's oversized 4,000mAh capacity battery, dual-aperture camera array — including a 123-degree ultra-wide-angle lens — and 6.4" Super AMOLED edge-to-edge Infinity-U display panel are just the beginning of features more well-suited for a flagship. Unlocking the handset is going to closely resemble its Galaxy 10-series' top model too, thanks to an in-display fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Samsung has also equipped this budget-friendly powerhouse with its Android 9 Pie-based OneUI for intuitive, easy interactions with the operating system and apps. </p>
<p> Plenty of storage space is provided to house all of those applications as well, backing up a respectable level of memory that's on par with some of last year's flagships as well as a rock-solid processor. For Samsung fans that need a new mid-ranger, this is going to be the one to buy for now. </p>
<p> 3 Moto Z4 </p>
<p> The Moto Z4 is a mid-range semi-modular smartphone with a $499 price tag unlocked and a near-stock Android 9 Pie experience. </p>
<p> It’s also guaranteed to get an update to Android Q, according to Motorola — even if no further firmware updates are expected — and will do 5G networking on Verizon’s network with the purchase of a moto mod. Bearing that in mind, the ability to link up magnetic attachments for a better camera, battery life, or other extra functionality like projecting movies or capturing 360 photos and video is not what sets the Z4 apart. </p>
<p> That comes down to its 2-day battery life and strong performance compared to last year’s model, as well as the inclusion of a camera that really seems to be looking to rival Google’s Pixel handsets — up to and including low-light shots. </p>
<p> For photography buffs who want a bit of expandability or added capability via add-on gadgets, coupled with a brilliant screen and a truly unique design language, the Moto Z4 is going to be a great option. </p>
<p> 2 OnePlus 7 </p>
<p> Starting at just under $532 on Amazon, for now, the OnePlus 7 has mostly been overshadowed by the more expensive and more drastically changed — compared to last year's OnePlus 6T — OnePlus 7 Pro. In fact, it looks almost identical to that previous handset and delivers the same specs in terms of RAM, with double the storage at 256GB. </p>
<p> That means the OnePlus 6T may be the better deal for those that don't need the latest processor, although it certainly doesn't make the OnePlus 7 any less worthy of consideration in the mid-range price bracket. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, OnePlus also made the decision to go all-out with a top-tier Snapdragon 855 SoC this year, used a notch instead of the mechanical pop-up camera in the larger device, and has not promised availability everywhere — including in the States. </p>
<p> Summarily, that all has driven up the usual price point to approximately $600, making it difficult to justify recommending this smartphone for those in the market for a true value-focused smartphone too. The specs and pricing here mean that OnePlus has, at least for this generation of devices, effectively left its "flagship killer" origins well behind itself, in favor of just releasing a flagship. </p>
<p> Having said that, at its current pricing, it definitely deserves its number two spot on this list. </p>
<p> 1 Google Pixel 3a/3a XL </p>
<p> Google’s Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL may have struggled to hold momentum in the months since its launch but the search giant hit a home run with its mid-ranger sister series. </p>
<p> Not only are the Google Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL easily the best value in mobile devices today, regardless of which variant is purchased. They are also arguably going to be the best mobile devices that money can buy to suit just about anybody’s needs. </p>
<p> Touting practically identical specifications, the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL are equipped with moderately powerful octa-core processors, ample RAM, and plenty of storage. They each also feature the same best-in-class cameras and software found on their older siblings, while keeping the headphone jack abandoned by those more expensive gadgets. </p>
<p> The key difference between the handsets lies in the Pixel 3a’s 5.6-inch FHD+ OLED display and 3,000mAh battery, as compared to its larger counterpart’s 6.0-inch panel and 3,700mAh battery. The larger gadget also abandons the often unfavorable notch in favor of larger bezels. </p>
<p> That’s all coupled with modern features such as a truly trendsetting night photo mode called “Night Sight,” squeezable active edge functionality, and a promise to always have the latest Android firmware version and security. Each operates on any of the major carriers in the U.S. and plenty of others worldwide too, so there can really be no doubt these are the smartphones to buy for value at just $399 or $479 direct from Google. </p>

<p> 12 Apps Everybody Should Consider For Their Chromebook </p>
<p> With start-up times at under 10-seconds on average and support for Linux, Android apps, and Web Apps, the Chromebook platform is ripe for those who want an easy-to-use computer. But getting started in a new ecosystem is never easy, especially with differences in software between any given computer platform. </p>
<p> Here, we're examining some of the best apps to download for those who want to make the transition a bit easier and see what a Chromebook is capable of. </p>
<p> Why are these apps the best for a Chromebook? </p>
<p> It bears pointing out that these apps, in particular, are not necessarily going to be the best for every user. There are plenty of more in-depth, comprehensive apps out there for professionals who need apps in any of these categories. Instead, this is a list of apps that could feasibly make the experience better for the non-professional, general userbase. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Chromebook-ready games and productivity apps aren't going to be the primary focus here either. </p>
<p> In fact, I'm going to focus very little on productivity here since G Suite is installed right out-of-the-box. Chromebooks are, by and large, still meant to be web machines. So, even for those services that aren't included as part of the bundle, such as Gmail, it's going to be just as easy to go view those online. And many of those can be downloaded as a PWA. So they can be accessed to a certain extent offline. </p>
<p> Similarly, many of these apps are Google-built or made by one of Google's many subdivisions. That's because put plainly, Google apps are going to be some of the best available on a Chromebook. And it goes without saying that there are going to be many apps that I've missed for this list. So users will want to explore the Chrome Web Store, Google Play Store, and elsewhere if these apps don't quite align with what they're looking for. </p>

<p> Photo editing & compressing apps on the Chromebook platform </p>
<p> One of the biggest drawbacks to any Chromebook is that even the best devices don't support full desktop photo editing apps. Of course, that doesn't mean anybody needs to forego the ability to edit, compress, or even watermark images. But it does mean that some of the functionality is going to be split across multiple apps. </p>
<p> On the other side of that, many Chromebooks either come with or have available a precision stylus. Especially now that universal stylus support is beginning to hit shelves. That means that some of the best art apps on the market can now be used with a wide number of Chromebook devices. </p>
<p> Here, we'll cover some of the best apps on offer in the category. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> SQUOOSH </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Where to buy: Squoosh.app </p>
<p> When Google launched Squoosh back in 2018, it was billed as an experiment. The app is, in effect, a photo compressor and light editor built on a PWA platform. So it works in any instance of Chrome and, on a Chromebook, is also going to be one of the best compressor apps to download. </p>
<p> That's because image compression is still this app's best feature — easily taking multi-megabyte photos down to just kilobytes. And it does so with a real-time-updating, zoomable preview so that users can see exactly what they're going to download. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Another great feature here is Squoosh's ability to perform minor edits. Those all center around compression and file-sizing, but this app does it all in a matter of mere moments. Changing compression and t0-scale-resizing methods is part of the package. As are deeper edits to smoothing, quantization, color channels, and quality. </p>
<p> Across each feature, Squoosh never slows down. And although it's a web-based PWA, updating periodically with new features and for a better experience, it's also completely usable entirely offline. Users simply need to navigate to the URL "squoosh.app" to get started from their Chrome browser. </p>
<p> Photoshop Express </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google Play Store </p>
<p> As its branding implies, Photoshop Express is Adobe's mobile version of its premier photo editing software. It isn't, by any means, as fully featured as the full desktop variant. But it will go quite a long way toward accomplishing the tasks most users would want to get done. </p>
<p> That's because Adobe has distilled its full software to something more manageable on the fly. So users can quickly select a photo or photos, add color effects, adjust filters or crop, skew, and adjust the tilt. Conversely, it also offers ready access to mobile Lightroom, as well as color corrections, tone splitting, blur, bokeh effects, and vignetting. And all of that stacks atop text adding, collage creation, frames, red-eye corrections, and pet eye corrections. </p>
<p> Put simply, this app is close enough to Photoshop that most users should see some benefit to having it installed. Especially, if they hope to use their Chromebook as their primary computer, Photoshop Express is going to be one of the best apps around for photo editing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Autodesk SketchBook </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google Play Store </p>
<p> At first glance, Autodesk SketchBook doesn't seem like a complex tool. And it's free, so it may be difficult to believe its one of the best apps around for art on a Chromebook. But it is and it accomplishes that easily. That's because this app, in recent years, took a plethora of paid features previously reserved for premium account holders and made them free. For everybody. </p>
<p> Now, it's possible to use this app to draw or write in a straightforward pen-and-paper fashion. Or, users can access the sidebar, image import tools, layering system, and more to create a full-blown masterpiece. The app features dozens of brushes across a variety of categories for 'sketching' out everything from comic-style characters to landscape oil paintings. And it features hundreds of customization levels across each brush. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That's setting aside mirroring, image selection tools, shape and line entry, perspective grids, rulers, timelapse creations, exporting, and a host of other features. Summarily, Autodesk SketchBook is a fully-featured art kit in digital form and it's absolutely free. So, whether with a stylus or a finger, users who love art — and those interested in getting started — are going to love this app. </p>
<p> PhotoStack 2 </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google Play Store </p>
<p> PhotoStack 2 is, as its branding implies, a second-generation photo tool from the web. Like Squoosh, it's a PWA. But it comes somewhat more fully-featured than its Google-built counterpart. Or at least it does in terms of what it does beyond basic 1 to 100 image compression. </p>
<p> To begin with, it also offers image resizing with scale reductions or increases based on maintained ratio and a desired image width input. Users can also fine-tune the sharpness of images, so opening up Photoshop isn't really necessary just to accomplish that. Another feature not found in Photoshop Express is watermarking, making this one of the few PWAs or desktop-level applications for a Chromebook that can accomplish that task. </p>
<p> Otherwise, PhotoStack 2 is a fairly straightforward app. The tool offers the ability to add borders, remove EXIF data, and export in either .jpg, .png, or .webp formats. Users can download the tool by navigating to the "photostack.app" URL. </p>
<p> Communication apps can make or break the Chromebook experience </p>
<p> Communications via a Chromebook, work similarly to how Android does. Users can even link up the Google-built Messages app to send and receive texts and MMS via their Chrome OS gadgets. But we'll get to that in a moment. </p>
<p> Now, Google Meet and chat would be obvious go-to's here. But they're already built directly into Gmail. So, chances are, if you're using those, you'll already be accessing them there in the Chrome browser. The same can be said of social media, more often than not better accessed via the web interface, than an app and something most users will already be accessed via the Chrome browser. The web is generally just a better interface for those services. </p>
<p> But there are a couple of other communication apps that are well worth a look for those on a Chromebook. Including some that work for Chromebook and are already some of the best messaging apps on Android. </p>
<p> Messages </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google Play Store </p>
<p> The Messages app is Google's text and picture-messaging app for Android. It's built on RCS, so chats work more in-line with web chats than with text messaging. And it should be built into most Chromebooks right out of the box. For others, it's a download away on the Google Play Store for free. </p>
<p> In that regard, it isn't necessarily something users will need to download and install but is something they may not be aware of. To use Messages, users simply need to open the app on both their phone and their Chromebooks. On their phone, in the three-dot overflow menu, users need to choose the "Messages for Web" option. Then they need to scan the QR code in the app on their Chromebook. </p>
<p> Afterward, users are able to use Messages on their Chromebook exactly as they would on their phone. That comes complete with gif, images, video, emoji, and sticker support. As well as integration with another app on this list, Google Duo, for video calls. </p>
<p> These are text messages, served up via the newly-linked phone. So one of the biggest benefits is that it provides an easy way to text while using a Chromebook via RCS chat without having to pick the phone up once the link is established. </p>
<p> Telegram </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google Play Store </p>
<p> For those who want to get a bit more from their messaging via one of the best, most secure web-based apps available anywhere, Telegram is going to be the obvious choice. Especially when it comes to self-destructing, encrypted messaging. </p>
<p> But Telegram isn't at all just about security. The app comes with custom theme options that should make just about any tech-savvy user happy. And there are interactive elements such as polling, video calls, bots, gifs, group chats, and more. Chats and groups can be sorted, file sharing is effectively unlimited in terms of size, and voice messages are included. </p>
<p> When it comes to stickers, Telegram has effectively rewritten the game. The app offers everything from cutesy, expressive animated stickers to serious ones. And the user-generated library of those grows every day, with additions from the pop-culture derived to NSFW entries for more private conversations. </p>
<p> Zoom </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Up to $20 per month for plans with enterprise features </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google Play Store or Chrome Web Store </p>
<p> Zoom is an obvious choice for entry on this list because it's easily one of the most professional video group calling apps around. Designed chiefly as a means to host meetings, Zoom allows up to 100 participants at once. For free. And it's poured quite a lot of effort into ensuring those group meetings are well-organized, high-quality, and easy-to-use. </p>
<p> Additionally, the web app or Android app can readily be used for other purposes. For instance, for a virtual family get-together. And the experience comes complete with screen sharing, meeting protections, and instant messaging. As well as a variety of options for video backgrounds and more. </p>
<p> All of that equates to an easy tool for chatting with larger groups for business or for fun. And makes it easy to see why Zoom skyrocketed in popularity over the past several months. </p>
<p> Duo </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google Play Store </p>
<p> Google Duo, as noted above, is a very nearly little more than a pack-in feature for Messages. But it takes things significantly further than that too. While it won't support quite so many participants as Zoom, users are treated to a straightforward interface. That, in effect, allows Duo to work more like a phone-based video chatting service than a web-based one. With users given the ability, for free, to place video calls like normal calls, all from the Chromebook. </p>
<p> The extra features included here are nearly on-par with Zoom too. That includes security that's in place to keep Duo calls safe. But it also includes more fun features like backdrops, filters, animated stickers, and even video message sending. The latter can be sent with or without those other features in place. </p>
<p> The fact that it integrates so easily with Messages means it's likely going to be the best option in terms of video calling apps and a must-have for those using that Chromebook feature. </p>
<p> Entertainment apps and more for a Chromebook </p>
<p> Most apps users will likely utilize for entertainment and other purposes already have a heavy web presence. And the best of those are packed in as part of Google Drive, which is arguably going to be the primary storage place for those on Chromebooks. And if it isn't, it should be for a wide variety of reasons. Not least of all because Chromebooks automatically start clearing storage if it gets too full. </p>
<p> But there are a few extras that can help stay productive and entertained too. Some of the best of those apps, users may not have considered downloading or using on their Chromebook. </p>
<p> Google Keep </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google Play Store </p>
<p> Google Keep is not one of Google's most popular applications. But, examined more closely, it serves as one of the best cross-platform note-taking, list-making apps you can get on a Chromebook. Or on Android, iOS, desktop, and through Google Assistant or Chrome. </p>
<p> In effect, this app takes the best of what notes can be and moves them to everywhere. </p>
<p> It also has a few neat additional features from list indentations and voice or media notations to link-image creation and note sharing. Notes can then be labeled and categorized out for intuitive organization. And any update made on any platform to a note — or by another account on a shared note — is instantly applied everywhere too. </p>
<p> Better still, if there are conflicts in the cloud data for a note, Google Keep doesn't just keep the newest version. It asks which version to keep with a side-by-side comparison. So this app is going to make staying organized and on task, or keeping a grocery list or recipe list, or just about anything to do with notes easier. </p>
<p> YouTube Music </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Individual Plan- $11.99 per month/Family Plan – $17.99 per month </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google Play Store </p>
<p> YouTube Music is Google's replacement for Google Play Music as part of a bid to move all media offerings under a single brand. In fact, with playlist creation across all of the music found on YouTube, song uploading, music streaming to speakers via Wi-Fi and Chromecast or Bluetooth, and more, it's one of the best apps for music on any Chromebook. </p>
<p> And those are just the free features. </p>
<p> Users can also go ad-free, download and save songs or videos for offline playback, play music in the background, and turn on audio-only mode for data savings. That costs just $11.99 per month for a single user. Or users can pull in a group of up to 5 other users with a $17.99 per month family plan. </p>
<p> Better still, if you're paying for a YouTube Music subscription, it may be a good idea to download the standard YouTube app too. Since that app's premium ad-free variant is included as part of the bundle. And all of that is accessible on the web, in the Android or iOS app, or on a Chromebook. With changes to an account, playlist, and more happening instantly across each platform installation. </p>
<p> COG System Info Viewer </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google Web Store </p>
<p> COG System Info Viewer is exactly what its branding says, it's a system management tool. In fact, it could easily be one of the best web-apps available for a Chromebook for that purpose. </p>
<p> COG is straightforward, just for starters, providing a quick glance at how processors are performing, system temperatures, and storage. It also provides an easy way to see how much RAM is in use, battery life and time remaining, and other specs. Put simply, this tool allows an in-depth, easy-to-read readout of system-level specs. And aside from not showing exactly what is using which resources, it puts the built-in task manager to shame. </p>
<p> Any serious Chromebook user is going to want to install this free tool from the Chrome Web Store. </p>
<p> Google Stadia </p>
<p> Price: Free to access and play paid games </p>
<p> In-app purchases: $9.99 per month for a Pro subscription and free monthly titles </p>
<p> Where to buy: Stadia.Google.com </p>
<p> Google Stadia really needs no introduction at this point. Currently, it's on offer with a three-month free trial for a Pro subscription. And, in short, it's a video game streaming service. </p>
<p> But these games aren't streamed from just anywhere. These are triple-A titles streamed from top-tier Google hardware at up to 4K at 60fps over a dedicated network backbone. And it's accessible from anywhere Chrome is. That includes availability as a PWA on Chrome OS, making it undoubtedly one of the best apps for gaming on the platform. </p>
<p> On Chromebooks, users can pick up a Stadia controller, complete with a direct connection to the Stadia servers and a Google Assistant button. Or, conversely, any Bluetooth or wired controller than can plug into the USB or USB-C ports on a Chromebook should work. That includes official controllers from other consoles. </p>

<p> Nearly 150 Security Flaws Found In New Android Devices For 29 Brands </p>
<p> Buying new Android devices won't guarantee a safe and secure experience, according to Kryptowire, which recently published a report showing 146 security flaws found across a number of brands. Those are referred to as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) by Kryptowire, which is a general cataloging term used as vulnerabilities are discovered. </p>
<p> The overwhelming majority of those security threats were found in relatively budget-minded brands. But the researchers at Kryptowire also found an alarming number of vulnerabilities in smartphones sold by brands such as Samsung and ASUS. </p>
<p> For clarity, every vulnerability didn't exist on all 29 smartphone brands or vendors examined. But more vulnerabilities existed on brand new Samsung and ASUS devices than on others. The devices were also those that contained problems directly out-of-the-box. That means that users were buying smartphones and some of the most popular brands with vulnerabilities already built-in. The figures also only relate to discoveries made in 2019 and related devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What are the security flaws and which new devices were they found on? </p>
<p> At current, the researchers haven't provided extra details about precisely how severe the vulnerabilities are. The full list is extensive, covering the full year 2019 so far. But the group has divided those into categories and four, in particular, are larger than others. The largest category is vulnerabilities that would allow for "System Properties Modification" comprised of 41 CVEs and making up 28.1-percent of those found. </p>
<p> Coming in just behind those, 34 CVEs that would allow for "App Installation," accounting for 23.3-percent of the issues discovered. Following that, "Command Execution" CVEs make up 30 of the 146 residing in that category at 20.5-percent. Finally, at a total of 26 CVEs, 17.8-percent of discovered vulnerabilities were flagged as allowing "Wireless Settings Modification." </p>
<p> Kryptowire points out two further differentiators among the vulnerabilities. Summarily, some of the vulnerabilities could be exploited by 'local' apps and others just by System or 'Signature' Apps. Kryptowire generally splits those across each brand with some exceptions. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Only five brands rose above showing a total of 10 CVEs discovered. The largest two, Samsung and ASUS, were primarily exploitable via system or signature apps. In fact, for Samsung, all 33 CVEs were in that category. For ASUS, 20 of the 26 CVEs were similarly classified. </p>
<p> Xiaomi phones have suffered from three of its total fifteen vulnerabilities related to problems with signature apps or system-level apps. For Lava and Tecno, all fourteen and thirteen respectively were vulnerabilities exploitable by "local apps." </p>
<p> The bulk of the remaining phones are comprised of less widely-known brands, primarily from Chinese manufacturers and primarily compromised in terms of "local apps." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Stock Android doesn't seem to be as vulnerable </p>
<p> For the most part, the vulnerabilities don't seem to impact devices running stock or near-stock Android. Instead, the problem appears to be endemic to devices that are running aftermarket software and particularly those that have third-party software installed before delivery to consumers. Because stock devices tend to receive updates more quickly, the problem is also more easily mitigated than on those that are running skins or overlays. </p>
<p> Presumably, the manufacturers discovered by Kryptowire to be delivering problematic devices have since patched the issues, following its report on those vulnerabilities. However, the company has not outlined exactly what the response of those companies has been. </p>

<p> 1TB Ultimate Edition ASUS ROG Phone II Now Available In The US </p>
<p> ASUS initially launched the ROG Phone II with its standard model carrying 512GB of internal storage and 12GB of RAM. It also had an Ultimate Edition coming soon after the initial launch of the standard model with 1TB of storage, and that model is now available in the US. </p>
<p> It has the same amount of RAM which is 12GB so you're not getting a bump there, but 12GB is plenty anyway so you don't really need more than that. The other big bump on the Ultimate Edition is the support for up to 2Gbps download speeds on LTE. </p>
<p> So if you live in an area where your carrier gets that kind of coverage out to you, then you'll benefit from that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Ultimate Edition is a little bit more in cost, but double the storage </p>
<p> You do pay more for the Ultimate Edition of the ROG Phone II. Compared to the standard model which costs $899, you'll pay $1,099. So it costs $200 more but you get double the storage since it goes from 512GB to 1TB. </p>
<p> 512GB is already a huge amount of storage for a phone, but 1TB can't hurt if you're really using this device for gaming. Some of the biggest games can easily sit at 1GB of space or more and when you start taking pictures, storing music and everything else, the storage starts to really add up. </p>
<p> This is the best version of the best gaming smartphone </p>
<p> ASUS knows gaming and that doesn't stop at smartphones. The ROG Phone II is a powerhouse packed with all kinds of specs that allow you to play mobile games at their peak with the best possible performance. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We recognized the ROG Phone II as the best gaming phone and the gaming phone to beat in our review. This model is the best version of the phone. So if you're interested in grabbing the ROG Phone II this is really the model to get. </p>
<p> In addition to the higher storage and better LTE download speed capabilities, the phone comes with a 6.6-inch Full HD display, the Snapdragon 855 Plus mobile platform, a dual camera system on the back, and it's unlocked so it works with just about any network out there. As long as it's GSM. It won't work with Verizon or Sprint or other CDMA networks. </p>
<p> There are other decent gaming phones out there. For example the Razer Phone 2 that we recently reviewed, which is a steal at $350. But if you want the best possible gaming phone and are ok with the cost, this is it. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/5g-coverage-us" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484859" filename="5g-coverage-us">
<p> Here's Everywhere 5G Is Available In The US </p>
<p> The next evolution of the mobile network, aka 5G, is already available in a good amount of the US (and other countries). However, not every carrier has the same 5G coverage. Some carriers have covered most of the US, like T-Mobile. While others have only covered a few parts of larger markets, like Verizon. </p>
<p> So we've put together this list showing you where you can get 5G from each of the major carriers in the US. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that 5G isn't really a big deal right now, and likely won't be until 2022 or even later on. And this is largely because the coverage is going to take some time to really be built out properly. But here's where you can get 5G in the US, right now. </p>
<p> Frequencies and technology </p>
<p> Much like with 4G LTE, each carrier is using different frequencies right now, for its 5G network. So here's a quick cheat sheet on what frequencies each network is using. In addition, this is going to be useful if you are buying an unlocked smartphone and want to be sure it works on your network. </p>
<p> With 5G, there are two main technologies being used right now. There's Sub-6 and then mmWave. </p>
<p> Verizon is using mmWave only right now, while the other carriers are using Sub-6. However, AT&T is the only carrier using both right now, but primarily rolling out Sub-6. Which is why we are seeing Verizon exclusive phones for 5G right now. As smartphone makers need to add support for mmWave to their phones to be able to sell them on Verizon's network. </p>
<p> Sub-6 is basically sub-6GHz spectrum. Which offers better coverage, and depending on the spectrum, somewhat decent speeds. T-Mobile has rolled out 5G on its 600MHz spectrum, which is how it is able to cover more area than its competitors, so quickly. T-Mobile covers roughly a third of the US with its "nationwide 5G network". But it's much slower than Verizon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So keep that in mind when we talk about coverage here. Verizon offers much faster speeds with less coverage due to mmWave, and T-Mobile does more coverage with slower speeds, due to the much lower spectrum band. AT&T and Sprint fall somewhere in the middle. </p>
<p> AT&T </p>
<p> AT&T is one of the networks you don't hear a lot about, when it comes to 5G. But it has quietly rolled out 5G to hundreds of markets. In both Sub-6 and mmWave flavors. </p>
<p> AT&T currently offers low-band 5G coverage in the following markets: </p>
<p> AT&T has done a good job of rolling out 5G to as many markets as possible. But this is just one layer of the 5G cake for carriers. There's another layer which includes millimeter-wave or mmWave. Which AT&T has also started to roll out in the US. However, it is currently only available for business customers, likely a way for AT&T to limit how many are using this network right now. Currently, high-band millimeter-wave 5G is available from 5G in these cities: </p>
<p> You can check out AT&T's 5G coverage map by clicking here. This one does get updated every time AT&T announces a new 5G market. </p>
<p> Sprint </p>
<p> Sprint's 5G coverage is a bit different from the others in the US. Partly due to the spectrum it has, and partly due to the merger with T-Mobile. </p>
<p> Prior to the merger with T-Mobile, which completed in late April 2020, Sprint launched 5G service in 10 cities. It is using a similar tactic to T-Mobile, in that it is rolling out with Sub-6 spectrum first. But it's not as low-band as T-Mobile is using. Sprint is using its coveted 2.5GHz spectrum for its 5G network. Which is the sweet spot for 5G coverage. Giving you decent coverage as well as decent speeds. In early testing, Sprint was able to get 300Mbps on 5G, which is better than T-Mobile's 600MHz, but nowhere close to Verizon's Gigabit speeds on its mmWave network. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Here are the markets that currently have 5G coverage from Sprint: </p>
<p> These markets will soon be refarmed, and integrated into T-Mobile's 5G network. So this list won't be getting any larger, unfortunately. But this spectrum is part of T-Mobile's 5G layer cake, which we will talk about in the T-Mobile section. So far, New York, NY and Los Angeles, CA have been refarmed and are now part of T-Mobile's network. </p>
<p> T-Mobile </p>
<p> T-Mobile's 5G coverage is a bit more complicated than the other carriers, primarily due to the merger with Sprint. </p>
<p> As T-Mobile's CTO, Neville Ray brilliantly illustrated in 2019, before the 5G network launched, T-Mobile will have a three-layer 5G cake. For instance, the bottom layer is the 600MHz spectrum, which is going to provide the excellent coverage for 5G. And that's what is available "nationwide" right now. It covers roughly a third of the US. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The second layer is Sprint's 2.5GHz spectrum, which the company is working to refarm into its own network. Currently only Los Angeles and New York City have Sprint's network working for T-Mobile's network. And users have reported some very big gains in speeds, compared to just the 600MHz. </p>
<p> The final layer is millimeter-wave. Which is currently only available in six cities. But T-Mobile will be rolling that out to more markets in the future. The way T-Mobile wants to roll out its 5G network is actually really smart. Start with the coverage (aka 600MHz) then move onto faster and faster speeds. </p>
<p> Currently, T-Mobile offers mmWave 5G coverage in six cities. </p>
<p> Dallas </p>
<p> Of course this list is going to grow over time. You can check out T-Mobile's 5G coverage map by clicking here. </p>
<p> Verizon </p>
<p> Verizon 5G coverage is the smallest of the four carriers. And the big reason for this is because it is using mmWave. Which can only penetrate a few feet. Versus low-band spectrum being able to do tens of miles. Verizon has launched 5G in 30 markets so far. </p>
<p> Though one important thing to note here with Verizon's 5G coverage, the carrier will "announce" the market once it has a single tower up and running. So some markets may only have 5G coverage in a single corner of the entire city. While others may have entire neighborhoods. Either way, don't expect to be able to use Verizon 5G inside, not while it's only mmWave. </p>
<p> You can check out Verizon's 5G coverage maps by clicking here. It currently has a separate map for each market. So you can see exactly where 5G is available. </p>
<p> Verizon will be continuing to expand its mmWave network and launch Sub-6 5G later this year. So that 5G coverage will get much better in the next six to 12 months. </p>

<p> Google News / Google Chrome / Acer Chromebook Spin 311 Review: Almost Perfect If You're On A Budget </p>
<p> Acer Chromebook Spin 311 Review: Almost Perfect If You're On A Budget </p>
<p> Acer Chromebook Spin 311 shows that a 2-in-1 laptop doesn't need to be expensive to be great </p>
<p> Rating </p>
<p> Pros </p>
<p> Battery provided almost 7.5-hours of screen-on time </p>
<p> WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 4.2 offer reliable, time-tested connectivity </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> A bit too much screen flex </p>
<p> Standard HD resolution </p>
<p> Audio needs to be louder </p>
<p> Acer already gave us an early look at the Chromebook Spin 311 back in June and now Android Headlines has been given a longer look for a full review. </p>
<p> There were, it goes without saying, some big differences between that preproduction unit and the final configuration. Not least of all, as an unfinished product, there were build quality quirks. Certain aspects felt, without a doubt, unfinished or were less comfortable than might be expected from a finished product. </p>
<p> Among other things, I was finally able to sit down and perform a more robust battery and performance test. Namely, using this device across more intensive tasks and really putting it to the test. But the keyboard and other aspects now finished too, this laptop feels like a completely different beast. And that's a good thing. So let's take a deeper dive. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Acer Chromebook Spin 311 has comfort nailed down </p>
<p> Now, from that preview period, not a lot has changed on the hardware front. It's still a comfortable, metallic plastic construction. But there are fewer gaps in the construction too. </p>
<p> It feels like a solid piece of hardware in hand, with chamfered edges, a blade-like construction in the keyboard base, and secure, wiggle-free hinges for its 2-in-1 design. That's regardless of whether it's been put in a tent, stand, laptop, or clamshell configuration. </p>
<p> In other words, if this review proves anything, it's that Acer Chromebook Spin 311 is an exceptionally comfortable laptop. Right down to its keyboard, which is embedded to match the surface of the keyboard deck with plenty of key travel. It was easily among the most comfortable Chromebooks in its price bracket that I've ever typed on. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Like the hinges, the buttons and ports here are all snug and secure too. Each button has a satisfying click that seems to guarantee they'll last for quite a few years to come. </p>
<p> Around the display, Acer utilized slightly thicker than average bezels. But those make the device easy to hold in tablet mode and is Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass too. Those bezels meet the edge in a beveled cut-off, so the lid is always easy to open. And, despite how thin this laptop is, there's not a lot of flex in the main body. Or any noise when the body is forced to flex what little it will. </p>
<p> There were no creaks or groans when the screen side is flexed either. Which is great, because that's quite a bit more flexible than I'd have liked to see. But the Gorilla Glass keeps things intact and there seems to be little chance this will break under normal use. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Put simply, this laptop is comfortable to hold in any configuration with hardware that appears more than ready to go above and beyond when it comes to surviving day-to-day use. </p>
<p> The display here is low-res but high-value </p>
<p> The display here, since the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 is a budget-minded gadget, isn't the best I've had the opportunity to review. But that's not the point of this device at all. This Chromebook is meant to be usable by the whole family and for just about any purchase. Without costing an arm and a leg. </p>
<p> For the price, buyers are getting an 11.6-inch HD IPS touchscreen display. And that's already a step above what most Chromebooks offer at this price, without consideration for the fact that it's a 2-in-1 laptop. When held, there is some light bleed from the edge being gripped. And only really appears under a tight grip. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That goes away the moment the hand is moved. So it shouldn't present an issue in the long term. </p>
<p> In terms of actual usability, the display is more than bright enough for outdoor use except under direct sunlight. As in, when the screen itself is facing the sun. And it's just clear enough for just about any use case. It's also responsive as a touch screen. More responsive, perhaps, than some Chromebooks in a higher price bracket. </p>
<p> As noted already, the screen on the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 isn't the best. But it comes just about as close as any device in its price range could. And it's lightweight and comfortable enough to hold to use in tablet mode for long periods too. At least compared to many other Chromebooks. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How much performance do you actually need in a Chromebook? </p>
<p> Chromebooks all ship with the same software and effectively have access to the same software too. And, of course, most of that software is either mobile or web-based. So, unless users want to do something intensive like video editing, photo editing, or coding, a lot of power isn't really necessary. </p>
<p> That doesn't mean there aren't differences between the price brackets. Even on performance. But we'll get to that momentarily. Under review, one of the biggest takeaways for Acer Chromebook Spin 311 is that an inexpensive Chromebook doesn't equate to poor performance. Or a bad experience. </p>
<p> In fact, although this Chromebook did take a few moments longer to boot up heavy apps and games, it ran them well once they were loaded. Similarly, photo and video edits take a bit longer to process. But they edit as would be expected from a more expensive machine all the same. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Just about the only area that anybody is going to notice big differences is in truly intensive tasks like coding. This Chromebook could be used for that in a pinch. It's going to be noticeably slower than on pricier hardware. </p>
<p> For just about anything else, this Chromebook stayed fast, cool, and jitter-free during my review. That's despite having the often maligned MediaTek chipset — specifically, a MediaTek MT8183C processor, backed by 4GB LPDDR4X RAM and 64GB eMMC storage. </p>
<p> Acer Chromebook Spin 311 audio is a big let-down, especially since just about everything else is so great </p>
<p> The audio experience with Acer Chromebook Spin 311 is one thing that didn't change much from preview to review. All of the audio spectrum audible to the human ear appear to be present and accounted for. But the speakers could stand to be louder. And a bit more powerful. Especially in the low end. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The sound is somewhat louder than the preview. But the audio is still almost inaudible from any distance further than a few feet. Users can link up Bluetooth 4.2 speakers or headphones — or via the 3.5mm audio jack — to rectify the issue. But this won't be the Chromebook of choice for those who need to work a lot with sound. That's even when the bottom-firing speakers are facing users head-on in stand or tent mode. </p>
<p> The mics, conversely, work wonderfully. That makes video calls and similar activities a great experience with this Chromebook. </p>
<p> Battery life dropped with more intensive use but was still great </p>
<p> Now that Acer sent a finalized review unit of the Acer Chromebook Spin 311, I was able to put the battery to the test more thoroughly. Previously, I had mostly conducted my test with less severe activities. And I saw a battery life at just under an hour short of the advertised 15-hours. This time around, the device lasted 7-hours and 25-minutes with the screen-on. </p>
<p> That's with screen brightness and volume maxed out and with the device being switched between tablet mode and laptop mode frequently. Additionally, I spent a much larger portion of my time editing photos, in video chats, responding to emails, and playing games or streaming audio and video. </p>
<p> The screen brightness, in this case, was likely the biggest determining factor, in spite of my multitasking. But, in combination with that, the time I saw in terms of use was different. So users shouldn't bet on this lasting as long with their needs or use cases. Battery life tends to be subjective. Regardless, this easily one of the longest-lasting batteries to grace a Chromebook to date. </p>
<p> And, less subjectively, charging takes just under two hours from completely drained. </p>
<p> Connectivity with Acer Chromebook Spin 311 is on-point </p>
<p> In terms of connections, Acer Chromebook Spin 311 proved a great device under review too. Not only is there a single USB-A and single USB-C port — for charging, display output, and more. A Kensington lock slot and 3.5mm audio jack are part of the build too. So users will be able to hook up just about anything they need to, to this machine. </p>
<p> In terms of internet and wireless connectivity, this Chromebook isn't going to offer bleeding-edge speed. Instead, it sticks to a reliable, tried-and-tested Acer InviLink Nplify 802.11a/b/g/n/ac connection. And Bluetooth 4.2 rounds out the options. </p>
<p> In real-world performance, those prove more than ample. The connection was strong enough to utilize video and music streaming simultaneously alongside dozens of tabs and web photo editing. It was also enough to play some games via Google Stadia at their maximum graphical settings. </p>
<p> Should you buy Acer Chromebook Spin 311? </p>
<p> At the end of the day, whether or not Acer Chromebook Spin 311 — tested as model CP311-3H-K5GD — is worth the money comes down to a couple of factors. Those are budget and use requirements. </p>
<p> In terms of solid design and connectivity, lag-free performance across most tasks, and long battery life, this Chromebook is a shoo-in. And it should be on the shortlist for any user who needs a real performer on a tight budget. That's whether users are looking to accomplish school, work, or play tasks. And it holds true even for more intensive tasks associated with those. </p>
<p> It also has a bright antimicrobial display, which should prove useful for any of those purposes. As should the ability to fold it into a stand, tent, or tablet configuration. </p>
<p> Where things do fall apart is primarily on audio, due mostly to low volume. Acer Chromebook Spin 311 doesn't have the highest-resolution display and isn't made of the highest-end materials. But that's easily forgiven, with consideration for its price. So there just aren't many caveats to contend with. </p>
<p> Acer Chromebook Spin 311 is easily one of the best budget-friendly Chrome OS laptops around. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / New Adobe Photoshop Camera Update Brings Support For Multiple Lenses & More </p>
<p> New Adobe Photoshop Camera Update Brings Support For Multiple Lenses & More </p>
<p> If you are not sure of the stock camera app pre-installed on your smartphone, then you can always make use of the Google Camera or GCam app or the Adobe Photoshop Camera app. </p>
<p> Google Camera app or the GCam app is one of the trusted secondary camera apps for Android users. We all know the image processing prowess Google has and brings with it its Pixel phones. </p>
<p> In fact, in the recently launched Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G, even after using almost 4-year-old camera hardware, the company is able to achieve camera results that could easily compete with today's best devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And almost similar imaging capabilities can be achieved on any Android device, using the GCam app. Moreover, you can search for your device-compatible GCam app from the internet. </p>
<p> To give competition to the Google Camera app, Adobe has the Adobe Photoshop Camera app. Besides, the latest update brings some new features like multiple lens support, timer function, additional language support, etc. </p>
<p> Notably, this new Adobe Photoshop camera update is arriving after a long gap. The update carries version number v1.10 and is rolling out via the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Adobe Photoshop Camera app update address multiple limitations of the first build </p>
<p> The latest Adobe Photoshop Camera update v1.10 is meant to fix the multiple limitations the app had in the first build. Most prominent is the support for multiple lenses. </p>
<p> For those who are unaware of the app, the Photoshop Camera app is an impressive way to make use of the high-end Adobe post-processing effects on your images. </p>
<p> You get real-time photoshop effects, auto-tone photo effects, portrait controls, various camera filters, and several other options. There are many features that you would not find on the GCam app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, before this new v1.10 update, even though your smartphone had multiple lenses, you could not use it with the Adobe Photoshop Camera app. </p>
<p> But now, you can change the focal length quickly with the tap of a button after the latest update. Additionally, the update also improves the auto-detection function. </p>
<p> This would enable more accurate detection of the subject. Ultimately, improving the effects as they can now be accurately applied to the subject. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You also get the new countdown timer for the shutter. This could prove beneficial when you want to make some framing adjustments before capturing the actual shot. </p>
<p> The Photoshop Camera app timer can be set to one of three presets, i.e. 0, 3, and 10 seconds. Apparently, this flexibility in timer is more than enough for many users. </p>
<p> If you have not updated your Adobe Photoshop Camera app, then you should click the button below in order to grab the latest update of the app from the Play Store. </p>

<p> Let Alexa Buy Your Gas Because It Can Totally Do That Now </p>
<p> Alexa, buy gas, is a phrase you may hear more often now when going to the local pump to fill up your tank. </p>
<p> Today Amazon started rolling out a new capability for you to buy gas using Alexa. Though, Amazon may be just a little bit behind the times here. Mobile payments at gas stations aren't an entirely new concept. </p>
<p> Some gas stations already accept mobile payments from Google Pay and Apple Pay at the pump. And inside you can use both (as well as Samsung Pay) to buy things at the register. Now Alexa users don't have to be left out though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Buy gas with Alexa at over 11,500 gas stations across the US </p>
<p> Alexa can be used to pay for gas at numerous gas stations across the country. </p>
<p> In fact, at over 11,500 gas stations. The one catch though is that these are Exxon and Mobil gas stations. So as of right now you're not likely going to be using Alexa at Arco, Shell, Chevron or any of the other large gas stations throughout the US. </p>
<p> Not all Exxon or Mobil gas stations will support this. So that's worth keeping in mind when making a trip to a specific gas station just to use this feature. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Make sure that location actually supports the tech first. Should it not you can always pay for your gas the old fashioned way – with cards or cash. Also worth noting is that you can use the Alexa app, your voice to talk to Alexa, or Alexa Auto if you have a vehicle with the technology built into it. </p>
<p> Alexa will even ask you what pump you're parked at </p>
<p> If you've been buying gas for a while you should be used to attendants asking you what pump you're at when buying gas inside. </p>
<p> You don't have this at the pump, obviously. Because there's generally not an attendant there unless you're in a state where you can't pump your own gas. Even then, the attendants already know what pump you're at. Because they're there too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you're paying with Alexa, Alexa's response to you asking to pay for gas is what pump you're at. To which you can answer. Alexa will then ask if you have your card set up with Amazon Pay, after which the transaction will be completed. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that you need to make sure Amazon Pay is set up with a credit or debit card before you can use this feature. </p>

<p> Alexa Introduces Samuel L. Jackson As Part Of Celebrity Voice Program </p>
<p> As part of its celebrity voice program, Amazon's Alexa has updated the voice, Samuel L Jackson, on its devices. As announced by the company, it is making it easier to summon the voice of Jackson on its devices. </p>
<p> This is not the only update Amazon has worked on over the past few weeks. Alexa Print has expanded to allow more keywords to print things like crosswords and colouring books for kids. Amazon also introduced a service called Alexa for Residential designed to lend a hand to property managers. </p>
<p> This, though, is probably one of the most exciting innovations for Alexa users on an entertainment level. As reported by Android Police, the ability to use the voice of Samuel L Jackson on Alexa came in last year. However, due to such a great demand for the actor's voice, Amazon has decided to expand the commands he can be used for. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon simplifies voice commands for Samuel L. Jackson </p>
<p> Firstly Amazon had made it much easier to summon Jackson's voice. Users can now simply say "Hey Samuel" to ask for a range of commands. These include jokes, weather, and more. </p>
<p> If you have never used Jackson's voice before you will need to take one step before this. To begin with just say "Alexa, introduce me to Samuel L. Jackson". Then you can choose the "Hey Samuel" wake word to use it easily from now on. </p>
<p> The "Hey Samuel" wake word works with almost all voice-activated Echo devices. However, the Echo and Echo Dot and Echo Look will not work. For these devices, users will need to use the command "Alexa, ask Samuel". </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Many more entertaining commands introduced for Jackson </p>
<p> Alongside the simplification of accessing the voice of Jackson, Amazon has also introduced a whole series of new commands. On the announcement, linked above, Amazon provides a more comprehensive list of these top commands. </p>
<p> However, here are a few of our favourites. Firstly, there is a range of basic ones like asking for jokes, the weather, setting timers and playing music. </p>
<p> However, things get more interesting with the ability to ask Jackson to "roast me". Users with explicit content also get a range of funny responses from Jackson. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Asking your devices things like "Hey Samuel, what’s in your wallet?" or "are you mad" will elicit some colourful language from the beloved actor. </p>
<p> Users can also get to know a bit more about Jackson by asking him more personal questions. To get more in-depth responses you can ask "Hey Samuel, did you always want to be an actor?" or "Hey Samuel, what’s the secret to your success?" These will get more personal responses about the actor's life. </p>
<p> Overall, this looks like a fun update which will delight most users, probably more so than most functional innovations Amazon makes! Here's to hoping the celebrity range will continue to grow on Alexa devices so we get more fun stuff like this to enjoy. </p>

<p> Take To The Stars With Starfinder, A New Alexa-Based RPG </p>
<p> Amazon is launching a new voice-based RPG game for Alexa smart speakers called Starfinder. </p>
<p> The game is voiced by Nathan Fillion of Firefly and Castle fame. He also voiced Cayde-6 in Destiny 2 for most of the character's lifespan. Laura Bailey is also part of the cast. If you're unfamiliar, she recently voiced a big role in The last Of Us Part 2. </p>
<p> Starfinder on Alexa is based on the Starfinder tabletop RPG game. However Amazon says that it worked closely with the creators to ensure its version would offer a "no-knowledge" gameplay approach. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Meaning you wouldn't need to know anything about the lore of the tabletop RPG to play this one. It also follows closely with the original game's lore and is authentic to source material and is more "narrative-driven." Which makes sense given the game is played through voice on a voice-powered Alexa speaker. </p>
<p> You can start playing the Starfinder RPG on Alexa speakers today </p>
<p> The game is available to play starting from today. It will be episodic and episodes will be released across a two-part wave. With the first half of the episodes being made available immediately. </p>
<p> The second half of the six-part series will launch in October. You can also play the pilot episode of Starfinder, which initially launched near the end of last year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both the pilot episode and the first episode are also free. So you can dive into it at no charge to check it out. If you like it, you can continue playing at $2 per episode. Or, you can pay $10 and get all six episodes. </p>
<p> Keeping in mind that you can only play the pilot and the first three episodes of the series right now. </p>
<p> Starfinder provides around 13 hours of playtime </p>
<p> If you're worried about content, you shouldn't be. Amazon says there is about 13 hours of playtime across all of the episodes. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That breaks down to about 2 hours per episode. Aside from the gametime, players will be able to sort of direct the narrative and outcome of the game with choices they make. </p>
<p> This also means it could be possible to shorten or lengthen the game just a little bit. Not to mention how much time you spend playing will depend partly on how long it takes you to make decisions. </p>
<p> If you've got an Alexa speaker and you're curious to give the game a try, a simple voice command will get things going. Just say Alexa, open Starfinder and that will kickstart things. </p>

<p> Alexa Print Can Entertain Your Kids With Coloring, Crossword Puzzles </p>
<p> Amazon's Alexa devices can now print documents and novel content covering everything from coloring pages to shopping lists. That's based on an announcement from the world's biggest online retail shipping company, detailing the new feature. </p>
<p> Summarily, users will be able to access Alexa Print using those keywords followed by a command for what they'd like to print. And there are a plethora of things that can be printed at any given time. Users might, for instance, print off their shopping list, a recipe, or some lined or graph paper. Conversely, they might choose to print off a math worksheet for their children. </p>
<p> Or, for more entertaining use cases, the feature can be used to print off crosswords, coloring pages, Sudoku puzzles, and more. All with their voice from any connected Alexa-enabled device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Which printers can use Alexa Print right now? </p>
<p> Using Amazon's new feature is just about as straightforward as it could be. Users simply need to tell Alexa to "Discover my printer" to get started. From there, Alexa will scan the network to add the printer to set as its default. </p>
<p> Now, not every printer will be supported, at least not for now. But there are at least four brands and a wide swath of models within those, straight out of the gate. Those are some of the most popular brands too, including Canon, Brother, HP, and Epson. Amazon has a full list available at the announcement via its help pages for the feature. </p>
<p> After the printer has been set up, it's just a matter of using the appropriate commands, as mentioned above. Amazon has a full list of commands available at its site. And, of course, low ink or paper notifications and smart re-ordering are possible through this new feature as well. And users can easily adjust when and how those notifications are received, whether via email or voice. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can save money this way too and it's available right now </p>
<p> Alexa Print is rolled out as of today, according to Amazon. So any of the above-mentioned features should already be available for users invested in the Amazon ecosystem. Better still, linking up a printer can actually save users some money. That's because linking and then signing up for smart reorders can earn users 10-percent off on all ink or toner reorders. </p>

<p> Alleged Huawei Mate X2 Appears, It's Heavily Inspired The Galaxy Z Fold </p>
<p> Alleged Huawei Mate X2 design has surfaced online, and it’s heavily inspired by the Galaxy Z Fold 2. This design appeared on CNIPA (China National Intellectual Property Office), as it has been certified in China. </p>
<p> This is the design of the alleged Huawei Mate X2, and it resembles the Galaxy Z Fold 2 </p>
<p> The design has been shared by Letsgodigital, and it shows a phone that is extremely similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 2. We cannot be sure this is the design of the Huawei Mate X2, but it’s possible. </p>
<p> As you can see, the phone folds like a book, just like the Galaxy Z Fold 2. It also has a large secondary display, with a display camera hole. Unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 2, this phone’s camera hole is pill-shaped. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That is not surprising considering that the company’s current flagships have such a selfie camera hole as well. The bezels around the secondary display are very thin, as expected. </p>
<p> A side-facing fingerprint scanner is included here, right below the volume up and down buttons. There are a number of cameras placed on the back of the device, we’re counting five of them here. </p>
<p> These are only camera cutouts, though, so one of those cutouts may not be reserved for a camera sensor, even though it seems like they all are. Huawei’s branding is visible on the back of the phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can also see that the phone is not equally thick on all sides, It’s thicker on the side where the camera sits, while it’s thinner on the opposite side. </p>
<p> A Type-C USB port is placed at the bottom of the device, along with the phone’s main speaker. The secondary speaker will likely be included above the display, under the earpiece grille. </p>
<p> The device will probably be made out of metal and glass </p>
<p> The phone’s rear-facing camera module does protrude a bit, which was to be expected. Based on the looks of this design, we’d guess that this phone will be made out of metal and glass. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It’s really difficult to deny that this possible Huawei Mate X2 design resembles the Galaxy Z Fold 2, it’s definitely heavily inspired by it. Some of you are probably wondering when will this handset launch. </p>
<p> Well, if this is the Huawei Mate X2, then you can expect to see it next year, at least based on the latest round of rumors. The device was expected to arrive in 2020, but that may not be the case. </p>
<p> The US ban managed to mess up Huawei’s plans, along with COVID-19, and everything that happened because of it. This information is not official, though, so we’ll just have to wait and see what will happen. </p>

<p> Here's The All-New Amazon Echo Dot & Echo Dot with Clock </p>
<p> Amazon has just announced the all-new fourth-generation Echo Dot today, and it's keeping the same $49.99 price tag. Keeping it a great entry point for getting into the Amazon and Alexa ecosystem. </p>
<p> The new Echo Dot also sports a new design, and it looks more like a sphere, and comes in three colors: chalk, steel blue and charcoal. With the steel blue being a somewhat new color for the Echo Dot. </p>
<p> It also comes in a fabric finish, which is made from 100% recycled fabric. This fabric finish allows the Echo Dot to produce crisp vocals and balanced bass for full sound. While also keeping the Echo Dot from picking up scratches, dust and dirt. While also keeping the sound quality top-notch. Which is pretty important. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Echo Dot with Clock has the same sort of design, but with an LED clock on the front. But, it only comes in blue steel and charcoal. So there's no chalk color this time. And that is likely due to the fact that the LED clock would be tough to see on a chalk colored Echo Dot with Clock. </p>
<p> It's the same Echo Dot you know and love </p>
<p> This is the same Echo Dot that we all know and love, but it comes with a new design. Which makes it look more unique, and you're more likely to put these in other places around your home. </p>
<p> As a sphere, the Echo Dot is able to fill the room a lot easier, with audio. As it is basically a 360-degree speaker, and as the third-generation model did, it gets even better with audio quality. Giving you some really good bass, as well as crystal clear mids and highs. Making it a really good sounding smart speaker, which is exactly what it is. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course, Alexa is still built-in, and it's continuing to get better and better. </p>
<p> The Alexa ring has moved to the bottom of the Echo Dot, so that it is now going to light up the table that it is sitting on. Making it look pretty unique, and out of the way. </p>
<p> When can I pre-order the Echo Dot? </p>
<p> Pre-orders or the new Echo Dot start today. As mentioned, the Echo Dot is sticking with the same $49.99 price tag. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Echo Dot with Clock also goes up for pre-order today and will cost the same $59.99. </p>
<p> They should begin shipping next month. Though Amazon has not yet announced when they will ship, or opened pre-orders just yet. </p>

<p> Amazon's Alexa App Gets Auto Mode To Improve In-Vehicle Experience </p>
<p> Amazon has introduced a new feature called Auto Mode for its Alexa app. It works in the same way as Android Auto but runs on the smartphone instead of the infotainment screen. The new Auto mode provides easy access to navigation, communication, and media functions with larger touch targets and bigger font. </p>
<p> This new feature will be available to users in the US, Canada, Germany, France, India, Italy, Spain, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. In the coming weeks, the Auto mode will show up on both the Android and the iOS versions of the Alexa app. It works with the supported Alexa auto accessories like the Echo Auto. </p>
<p> Amazon adds all-new Auto Mode to the Alexa app </p>
<p> After being successful in the smart home category, the biggest challenge for Amazon is to bring Alexa to the cars. Amazon's Echo Auto, introduced in 2018, is the first attempt at putting an Alexa-enabled device in the vehicles. However, the voice-only feature of the Echo Auto failed to impress the users. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the new Auto mode, the actions and suggestions offered by Alexa can be seen on the smartphone display. The driver-friendly mode will have a total of four screens — Home, Navigate, Communicate, and Play. The Home screen provides shortcuts to the frequently used actions for easy and faster access. Users can use their voice or tap on the actions related to the task. </p>
<p> For suggestions from the Navigate screen, Alexa will use the default navigation app to show the directions. Moreover, it can also access the favorite locations stored within the Alexa app. Users can also ask "Alexa, go back to the Alexa app" for switching to the regular Alexa app from Auto mode. </p>
<p> Make announcements to Echo devices at home </p>
<p> The Communicate screen includes three options — Calls, Drop In, and Announcement. Users can also make announcements to the Alexa-enabled devices at home through the Auto mode. As the name suggests, the Play screen will show the most recent media played on any Alexa device with a large button to play or pause. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Even the "Now Playing" screen is designed with larger and driver-friendly buttons. For the US users, Amazon is also introducing a new "Start My Commute" routine. It will give heads up of the weather, traffic update, and preferred choice of entertainment. Users can listen to music, audiobook, or daily news. </p>
<p> The announcement comes just a week after unveiling the new Fire TV, Echo, and Ring products. Amazon also introduced its own game streaming service called Luna. </p>

<p> Amazon Says Unused Alexa Hacks Wouldn't Leak Bank Details, At Least </p>
<p> According to newly reported findings from Check Point researchers, Amazon Alexa may have incidentally exposed users to hacks from bad actors. More pertinently, that includes details users wouldn't want malicious entities to have access too. That's because any attacker would have effectively had access to the users' entire voice history. </p>
<p> That's based on vulnerabilities that would have allowed attackers to target users with fairly standard, but maliciously encoded links. Specifically, those would have been Amazon package tracking links. </p>
<p> With those links, if clicked by the end-user, the attacker could have used Amazon and Alexa subdomains to redirect users. In effect, they'd be directed to a legitimate-looking page with bad code. The code could then be used to send a request to the Alexa Skills store, allowing bad actors to delete and install skills, as well as accessing voice history. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The response from Amazon seems to indicate that all is well </p>
<p> Now, Amazon has responded with statements regarding the newly discovered potential Alexa hacks. And the news appears to be good. </p>
<p> Not only are bank details redacted in Alexa's responses, making uncovering the specifics incredibly difficult. But the company also has found no evidence that the vulnerabilities were ever used against customers. There isn't any indication that any details gathered through the use of the vulnerabilities were leaked out anywhere either. And, of course, the company has already patched the offending code. </p>
<p> That means that this time at least, the underlying issues shouldn't crop up to cause problems for users down the line. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company also indicates, as always, that security is a 'top priority' for its devices. And called out Check Point researchers with a note of appreciation for assisting Amazon in recognizing problem areas before they become a problem. </p>
<p> You should still be careful smart home devices, including Alexa </p>
<p> This latest set of vulnerabilities isn't the first time Amazon has been called out over how its Alexa AI captures audio. Or about the potential for leaks and hacks. It's certainly not the first time any smart home system has been found to be insecure either. In fact, reports on the matter do seem to be occurring with increasing frequency. So users should be cautious about how they interact with and around the IoT devices. </p>

<p> Amazon Extends Alexa As A Helping Hand To Residential Property Owners </p>
<p> Amazon wants to use its Alexa platform to help modernize residential properties, starting with apartments in the US. That's according to a recent announcement from the company detailing a new service called Alexa for Residential. The service, as its branding implies, is geared toward bringing everything great about a smart home to apartments. </p>
<p> Best of all, it'll be ready and available starting this fall thanks to a partnership between Amazon and IOTAS, STRATIS IoT and Sentient Property Services. More partners will undoubtedly be announced in short order, if all goes well. </p>
<p> What does this do for property managers and owners? </p>
<p> Now, determining who will be the biggest benefactor from Alexa for Residential is a task, in and of itself. For property owners and managers, Amazon says that Alexa for Residential will help meet increasing demand for voice-enabled smart homes. But specifically for apartments and apartment complexes. Not least of all, it will drastically reduce the time-consumption and cost, while also providing property managers a way to manage devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Summarily, the new service alleviates the need for property managers to reset each individual smart home device and system on move-out. Property managers will be able to remotely reset devices to default settings with Alexa for Residential. And they'll be able to do that without removing integrations with the smart home environment. </p>
<p> It will additionally allow custom voice experiences and skills for every unit in a property. That will let managers set up ways for residents to manage their unit. For instance, they'll be able to manage rent, reserve amenities, request maintenance, and more. </p>
<p> Does Amazon Alexa for Residential raise any red flags on privacy? </p>
<p> For residents, the difference will be primarily linked to the overall standard of living. Not only will Alexa for Residential allow the above-mentioned property integration. It will also create a smart home experience complete with whatever amenities a property chooses to offer. From security to speakers and thermostats, without requiring potential contract breaches caused by self-installing a smart home environment. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additionally, users can sign in if they have an Alexa account and gain full access to all of the Alexa features as though they owned the place themselves. That includes the ability to link up other smart home devices such as TVs, speakers, and appliances. But it also includes personalized results, services, and reminders. </p>
<p> Best of all, according to Amazon at least, property managers don't have access to customer data and voice recordings are automatically deleted daily. So there shouldn't be a large number of potential security concerns for renters either. </p>

<p> Amazon Revealed Its New 2020 Echo And It Looks Like A Nexus Q </p>
<p> This is the new Echo speaker that Amazon just revealed for its 2020 lineup, and it looks like a Nexus Q. </p>
<p> If you've been around the Android scene long enough, you may remember the Nexus Q. It was a short-lived device from Google that was released in 2012. And although there are stark differences here, it's hard not to look at the design and see the similarities either. </p>
<p> All that aside, Amazon decided to give its new 2020 Echo a spherical design because it felt the device needed a change. Visually, it still has some of the telltale signs of an Echo too. Like the fabric-covered top and the light ring around the base. It also doesn't cost a whole lot. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The 2020 Amazon Echo will retail for $99 </p>
<p> Amazon is keeping things simple here and charging the same price for the new Echo that it has for the last couple of them. </p>
<p> The new Echo speaker will retail for $99, and it comes with everything you'd expect from an Echo. Though it does have that new design as well as some new technology baked in. </p>
<p> On the technology side of things it has a new machine learning processor called the AZ1 Neural Edge. What this aims to do is listen for your commands and then process them using local onboard machine learning tech. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> After which your responses are sent to the cloud like they always are. Amazon says this will help speed up the times for getting a response. So what this all breaks down to is just the device working faster than before. </p>
<p> If you ask it a question, then you'll get an answer quicker with this Echo than you would on the earlier versions. </p>
<p> It comes in multiple colors and has a built-in Zigbee smart home hub </p>
<p> One of the other big new features is a built-in smart home hub. In the case of the new Echo, it's a Zigbee hub. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This means you'll be able to connect a network of your different smart home devices directly to each other through the new Echo. So long as they're compatible with the Zigbee technology and software. </p>
<p> The new Echo also comes in a few different colors. There's a darker Charcoal color, Glacier White, and one called Steel Blue. All three will be available at launch. </p>
<p> The release date for the new Echo will be October 22, but you can already pre-order the device if you want it to show up on launch day. </p>

<p> Amazon's Echo Dot Kids Edition Is Now More Kid-Friendly </p>
<p> Along with the new Echo Dot today, Amazon also announced a new Echo Dot Kids Edition, which is actually more kid-friendly now. </p>
<p> With the previous model, it looks exactly like the regular Echo Dot, but with a new color on the outside. But with the redesign of the Echo Dot. Amazon was free to really get crazy with the designs on these Kids Edition versions. </p>
<p> So, Amazon added some animal designs to the Kids Edition. Including tigers, pandas and more. Which makes it really fit into a kids room, and also makes them a bit more fun. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Echo Dot Kids Edition comes with kid-friendly Alexa responses </p>
<p> At the heart of the Echo Dot Kids Edition is Alexa, like with any Echo device. But with the Echo Dot Kids Edition, the responses are now kid-friendly. </p>
<p> It also allows kids to listen to thousands of Audible books that are also kid-friendly. Some of the brands that are available are Disney, Nickelodeon and National Geographic. </p>
<p> There is a new feature for Alexa on this version of the Echo Dot though. And that is Sidekick. So Alexa will read along with your kid, and help them out with their reading time. And with the majority of us stuck at home right now, that's a really great feature to have available. So kids can still get their reading time in, even if their parents are busy cooking, working, or whatnot. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is all part of Amazon Kids+ (also known as Freetime Unlimited). You will get a year free when you purchase the Echo Dot Kids Edition, and after that year, it'll cost you $2.99 per month, plus tax. Which is not too bad, especially considering the amount of content that is available on Freetime Unlimited. It's definitely worth that price. </p>
<p> Amazon also includes a two-year worry-free guarantee. So if your kid(s) breaks the Echo Dot, Amazon will replace it free of charge, and no questions asked. </p>
<p> When can I pre-order it? </p>
<p> It is available for pre-order today. It costs the same $59.99 as the previous generation did. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pre-orders will ship on October 22. So they should arrive in plenty of time for the holidays. Even if Amazon's stock does run low. </p>
<p> Currently, they are only available as a tiger or panda. But we wouldn't be surprised if Amazon adds more options later on. </p>

<p> Amazon Enters Cloud Gaming With Low-Cost Luna </p>
<p> Amazon is officially in the running for cloud gaming with Luna, its newly announced service that was just unveiled today during the company's large product event. </p>
<p> Luna was initially rumored late last year, but at the time there wasn't much information about what it would cost, what it was called, or how it would work or what it would offer. </p>
<p> Details were sparse and the rumor was simply that Amazon had interest in launching a cloud gaming service in 2020. Luna is the service from that rumor, and right off the bat it seems like a competitive offering. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It comes in at a low-cost, there appears to be lots of games that will be available, and it works on multiple devices. All-in-all, Amazon may have a winner here. But time will tell. </p>
<p> Amazon Luna cloud gaming service will start at $5.99 </p>
<p> In terms of cost, what Amazon is going to be offering seems competitive. It starts at $5.99. </p>
<p> That's already $4 below Google's Stadia Pro, and $1 more than GeForce NOW. And if you compare it to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, where Microsoft's cloud gaming now exists, then it's much cheaper since Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs $14.99. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There is at least one caveat though. The $5.99 is an early access price. Amazon doesn't appear to list what the cost will be once Luna leaves early access. Nor does it mention when that will be. </p>
<p> So for now the service is firmly planted in a good spot when it comes to cost. But it may not always be that way. In its early access period, Luna will be available on PC, Mac, iOS, and Fire TV. Android will be coming soon. </p>
<p> No lengthy downloads, tons of games, and a dedicated controller </p>
<p> Luna will seemingly be a very good cloud gaming option. At least based off the details Amazon has shared so far. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The early access version, which you can request access to right now, will have a large selection of games across different genres. Some of the titles listed are Control, the Panzer Dragoon Remake, Resident Evil 7, The Surge 2, GRID, ABZU, and more. </p>
<p> over on the Luna landing page, there's a much larger collection of games shown. Though these won't necessarily all be available. Those titles include Bloodstained, Metro Exodus, Watch Dogs Legion, and even Assassin's Creed Valhalla. </p>
<p> There's a good variety of games here. And if Luna gets off to a good start then it will undoubtedly get more. It also looks like Ubisoft's Uplay+ will be available through Luna but not right away as it's listed as coming soon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon has everything listed out in channels. So there's the Luna+ channel that has a growing library of games. And then the Ubisoft channel which is coming soon that will open access to a collection of just Ubisoft titles, including DLC content. </p>
<p> The service comes with its own controller (it retails for $49.99) which looks a lot like a cross between the Stadia controller and the Switch Pro controller. </p>
<p> And the service is built on the foundation of Amazon's AWS servers. So Amazon is promoting low-latency gameplay and all that goodness that Google has been touting since last November. </p>

<p> Amazon Announces Fall Hardware Event For September 24 </p>
<p> Amazon has announced the date for its fall hardware event. It will take place on September 24 at 1 PM ET as reported by The Verge. </p>
<p> Amazon never manages to stay out of the news for that long and as a result, this is not the first story concerning the company this month. Early this month Amazon announced its new Amazon for Residential service designed to help property owners. </p>
<p> Amazon will also hope that this event announcement will take some shine away from other worrying news concerning the company. It recently emerged that a number of Amazon Basics products may be dangerous and that Amazon may not have done enough to investigate and recall this produced. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are still very few details when it comes to this Amazon fall hardware event. In invites Amazon sent out, the only thing they said is that the would share "some news". Quite vague so it will be interesting to see if any more detail come out over time. </p>
<p> Exclusive Amazon hardware event set for September 24 </p>
<p> An Amazon spokesperson said that this event would just be invite-only. This means that it will be fairly exclusive creating a sense of intrigue. Because of this, the likelihood that this event will not be publicly streamed. Why Amazon has made this decision is not known at the moment. </p>
<p> As mentioned, there are no firm details on what will go on or get shown at the event. This has naturally, led to a fair bit of speculation surrounding the event. Hopefully, we will find out a little bit more as time goes on. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Some reporters seem to suggest that we may see new smart speakers and smart displays of some kind. This is largely based off of what happened at last year's events. In 2019, Amazon launched the flagship Echo Studio speaker, the Echo Show 8 smart display, and a third-generation Echo speaker. </p>
<p> However, Amazon could show off some more surprising and out there hardware that more people will not expect. For example, last year Amazon showed off revealed the Echo Frames glasses, which had Alexa built-in, and the Echo Loop. </p>
<p> If we see something a bit more akin to this more exciting and out there then this event could be pretty exciting. Hopefully, it will be worth watching and Amazon will offer up something interesting. The fact that they have kept this fairly exclusive, then something of some note must be happening but we will have to wait and see. </p>

<p> Amazon / Amazon Is Taking The Competition To Roku With The $30 Fire TV Stick Lite </p>
<p> Amazon Is Taking The Competition To Roku With The $30 Fire TV Stick Lite </p>
<p> Amazon announced several devices today, including two new Fire TV Sticks. There is the new Fire TV Stick, plus the brand new product that is the Fire TV Stick Lite. </p>
<p> These two Fire TV Sticks are very similar, and only a $10 difference in price. As mentioned, the Fire TV Stick Lite is going to cost $29.99, while the Fire TV Stick will cost the same $39.99 as the previous generation. </p>
<p> Amazon, surprisingly, did not replace the Fire TV Stick 4K this time around. Though that was replaced last year, with the new Alexa Voice Remote. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What is the Fire TV Stick Lite? </p>
<p> The Fire TV Stick Lite is a new HDMI dongle that runs on the Fire TV platform, and is their cheapest model to date. Obviously, Amazon is looking to take the competition to Roku with this model. As Roku has a number of models that are priced under $30. </p>
<p> It does cut a few corners, as you'd expect, to hit that price point. Mainly, it is coming with an older remote, which does not have the ability to control your TV. But for most people, that's perfectly fine. </p>
<p> It also will not support Dolby Atmos, instead it is Dolby Audio (via pass-through only). Otherwise the two are virtually the same. With 8GB of storage and a quad-core processor. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Fire TV Stick is now 50% more powerful </p>
<p> Amazon doesn't disclose specs all that often, and when they do, they aren't specific. So the Fire TV Stick runs on a quad-core processor with 8GB of storage. But according to Amazon, it is now 50% faster than its predecessor. </p>
<p> Which allows the new Fire TV Stick to offer 1080p at 60fps better and smoother than before. It also offers Dolby Atmos out of the box now. And it still has dual-band WiFi support for 2.4GHz and 5GHz, as well as dual antennas. So that it should never have a bad connection to your network. </p>
<p> All-new Fire TV experience </p>
<p> Amazon also announced that it has redesigned Fire TV, to make it more personalized. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The main menu is now at the center of your screen and makes it super easy to find what you want. You'll still be able to quickly jump into your favorite streaming service, or scroll over to supported apps to see what's new. </p>
<p> There's a new Find experience, that will make it easier than ever to discover great movies, TV shows and much more. You can also tell Alexa to "go to Find" or "go to Live" making Alexa even more useful in Fire TV. </p>
<p> This update will begin rolling out to Fire TV devices later this year. And it will be available first on the new Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pre-orders open today </p>
<p> Both are being released on September 30. So you won't have long to wait to get your hands on it. </p>

<p> Amazon's New Guard Plus Mimics Your Daily Smart Light Use </p>
<p> Among all the things that Amazon announced today, one of them was a subscription service called Guard Plus that works with all the new home security hardware it announced. </p>
<p> This is essentially the next step up from Alexa Guard, and although it does cost money where Alexa Guard does not, Guard Plus comes with more features. </p>
<p> For those extra features Amazon believes that consumers won't mind paying the monthly fee. And it may very well be right. Especially if any of those consumers are planning on buying any of that new home security equipment. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon Guard Plus costs $4.99 a month, and mimics you while you're away </p>
<p> Amazon's new subscription service has a few tricks up its sleeve that may just make it worth the $4.99 monthly fee. </p>
<p> For starters, it can mimic you while you're away from home. More specifically, it mimics how you use your smart lights on a day to day basis. So as to not attract attention from your lights being off all the time. </p>
<p> To engage this you'll need to set the service to Away Mode. And after doing so it can basically turn your smart lights on and off as you would if you were home. More or less it learns (or already knows) what times you use the lights and what times you don't. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Using that knowledge it will to the best of its ability, make it seem as if you're still there. It does more than that though, naturally. It can also help you reach emergency help if needed. </p>
<p> Ask Alexa to call for help and it'll reach out to emergency services </p>
<p> We all need a little help sometimes. To that end, Guard Plus is here to help. All you have to do is ask Alexa to call for help by saying Alexa, call of help, and the service will contact emergency services for you. </p>
<p> Alexa will make a call to trained emergency response agents who can then assist you by calling the fire department, police, or call for an ambulance if needed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All of this could save the user time in a more serious emergency if they aren't able to make it to a phone. Guard Plus can also detect potential emergencies and then alert you about them. Like breaking glass or footsteps during times that no one is usually there. </p>
<p> It can even tell your Echo to play the sounds of a barking dog if motion is detected. All in an attempt to deter intruders. Amazon is rolling out this service in the near future. If you're interested in checking it out, you can sign up for an email alert when it's available. </p>

<p> This Is Halo, Amazon's First Fitness Tracker </p>
<p> Amazon is continuing to expand its hardware offerings, this time with Halo. Which is a new fitness tracker from the e-commerce giant. </p>
<p> Now, Amazon is heading straight for Apple and Google (which owns Fitbit too). As the Apple Watch and Fitbit has been very popular in the fitness tracking space, but Amazon is aiming to take a chunk of their market share and thus profit. </p>
<p> This isn't your typical fitness band </p>
<p> To start things off, this isn't something you pay for once and it's yours forever. Instead, Amazon is embracing a subscription model with the Halo. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For early access users, which starts today, you can get it for $64.99. That includes the price of Halo and six months of service. It will go up to $99 at some point. And it'll cost you $3.99 per month to keep the service going. </p>
<p> There are also some additional bands that can be purchased. So the fabric brands will be $19.99 and sports bands will be $15.99. These prices are also going to go up once the early access period has ended. </p>
<p> The app is also pretty different from Fitbit, and Apple Watch. It does the usual stuff like tracking steps and sleep. But it also does a lot of other things and even uses AI to do it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It can measure your weight, in which it uses body fat content as the main metric. There's also Labs, which has workouts, challenges and more to help encourage healthier habits. </p>
<p> But the really impressive feature is Tone. And yes, its using your voice for this. As you may or may not know, your voice reveals a lot about you. And by listening to your voice and using machine learning to analyze how you sound, Halo is going to be able to see how stressed you sound. </p>
<p> The microphones in the Halo band will listen in the background, sampling speech samples every 10 minutes or so. You can also turn these off at anytime, but long-pressing the button on the band. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There is also Live Mode. This can analyze your tone in real-time, and give you feedback on how you're sounding. Which can be useful if you are preparing to give a speech. </p>
<p> This data is not sent to the cloud, something Amazon is really stressing here. </p>
<p> It's only available in the US… for now </p>
<p> As with a lot of new things that Amazon and other companies launch, Halo is going to be exclusive to the US. At least for now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can request early access starting today. And you can do that here. </p>

<p> Amazon Kids Is The Company's New Name For Kids-Focused Software </p>
<p> Amazon is rebranding its FreeTime and FreeTime Unlimited kids-focused software experiences with a new, easier to understand name. </p>
<p> The names will now be Amazon Kids and Amazon Kids+. Both of these names will make more sense to the parents that may want to use them for their own children. </p>
<p> And although it surely wasn't exceedingly difficult to figure out what FreeTime and FreeTime Unlimited were, neither name really did a great job at describing to parents what the software was for. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon Kids and Amazon Kids+ makes things much more clear, so there's a lot less confusion on what the software experiences offer and why parents should want to check them out. </p>
<p> Amazon Kids software will have a new home screen experience </p>
<p> The new names aren't the only thing coming. Amazon says there will be a new home screen experience that gets added to the software. </p>
<p> Specifically this will include a new theme which Amazon says will look and feel more like a tablet UI that was designed for grown ups. Presumably this is so kids feel like they get to use a more grown-up device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon says it recommends the new experience for kids that are ages 8 and up. It also confirms that the new theme will begin to hit tablet devices over the next few weeks. Though the Amazon Kids and Kids+ branding will take a bit longer and start rolling out over the coming months. </p>
<p> The new theme will not necessarily be on by default though. Parents that want to enable it will need to go into the Amazon Parent Dashboard and turn it on. Once in the dashboard, the new theme is located un the profile settings which can be found under the menu for adjusting age filters and themes. </p>
<p> Kids will now be able to broadcast their voice to Alexa devices </p>
<p> Amazon is adding a fun and functional new feature to the services. Broadcasting. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once the software is update, kids will be able to broadcast their voices to any connected Alexa devices within the home. So if you have an Echo speaker, your kids will be able to get your attention no matter where they are in the home in relation to the speaker. </p>
<p> This feature is called Announcements, and parents do have to enable it. This will also be rolling out in the next few weeks along with the new home screen theme. </p>
<p> Amazon Kids will be a free service. However if parents want to go with the Amazon+ option, it'll be $4.99 a month. You can save a little bit if you subscribe to Amazon Prime. As the cost will go down to $2.99 a month. </p>

<p> New Amazon, MediaTek Chip Brings Fast On-Device Processing To Echo </p>
<p> Amazon took to the web today to launch a new range of smart speakers and it partnered with MediaTek for the chip powering one of the gadgets' best features. Namely, on-device processing, according to a recent report from The Verge. </p>
<p> Dubbed the AZ1 Neural Edge processor, it brings at least some of Alexa's functionality on Echo devices into parity with those running Google Assistant. Google's offerings have provided on-device processing for quite some time now. But Amazon devices previously sent audio data and interactions to the cloud for processing. </p>
<p> The new chip doesn't mean that Alexa-enabled speakers will work without a connection. Or that older speakers will be better. But, enabled by the AZ1 MediaTek chip, the new Echo-branded Alexa devices be improved. And, in part thanks to additional built-in memory, the new Echo and Echo Show 10 will be even faster to respond. Those two devices will also be the ones that support the all-neural speech model. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Which Alexa devices are built on the new MediaTek Chip? </p>
<p> As summarized by Amazon, the MediaTek-built AZ1 Neural Edge processor cuts power consumption by 20-times with new Echo devices. Speech processing is twice as fast, on average, and memory use has dropped by 85-percent too. </p>
<p> In terms of exactly which speakers will feature the custom processor, the list of devices is going to be short. In fact, it appears to be just five devices. The new Echo smart speaker will be among the gadgets, of course. So will the new Echo Dot, Echo Dot with clock, and Echo Dot Kids Edition. Finally, the Echo Show 10 smart display will pack the AZ1 processor too. </p>
<p> This isn't going to bring massive improvements everywhere all at once, unfortunately </p>
<p> Now, none of that means the experience with Alexa-enabled devices is going to drastically change. The improvements will mostly be seen in terms of response times from Alexa. But nothing here is going to change in terms of user interactions with the voice data either. Users will still conveniently be able to manage voice history and interactions via the Amazon Alexa app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Simultaneously, not every user is going to see the benefits of the AZ1 immediately either. In fact, to begin with, only English speaking users will be able to take advantage of the on-device processing. And that will only be in the US. </p>
<p> Amazon hasn't provided exact details for a wider release but says that plans are in place to improve the user experience in other languages "in time." </p>

<p> Much like many of the other streaming music services out there. Amazon Music has decided to jump on the Podcasts bandwagon too. </p>
<p> According to Amazon Music's VP, Steve Boom, "our customers' listening habits are constantly evolving, and we know they're looking to us to provide them with a rich experience rooted in music and entertainment." Boom continued by stating that "with this launch, we're bringing customers even more forms of entertainment to enjoy, while enabling creators to reach new audiences globally, just as we've done with music streaming. Podcasts, paired with our recent partnership with Twitch to bring live streaming into the app, makes Amazon Music a premiere destination for creators." </p>

<p> Which podcasts are available? </p>
<p> Amazon says that popular shows like Crime Junkie, What A Day, Radiolab, Revisionist History, Planet Money, Ear Hustle, Why Won’t You Date Me? with Nicole Byer, and Stuff You Should Know are available now. </p>
<p> It also notes that millions of episodes from top shows, with more being added all the time. So it's not as simple as Amazon Music becoming a podcast-catcher, like with PocketCasts or Google Podcasts. But more about Amazon Music actually adding support for them. </p>
<p> That also means that Amazon Music is going to add some exclusive podcasts, like Disgraceland, which is a narrative storytelling highlights tales of getting away with murder and behaving badly. Disgraceland will be premiering in February 2021. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are other exclusives coming too, including a new podcast from DJ Khaled, called "The First One". It's a new audio experience hosted by DJ Khaled. And developed by Amazon Music and the Springhill Company. DJ Khaled will be interviewing his all-time favorite artists about the hits that made them iconic and eventually legendary. </p>
<p> Why bring podcasts to Amazon Music? </p>
<p> Podcasts have been gradually becoming more and more popular in the past five years or so. But, with the global pandemic going on, and most of us still stuck at home, many are turning to creating and consuming podcasts. Including many celebrities that you never would have thought would have time to do a podcast. </p>
<p> For Amazon, it's about adding more content. Adding exclusive content that is going to get people to use its service over competitors. Like YouTube Music, Apple Music and Spotify. This is the same tactic that Spotify is taking on as well, with paying Joe Rogan and Michelle Obama millions for their podcasts to be exclusive to their platform. </p>

<p> Amazon One Lets You Make Contactless Payments With Your Palm </p>
<p> Amazon has unveiled a new biometrics technology that allows users to make contactless payments with the palm of their hand. Amazon One, as the company calls its new innovative technology, uses your "unique palm signature" to verify your identity. </p>
<p> Starting today, customers entering the Amazon Go stores at 7th & Blanchard and South Lake Union at 300 Boren Ave. North in Seattle can use Amazon One as an entry option. The signup process first requires you to insert your credit card and then hover your palm over the device. Now follow the prompts to associate that card with your unique palm signature. You can choose to register just one palm or both. </p>
<p> Once you've registered your palm with Amazon One, you can enter stores that use this service by simply holding your palm above the scanning device for about a second or so. You don't need an Amazon account to use the service. It just needs a credit card and your phone number. If you no longer want to use this service, you can delete your data from the company's online portal. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon says the service uses proprietary computer vision algorithms to create your palm signature in real time. It'll capture "the most distinct identifiers on your palm" that may include a combination of the palm's surface details such as lines, ridges, and vein patterns. </p>
<p> Amazon One may arrive at more locations soon </p>
<p> Amazon has been working on this palm recognition service for the past several years. The retail giant applied patent for this technology with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) back in June 2018. The patent was published in December 2019, showing a sign that the development is nearing a final product. </p>
<p> Debuting at the two Go stores, the company plans to add Amazon One to its other brick and mortar stores in the coming months. The service is eventually targeted as an identity verification system for various other locations such as stadiums and office buildings. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> "We believe Amazon One has broad applicability beyond our retail stores, so we also plan to offer the service to third parties like retailers, stadiums, and office buildings so that more people can benefit from this ease and convenience in more places," said Dilip Kumar, vice president of Amazon's physical retail business, in a blog post on Tuesday. </p>
<p> The company projects Amazon One as a part of an existing entry point to make accessing such locations quicker and easier. Meanwhile, in retail locations, the service could become an alternate payment or loyalty card option. Since it is a contactless solution, it addresses the much-needed norms of social hygiene as well. </p>
<p> Additionally, palm recognition also has a privacy benefit over other biometrics technology such as face recognition. You can't determine a person's identity by looking at the image of their palm. The system also requires the person to make an intentional gesture of holding their hand over the scanning machine. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon says it's in active discussions with several potential customers, so we may soon see the use of Amazon One beyond the company's own retail chain. </p>

<p> Amazon Prime Day Is Set For October 13 </p>
<p> After several delays and reschedulings, Amazon has scheduled Prime Day 2020 for October 13. </p>
<p> It's not official yet, but CNET is reporting that it is happening October 13 and 14. We can also confirm from our sources that Amazon employees have had the week of October 13-20 blacked out for Prime Day. Which is what Amazon typically does for the big shopping days, like Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. </p>
<p> Amazon will likely officially announce Prime Day in the coming days, as that is less than three weeks away at this point. It could even be announced at its event tomorrow. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What kind of sales can I expect from Prime Day? </p>
<p> Typically, Prime Day lasts for about two days, though many sellers will start their sales early and they last beyond Prime Day. </p>
<p> All of Amazon's products will be on sale. From the Echos, to the Fire TV, to Fire tablets and everything in between. Typically, this is when we see the lowest prices on its products. So it's worth it to wait for Prime Day to purchase. </p>
<p> We'll also see some steep discounts on TVs, robot vacuums, smartphones, and everything in between. Almost everything that Amazon sells will be on sale at some point during Prime Day. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What does an October Prime Day mean? </p>
<p> With Prime Day being later this year than it normally is, thanks to the pandemic, this could result in a lot of people buying their holiday gifts earlier than usual. Most people wait until Black Friday to really start shopping. But with a big event like Prime Day happening in October, the month before, it could help people get their holiday shopping done sooner. That would also relieve a lot of the stress that comes with last minute holiday shopping, and that's always good. </p>
<p> Prime Day does typically provide a nice boost to retailers that don't sell on Amazon, as well as other smaller sellers on Amazon. </p>
<p> For the bigger retailers like Best Buy, JCPenny and such, this is going to really help them. Because they typically run their own massive sales alongside Amazon. And where most of them had to close their locations for a majority of the year due to the pandemic, it means that they'll be able to have a pretty decent Q4. Even before we get to Black Friday in November. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That's not only good for those retailers but also for the economy as more money being spent means more jobs being saved. </p>

<p> Amazon / Amazon Just Made The Echo Flex Infinitely More Useful With This New Accessory </p>
<p> Amazon Just Made The Echo Flex Infinitely More Useful With This New Accessory </p>
<p> Amazon just announced the Smart Clock for Echo Flex accessory, which is a $15 accessory that plugs into the Echo Flex and gives it an LED clock. Similar to the Echo Dot with Clock. </p>
<p> Basically, the Smart Clock for Echo Flex will plug into the USB port on the bottom of the Echo Flex, and provide you with a clock. Alexa will automatically discover the clock, so there's no real set-up needed here. </p>
<p> Besides the fact that this is going to allow you to have a clock in the hallway or in your bedroom on the wall, it also will give you a visual for timers and such. Alexa does support up to 20 timers too. And that's going to make this really useful for the kitchen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon didn't actually make the Smart Clock accessory </p>
<p> So Amazon didn't, technically, make this new accessory. It's made by Third Reality, but it is part of the "Made for Amazon" program. So it does work with the Echo Flex without any issues. And that's always a good thing. </p>
<p> It will cost you $15 when it starts shipping on August 11. So it's about the same price as the Echo Flex. And for some people, simply getting an Echo Dot with Clock (when it's on sale) might be the better option. </p>
<p> Though, we can't deny that being able to have a clock on the wall with Alexa, is definitely useful. As it doesn't take up any space in your home, or need a table to sit on. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It does have a pretty bright display, and you can adjust the brightness by telling Alexa to change it. You can also change between the 12 hour and 24 hour format, by using the Third Reality Alexa Skill. </p>
<p> What's beautiful about this is the fact that there are no batteries needed, since it is plugged into the Echo Flex and that is plugged into the wall. So now you can have an Alexa powered clock in your hallway or anywhere in your home. </p>
<p> Obviously, you will need the Echo Flex, to be able to use this Smart Clock accessory. The Echo Flex retails for $25, and then the Smart Clock is $15, so for $40 you're getting an Echo that is plugged directly into the wall and giving you a smart clock. Not to shabby. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Smart Clock is now up for pre-order on Amazon. And it is set to start shipping on August 11 – next Tuesday. </p>

<p> Amazon Adds Twitch Live Streaming To Its Music App </p>
<p> Amazon is adding Twitch streaming functionalities to its Music app, the company announced on Tuesday. This partnership between the two sister companies will enable artists to connect live with their fans on Amazon Music. </p>
<p> Twitch’s live streaming functionality is already available on Amazon Music app for both Android and iOS platforms. It is accessible for users across all streaming tiers, including the free tier, Amazon Prime, Amazon Music Unlimited, and Amazon Music HD. </p>
<p> Users can follow an artist on Amazon Music and get alerts when they go live. They can also discover ongoing live streams through the app's new "Live" browse page. Additionally, an artist’s profile page will also show if they are streaming live. Music artists will need to link their Amazon Music and Twitch accounts through the new Amazon Music for Artists app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company says more than 1,000 artists connected their Amazon Music accounts to Twitch on the first day itself. Amazon Music has more than 55 million customers across all streaming tiers. </p>
<p> Amazon Music and Twitch, both owned by Amazon, have teamed up in the past as well. The two companies worked with artists including Barry Gibb, Ryan Tedder, Charlie Puth, and many others to raise funds for COVID-19 Relief efforts earlier this year. </p>
<p> Amazon Music adds Twitch live streaming </p>
<p> Since the COVID-19 pandemic has shut down in-person events, concert live streaming has grown multifold. As artists can't go on tour, they are looking for new ways to continue creating and connecting with fans. Many artists have taken to platforms such as Twitch, TikTok, Facebook, and others to connect with their fans. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Twitch, in particular, has seen strong adoption by artists as their go-to platform for live streaming during this pandemic. According to a StreamElements report, the Amazon-owned streaming service saw a 56-percent quarter-on-quarter increase in hours watched in Q2 2020. </p>
<p> Amazon is sensing an opportunity here as incorporating Twitch's live streaming functionality into its Music app could provide artists with a larger audience, resulting in greater adoption of its two services. This also enables fans to watch their favorite artists perform live on the very platform they listen to their songs from. </p>
<p> "The combination of live streaming, coupled with the on-demand playback of songs on Amazon Music is groundbreaking," said Ryan Redington, Director, Amazon Music. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Upcoming Twitch live streams on Amazon Music include: </p>
<p> A Q/A session by The Killers’ Brandon Flowers and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. about their latest album, Imploding the Mirage, on September 4 at 1 PM ET (5 PM GMT). </p>
<p> Soul singer and storyteller Nicole Atkins will host a variety series Wednesdays at 7 PM ET (11 PM GMT) with performances and interviews with friends and artists including Elle King, Cut Worms, and Whitney. </p>
<p> Amazon Music UK will stream the Heavy Music Awards 2020 on September 3 at 3:30 PM ET (7:30 PM GMT). The event will feature performances from The Hunna, Holding Absence, Heart Of A Coward, Wargasm, Coldbones, and HAWXX. </p>
<p> Capital One City Parks Foundation's SummerStage Anywhere will stream weekly concert series on Tuesday at 7 PM ET(11 PM GMT). Those exclusive concerts will span across Latin, World, Hip-Hop, Jazz, and more. </p>

<p> Alexa Updates To Be Smarter Than Ever & To Join Your Conversations </p>
<p> Amazon has kicked off its hardware event with a plethora of news, including updates that allow Alexa to join conversations and remember things better. </p>
<p> The latter feature is arguably the most intriguing. As demonstrated by Amazon during its event, the AI can now be asked to join in on a conversation. In effect, Alexa can become a third person in the conversation. And that comes complete with awareness regarding when it is — or isn't — being addressed. So it won't interrupt or interject when users don't want it to. </p>
<p> Additionally, the users in the demo didn't need to wake Alexa up again, allowing the AI to integrate without saying "Alexa" again. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Updates allowing conversations with AI are great but what else can the new Alexa do? </p>
<p> Setting aside the ability to interact as a third participant in conversations, Alexa is also getting a couple of other great updates. To begin with, it's going to be more conversational too. </p>
<p> Amazon says that Alexa will sound more natural in the flow of a conversation in terms of its tone and understanding context. That means that it will pause, add emphasis to words, and more, naturally. And all within the context of the conversation that's being had either with Alexa as a third participant or one-on-one. </p>
<p> Finally, Amazon revealed that Alexa will now be able to remember clarifications made by end-users. In its demonstration, Alexa was told to "set the light to Rohit's reading mode." Alexa misunderstood the request. So the AI asked what the presenter meant by "Rohit's reading mode." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The presenter told Alexa that the light should be set to an exact percentage. </p>
<p> In the past, Alexa would simply have set the light to that percentage and called it a day. Now, Alexa will remember when users clarify. So, using Amazon's example, Rohit can simply repeat his initial request in the future. And Alexa will remember to set the light to his defined percentage. </p>
<p> These updates should be rolling out immediately </p>
<p> Now, no exact timeline for these updates to arrive has been reported. But, as with most updates for Alexa and unlike most of the hardware announced today, Amazon should be rolling these changes out now. So users will want to keep an ear out for the update to arrive. To check manually for updates, users need to log into the Alexa application and navigate to Settings. The update settings are featured under the "About" section of the resulting menu. </p>

<p> Amazon Is Planning On Offering Podcasts In Two Of Its Services </p>
<p> A new report suggests that Amazon is preparing to offer users podcasts in two of its services. </p>
<p> Which not only opens up the possibility for more listeners for podcast creators, but it adds some value for Amazon's subscribers. It should also make listening to podcasts on Amazon's Alexa-enabled speakers a little easier for those that use Amazon's services. </p>
<p> Currently you can only get podcasts on its Alexa-enabled devices through various skills and apps that aren't developed by Amazon. Such as Spotify, iHeart Radio and more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon may add podcasts to Amazon Music and Audible in the near future </p>
<p> It appears that Amazon will definitely add podcasts to Amazon Music and Audible at some point down the road. </p>
<p> The question really, is when that will happen. It could be closer than you think. Sooner rather than later, you may be able to listen to your favorite podcasts via Amazon's two streaming audio services. </p>
<p> An email obtained by The Desk shows that Amazon confirms the podcasts are coming. So they're on the way. And it looks like Amazon is contacting top podcast creators to let them know about the new podcasts feature in both these services. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The benefit for podcast creators in working with Amazon to submit their content means they'd have access to a large list of users. Between Amazon Music and Audible, Amazon has around 55 million subscribers. Many of which may not subscribe to any other streaming music app. </p>
<p> That opens the door for a lot of untapped potential in terms of listeners. But podcast creators would have to meet a list of requirements that Amazon has put on the table. </p>
<p> Podcast creators can't say bad things about Amazon or its services </p>
<p> The main term set forth by the company that Amazon doesn't want creators saying bad things about it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One of the regulations that creators have to agree to if they want their feeds to be submitted before the podcasts feature arrives, is to abstain from negative context against Amazon. </p>
<p> Specifically creators can't say anything negative about Amazon as a company. They also can't be negative towards Amazon's products or services. Advertisements on the podcasts are required to abstain from this as well. </p>
<p> When podcasts launch on Amazon Music, both free tier subscribers and premium tier subscribers will have access. Audible only offers a free tier, save for the trial period, so users will more or less be paying to access podcasts there. </p>

<p> Android 10 Is Rolling Out To The ASUS ZenFone 5Z </p>
<p> ASUS has started rolling out the Android 10 update for its 2018 flagship handset, the ZenFone 5Z. This update follows the update for the ZenFone 6/6Z that arrived earlier this month. </p>
<p> Not many people expected the ZenFone 5Z to follow this soon, but ASUS made it happen. This is a stable Android 10 update for the ZenFone 5Z, in case you were wondering. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 5Z received the Android 10 beta update late last month, so this update was definitely not expected. Users were expecting ASUS to deliver in December, at the earliest, but ASUS managed to surprise everyone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This new update brings all the general Android 10 features that you may expect, along with some changes that ZenUI 6 bings. </p>
<p> Android 10 for the ZenFone 5Z removes quite a few ZenUI-specific features </p>
<p> ASUS had managed to clean up its ZenUI Android skin with Android 10 quite a bit, and it only builds upon that here. The company removed Page Marker, ZeniMoki, Selfie Master, Beauty Live, Kids Mode, Easy Mode, weather animation setting, AI charging, WebStorage, Go2 Pay, Report Location in Safeguard, and Yandex cloud option in File Manager. All these are ZenUI-related changes. </p>
<p> In terms of ZenUI, the company also moved Themes and Mobile Manager to Advanced Settings. Android 10 also brings upgraded APN settings to the ZenFone 5Z. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It is worth noting that ZenUI 6 is much closer to stock Android that ZenUI 5 was. ASUS cleaned up its skin quite a bit, which was first noticeable on the ZenFone 6 when it launched. </p>
<p> Well, the ZenFone 5Z brings such an experience as well, with an upgraded version of Android, nonetheless. ZenUI 6 actually even looks like stock Android, for the most part. </p>
<p> As part of the Android 10 update, you’ll get a system-wide dark theme. This is the same dark theme implementation that Google implemented. The same can be said for Android 10 navigation gestures, as they’re also a part of this update. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Native screen recorder and a one-hand mode are available here </p>
<p> ZenUI 6 does build upon Android 10 experience by adding a native screen recorder, which is not available on the Pixel phones. If you like to use a one-hand mode, that feature is included here as well. </p>
<p> ASUS’ Game Genie feature is available in the Settings, while you’ll find a number of additional options that are not available in stock Android builds. </p>
<p> News of this update surfaced on the company’s official website, well, its official forums. Regions were not mentioned, so we’re presuming that the update is rolling out to all unlocked global ZenFone 5Z units. Do note that the update is coming in batches, so it may take a while for it to reach your device. </p>

<p> Android 10 Update Finally Arrives On Verizon Galaxy Tab S4 </p>
<p> Months after being available for the LTE Samsung Galaxy Tab S4, the Android 10 update is now finally making its way for the Verizon Galaxy Tab S4. </p>
<p> Notably, the new update also brings along all the new features that are under the package with One UI 2.1. Though the update is arriving a bit late, that is how it is. </p>
<p> This Android 10 One UI 2.1 update is feature-packed. Additionally, it bumps the security patch level to August 2020. It is arriving with version number T837VVRU4CTH6 for the cellular variant of the Tab S4. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Talking about all the new features, it packs live transcribe, new gesture navigation, Focus Mode, Sound Amplifier, Samsung Daily, etc. along with other Android 10 features. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that all the latest Samsung tablets are running One UI 2.5, while Verizon Galaxy Tab S4 is currently receiving One UI 2.1. Other inclusions are Quick Share, Music Share, and a redesigned Gallery app. </p>
<p> Samsung has always been known as a leader when it comes to pushing the latest updates. Especially for pushing security updates. However, the carrier variants are not always as fast as the OEM. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sound Amplifier can be used to boost sound and reduce background noise </p>
<p> You can plug in your headphones to use the Sound Amplifier button. This will reduce the background noise and boost the sound while on a call, listening to music, etc. </p>
<p> Live Transcribe will show you the real-time text of sound coming out from the microphone and displays as text. Note that Google though processes your conversations but never stores them. </p>
<p> Full-screen gestures are now more improved and faster. Well, one good thing is that Bixby is now replaced by Samsung Daily. You can give a glance to all your favorite things in here without the need to open individual apps. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Just a single tap will show you the current news, weather, appointments, and more. Focus Mode is just Digital Wellbeing that is meant to minimize the distractions and lets you focus on your work. </p>
<p> All in all, this is a featureful update, which the users should be receiving via OTA. However, note that the updates will take some time in hitting all the units. </p>
<p> If you haven't received the Android 10 update notification on your Verizon Galaxy Tab S4 then you can head over to Settings > About Phone > Software updates > Check for Updates. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tap on the latest update notification to start the downloading process. Note that we recommend you use a stable internet connection to download this file as it is big in size. </p>

<p> Android 11 Release: Features, Supported Phones & More </p>
<p> Android 11 is the latest version of Android to hit the majority of the world's smartphones. Google set the release of Android 11 for September 8, 2020. </p>
<p> With the release of Android 11, Google has introduced a number of new features. Some of which have been a long time coming for Android. Like Bubbles for Conversations. </p>
<p> Here's everything you need to know about the release of Android 11. From when it is going to be available, to what devices are getting the update, to the features that are coming with this latest version of Android. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When is Android 11 coming to my smartphone? </p>
<p> Android 11 will be available on all Pixel devices (Pixel 2 and newer) on the release date of September 8. It might take a bit longer to hit every single Pixel device, as Google tends to do a staggered roll out for these releases. </p>
<p> It will also come to select Pixel, OnePlus, Xiaomi, OPPO and realme phones on September 8. Other phones will get it a bit later on. </p>
<p> For the most part, if your phone was released in 2019 or later, you are pretty much guaranteed to get Android 11. The only question is when you'll get it. Normally, the newest phones get updated first. We may even see some 2018 smartphones get updated, like the Galaxy S9 series. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What's new in Android 11? </p>
<p> With the release of Android 11, Google is really focusing on conversations and messaging. And it is debuting a feature, that it actually talked about a couple of years ago. Which are bubbles. And yes, they are basically a straight up, rip off of Facebook Messenger's Chat Heads. Which Facebook has had in its app for many years now. But the different now is that most of your conversations, in different apps, are going to work with Bubbles. That's a big deal. </p>
<p> Media controls have been redesigned in Android 11 as well. So instead of them showing up as a notification in your notification shade, they are actually part of the quick settings section now. They look mostly the same, but they stay in your quick settings now. Which makes it easier to play/pause music, skip to the next song and so forth. On top of that, you can also switch where the music is playing – whether that is on device, on your headphones, speakers, or somewhere else. </p>
<p> Permissions are getting changes once again, in the release of Android 11. There are a couple of changes to permissions in Android 11. One, is the new one-time permission option. So you can opt to give the app access each time you open it. This means that an app won't be tracking your location all the time. Just every time you open the app. This can be quite annoying though, having to give it access every time. But worth the inconvenience. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The other change to permissions is going to be for apps you don't use often. If you haven't used an app recently, Google is going to automatically reset those permissions. So when you re-open the app, you'll need to give the app those permissions once again. This is also another way that Google is looking to protect your data and privacy. </p>
<p> There are many other changes in Android 11 as well, and you can check out the full feature list here. </p>
<p> How do I use Bubbles for my conversations? </p>
<p> As mentioned before, Bubbles are very similar to Chat Heads, from Facebook Messenger. And it's going to make multi-tasking so much easier, in Android 11. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You will be able to move the bubbles around on your home screen, and even flick them away if you wish to do so. The whole point of this is to allow you to respond to your friends and family, without needing to leave the app you are currently in. </p>
<p> There is going to be a new setting in Android 11, so you can set certain conversations to open up in Bubbles and others to open up in the app as normal. This will be found in Settings > Apps > [App Name] > Notifications and then tap on Bubbles to the see the screen above. </p>
<p> In addition to Bubbles, Google is making another change to conversations and it has to do with the notification shade. There's going to be a new section in your notification shade that will be specifically for conversations. So you can keep your conversations in one place. And it'll make dealing with your many notifications a lot easier. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What apps are compatible with Bubbles? </p>
<p> One of the downsides to enabling a new feature like Bubbles, is that developers need to add support within their app for it. Currently, Bubbles is not available within every messaging app right now. It's only available with a few of them. But that list is expected to grow, especially with the release of Android 11. </p>
<p> As of now, Google Messages, Discord, Facebook Messenger and Telegram support it. </p>
<p> How does 5G and Android 11 work together? </p>
<p> 5G has been a big topic of 2020, though not quite as big as some other topics unfortunately. But it is on the way and it's going to make our lives a lot more enjoyable. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Android 11 is aiming to work better with 5G. But, most people likely won't notice the difference. </p>
<p> Google is introducing the "Dynamic Meterdness API" with the release of Android 11. Which is going to take full advantage of all that 5G power. Basically, the API detects that you are connected to an unlimited 5G signal, it'll allow you to access the highest possible quality for videos and graphics. So you can really take advantage of those Gigabit speeds. </p>
<p> Where can I download Android 11? </p>
<p> Typically, only Google releases Android 11 downloads for its own Pixel devices. So if you have a Pixel device, you can download the factory images here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the factory image, you won't need to wait for the OTA to hit your device. But beware, that when you do update your phone using the factory image, you will lose all of your data. So keep that in mind before you decide to go this route, and of course, make sure to back it all up. </p>
<p> Is the Android Beta Program closing? </p>
<p> Surprisingly, no. The Android Beta Program is not closing, just yet. Google is opting to keep it open and allow users to check out early Android 11 builds. </p>
<p> Now Google was a bit vague with this. So we are not sure if this means that it will be for the security patches, or even feature drops in the future. But if you enroll your device, you will get early OTAs, which is always awesome. </p>
<p> The r/android_beta sub-reddit is also remaining open, but the Android Beta issues tracker and the feedback app are closing in the next few days. </p>

<p> Here's What's New In Android 11 For Android TV </p>
<p> Google just announced Android 11 for Android TV, and it'll be rolling out in the coming months. But there are some new features in Android 11 for Android TV. So here's everything that is new, as of right now. </p>
<p> Spoiler alert: it's not a long list. </p>
<p> New features for Android 11 on Android TV </p>
<p> With Android 11 for Android TV, there are a few changes to the core Android experience on TV. Android 11 is bringing some performance improvements to the TV. This includes enhanced memory management and privacy features. Including a core feature of Android 11, which is one-time permissions. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Android 11 is bringing Auto Low Latency Mode to the TV, and low latency media decoding. This comes with a new tuner framework and updated Media CAS support. Google is also bringing extensions to the HAL implementation of HDMI CEC. </p>
<p> Google has also extended Gamepad support, silent boot mode for system updates and inactivity prompts. Which gives Android 11 greater control over TV functions. There is also new framework functionality available for managing system LEDs, and physical microphone mute buttons. </p>
<p> Finally, Google made it easier to test on the TV. With the new test harness mode on Android TV and play Store support in the Android TV emulator, developers can now easily test their apps before deploying them. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When will I get Android 11? </p>
<p> According to Google, Android TV OEM partners are going to be launching and upgrading their devices to Android 11 over the coming months. </p>
<p> This means that it is unlikely that your TV will get Android 11 before the end of the year. Typically, Android TV makers have been very slow to update their TVs to the latest version of Android TV. In fact, one of my Hisense TVs just got updated to Android 10 last month. So don't expect to see it anytime soon. However, if you do have an NVIDIA SHIELD TV, you will likely see the update a lot sooner. NVIDIA is usually somewhat fast with updating its devices. So you might even see it before the end of 2020. </p>
<p> Those developers with the ADT-3 development Android TV device, you will get the update today. Which will allow Developers to start working on Android 11 for Android TV and preparing their apps. Since there was no beta for it. Unfortunately, if you're not a developer, you can't buy the ADT-3, so the rest of us are out of luck for now, when it comes to checking out Android 11 for Android TV. Though the majority of the changes are behind the scenes anyways. </p>

<p> Android News / Android 11 Preview Is Available For Android TV, But You Won't Be Able To Run It </p>
<p> Android 11 Preview Is Available For Android TV, But You Won't Be Able To Run It </p>
<p> Google has just released the Android 11 Developer Preview for Android TV. But unfortunately, the vast majority of us will not be able to run it on our Android TV devices. </p>
<p> The reason for that is because it is only going to be available on the ADT-3 Developer Kit, which was not widely sold. So the number of developers with this unit is pretty small. </p>
<p> Google doesn't say much about this preview </p>
<p> For the first Android 11 preview for Android TV, Google has not said a lot about what to expect. Other than touting "privacy, performance, accessibility, and connectivity features." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's no huge blog post from Android Developers explaining what's new either, which is rather unfortunate. </p>
<p> However, we should learn more about what's new in Android 11 for Android TV in the "Android Beyond Phones" week of videos from the Android team. And that will be happening in August. </p>
<p> Most Android TV devices are still on Android 9 Pie, with very few getting Android 10. Google did announce Android 10 in December for Android TV, but it never really rolled out to any of its devices. So it's good to see that Android 11 is at least coming in preview form for Android TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How do I install it on my ADT-3 Developer Kit? </p>
<p> If you are one of the few that have the ADT-3 Developer Kit, here's how you can install it. </p>
<p> Next, plug in the ADT-3 developer kit for Android TV and enable Developer Options. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, run the flash-all.sh in the unzipped folder. This will install the entire image on your ADT-3. </p>
<p> It's worth mentioning here that this is just an update to the core OS, there's no visual updates or user-facing changes (yet). All user data is going to be wiped and you will not be able to go back to Android 10. </p>
<p> That's likely why it is only available on the ADT-3 and not other Android TV devices like the NVIDIA SHIELD TV or Mi Box S. Since there's no Pixel or Nexus version of an Android TV device right now – though there have been plenty of rumors of one coming. So hopefully we'll get one this fall. It's been many years since the Nexus Player launched, and there hasn't been a successor to it since it was killed off a few years ago. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, it is good to see that Google is still actively developing for Android TV. </p>

<p> Android Headlines Awards – Best Battery Smartphone 2018 </p>
<p> 2-day battery life is easily achievable on the Huawei P20 Pro </p>
<p> There are many reasons to buy a smartphone, but sometimes longevity is the most important factor. While there are certainly plenty of budget-minded phones that can deliver on such promises due to their lower-power nature, most flagship-level phones simply cannot offer more than a single day's use on a full charge. Today we're giving two phones an award for delivering greater than one-day battery life, all without sacrificing the performance or features expected from a flagship device. </p>
<p> WINNER: Huawei P20 Pro </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It seems like every Android update from Google and every new phone talks about better battery life, but we’ve rarely seen any real substantial improvements to this statistic in several years. Oftentimes phones that could claim over a day’s worth of battery life had several other problems, including performance issues and harsh restrictions of apps and data running in the background. Huawei seemed to have aligned all the stars for its launch of the P20 Pro in the Spring, and it’s the P20 Pro that achieves the best battery life we’ve ever seen from a flagship device, all without sacrificing anything noticeable. In our review, we pointed out the fact that the phone only needed to be charged 3 times per week, and prolonged use proved was, indeed, reality. </p>
<p> While most phones still struggle to get through a full day of use without some kind of top-up, the P20 Pro finished the first day with an average of 60% battery left, even through heavy use. What’s probably most important through all of this is the fact that the processing power and background task management aren't going to suffer just to deliver solid battery life. In the past, we saw Huawei, in particular, with its EMUI Android skin, artificially restrict background app and data usage just to achieve good battery life from its phones. That’s all gone in the latest versions of EMUI, and what’s left is a phone that’s fast, lasts a long time on a single charge, and doesn’t make users feel restricted in any which way. </p>
<p> Sony has long been at the top of the game for good battery life on its flagship phones, but something about the Xperia XZ2 seems to have really hit the nail on its head. A combination of a sizable battery and a low-power display certainly help get things started off right, and Sony has only furthered their efforts with quality software design that’s mindful of user habits all while keeping battery health in tip-top shape. Sony’s own QNovo battery technology intelligently monitors charging habits and determines the average amount of the time phone spends on the charger, utilizing key triggers, like alarms, to determine exactly when the phone is going to be taken off the charger. Sony’s intelligent QNovo software will stop the phone charging at 90% to keep the battery from being overcharged and finish the remaining 10% as it gets closer to the calculated unplug time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Overcharging is a big cause of shorter battery capacity over the life of the device, making this an important, unique feature. It’s not just battery health that makes the Xperia XZ2 so good, it’s actual battery longevity itself. In our review, we talked about ending most days with 40-50% battery left, and given Sony’s incredible standby time, this could easily translate into near 2-day battery life for many users. Bottom line is this: while the Xperia XZ2 didn’t see quite as many hours of battery life as the Huawei P20 Pro, Sony’s battery health techniques could mean better battery longevity over the life of the phone, and thus not run into problems with quick battery draining in a few years as many other phones tend to suffer from. </p>

<p> Android Headlines Awards – Best Camera Smartphone 2018 </p>
<p> Huawei’s Mate 20 Pro has the most versatile smartphone camera ever made </p>
<p> Smartphone cameras have been "good enough" for a few generations now, but what about the ones that go above and beyond expectations? 2018 has been a pivotal year for smartphone photography, in particular, but has also proven to be a big year for videography too. Huawei has pushed the envelope for available focal lengths on phones, as well as introduced an industry-changing night mode with the P20, while Sony and LG delivered 4K HDR video recording, and HTC's U12+ can even focus in on the audio of subjects when zooming. What phone delivers the best experience? Here are our winners for 2018. </p>
<p> WINNER: Huawei Mate 20 Pro </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei has been an up-and-comer in the camera world for some time now, and while their co-branding with Leica a few years back spelled some big things in the works, it wasn’t until this Spring’s P20 Pro that we finally saw the real fruits of Huawei’s labor pay off. The Huawei Mate 20 Pro takes what was good about the P20 Pro and turns it up several notches, adding in a brand new 20-megapixel ultra-wide angle lens that’s also capable of taking super-macro photography as well. This, combined with the 80mm 3x optical zoom telephoto lens, the 40-megapixel main sensor with f/1.8 lens, and Huawei’s incredibly feature-rich software make this the most versatile camera on the market. 5x effective zoom is possible without any fidelity loss to the image, and the 40-megapixel setting produces the most detailed images of any smartphone by quite a wide margin. </p>
<p> Even low light capabilities are unmatched, both in auto and night modes. Auto mode produces the absolute brightest imagery of any smartphone and the gulf between the Mate 20 Pro and its next closest competitor can be pretty wide at times. Huawei introduced Night Mode with the P20 Pro in the Spring, but that mode has been further improved on the Mate 20 Pro thanks to some cleaner processing, better color accuracy, and of course the ability to select any ISO or shutter speed for the process. Even manual photo mode is more versatile than most other phones on the market thanks to its ability to crank the ISO up to 102,400; a number that's unheard of even on most SLR cameras, much less a smartphone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Its only real weakness is in video, where Huawei’s new image stabilization can cause some wacky issues, and the phone isn’t able to record in 60FPS at 4K resolution. The stabilization issue is expected to be fixed, but we’re probably going to have to wait another generation before we see 60FPS video support. Still, Huawei offers some pretty amazing new AI color modes, powered by the dual-NPU AI processors in the phone, colorizing black & white video in realtime, and performing a host of other interesting tricks as well. </p>
<p> We’ve been pretty critical of Samsung cameras in the past, and much of this criticism has to do with Samsung’s overly aggressive processing. Samsung has cleaned almost all of this up on the Galaxy Note 9, which received a substantial update after launch that improved image processing in a truly significant way. While it doesn’t have the wide-angle lens or extra steps of optical zooming that the Mate 20 Pro features, it’s got a more subtle scene detection algorithm, stellar low light shooting abilities that often produce more detail than the Mate 20 Pro, even if the images are a little darker. Samsung’s HDR is among the best balanced in the industry now and are processed in a split second, with no delay to the shutter and no waiting for processing in the background. It’s also got some of the absolute best video quality in the industry, with support for stabilized 4K 60FPS video, as well as the best software design for super slow motion on any smartphone. While it isn’t quite as versatile as Huawei’s latest and greatest, it provides an incredibly well-rounded experience that’s likely to please even the pickiest of consumers. </p>

<p> Android Headlines Awards – Best Smartphone 2018 </p>
<p> Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 is the complete package, through and through </p>
<p> Plenty of smartphones specialize in one thing or another, but what phone does almost everything well with little to no compromises? This year we've seen phone prices increase quite a bit, but with that increase comes better build quality, significantly better specs, and experiences that hopefully match the price tags. What phone delivers a solid experience, features that matter, and the overall best value? </p>
<p> WINNER: Samsung Galaxy Note 9 </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> 2018 is easily one of the most interesting years when it comes to smartphone designs, yet it’s paradoxically one where we’ve seen the most complacency among smartphone manufacturers. While most phones seem to be last year’s models with a notch thrown in, Samsung went with a similar design to last year and essentially only fixed what was missing from 2017’s Galaxy Note 8, all while leaving the best features intact and adding plenty of awesome new ones. As one of the absolute most expensive smartphones on the market, there’s a reason this phone has something for everyone. Folks looking for a solid design with the absolute best display in the industry simply need to look no further. Samsung displays are the best on the market, and Samsung chose its absolute best display ever for the 6.4-inch Galaxy Note 9, with a gorgeous set of curves on the left and right sides, tiny bezels and no obnoxious notch to deal with. On top of this, Samsung significantly increased the battery size over last year, improving battery life substantially, all while barely adding any size or weight over last year’s device at all. </p>
<p> The S-Pen was upgraded with some new remote features, powered by a Bluetooth connection, and the charging mechanism for the pen is completely transparent too. Better yet, you won’t need to charge it for the regular functions either, only for the new remote functions, and with a whopping 30-second charge to full, you’ll never need to worry about the battery life of the pen. The camera has also been significantly improved over previous years, even from the launch of the Note 9 itself, and features one of the most reliable, well-rounded cameras on the market. If this wasn’t enough, the sheer number of features and options available to users out of the box is staggering. Samsung Pay, the best mobile payments solution on the market, is certainly a hallmark feature of any Samsung device, but Samsung has taken features a massive step further with the updated Good Lock 2018 app, which, combined with the incredibly powerful and well-supported theme engine, makes the Galaxy Note 9 the most customizable phone on the market. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is all without having to mod the phone or perform complicated commands on a computer to get these features too; something unheard of in the mobile industry. Fully customizable UI? Check. Excellent performance and battery life? Absolutely. Unique, meaningful features you won’t find anywhere else this year? Many times over, and it’s all these things in one incredible package that brings us to give the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 the Smartphone of the Year Award for 2018, despite the high price of entry because, if any phone is worth the price you pay, it’s absolutely this one. </p>
<p> Huawei’s 2018 flagships are the company’s best showings ever and are significantly better than even their previous best smartphones from yesteryear. The Mate 20 Pro is the epitome of the term “flagship” and represents an incredible combination of new ideas, mixed with tried and true ones to create what could have been the ultimate smartphone. What holds Huawei back from getting the crown of best smartphone vendor of 2018? Simply put, software. While Huawei’s hardware and list of quality, unique features are all well worth taking a look at, Huawei’s EMUI Android skin is still a bit lacking in a number of areas. Some of these issues are bugs that can be squashed with future software updates, some are design inconsistencies or obvious oversights on Huawei’s part, and some represent problems of old that just don’t seem to want to go away. Not being able to change out your launcher with a 3rd party solution without running into big problems is something we thought was ancient history, but it’s these odd decisions that mar what could otherwise be the best smartphone ever made, especially given how good Huawei’s camera prowess has become in 2018. </p>
<p> LG received honorable mention for the V30 last year and not much has changed for the company in 2018. LG’s list of improvements is a decent length list, but it has also fallen behind in a few areas. While Samsung’s excuse for sticking with Android Oreo on a late 2018 release holds water because of its huge OneUI redesign, LG doesn’t seem to have the same excuse for its flagships, which are still waiting for any big announcement to come out of the upcoming Android 9 Pie release. Still, the hardware improvements coming from the V30 are noteworthy, including that excellent new BoomBox speaker, one of the best mobile displays ever made, the best vibration motors in the business, and a set of 5 cameras that give more control to the user than ever. If Huawei or Samsung’s solutions don’t appeal to you for any particular reason, LG is once again providing very compelling reasons to check out their biggest and best smartphone ever. </p>

<p> Android-Powered BlackBerry Ghost Launching In Summer: Rumor </p>
<p> The Android-powered BlackBerry Ghost smartphone is set to be launched this summer, established industry insider Evan Blass said Thursday. The handset that's been rumored for months now is understood to be produced by Optiemus Infracom, an Indian electronics maker and one of the Canadian company's original design manufacturer partners licenses to create and retail BlackBerry smartphones in its home country and several surrounding markets. Due to that state of affairs, the BlackBerry Ghost isn't expected to be closely related to the upcoming KEY2 or any other BlackBerry products from Huizhou, Guangdong, China-based TCL Communication. </p>
<p> The upcoming smartphone is rumored to be meant to compete in either the upper mid-range of flagship segment of the market, featuring a traditional candy bar design which lacks a physical QWERTY/QWERTZ keyboard many BlackBerry handsets — even contemporary ones — feature. Previous reports also pointed to a dual-camera setup being part of the package, with Mr. Blass's Thursday comments pointing toward the same and the industry insider claiming the handset will have "low-light enhancements" and optical zoom, without elaborating on the matter. If the BlackBerry Ghost ends up being a full-fledged Android flagship, the secondary lens found on its back panel may be of the telephoto variety, as is the case with numerous other high-end smartphones released in recent times. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry Ghost is expected to first be launched in India but as Optiemus also has a standing license to use the Canadian mobile brand for commercial purposes in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal, the handset may eventually make its way to those markets as well. Unlike TCL, Optiemus hasn't been using its BlackBerry rights too aggressively over the last year, having released only a couple of low-end models in its operating region. The BlackBerry Ghost is unlikely to ever make its way to the West. No BlackBerry flagships hit the market ever since the Waterloo-based tech giant shut down its hardware operations and turned to a licensing business model in late 2016, with the 2015 Priv being the last true high-end device to launch as part of the iconic brand. </p>

<p> Android-Powered BlackBerry KEY2 LE Leaks In Real-Life Image </p>
<p> A stitched image depicting what are said to be the front and back panels of TCL's upcoming BlackBerry KEY2 LE appeared online earlier today, having been shared by Android Police. The photograph seen above shows a device that's largely indistinguishable from the regular BlackBerry KEY2 launched earlier this spring but is expected to be released as a more affordable alternative to its sibling, with specs that are much closer to those of the 2017 BlackBerry KEYone than its 2018 follow-up. </p>
<p> The device is hence rumored to feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636, 4GB of RAM, and a 4.5-inch LCD panel with a resolution of 1,620 by 1,080 pixels amounting to a blocky aspect ratio of 3:2. Two variants offering a choice between 32GB and 64GB of flash memory are expected to be on the cards, with both being powered by a 3,000mAh battery and offering a dual-camera setup using a 13-megapixel sensor and a 5-megapixel one. For added context, the original BlackBerry KEY2 uses the newer Snapdragon 660 chip, 6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage space, a 3,500maH cell, and two 12-megapixel cameras on its back. Both devices have the same screen and house an identical QWERTY/Z keyboard whose space bar doubles as a fingerprint reader, though the KEY2 LE is understood to be slightly smaller than the handset that preceded it, measuring 150.25 x 71.8 x 8.35mm in size as opposed to 151.4 x 71.8 x 8.5mm. Likewise, the upcoming Android device should tip the scales at 156g, thus being 12g lighter than the KEY2. </p>
<p> It's still unclear when TCL may end up launching its next BlackBerry-branded smartphone but combined with the new sighting, one previous leak suggested that whenever that happens, the company will offer at least two color options to consumers, one of which will have a bright red frame. Given the hardware differences between the two models and the fact that the KEY2 starts at approximately $650, depending on the market, this lightweight take on the same keyboard-equipped Android formula may have a price tag that will hover around the $500 mark. </p>

<p> The Android TV Dongle Price Just Leaked, And It's Cheap </p>
<p> Google's Android TV products have never really been available at an affordable price before but that seems to be changing with the dongle. Eventually, the price of Android TV devices does drop. </p>
<p> In the case of the new Android TV device from Google though, the dongle codenamed Sabrina, the cost seems to be ridiculously inexpensive from the get-go considering what the dongle is essentially going to deliver to the user. </p>
<p> This also isn't Google's first dongle. It has the Chromecast Ultra. And older iterations of the Chromecast that you can no longer buy. Perhaps that plays a little bit into the suspected cost of this new dongle. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google's Android TV dongle price set at $50 </p>
<p> Maybe $50 isn't exceedingly cheap, but it's not $70 (the cost of the Chromecast Ultra when it launched) and it's quite a bit cheaper than something like the NVIDIA SHIELD. </p>
<p> Which is currently the only remaining Android TV product that you can buy brand-new in the US. </p>
<p> The price of the dongle appears to have been listed on an internal system at Home Depot (via 9To5Google). This isn't typically the place you'd expect to buy a piece of electronic equipment like this. So it's strange that the price would leak from a store that generally sells home improvement gear and hardware. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Regardless of location, though, the discovery is no doubt a good one for consumers who were interested in buying this. Because the cost was expected to be higher. So this could be seen as a nice surprise. </p>
<p> There will be multiple "fun" colors available </p>
<p> True to Google fashion, the Android TV dongle looks to be coming in some fun colors. </p>
<p> The listing on Home Depot's internal system shows three different variants. One coming in Como Blue, one coming in Rock Candy, and one coming in Summer Melon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Summer Melon is likely the color seen in initial leaked promo images of this device. Which has been shown alongside white and black options. Como Blue as the name suggests is probably a light-shaded blue option. While Rock Candy could be the name of the white model that's been leaked before as well. </p>
<p> These three colors aside, there is likely to be at least one more color. The black model. As it doesn't really look like a Como Blue or Rock Candy. There's no date listed along with the leaked pricing image, but that might not be too far off. </p>
<p> Google could very well unveil these officially at an upcoming event when it unveils the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G. Which is suspected to be this Fall. </p>

<p> Android News / Android TV, Google TV & YouTube TV: Google's TV Strategy Sound A Lot Like Its Messaging Products </p>
<p> Android TV, Google TV & YouTube TV: Google's TV Strategy Sound A Lot Like Its Messaging Products </p>
<p> Last week, Google announced the new Chromecast with Google TV. Leading up to the announcement, many of us thought that Google was rebranding Android TV (again) to Google TV. But nope. That's not the case. Google is doing the most Google thing ever, fragmenting its TV strategy. </p>
<p> Now we have Android TV, Google TV and YouTube TV. Now it's arguable that YouTube TV doesn't really fit in there, other than the fact that it has "TV" in its name. But there are three "TV" products now in Google's ecosystem. And it sounds like something else Google has been doing lately. That is messaging. </p>
<p> At one point, Google had nearly 10 different messaging services. It has started to thin some of those out, but there is still quite a few different messaging services available from Google. And now it's doing the same thing with TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> TV is the new messaging, for Google </p>
<p> Google has a habit of unveiling new products and if it doesn't do well after a couple of years, killing it off. We've seen this with countless products like Google+, Hangouts, and others. Which is why Google has so many messaging services. There's Google Chat, Voice, Messages, as well as Hangouts, for now. </p>
<p> Now when it comes to TV, we're seeing the same thing. Google has two distinct products, but using three different names. YouTube TV should exist as it does, as it is a live streaming TV service, and under the "YouTube" name makes loads of sense, of course. But when it comes to Android TV and Google TV, only one of those should exist. And it's the latter. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You see, Android TV is cool and all, but it doesn't ever get updated. My Hisense Android TV just got updated to Android 9 Pie just last week. Meanwhile my Pixel 4a is on Android 11. That's pretty bad, especially for an ecosystem that already is pretty bad with timely updates. What Google should do is remove the "Android" from it, and just call the OS Google TV. Like it did before 2014. </p>
<p> The reason for that is simple, we don't need a new version of TV software every year. Heck even with Android TV 11, we aren't getting very many features, it's mostly in the backend. So Google could do like it has done with Wear OS and remove the "Android" from the name. Then people aren't going to complain when their TV is on a much older version of Android then their phones. Because it's not on the same operating system. But that's a topic for another day. </p>
<p> Google TV makes much more sense, then Android TV does. Right now Google TV is just the launcher on top of Android TV, which seems really weird, to be honest. Let's hope Google does eventually phase out Android TV in favor of Google TV as a whole. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google is really good at confusing people </p>
<p> If there was an award for confusing its customers, Google could win it. Google is really good at confusing its customers. I keep drawing back comparisons to its messaging strategy, but it's true. When it comes to messaging, you have to ask yourself "which app do I use to message this person?" as Google has so many, and not all of your contacts are on each service. </p>
<p> And now when it comes to TV, do you want an Android TV or Chromecast with Google TV? Well technically, they are both running the same operating system under the hood, so it doesn't matter. But the average consumer isn't going to know that. They will see different home screens from the SHIELD TV and the new Chromecast and think they are two distinctly different operating systems. </p>
<p> Google needs to simplify its TV strategy, just like we've been saying about its messaging strategy for years. Google TV and Android TV should be the same, and Google needs to go back to Google TV. And drop the Android name altogether. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> TV is even fragmented on your smartphone </p>
<p> Yes, we're using the f word. Fragmentation. </p>
<p> With Google essentially killing off Google Play Movies & TV, and rebranding it as Google TV, you'd think it would be like a remote for your new Chromecast with Google TV, but it is not. And that's typical Google right there. Fragmenting its own service on different platforms (that it owns). </p>
<p> The Google TV app is basically a store for renting movies and shows. And they are not the only one to do this. Apple also does this with the Apple TV app and uses that branding in a few different ways. So Google isn't alone here, but that doesn't make it right. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If Google were smart, it would make the app as more than just a store. But a place where you can add things to your watchlist, control your Chromecast with Google TV, and do basically everything you can with Google TV on your Chromecast. But this is Google we're talking about here, nothing is ever that simple with Google. </p>
<p> Bottom line: Google needs to axe Android TV </p>
<p> Android TV has a pretty bad reputation and really needs to be killed off, in favor of something like Google TV. It sounds better, and sounds like it works with more than just Android devices – because it does. And as mentioned before, Google needs to also needs to kill off the "Android" part of TV, because of updates. TVs don't need a big update every year, like a smartphone would. And so dropping Android TV would be a much better idea than to have "outdated" TVs on its ecosystem. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Follow the lead of the Wear OS team, Android TV. </p>
<p> I don't hate Android TV, but it isn't the best thing in the world either. Particularly with TVs that have it built-in. That is primarily because they don't include the hardware needed to run Android TV smoothly. I have two Hisense Android TVs, and one (the older one of the two) runs it better than the other, but both are shockingly slow. Really the only Android TV device that can run the OS properly is the NVIDIA SHIELD TV and it's $150 – i.e. most people aren't going to be buying one. </p>
<p> So it needs a rebranding, and now with the launch of Google TV, it seems like the perfect time. But Google won't do it, it'll likely launch another TV service next year – maybe Chrome TV? </p>

<p> Android TV Levels Up With Slick New Highlights Feature </p>
<p> Google today announced that it was bringing a pretty slick new feature to Android TV called Highlights. </p>
<p> If you're familiar with the way things now look on Netflix and Hulu on the main home page after logging in, you should immediately be able to imagine what this feature is like. With Netflix, after logging in the main home page will play a cinematic highlight of featured content. </p>
<p> It gives the page some pizazz and really adds to the experience when streaming. It's like having a little trailer for the TV show or film you're about to watch. But without having to go and search for it or click a play button. Highlights on Android TV is going to be pretty similar </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Android TV Highlights feature adds cinematic playback trailers for content </p>
<p> With Android TV now getting this feature, it'll be a little easier (and faster) to find content that you may want to watch. </p>
<p> There is a difference though between the cinematic Highlights feature and the cinematic playback on services like Netflix or Hulu. Auto-play. On Netflix for example, the featured cinematic playback content is automatic. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It plays as soon as you hover over it. It also has a mute button for the audio if you wish to disable that. With Android TV, this isn't the case. Highlights are collections of content that are rolled up into a cinematic teaser. Google curates this content, and then serves it up to you on the homescren. </p>
<p> If you want to actually watch a trailer of stuff, you have to first scroll through the carousel of content and choose something. Then select that content to watch a quick teaser trailer for it. Like shown in the GIF above. </p>
<p> This makes it so that stuff isn't auto-playing the moment you hit the home screen. Which is helpful if you want to avoid potential spoilers. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can now more easily subscribe to apps through the Android TV interface </p>
<p> Say you wanted to check out HBO Max, Hulu, or Netflix for the first time using Android TV. </p>
<p> As part of the new changes Google is making, it's now easier to subscribe to those apps and services using the Android TV interface. Subscribing was possible before. But prior to now you'd have to use your phone or use the remote and navigate around the text entry for emails and other personal information. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> No longer. With Android TV there is now a subscribe and install button. This will install the app and Google will subscribe you to your chosen service using your email. It says it will handle the rest. So the process is much more seamless. </p>
<p> As of now this is only being piloted though. And only in the US at the moment. On top of that there are just a few apps involved with the pilot test, which includes Starz, DC Universe, and EPIX NOW. Google does mention though that more services will be added soon. </p>

<p> Android TV Now Apparently Supports 4K HDR For Stadia </p>
<p> Stadia on Android TV has yet to reach an official launch, but you can access it, and now it reportedly supports 4K HDR for the games that offer it. </p>
<p> 9To5Google points out that it's possible to set this all up. The feature was first spotted by YouTube channel 'Cloud Gaming Xtreme.' The feature is part of a new update to the app on Android TV devices. </p>
<p> And even though the app hasn't been officially released for the platform, Google is still continuing to add Android TV functionality to the app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> 4K HDR Stadia support may only be available on some Android TV devices </p>
<p> Before you go trying to set this up yourself, it's important to note that not every Android TV device is likely to support this new feature. </p>
<p> While support hasn't been confirmed officially by Google, 4K HDR also hasn't been tested on every single Android TV device out there. It's said to work on the NVIDIA SHIELD as well as the JBL Link Bar. </p>
<p> And it'll probably also work for any Android TV device that actually supports 4K resolution. If you have a device that fits into that category it's rather easy to enable it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All of this is of course done in the Stadia application on your Android TV. And will be located in the same place as it would if you were changing the resolution for other devices. Like your phone or Chromecast Ultra. </p>
<p> Enable the two features from the performance section </p>
<p> Whether or not you've already got Stadia loaded onto your Android TV, enabling these two graphical settings is pretty straightforward. </p>
<p> Simply open up the Stadia app on your Android TV device and then open the settings menu. From there scroll and find the performance section. Once there you should see two new options there. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One for getting resolution in games at up to 4K, and a toggle for HDR. Select 4K and flip the toggle and you're good to go. Now games that support both of these will show up with a higher resolution and better, more vibrant colors. </p>
<p> Quite honestly, it's a bit curious that Google would enable these features before officially releasing Stadia onto the Android TV platform. Even if you can sideload the app and use it. </p>
<p> Either way, if you have an Android TV device, you can now forego using the Chromecast Ultra without having to give up the better resolution for games. </p>

<p> ASUS Rolling Out Android 11 Update To Zenfone 7 Pro Beta Testers </p>
<p> ASUS is now rolling out the Android 11 beta update to recruited Zenfone 7 Pro beta testers. The rollout is happening exactly a month after releasing the beta build to the Zenfone 6. The Android 11-based Zen UI beta update comes with the build number 30.04.31.30 and is 1.1GB in size. </p>
<p> Last month, the company started recruiting beta testers with the Zenfone 7 Pro smartphone for the Android 11 update. However, ASUS hasn't yet revealed the timeline for the stable update. As seen with other OEM's, ASUS will also likely prioritize its latest flagship smartphones for the Android 11 public release. </p>
<p> Android 11 closed beta update now available for the ASUS Zenfone 7 Pro </p>
<p> Going by the changelog, the company is bringing in a lot of changes to the in-house Zen UI. Additionally, the company is offering optional Android 11 features like the notification conversations and quick controls in the power button menu. The power button will no longer show the option to take a screenshot. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Users can long-press the power button to quickly access the smart home shortcuts and Google Pay. ASUS is also revamping the majority of stock apps, including Mobile Manager, Contacts, Phone, File Manager, Calculator, Clock, Gallery, and Settings. </p>
<p> It will also show the updated media controls introduced with Android 11. The company is also bringing the bubble notifications and notification history. When turning on airplane mode in Android 11, the device will no longer disable the Bluetooth connection. </p>
<p> Android 11 brings improved privacy controls </p>
<p> All Android 11-powered smartphones will also provide better privacy controls like one-time permissions and auto-reset permissions. Users can manually add the newly launched nearby share to the quick settings on the notifications panel. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Like any other beta build, there will be some known issues with this Android 11-based Zen UI update. Hence, it is not recommended to try out on the primary smartphone. For the stable release, the Zenfone 7 should also accompany the Zenfone 7 Pro. </p>
<p> Compared to the standard Zenfone 7, the Pro moniker sports the Plus variant of the Snapdragon 865 SoC and offers OIS for both primary and telephoto cameras. Apart from these changes, both the 2020 flagship smartphones from ASUS offer the exact same specifications. </p>
<p> Google and Samsung have already announced that they will provide three years of guaranteed software support for their smartphones. On the other hand, ASUS is only promising two major OS updates even for its flagship smartphones. Since the newly launched Zenfone 7 series comes with last year's Android 10 out of the box, Android 12 releasing next year will be its last major OS update. </p>

<p> ASUS Chromebook Flip C436 Pricing & Pre-Orders Are Here </p>
<p> ASUS launched its Chromebook Flip C436 at CES 2020 earlier this month and now the device is up for pre-order on Amazon. That's according to recent reports stemming from readers over at Chrome Unboxed. The listings fill in quite a few details but, more importantly, outline the overall cost of the gadgets. That's in addition to when they'll become available. </p>
<p> There are two variants available, as of this writing, leaving the top model distinctly absent. The 'entry' level model starts at $799. That places it, as its specs do, clearly in the upper-midrange for a Chromebook. Another model, priced at $999, is also listed. </p>
<p> Both devices shown at Amazon are available for pre-order starting from today. They're listed as being set to ship on February 24 in both cases. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ASUS Chromebook Flip C436 made a bleeding-edge splash at CES </p>
<p> Of particular interest here are the specs for the less-pricey models of the Chromebook Flip C436 that are now up for pre-order. At the gadget's CES announcement, ASUS only outlined the specifications for the top model. </p>
<p> Each device ships with a Full HD 1920 x 1080 display panel in a 14-inch NanoEdge display frame. Each ship with an Intel UHD Graphics chip on that side of the equation, as well as Dual-band Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) and Bluetooth 5.0 on the connectivity side of things. </p>
<p> The external shell is comprised of a backlit full-size keyboard, jammed into a 2.4 lbs magnesium alloy metal chassis with a 13-inch diagonal measurement. That's also right around 13.7mm thin. Universal stylus support with up to 4,096 pressure-level sensitivity is also universal across the range. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But this device is supposed to be available with up to the same specs as the second most expensive variant now on sale. The chief difference is that it's supposed to ship with up to a 10th-Gen Intel Core i7-10510U processor. Neither of the new devices features that. </p>
<p> Instead, the more expensive of the newer devices ships with a 10th-Gen Intel Core i5-10210U processor. ASUS packed 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 512GB of NVMe storage behind that. That's the same specs found in the most expensive variant, although some reports indicate it will feature a 4K display panel. The biggest difference will likely be that device utilizing a 10th-Gen Intel Core i7-10510U processor. </p>
<p> The less-pricey entry model of the two ASUS Chromebook Flip C436 now up for sale on pre-order features half the RAM, 128GB NVMe storage, and an Intel Core i3-10110U inside. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Each model will, of course, ship with Chrome OS as the operating system. </p>
<p> This comes in two colors too </p>
<p> Now, ASUS also announced that there would be two colors made available for its Chromebook Flip C436 at launch. That appears to hold true here but each pre-order gadget is only available in one of the two colors. The cheaper Intel Core i3 model is being shipped in a Transparent Silver coloration. </p>
<p> The more expensive $999 model on Amazon comes in a fancier color, which will likely be used for the top model when that releases. Namely, that's a white hue the company has taken to calling Aerogel White. The color is ceramic-like and nearly iridescent — shimmering at the edges with a spectrum of colors in the images shown at the listing. </p>

<p> ASUS Confirms ROG Phone III Through Unity Partnership </p>
<p> ASUS hasn't officially announced the ROG Phone III yet, but it has now confirmed its existence through the announcement of Unity partnership. </p>
<p> According to a new report from GSMArena, citing an ASUS press release, the famous gaming brand has named Unity as a verified solutions partner. </p>
<p> In this announcement, ASUS mentions that it will be creating a special plugin for the Unity Engine. As well as the fact that the ROG Phone III will support a handful of special features through that plugin. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Beyond that, ASUS doesn't appear to have mentioned what the plugin will do for Unity or what features would be supported on its phones. So perhaps it will share more on that at a later date. </p>
<p> The Unity plugin will support features on the ROG II in addition to the ROG Phone III </p>
<p> In addition to supporting the ROG Phone III, ASUS also reportedly mentioned that the plugin it creates will support features on the ROG Phone II as well. </p>
<p> There will be five features specifically. When the plugin for the Unity Engine is finalized and pushed out to devices, it's not immediately clear if those supported features will be something that users can adjust. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If they are, owners of the ROG Phone II (and eventually the ROG Phone III) could see those features inside of the Armory Crate. This is the app ASUS has created and placed on its ROG gaming phones. Where uses can adjust things like the RGB lighting, toggling the fan on and off for the attachment and more. </p>
<p> It's also possible that the features the plugin supports will simply be passive and users won't be able to change anything on their own. Rather, they might simply be features that improve the experience in some games which use the Unity engine. </p>
<p> A Summer release could have been delayed </p>
<p> Recent rumors have suggested that ASUS might launch the ROG Phone III sometime in the third quarter. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That would be sometime this Summer, between July and October. While ASUS could still certainly meet that release goal, with everything going on it's also entirely possible that a launch could have been delayed. </p>
<p> Since ASUS hasn't made any formal statements about the device, such an announcement and unveiling, it's tough to tell. But a release could be in the near future provided the company is able to stay on target. </p>
<p> As it gets closer to a potential release date, ASUS will probably share more details. And maybe even formally announce the phone. </p>

<p> ASUS Finally Ships $499 ZenFone 6 Flagship In The U.S. </p>
<p> ASUS is finally ready to unleash its ZenFone 6 flagship killer in the U.S., following months of false starts. According to recent reports, the phones vary in price to match variances in specifications and can be found on the official ASUS website. Each will ship with the same processor, cameras, and other internals intact. </p>
<p> The primary differences are going to come down to memory and storage. Starting at $499, users can pick up the handset with 64GB of storage and 6GB RAM. For $50 more, buyers can double the space for apps, media, and other files. Finally, at $599.99, ASUS is selling the ZenFone 6 with 8GB of RAM coupled with 256GB of onboard storage. </p>
<p> The only option for coloration is ASUS's high-shine Midnight Black. For the time being, Twilight Silver is sold out. Conversely, another special edition device was available — called Edition 30 and packing 12GB RAM with 512GB storage — for a more traditional cost of $899.99. But that's already been sold out too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ZenFone 6 brings exceptional value to the U.S. </p>
<p> Due mostly to its incredible pricing, it's difficult to refer to the ASUS ZenFone 6 as a flagship. But that doesn't mean it isn't one. Launched near the beginning of the year, the first noteworthy point is that this phone is powered by a Qualcomm-built Snapdragon 855 SoC. That's the same powerhouse found in phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S10 or Galaxy Note 10 series. </p>
<p> The battery powering that is a 5,000mAh capacity unit capable of charging at 18W for rapid refills and supporting 10W reverse charging via OTG cable. </p>
<p> But setting aside Zen UI-topped Android 9 Pie out-of-the-box and a near-certain update to Android 10, the cameras are the showstopper for this ASUS. There are only two cameras in use here and no traditional selfie camera. On the back panel, above the fingerprint scanner in a horizontal configuration, ASUS includes a 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 sensor. That’s coupled with a 13-megapixel ultrawide sensor. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ASUS set the cameras on a flipping mechanism. When activated, that rolls forward to act as a selfie-snapper, giving users one of the best such options around. That leaves almost the entire front available for a 6.4-inch fullHD+ display panel. It also leaves plenty of edge space, helping ASUS leave a 3.5mm audio jack in place alongside stereo speakers. </p>
<p> Why the long wait? </p>
<p> No reasoning has been given yet for the wait between the ASUS ZenFone 6 being announced and its arrival in the U.S. Between today and then, the phone has been teased for the region almost since inception. </p>
<p> That started with a contest that suggested it would become available in July. Following off from that, pre-orders opened in August online at B&H Photo. Puzzlingly, those pre-orders are still open at that site but there's still no ship date listed. The same holds true for Amazon, which lists the phone as unavailable but it should be arriving soon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's no indication as to when the phones will begin shipping from either of those sites but ASUS is reportedly shipping phones immediately. So users at GSM carriers in the U.S. can finally pick up the flagship-level device for a much better price than they'd get for similar specs and capabilities in other smartphones. </p>

<p> ASUS Is Working On Four New Budget Smartphones </p>
<p> ASUS looks like it might have four new budget smartphones in the works. A tweet from a tipster has leaked some details about the four new devices. This leak indicates some of the specifications and chipsets for the devices, as reported by GSM Arena. </p>
<p> The last few weeks have been busy for ASUS with the launch of the ZenFone 7 series. The company has had to work on its marketing campaign for the device which will come with the world’s first triple flip camera. More details have also become clearer about the device over recent weeks including its detailed specifications. </p>
<p> Unlike the ZenFone 7, these four new smartphones look to be a move back towards more budget devices by ASUS. Since the departure of CEO Jerry Shen in 2018, the company has shifted away from this market slightly. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It has instead focused on its flagships and gaming ROG lineup. ASUS has worked on cheaper models in this time such as the ZenFone Live (L2) but none of its offerings has been as successful as The ZenFone Max Pro (M2) which was the companies major budget hit. However, that may all be about to change with these new devices. </p>
<p> ASUS shifts focus back on to budget smartphones </p>
<p> All of these new devices come with specific codenames which roughly indicate their respective chipsets. The codenames are “Lito”, “Lagoon”, “Bengal”, and “Scuba”. </p>
<p> The "Lito" is likely to use the Snapdragon 765/765G. Whilst the "Lagoon" probably refers to the Snapdragon 690. These two are both modern mid-range parts. They also both included 5G modems on the chipset itself. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The “Bengal” and “Scuba” are a little bit harder to work out, however. “Bengal” is most likely associated with either the Snapdragon 662 or the Snapdragon 460. However, that assumption is much less certain than the ones previously mentioned. </p>
<p> The "Scuba" may well be part of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 family of chips. Again, this is by no means certain hence the lack of detail in this assumption. These two devices appear to be more budget than the other two if these chipset assumptions prove to be correct. </p>
<p> This is, unfortunately, all the information available on these four new devices. Rumors suggest the name of these devices may be the ASUS Max (M3) family. However, this is only based on speculative assumptions and may prove to be false. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is the first thing we have learnt about these devices so there are many gaps to fill in and things we do not know. We will have to keep our ears to the ground the find out any more relevant information on these devices as it comes out. </p>

<p> ASUS Lays Out Chromebook Flip C436 With Bleeding Edge Internals </p>
<p> ASUS is back at CES 2020 with a new entry into its Chromebook Flip series, the ASUS Chromebook Flip C436. As with other recent devices in the series, the Flip C436 is built around a raised-back clamshell design that folds completely into a tablet as needed. It's also among the first of ASUS's Chromebooks to feature universal stylus support with up to 4,096 pressure-level sensitivity. </p>
<p> The overall aesthetic of the ASUS Chromebook Flip C436 is going to be familiar for any fans of the series. The company has held to its nano-edge display design for the 14-inch touch-enabled Chromebook. It's also kept most of the design cues and slimmed things back on the build. </p>
<p> This laptop weighs in at just 2.4 lbs despite its magnesium alloy metal chassis and 13-inch diagonal measurement. It's also right around 13.7mm thin, making for a sleek and striking aesthetic and allowing for a better in-hand feel. That translates over to usability too, thanks to the full-size backlit keyboard with 1.2mm of key travel. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The speakers here are Harmon Kardon-certified and all the ports a user could want are present and accounted for. </p>
<p> One key difference in the design this time around is in the colors available. ASUS is offering its Chromebook Flip in two hues — an iridescent Aerogel White or a stately transparent silver. </p>
<p> What's on the inside is what counts with ASUS Chromebook Flip C436 </p>
<p> The only internal component that doesn't align well with the 'bleeding edge' mantra comes in the form of this device's RAM. There, ASUS opted to utilize the older LPDDR3 variety. But the company is offering a staggering amount for a Chromebook. Buyers can pick up either an 8GB or 16GB variant. That's coupled with up to 512GB of M.2 SSD storage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Making use of that memory and storage, ASUS includes up to an Intel Core i7-10510U processor. That means that this Chrome OS convertible will get the work done and it will keep on doing so for up to 12-hours according to ASUS. That figure is backed by the company's participation with this device in Intel's Project Athena. So the numbers should be fairly accurate for most users' day-to-day activities. </p>
<p> Tucked underneath all of that and taking advantage of the cloud nature of Chromebooks is another top-notch component aimed at making connectivity future-proof. Not only does the ASUS Chromebook Flip C436 pack in Bluetooth 5.0. It also delivers dual-band Wi-Fi 6 802.11ax. So this Chromebook will see faster speeds, reduced latency, and better use of bandwidth as long as users have access to a Wi-Fi 6-compatible router. </p>
<p> Specs that go beyond the demands of day-to-day Chrome OS use </p>
<p> Specs aren't everything when it comes to a Chromebook. But they can be a big help for those who really need to get serious work done. Here are all of the specs for the ASUS Chromebook Flip C436 as laid out by the company. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Screen size </p>
<p> 14-inch four-sided NanoEdge display with only 4.9mm slim bezel and 85% screen-to-body ratio </p>
<p> Chrome OS </p>
<p> Colors </p>
<p> Aerogel White, Transparent Silver </p>
<p> Length: 12.58 in (319.54 mm) Width: 8.08 in (205.3 mm) Height: 0.54 in (13.76 mm)319.54 x 205.3 x 13.76 mm </p>
<p> Weight </p>
<p> Full HD: 2.3lbs (1061g) 4K 2.4lbs (1090g) </p>
<p> Pricing and availability </p>
<p> After its initial announcement at CES 2020, ASUS expects the Chromebook Flip C436 to become available in its two different hues as early as late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of the year. That puts its launch at right around March, give or take a month or two. </p>
<p> Pricing details have not been provided just yet and are likely being finalized for each variant of the device ASUS has planned. </p>

<p> ASUS Premium Chromebook Flip C436 Is Reportedly Ready To Buy </p>
<p> Chromebook fans can now pick up ASUS premium-grade Chromebook Flip C436 for just $799. That's based on recent reports citing the appearance of the 2-in-1 Chrome OS laptop at the official ASUS store and Amazon. </p>
<p> The variant showcased at the ASUS store is not the most powerful version of this particular Chromebook. Posted specifically as model C436FA in the US, this variant ships with a generation 10 Intel Core i5 processor backed by 16GB RAM. That features 512GB of PCIe SSD storage, allowing plenty of space for movies, pictures, Linux software, apps, and games. </p>
<p> Comparatively, the ASUS Chromebook Flip C436 is still expected to arrive with up to a 10th-Gen Intel Core i7-10510U processor. On the budget end, it is expected to ship with an Intel Core i3-10110U, 4GB RAM, and 128GB NVMe storage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The present model then sits squarely in the middle in terms of specifications. </p>
<p> What makes this ASUS Chromebook a premium device? </p>
<p> Regardless of which model is purchased, the latest member of the ASUS "Flip" family is a genuine premium gadget. The company built the device on an almost identical platform, outwardly, to its extremely popular Chromebook Flip C434. </p>
<p> That means it delivers a 14-inch FHD NanoEdge display packed into a magnesium alloy shell measuring 13.7mm thin. That's attached via an ErgoLift Hinge for more ergonomic typing, as well as use in a tent, tablet, stand, or clamshell configuration. The device tips the scales at just 2.2lbs. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But ASUS also packed in a fingerprint sensor and a backlit keyboard standard. That's on top of some of the latest technology the Chrome OS market has to offer. For instance, Bluetooth 5.0 and Wi-Fi 6 support are built-in, right out-of-the-box. </p>
<p> Topping off the list of brand new features, this Chromebook also brings Universal stylus support. That means that any USI-certified stylus should work with any model of this particular Chromebook. So artists and productivity-focused buyers can take advantage of up to 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity with the Chromebook Flip C436. </p>
<p> For ports, the Chromebook Flip C436 features two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm audio combo jack, and a microSD card slot. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Where can you buy ASUS Chromebook Flip C436? </p>
<p> Now, widespread sources have reported that the ASUS Chromebook Flip C436 is available to buy right now. The device is reportedly available via both Amazon and the ASUS digital storefront with a starting price of just $799. For colorations, buyers are offered either “transparent silver” or an iridescent “aerogel white.” But the laptop has apparently since been removed from both sites. </p>
<p> The implication here is that ASUS simply wasn't quite ready for launch yet when the pages went live. Its appearance at multiple online stores does imply that it is close, however. That's compounded with the fact that the official ASUS landing site for the Chromebook Flip C436 is also still live. The page comes complete with a somewhat blank "Where to buy" page. </p>
<p> Other models have reportedly been spotted too and that follows on a pre-sale that got its start back in late January. So buyers should, by all accounts, be able to pick up the gadget sooner than later. </p>

<p> Android News / ASUS ROG Phone 3 Coming In July With Powerful Specs & Large Battery </p>
<p> ASUS ROG Phone 3 Coming In July With Powerful Specs & Large Battery </p>
<p> The ASUS ROG Phone 3 will become official in July, the company has officially confirmed. This confirmation comes via ASUS’ official Weibo page. This timing makes sense, as the ROG Phone 2 launched in July 2019. </p>
<p> The ASUS ROG Phone 3 is coming in July, same as Lenovo’s Legion handset </p>
<p> ASUS has yet to confirm the official date of the ROG Phone 3’s arrival, though. This is not the only gaming phone that will launch in July, though. The ASUS ROG Phone 3 will see some competition from Lenovo’s Legion gaming handset, which is also coming in July. </p>
<p> Much like ASUS, though, Lenovo did not confirm the launch date either. The ASUS ROG Phone 3 will launch with gaming optimizations from Tencent in China. That is where it will see its initial launch, it seems. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone will be quite powerful, and that was to be expected as this is a gaming handset. It will be catered towards gamers, much like its predecessors were. </p>
<p> The ASUS ROG Phone 3 got certified by TENAA (China’s equivalent to the FCC) already. That happened quite recently, by the way. That certification revealed the phone’s design. </p>
<p> The ASUS ROG Phone 3 won’t be a huge step away from the ROG Phone 2’s design, it seems. The phone will still be made out of metal and glass, and ship with a curved back. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It will feature a flat display, without notches or holes </p>
<p> It will have some bezel above and below the display, while its display will remain flat. Display holes and notches will not be included, which is not surprising, as once again, this is a gaming device. </p>
<p> The phone is expected to feature a 6.59-inch fullHD+ (2340 x 1080) AMOLED display. That display will probably offer a 144Hz refresh rate, and ship with an under-display fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Android 10 will come pre-installed on the device, along with ASUS’ ROG UI. The phone will come in three RAM variants with three storage options, according to TENAA. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It will be offered in 8GB, 12GB, and 16GB RAM flavors with 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB of storage, respectively. The Snapdragon 865+ will fuel the phone, which also signalizes that chip will probably launch soon as well. </p>
<p> A 5,800mAh battery will also be a part of the package. That battery will not be removable, but it will support fast charging. The device will probably offer 30W fast wired charging. </p>
<p> Now, in terms of cameras, we don’t have the whole picture just yet. A 64-megapixel camera is expected to lead the pack on the back, while a 13-megapixel camera will be included on the front. The device will have several camera sensors on the back, though. </p>

<p> ASUS Announces US Price For The ROG Phone 3 </p>
<p> ASUS announced the ROG Phone 3 earlier this year but it was never officially launched in the US, and there was no US price point announced. </p>
<p> While you could simply convert the price of the ROG Phone 3 from other regions into USD, this wouldn't be an exact amount. Today though ASUS has laid out how much the device will cost. And surprise, it isn't cheap. </p>
<p> The ROG Phone 3 is ASUS' third-gen gaming phone. It comes with a Snapdragon 865+ mobile platform, up to 16GB of RAM, 512GB of internal storage, and a 144Hz display. Not to mention it supports 5G and Wi-Fi 6. So it was always expected to be a little bit pricey. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The ROG Phone 3 will start at $999 in the US </p>
<p> In the US ASUS has two versions of the phone that you can pick up. </p>
<p> The price of the ROG Phone 3 starts at $999 and this is for the 12GB RAM model. This also comes with 512GB of storage, a 6.59-inch FHD+ display, a 6,000mAh-capacity battery, and dual nano SIM slots. </p>
<p> If you want the 16GB RAM model then the price jumps up to $1,099. This is a bit more than the costs of the ROG Phone II. Though not too far off and really, considering the bump up in specs, ASUS could have potentially charged more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is of course not even considering the prices of any of the next-gen accessories that ASUS launched alongside the phones. And there are more than a couple of them. </p>
<p> The ROG Kunai Gamepad 3 for instance is $149.99. Meanwhile the ASUS ROG Clip is $39.99, the Lighting Armor Case is $59.99. ASUS has also officially announced the prices for the TwinView Dock 3, Antibacterial Screen Protector, Professional Dock, and Mobile Desktop Dock. </p>
<p> Which are $329.99, $36.99, $89.99, $ and $229.99 respectively. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can't technically buy it yet </p>
<p> ASUS says that the phone is already available for sale in the US starting today. But you can't technically buy it yet. </p>
<p> The listings are live however from both Amazon and B&H Photo for the 16GB model, you just can't put them in your cart at the moment. You will be able to purchase it sooner rather than later. ASUS is also selling the phone on its own US store. Though the listings for it are not yet live there at the time of writing. </p>
<p> None of the accessories seem to be available right now either. That being said, it probably won't be too long before both the phones and the accessories are in the hands of US consumers. </p>

<p> ASUS ROG Phone III Accessory Surfaces Following EEC Certification </p>
<p> The ROG Phone III has reportedly received certification with the EEC, a Eurasian regulatory body. This is according to a report from MySmartPrice. </p>
<p> Worth mentioning though is that the certification does not actually refer to the phone as the ROG Phone III. Instead it's labeled as the ZS661KS. The reason it's believed to be the ROG Phone III is because this is nearly identical to the ROG Phone II model number. </p>
<p> ASUS' current gaming phone. That model number is ZS660KL. So there are only two letters that have been changed. Which leads to the speculation that this is the upcoming gaming smartphone from the company. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Manufacturers also tend to keep the model numbers of subsequent phones close to previous models. So it would certainly make sense here for this to be the ROG Phone III. </p>
<p> Another ROG Phone III certification likely means ASUS is close to a reveal </p>
<p> It's already been rumored that ASUS was looking to launch the ROG Phone III in the third quarter of 2020. </p>
<p> But now with the certification a reveal may be closer than we think. For comparison, the Lenovo Legion Phone just received a certification in early June. And as of today Lenovo seems to have confirmed that the phone will be announced officially in July with the reveal being a part of that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That doesn't necessarily mean that ASUS will do the same thing. But it could be an indicator to keep your eyes open. No doubt ASUS will let people know when it has an event to announce something big. But the certifications definitely help in pointing to possible time frames. </p>
<p> An accessory for the ZS661KS has also surfaced online </p>
<p> The certification isn't the only piece of evidence suggesting that ASUS' new gaming phone is on the way soon. </p>
<p> On a European website called Accessories ASUS, a USB cable is now available for purchase that says it's for the ASUS ROG Phone ZS661KS. The same model number suspected to be the upcoming ROG Phone III. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, this probably isn't an official OEM cable straight from ASUS. It might be, but it's just as likely that it's an aftermarket cable. The important thing is that it's for the model number that is likely the ROG Phone III. And if there are already accessories being sold for it, then the phone itself can't be far off from an announcement and a launch. </p>
<p> Take this with a grain of salt of course, because this isn't confirmed by ASUS. But again, it may suggest that ASUS is getting close to its announcement. </p>

<p> ASUS ROG Phone III Certification Claims There's A 16GB RAM Model </p>
<p> The ASUS ROG Phone III has gone through certification at Chinese regulatory body TENAA, and the certification claims there's a model with up to 16GB of RAM. </p>
<p> There are also ROG Phone III models listed with 8GB and 12GB of RAM. Which would match up with the amounts of memory on the ROG Phone II. ASUS' current gaming phone model. </p>
<p> In addition to the memory, various other specs are listed for the upcoming device, including internal storage space and the Android version that the phone is likely to be shipped with. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A ROG Phone III with 16GB of RAM is likely to be pretty expensive </p>
<p> 16GB is a lot for RAM on a phone. Probably more so than anyone needs. Even with how advanced smartphone gaming has become. </p>
<p> A ROG Phone III with this much memory would also be very expensive. The 12GB RAM model of the ROG Phone II was close to $1,000. And there's no doubt that bumping that up to 16GB would also probably mean having the higher amount of storage space. </p>
<p> According to the certification there will be options for 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. If these specs are accurate, consumers shouldn't expect the ROG Phone III to be any less than $900. Of course, a true picture of the price tag won't be clear until ASUS officially announces the phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At which point it may also reveal the launch date and cost of all available models. Then again it may not. Choosing to hold off pricing until a later date. </p>
<p> The first potential look at the final design </p>
<p> TENAA certifications are generally good for more than just specifications. While they do usually list some of these details, they also tend to have images of the device. </p>
<p> This is true with the ROG Phone III as well. The images below show off what might be the first visual of what the final design of the ROG Phone III is like. Judging by the pictures, ASUS doesn't appear to have changed the overall design too much. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone still carries a glossy back, and features the iconic ROG logo directly in the center. This is likely to house the LED lights that can be found on the ROG Phone II. One big difference is there now seems to be three camera sensors instead of two, making the rear camera array larger. </p>
<p> The camera array also now protrudes a little bit here. Whereas it was entirely flat and flush with the back of the phone on the ROG Phone II. Additional specs rumored to be on the device include the Snapdragon 865 Plus, 5G support, a 6.59-inch display, dual front-facing speakers, and a 6,000mAh-capacity battery. </p>

<p> ASUS ROG Phone III Meets Another Launch Requirement Goal </p>
<p> The ROG Phone III has met its latest goal on the road to an official release, which is slated to happen sometime this Summer. </p>
<p> Speculation is that ASUS will be launching the ROG Phone III in July, but like any other phone it has to meet every goal or requirement that's needed before it can be deemed ready for mass production. In this case that pertains to more certifications. </p>
<p> Bluetooth certification for the ROG Phone III is one the final pieces of the puzzle </p>
<p> Now that Bluetooth certification for the device is out of the way, there isn't much left that ASUS needs to do before the launch. </p>
<p> Something to keep in mind is that ASUS may not actually release the phone in July. Rather it could simply announce the ROG Phone III officially. With a launch happening later on in the Summer. </p>
<p> Then again, ASUS could announce the phone in early July. Then follow it up with availability for purchase by the end of the month. All in all, if rumors are accurate the ROG Phone III will be in the hands of users before too long. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Just like with the Pixel 4a, there's not really a lot left to the imagination with ASUS's upcoming device. Most of the specs have already leaked, and what is seemingly the final design has leaked recently as well. </p>
<p> ASUS has already confirmed the device </p>
<p> Even though ASUS hasn't formally announced the new phone it has officially confirmed/acknowledged its existence. </p>
<p> Earlier this year, specifically back on June 3 it announced a partnership with Unity. That partnership would include working on things for more than just the ROG Phone III. However it did specifically name the ROG Phone III too. Thus finally putting it out in the open that it was indeed coming to market. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As this was not a formal ROG Phone III announcement, there was little else to go on. Other than that the phone was in development and probably close to being finalized. The ROG Phone III should be using the Snapdragon 865 mobile platform, but some rumors have suggested that it will be using the "Plus" version of this platform specifically. </p>
<p> Which would make sense as the ROG Phone II used the Plus version of the Snapdragon 855. Which has more gaming-focused features. More details about the phone are likely to pop up in the weeks ahead. </p>

<p> ASUS Is Likely Close To Officially Unveiling The ROG Phone III </p>
<p> ASUS is suspected to hold the unveiling event for the ROG Phone III sometime this Summer. Which could be anytime between July and September. As it's been rumored to release the phone in Q3 of this year. </p>
<p> Following a recently leaked image though, it appears that ASUS may be closer than we think to unveiling the ROG Phone III and making it available to consumers. </p>
<p> On June 18, a user on the Chinese micro blogging site Weibo shared an image of the device. And this one is a hands-on shot of what looks like a finished product. It also matches the design of the phone that was shown in images from the TENAA certification earlier this week. So this does seem to be the final design. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The ASUS ROG Phone III is probably just around the corner </p>
<p> Information about the ROG Phone III has been trickling out for months now. And the closer it gets to an announcement, the more the information seems to be accurate. </p>
<p> The latest leak which includes the image below, also talks more about the specs of the phone. Some of which are exactly what were listed in the TENAA certification. The point is that details are starting to match up more and more. </p>
<p> And with the image below appearing to be a production model phone, this might suggest that ASUS is more or less ready to show off the device in an official capacity. All that's left to really do at this point is wait. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One thing worth pointing out is the "Tencent Games" logo towards the bottom of the phone. A logo like that may not necessarily be on a global model of the device. Or even a regional model. But it could be a special edition model of the phone that is offered in China which has some sort of partnership with Tencent. </p>
<p> If that were the case, then anyone buying a potential model like that could end up with in-game rewards for some of Tencent's biggest games. Like PUBG Mobile, Call of Duty: Mobile and more. Of course this is only speculation. And the logo may never be there at all for any production models regardless of the region. </p>
<p> The ROG Phone III may have a 144Hz display </p>
<p> Though no specifications are official yet, some have leaked out along with this hands-on image. According to the leak the ROG Phone III will carry a 6.59-inch display which could either come with a 120Hz or 144Hz refresh rate. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The display is also rumored to be an FHD+ symmetrical OLED panel, come with a 6,000mAh-capacity battery, a 64-megapixel rear camera, 30-W fast charge support, and up to 16GB of RAM. </p>
<p> Some of these specs have been rumored before. So again a few details are starting to match up. That being said, consumers should still take things with a grain of salt as none of this is officially from ASUS. </p>

<p> ASUS Rolls Out The Android 10 Update For The ZenFone 6 </p>
<p> ASUS has begun rolling out the Android 10 update for its ZenFone 6 flagship smartphone. According to Redditors, the handset is now getting the latest iteration of Android OS in the US, Canada, and India, where it is called ASUS 6Z owing to a court ruling. The update, which carries build number 17.1810.1910.63, weighs in at around 810MB. </p>
<p> This update should bundle all the improvements and features that are part and parcel of Android 10. You can expect things like system-wide dark mode, Smart Reply functionalities, improved privacy controls, improved digital wellbeing, and various security enhancements with this update. The accompanying changelog, however, only mentions support for gesture navigation and Google Play system update, which presumably is Project Mainline. </p>
<p> Android 10 update for the ASUS ZenFone 6 also brings the ZenUI 6 on board. However, the Taiwanese smartphone maker has rightly refrained from making too many UI changes in this update. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ASUS can do it on the software front too </p>
<p> ASUS released two killer phones this year – the ROG Phone II and the ZenFone 6. While the former had a target audience – mobile gamers – the ZenFone 6 was simply thrown at the crowded market of flagship Android smartphones. The rather eccentric smartphone still managed to carve a chunk for itself thanks to its impressive hardware components. ASUS is now showing its credibility on the software front too. </p>
<p> The company may not be the fastest to release an Android 10 update, but the likes of Samsung, Huawei, and LG are yet to push out a stable update for any of their devices. They are still only beta testing their updates. The ASUS ZenFone 6 joins a select group of devices from Google, Essential, OnePlus, Xiaomi and Nokia to be running a stable version of Android 10. </p>
<p> ASUS has also released the kernel source code for the Android 10 update for the ZenFone 6 (via XDA Developers). This is another impressive feat by the company. It does spark hope that the company will show the same level of commitment for future software updates as well. The ZenFone 5Z and the ROG Phone II should be the next two on the pipeline. ASUS should also be working on to quickly expand the Android 10 rollout for the ZenFone 6 globally. </p>

<p> Haven't yet received the Android 10 update on your ASUS ZenFone 6? Well, software updates are released in stages and may take some time before they reach every unit across the globe. You should get a notification once the update becomes available for you. If you're feeling too impatient to wait, you can download the full firmware from ASUS and flash it on your phone. </p>

<p> Leak In ASUS Routers' Software Leaves Smart Homes, Networks Exposed </p>
<p> Software for ASUS routers caused a data leak across potentially dozens of the devices, according to researchers at vpnMentor. More succinctly, the breach centered around the AsusWRT web app. ASUS fixed the problem quickly on its end. But, making matters worse, the leak has been around for some time. According to vpnMentor, other researchers had previously found the leak but did not report it to ASUS. </p>
<p> In effect, the team found that ASUS had incidentally left the database behind the web app unguarded by encryption or other protective measures. A relatively straightforward port scanning method revealed the existence of the leak. From there, researches accessed the database using a browser and URL search criteria manipulation. </p>
<p> The researchers, led by vpnMentor's Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, haven't provided exact details regarding the number of affected users. But the problem appears to be global and every user of the management software is at risk. The full impact of leaks isn't always completely realized immediately either. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What makes this leak so bad? </p>
<p> The data that the leak centers on isn't necessarily going to be personally identifiable. Researchers say they were able to take advantage of the breach to find users' IP Address, name, device name, use information, longitude, latitude, country, and city. That data can be used and linked to other easily discoverable information, however. </p>
<p> Perhaps more worrisome, when routers utilize AsusWRT, the web app effectively becomes a central node to not just access network devices. It stores and manages, and controls those too. The leak also potentially handed out IFTT commands and other smart home device commands. </p>
<p> In effect, that prepares a number of potential attack vectors for malicious entities. For example, a malicious entity might use location-based data alongside Alexa or other smart home commands. In particular, that information could be used to plan and execute physical attacks against a residence or business. The researchers point to theft and robbery as a high-level risk from the leak. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The smart home command data could potentially pave the way for cyberthreats all on its own. Specifically, the researchers point to email, financial apps, and direct control over smart devices as a serious risk. That's especially pertinent with consideration for just how much data those devices can hold and the aspects of a home they can control. </p>
<p> All of that is in addition to the traditional attacks enabled by a breach. Bad actors could potentially use the data to launch further cyberattacks, commit identity fraud, or compromise personal accounts. </p>
<p> To stop the leak, disconnect from the ASUS network app completely </p>
<p> ASUS's response to reports about the issue was swift but that doesn't mean the problem is necessarily solved. VpnMentor told ASUS about the leak in its routers on September 15, the same day it discovered. The company responded to that and reportedly fixed it on the same day as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Regardless of that swift response, vpnMentor goes on to say this was easily preventable and that a patch won't necessarily protect everybody. In fact, the researchers claim that AsusWRT still isn't safe to use. Because of that, the team is cautioning users to disconnect everything from their networks. Then, they'll need to uninstall the web app and user an alternative — only reconnecting devices after AsusWRT is gone. </p>
<p> The software will be safe to use again once a full patch has been released, changing the exposed database and bolstering security. </p>
<p> Users should also contact ASUS directly with concerns about the breach. </p>

<p> ASUS Sets Another Bar In Gaming Smartphones With The ROG Phone 3 </p>
<p> Earlier this morning ASUS took the wraps off of its newest entry in the ROG Phone series, the ROG Phone 3, and it's really set the bar high this time for gaming smartphones. </p>
<p> Building on the success the ROG Phone II had with mobile gamers, ASUS has packed its new device with the latest features and hardware. </p>
<p> It also revealed a few surprises that were designed to enhance the mobile gaming experience even more. With new accessories that are designed to help enhance each gaming experience. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The ASUS ROG Phone 3 is packed with power and comes with all-new accessories </p>
<p> Keeping with its reputation as the premiere mobile gaming smartphone, the latest version of the ROG Phone comes with the latest version of Qualcomm's mobile platform, the Snapdragon 865 Plus 5G. </p>
<p> This puts it on par with the Lenovo Legion Duel. Lenovo's first gaming smartphone that was announced this morning as well. It also puts the ROG Phone 3 in a unique position of being the better phone. Not necessarily from a hardware standpoint because both phones seem powerful. </p>
<p> Rather, more from a feature standpoint. Because the ROG Phone 3 is not only a gaming powerhouse for mobile games, but ASUS is using it for the continued partnership with Google and Stadia. Making it more equipped to deliver a variety of gaming experiences on the go. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Alongside the new phone, ASUS is also releasing a new version of every accessory it launched with last year's ROG Phone II. This includes the Kunai 3 Gamepad, the TwinView 3 Dock, the Game Clip, and even a new external monitor with the Strix XG16. </p>
<p> It's also releasing new versions of the Lightning Armor cases. As well as a 65-percent wireless gaming keyboard called the Falchion that can be used with the phone. </p>
<p> Specs to secure your spot in the rankings </p>
<p> Mobile gaming these days has been taken to another level with games like Call of Duty: Mobile and PUBG Mobile. But to outperform your competitors in the rankings you'll want a high-powered device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The ROG Phone 3 delivers on that with its list of top-tier hardware specs. The device comes with three RAM and storage configurations. The most high-end model has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. </p>
<p> It'll also cost the most. There will also be a 12GB RAM model with 256GB of storage, and an 8GB model with 256GB of storage. The phone will have a 6.59-inch AMOLED display with HDR color calibration. It bumped up the refresh rate too, jumping from 120Hz to a 144Hz. </p>
<p> As for cameras, ASUS is using a triple camera array on the back this time. This carries a 64-megapixel main sensor along with a 13-megapixel ultrawide sensor, and a new 5-megapixel macro sensor. The front camera meanwhile uses a 24-megapixel sensor. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To keep things cool the device comes with ASUS' updated vapor chamber cooling technology, Game Cool 3, and it's kept the 6,000mAh-capacity battery that the ROG Phone II had. So expect long battery life on a single charge and plenty of hours of gaming. </p>
<p> Though the AirTriggers are also making a return, ASUS says it's improved them by adding additional functionality. This time around you have swipe gestures on each AirTrigger and it's possible to split each one up to act as two buttons just like you get with your standard game controllers. </p>
<p> In short, this will be one very powerful smartphone. ASUS is releasing the ROG Phone 3 in the US in September of this year. No pricing has been mentioned yet for the US. But it will likely cost at least $899 for the least expensive model. </p>

<p> ASUS Starts Android 10 Rollout For ROG Phone II </p>
<p> Android 10 is now officially rolling out for the ASUS ROG Phone 2. That's according to the company's gaming division ROG Global, which posted about the rollout on Twitter. </p>
<p> Details about the firmware update from ASUS are slim. But a screenshot shared by one responding Twitter user does highlight a few changes. First and foremost the changelog runs through some housekeeping, informing users to backup their system and that the update will address both Android itself and security patches. </p>
<p> The changes listed include the removal of Go2Pay and image library tagging functions. It also points to the addition of more Aura system lighting options. Quick Settings have been adjusted with advanced options for automatic brightness adjustments and game profile changes have been made in ASUS's Armoury Crate game center. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Details are slim but here are some Android 10 goodies that should be included </p>
<p> ASUS may be keeping mum about updates included in Android 10 for the ROG Phone 2. There are a few features and additions that should be included by default as part of that Android update. Two of the biggest changes are alterations to navigation, via gestures, and dark mode. </p>
<p> The new gesture-based navigation may or may not make its way over on ROG Phone 2. But, if it does, it will mean primarily that users have a new action that they can perform to navigate "backward" in the system UI. Swiping from the left or right edge will now perform the same action as a back button click or tap. Swiping from the bottom, conversely, will return to the home screen. </p>
<p> Slowing down the swipe up and holding on the screen loads up the recent apps. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Dark mode, on the other hand, will almost certainly make its way over as it's one of the most sought after features in Android. As its name implies, turning on Dark mode in settings — also referred to as Night mode by some OEMs — turns the system UI dark. That reduces eye-strain in some environments but also for those who have medical conditions impacted by bright screens with light colors. </p>
<p> The theming also applies to most applications that have a dark theme automatically when it's turned on at the system level in Android 10. So users won't need to individually turn on dark mode for many of their apps. </p>
<p> Check for your ASUS ROG Phone 2 Android 10 update now </p>
<p> The update for ASUS's ROG Phone 2 is going to be a slow rollout since this is a globally available device. And the company didn't provide any details regarding which regions might see the firmware first. In the interim, checking manually for Android 10, which will arrive as an OTA, is fairly straightforward. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To look for the update, users need to open up the Settings application and then scroll down to the "About" section. Under that, the option for "System update" should be presented. That doesn't guarantee earlier arrival of the firmware but in some cases can speed things along. ASUS typically uploads its firmware to the official ASUS website too. But that doesn't appear to be available for Android 10 for ROG Phone 2 as of this writing. </p>
<p> There may also be at least a few hiccups with this rollout, still unconfirmed by ASUS. Several comments responding to the announcement indicate that the notification to update arrived but that the firmware update itself was missing. </p>

<p> ASUS To Launch ZenFone 7 & ROG Phone III Very Soon </p>
<p> It's the end of May and we are yet to see the launch of a new ASUS smartphone this year. The ROG Phone II from July 2019 is the last smartphone to be launched by the company. According to a new report, ASUS will launch the new ZenFone 7 and ROG Phone III at the end of the second quarter or early third quarter of this year. </p>
<p> Compared to its predecessor, the company is expecting at least 30% or 50% growth with the upcoming ROG Phone III. With the ROG Phone lineup, ASUS has been a dominant player in the mobile gaming market. As of now, the company hasn't revealed any details about either of these smartphones. Both the ZenFone 7 & ROG Phone III can be expected to launch in the next couple of months. </p>
<p> ZenFone 7 & ROG Phone III Launching Very Soon </p>
<p> In February this year, Qualcomm confirmed that the ZenFone 7 and ROG Phone III will be launched with the flagship Snapdragon 865 Mobile Platform. The ZenFone 7 will be the successor to ZenFone 6 (aka ASUS 6Z) which came with a unique flip camera. Meanwhile, the ROG Phone III will replace last year's ROG Phone II. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The ROG Phone III with the model number 'I003DD' has recently been listed on Geekbench and Wi-Fi Alliance. The Geekbench listing confirmed the device to pack Snapdragon 865 SoC along with 8GB of RAM. It is also mentioned to be running on Android 10. Unlike the ZenFones, the ROG Phones will have ROG UI with several gamer-centric features for an enhanced gaming experience. </p>
<p> To feature Snapdragon 865 Mobile Platform? </p>
<p> As per the Geekbench 5.1.1 benchmark, the device has scored 902 points in the single-core and 3,074 points in the multi-core tests. The second-gen ROG Phone came featuring a 120Hz OLED display with 240Hz touch sampling rate and 10-bit HDR support. It offers up to 12GB of LPDDR4x RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 3.0 flash storage. </p>
<p> Along with the power-hungry hardware, the device came packed with a huge 6000mAh battery. Speaking of the ZenFone 6, it offered a true bezel-less experience with no notch or cut-out. The company used a motorized flip camera featuring a 48MP primary sensor and a 13MP secondary sensor. The dual camera setup can also be used for capturing selfie or video calls. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ASUS might skip using the flip camera setup for the upcoming ZenFone 7 smartphone. As seen with the ZenFone 6, the company might launch the ZenFone 7 as ASUS 7Z in India due to a trademark issue. </p>

<p> ASUS Will Unveil The ROG Phone 3 At The End Of This Month </p>
<p> ASUS has been teasing the ROG Phone 3 for months now and today it officially confirmed it will unveil the device soon. </p>
<p> Over at the official ASUS website, there's now a landing page for the ROG Phone 3 that the company is using to tease when exactly it will unveil the phone. It's nearly 21 days from now at the time of writing. </p>
<p> And although there isn't much detail about the device, or any images for that matter, there is a countdown timer. As well as the ability to sign up for notifications about the reveal should you want them. Alerts will go out 15 minutes before the event starts. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ASUS will unveil the ROG Phone 3 on July 22 </p>
<p> If you've been looking forward to the next gaming phone from ASUS you still have to wait a little bit longer. </p>
<p> The countdown timer on the official landing page shows that the unveiling will be nearly 21 days from now. July 22 will be the official date, with the exact timing being 8AM PST/11AM EST. That will be a Wednesday morning, so it'll be something to look forward to as you head into the middle of the week. </p>
<p> Technically, nothing on the page refers to the third ROG Phone in ASUS's official imagery. However, the name of the device is listed not only in the address bar, but also in a small box next to your mouse cursor if you hover over the main section of the page. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ASUS isn't trying to hide that the phone is coming. Nor is it hiding what this event is for. Unlike Samsung who is generally a little more cryptic with the announcements for its Galaxy S and Note series phones. </p>
<p> In addition to the device label, the landing page also says New Game Starts From Here, and Game Changer, so the message is pretty clear. </p>
<p> The phone will be a game changer </p>
<p> Yeah, yeah. Every company thinks this about its own products. But in ASUS's case, it's more likely to be true and the ROG Phone 3 probably will be a game changer. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The ROG Phone II was one of the best gaming phones of its time when it launched. If not the best. We absolutely loved it. There's nothing to suggest that ASUS won't deliver on this front again. The phone will be powered by a next-gen Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile platform. </p>
<p> The landing page doesn't say which one, but it's been rumored to be the Snapdragon 865 or the Snapdragon 865+. It's also likely to come with at least 12GB of RAM (one rumor has suggested there could be a 16GB model), at least a 120Hz display, and carry a battery capacity of 6,000mAh. Which is what the ROG Phone II has. </p>
<p> Long story short, the phone will be a beast and ASUS will potentially prove that it can deliver the pinnacle of mobile gaming hardware. Again. </p>

<p> ASUS Zenfone 6 Finally Gets The First-Ever Android 11 Beta Update </p>
<p> Last month, ASUS started recruiting beta testers with the Zenfone 6 smartphone for its upcoming Android 11 update. A week after Google released Android 11, the company has now started rolling out its first-ever beta update based on Android 11 to all the eligible users. </p>
<p> The Android 11-based Zen UI beta update comes with the build number 18.0610.2009.37 and is 1.36GB in size. Compared to other major Android OEMs, ASUS has been a little too late in rolling out the Android 11 beta update. </p>
<p> ASUS starts rolling out Android 11-based ZenUI update for Zenfone 6 </p>
<p> While the beta update is finally here, the company is yet to reveal the update timeline for its smartphones. However, it will likely prioritize the flagship Zenfone 6 and Zenfone 7 series over other smartphones. Along with all the Android 11 features, ASUS is also introducing the all-new ZenUI design. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The stock launcher will lack the options for smart groups, icon alignment, and icon pack functions. It also removed the Private Listening and ZenUI Help features. Moreover, the company has integrated its own PowerMaster features into the battery settings menu for a more clutter-free experience. </p>
<p> Additionally, it skipped using the Avast Scanning engine. Asus also mentioned that some third-party apps might not function as intended on devices running on the beta version of Android 11. Hence, it's not recommended to use these beta builds on primary smartphones. </p>
<p> Navigation gestures now work with third-party launchers </p>
<p> Speaking of new features, the ZenUI will now support bubble notifications for messaging apps. With the notification history enabled, the Zenfone users can view all of the dismissed notifications from the last 24 hours. Finally, the third-party launchers on ZenUI are getting support for navigation gestures. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Since this is the first Android 11 beta update from ASUS, the public update might not come anytime soon. Even the current beta update is only limited to last year's Zenfone 6. Due to trademark violations, this same device was launched in India as the ASUS 6Z. </p>
<p> As of now, there is no mention of the Android 11 beta program for the new Zenfone 7 series. Just last month, the company unveiled the Zenfone 7 and Zenfone 7 Pro smartphones in Taiwan. The devices come with Android 10-based ZenUI 7 out of the box. </p>
<p> While the Zenfone 7 packs in a Snapdragon 865 5G mobile platform, the Pro moniker sports the Plus-variant of the same chipset. These new smartphones also come with the flip camera mechanism featuring a triple camera setup. On the front, ASUS replaced the LCD display with an AMOLED panel, which also has a 90Hz refresh rate. </p>

<p> ASUS Zenfone 7 and 7 Pro To Feature Nokia OZO Audio Processing </p>
<p> Nokia has revealed that the ASUS ZenFone 7 Series works with Nokia's OZO Audio technology. As claimed in a company post, this should elevate "the audio capturing result to the new heights". </p>
<p> GSM Arena reports that the devices come with three microphones to capture sound and advanced features in the camera app. The devices, therefore, have a number of features to optimise audio capturing which Nokia has outlined. </p>
<p> We thought we knew everything there is to know about the ZenFone 7 series. A recent marketing video gave us an in-depth look at the device. Almost all the specifications had also been revealed by this point. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Therefore, this audio reveal is interesting given its timing post the release of these devices. It is a slightly strange time to be finding out something potentially quite important. </p>
<p> ZenFone 7 series to come with Nokia audio processing </p>
<p> The press release noted that the ZenFone 7 series uses Audio 3D, Audio Focus, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen to optimise users sound experience. </p>
<p> Audio 3D enables users to capture natural, spatial sound recordings in a certain direction. Audio Focus works to suppress distracting noises from crowded areas. This works to focus just on the important sound you wish to capture. This, therefore, makes it perfect for capturing audio in any space. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Audio Zoom links to the visual zoom of the ZenFone 7 series' camera. This allows users to amplify and identify sounds to correspond to the zoomed video. Finally, Audio Windscreen reduces wind distortion. The idea is to bring clarity of sound in any weather conditions. </p>
<p> Jyri Huopaniemi, Head of Technology Licensing, Nokia Technologies has commented on the move in glowing terms. He said, “We’re really excited to continue our collaboration with ASUS". He also pointed out that this technology will enhance "user experience in recording, and providing a sharper, true-to-life audio perspective of the memories they capture using their ASUS devices". </p>
<p> Bryan Chang, general manager, smartphone business unit at ASUS also made a statement on the news. He noted that "users really value audio quality, so we were pleased to work with Nokia to integrate their OZO Audio technology into the new ZenFone 7 Series". He then went onto extol the virtues of this new technology for ASUS customers. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Overall, this looks like an exciting partnership between Nokia and the ASUS ZenFone 7 series to augment its audio capturing capabilities. These features, on the whole, sound innovative and useful to users if a little bit complex. However, this should improve as people become accustomed to them. </p>

<p> ASUS Zenfone 7 Picks Up More Certifications In The Build Up To Launch </p>
<p> ASUS is expected to announce a new flagship smartphone, supposedly called the Zenfone 7, this year. While there's no official word about it yet, the rumored ASUS Zenfone 7 has started taking shape. </p>
<p> A new ASUS smartphone with identification number(ID) ASUS_I002D has recently picked up a couple of certifications, suggesting of a nearing launch. The device received wireless certification from Taiwan’s National Communications Commission (NCC) as well as the safety standard certification from TUV Rheinland. </p>
<p> The two listings reveal quite a lot about the upcoming ASUS smartphone. While neither of the listings explicitly mention the device's name, it gets high-end specs that suggest of a flagship phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additionally, the ID number ASUS_I002D also indicates the same. To recall, the ASUS Rog Phone III has the ID number ASUS_I003D. </p>
<p> ASUS Zenfone 7 specifications revealed by NCC and TUV Rheinland certifications </p>
<p> As per the NCC and TUV Rheinland certification listings, the ASUS Zenfone 7 will come with 512GB of internal storage capacity. Storage can be further expanded up to 2TB via microSD, a feature that's hard to find in newer flagship phones. </p>
<p> It will be a 5G-capable phone and will offer Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth v5.0, and NFC connectivity features, of course. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The device packs a 5,000 mAh battery with 30W fast wired charging support via a USB Type-C port. Additionally, the model number ZS670KS suggests that one of the ASUS Zenfone 7 models could be sporting a huge 6.7-inch display. </p>
<p> Along with the standard Zenfone 7, a 'Pro' model is also reportedly in the works. Hopefully, ASUS will fit the new phones with an AMOLED display and not an LCD panel as it did last year with the Zenfone 6. </p>
<p> A Geekbench listing last month that the ZenFone 7 will include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC and will have up to 16GB of RAM. The ZenFone 7 Pro, on the other hand, may get the recently launched Snapdragon 865+ chipset. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both models should come in multiple memory configurations and run Android 10 out of the box. ASUS is reportedly looking to offer the phones in black and white colors. </p>
<p> The Zenfone 7 series will likely keep the flip camera module of its predecessor but pack more lenses. We might also be getting more powerful sensors with the new ASUS flagship. The Zenfone 6 came last year featuring a 48-megapixel primary camera and a 13-megapixel wide-angle sensor. </p>
<p> ASUS is expected to reveal some details about the Zenfone 7 and Zenfone 7 Pro during the ROG Phone III launch next week. The new gaming smartphone from the Taiwanese company launches on Wednesday, July 22. </p>

<p> Android News / Flip Camera Making A Comeback With The ASUS ZenFone 7; Details Leak </p>
<p> Flip Camera Making A Comeback With The ASUS ZenFone 7; Details Leak </p>
<p> The flip camera will be a part of the ASUS ZenFone 7, it seems. According to a new piece of information that surfaced online, the ASUS ZenFone 7 will feature a triple flip camera setup. </p>
<p> Some information regarding those cameras did surface, along with some additional info. The info surfaced on the reameizu website, and was shared via Twitter. </p>
<p> The flip camera module on the ASUS ZenFone 7 will host three cameras </p>
<p> If this info is to be believed, the ASUS ZenFone 7 will feature a 64-megapixel main camera, it will utilize Sony’s IMX686 sensor. In addition to that, ASUS will include a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera (Sony’s IMX363 sensor), and a ToF unit. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Those cameras will serve as both the phone’s rear and front-facing units. Those cameras will be rear-facing until you switch to a selfie camera in the camera app, at which point they’ll rotate. </p>
<p> The source also mentions that the phone will be fueled by the Snapdragon 865 Plus SoC. That is Qualcomm’s most powerful processor at the moment, and it offers 5G support. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 7 will also include a fingerprint scanner, but it won’t be an under-display one, it seems. The source claims that Goodix’s fingerprint scanner will be rear-mounted. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The device may not feature an OLED display </p>
<p> What is disappointing, though, is the fact that the phone may include an LCD panel. The source claims that a 6.4-inch fullHD+ LCD panel by BOE will be used. This will be a 60Hz display, by the way. </p>
<p> Considering this will be ASUS’ flagship, basically, we’d expect an OLED panel. It is worth noting that the phone is set to be quite affordable, but still, an OLED panel is kind of expected in this day and age. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 6 managed to be quite popular last year, as it was different, affordable, and all-around a good phone. That LCD panel on it was probably the most negative thing people noticed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Well, the ASUS ZenFone 7 was expected to fix that with an OLED panel, but that may not happen. We do hope that this information is not accurate, but we’ll see. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 pricing is rumored to start at €499. That is the rumored price tag for a 6GB RAM variant of the device. An 8GB RAM model will also launch, it seems, and start at €549. </p>
<p> No matter whether the phone ends up sporting an OLED display or not, this price tag is quite appealing. The device is expected to launch on August 26, in exactly one week. </p>

<p> Android News / ASUS ZenFone 7 Plans To Compete With The Best; Powerful Specs Surface </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 7 Plans To Compete With The Best; Powerful Specs Surface </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 will pack in a powerful set of specs. ASUS confirmed yesterday that the device will become official on August 26. Well, the phone now surfaced on Geekbench, revealing some of its specs. </p>
<p> The phone appeared on Geekbench with the ‘ASUS_I002D’ model number. The listing doesn’t mention the ZenFone 7 specifically, but this is almost certainly ASUS’ upcoming smartphone. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 will offer powerful specs, as expected </p>
<p> The company doesn’t really release that many phones a year, and it all fits. In any case, Geekbench claims that the phone will include the Snapdragon 865 Plus SoC. That is the most powerful processor Qualcomm has to offer. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In addition to the Snapdragon 865 Plus, the device will also sport 8GB of RAM. It is possible that more than one variant of the phone will become available, though. So, it’s possible we’ll see a 12GB RAM model as well. </p>
<p> We’re still not sure how many ZenFone 7 devices will ASUS announce. Last year, only the ZenFone 6 arrived, but in previous years, ASUS tended to release several completely different models. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 managed to score 966 points in the single-core benchmark on Geekbench. In the multi-core test, it managed to rack up 3,282 points. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone was also spotted at two additional certifications recently, NCC and TUV Rheinland, Those certifications confirmed that the phone will ship with Wi-Fi 6 support, Bluetooth 5.0, and that it will have a large battery. </p>
<p> A 5,000mAh battery will also be a part of the package </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 will include a 5,000mAh battery, it seems. We still do not know how large will its display be, though. An OLED panel will almost certainly be a part of the package, which was not the case on the ZenFone 6. </p>
<p> It’ll be interesting to see if this phone will offer a rotating camera setup like its predecessor. The ZenFone 6 had a rather interesting, motorized camera setup which acted as both the phone’s front and rear camera setup. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That camera module did work really well, and it was even able to take landscape shots on its own. It also allowed ASUS to trim down the bezels without including a pop-up camera, notch, or a display camera hole. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 design still did not surface, so we’re not sure what to expect. It’s possible that its design will appear in the coming days, though. The closer the launch date, the bigger the chance we’ll see the device ahead of time. </p>

<p> ASUS Zenfone 7 Spotted On Geekbench With SD865 & 16GB RAM </p>
<p> Along with the ROG Phone III, ASUS could also be working on a new flagship smartphone under its ZenFone series. A mysterious ASUS phone has appeared on the benchmarking platform Geekbench, revealing a few details. </p>
<p> According to the Geekbench listing, the new 'asus ZF' will be powered by an octa-core Qualcomm processor operating at a base frequency of 1.80GHz. The chipset is codenamed 'kona,' so it is none other than the Snapdragon 865. </p>
<p> The listing also mentions a whopping 16GB of RAM, so this phone should be capable of delivering a massive performance. The device scored 973 in the single-core test of Geekbench v5. In the multi-core test, it scored 3346. This ASUS smartphone will run Android 10 out of the box. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It will likely arrive as the ASUS ZenFone 7 </p>
<p> ASUS announced the ZenFone 6 flagship in May last year. A year on, we are yet to hear about its successor. However, it now appears to be taking shape. The new 'asus ZF' that recently popped up on Geekbench should be none other than the ASUS ZenFone 7. </p>
<p> Back in February, Qualcomm had released a press note that revealed that the ASUS ZenFone 7 will be powered by the Snapdragon 865 SoC. </p>
<p> The note also revealed that the new ASUS flagship will feature Qualcomm FastConnect 6800 mobile connectivity subsystem. This technology "redefines Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth audio," the chipmaker says. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ASUS itself has yet to share any details about the ZenFone 7. The ZenFone 6 arrived last year with a flipping dual-camera module on the back. The motorized camera module could flip up and double as the selfie cameras as well. It remains to be seen if its successor will have any such standout feature. </p>
<p> Although the ASUS ZenFOne 7 is listed with 16GB of RAM on Geekbench, it should come in multiple variants with lesser amounts of RAM as well. </p>
<p> Reports are that both the Rog Phone III and the ZenFone 7 will arrive at the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter this year. These two handsets will be the first 5G-equipped phones from the Taiwanese company. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's unclear if the two phones will launch together, though. The upcoming gaming phone from ASUS has already picked a couple of necessary certifications, suggesting an imminent launch. </p>
<p> To recall, the ZenFone 6 launched as ASUS 6z in India owing to a legal issue. The Taiwanese phone maker is banned from using the Zen, ZenFone, or any other identical branding in the country. </p>
<p> So the new ZenFone 7 will also likely arrive as the ASUS 7z in the world's largest second-smartphone market. </p>

<p> ASUS ZenFone 7 & 7 Pro Launch Globally With Tempting Price Tags </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 7 series initial launch was about a week ago in Taiwan, and now the phone’s launched globally. We also have European price tags for the two phones as well. </p>
<p> Before we get down to it, do note that the phones will not be going to the US, at least for the time being. ASUS did not mention anything about them being available in the US. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 6, a predecessor to these two handsets, did launch in the US last year. That gives us some hope that these two phones will make their way to the States eventually. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 & 7 Pro launch globally with appealing price tags </p>
<p> That being said, the vanilla ASUS ZenFone 7 is priced at €699 in Europe. The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro, on the other hand, comes with a price tag of €799. These two handsets are here to compete with the OnePlus 8, pretty much. </p>
<p> The regular ASUS ZenFone 7 comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The ‘Pro’ variant includes 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. There are no additional models available. </p>
<p> This is not the only difference between the two devices. Their SoC is different, and there are also some differences in the camera department. The ASUS ZenFone 7 comes with the regular Snapdragon 865, while the ‘Pro’ model includes the Snapdragon 865 Plus. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Only the ‘Pro’ model offers OIS on two of its cameras </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro also includes OIS for its main and telephoto lenses. The ZenFone 7, on the other hand, does not. So, if you want to get absolutely the best out of the cameras, you should consider getting the ‘Pro’ unit. </p>
<p> Other than the OIS difference, the camera setups are the same. These two phones are actually the same in every other way. They do look the same, plus the rest of their specs are identical. </p>
<p> Both devices are made out of metal and glass, and feature flat displays. A side-facing fingerprint scanner sits on both phones, while the flip camera module sits on the back of the two devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When you switch to the selfie camera mode within the camera app, that camera module will flip up, allowing you to use all three cameras as your selfie shooters. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro may end up being quite appealing phones mainly due to their price tag, interesting camera module, and no notches or display holes. </p>
<p> These two devices certainly have a lot to offer, and probably offer the best selfie cameras on the market. The two devices will probably reach more markets in the coming weeks / months. We’re just not sure if one of those markets will be the US. </p>

<p> ASUS ZenFone 7 Hands-On Video Shows The Flip Camera In Action </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 hands-on video has just surfaced, and it reveals a lot. In this video, you’ll not only see the whole design of the phone, but also its flip camera in action. On top of that, various different parts of the phone’s software can be seen on the screen. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 hands-on video reveals the phone's entire design, pretty much </p>
<p> This hands-on video surfaced on YouTube, and it has a duration of around 5 and a half minutes. This video gives us a first look at the phone’s front side, actually. </p>
<p> The phone’s back surfaced in real-life images yesterday, but not its front. Well, You can now see that the phone will feature thin bezels, and no display camera hole or notch. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That’s because that flip camera is included here. You can clearly see that there are three cameras included on it, along with an LED flash. The flip camera itself works similarly to the one on the ASUS ZenFone 6. </p>
<p> It is motorized, and it usually sits on the back of the phone. Once you activate the selfie camera, it will flip to the front. Those are not the only two positions for it, though. You’ll be able to use it in various different angles thanks to the camera app. </p>
<p> This flip camera will also be able to capture a landscape shot by stitching several images together, and it will capture those shots on its own, while you hold the phone steady. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The device has a side-facing fingerprint scanner </p>
<p> The phone seems to be made out of metal and glass, and you’ll notice that a fingerprint scanner is not located on the back. Its fingerprint scanner sits on the right, it’s a regular capacitive sensor. </p>
<p> The phone’s back is curved towards the sides, as you can see. The phone showed here is silver-colored, though ASUS will probably offer several different color options. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 7 is expected to come in two variants, a regular and ‘Pro’ models. Those two variants will be extremely similar, if rumors are to be believed. The ‘Pro’ model is said to offer more RAM (8GB compared to 6GB), and more storage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 865 will fuel the ZenFone 7, while the ‘Pro’ model will be equipped with the Snapdragon 865 or 865 Plus. Both devices will feature a 6.67-inch display, and it will probably be an LCD panel. </p>
<p> ASUS will utilize a 60Hz display on this handset, almost certainly. Android 10 will come pre-installed on the device, while 64, 12, and 8-megapixel cameras will be included. </p>
<p> You can also expect to get stereo speakers here, by the way. That’s all the information that we have at the moment. The phone is expected to launch tomorrow, so stay tuned. </p>

<p> Android News / ASUS ZenFone 7 & 7 Pro Launched With Flip Camera, Flagship SoCs & More </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 7 & 7 Pro Launched With Flip Camera, Flagship SoCs & More </p>
<p> ASUS has announced its new flagship smartphones, the ZenFone 7 and ZenFone 7 Pro. These are the two phones that were rumored to arrive today, and that’s exactly what happened. </p>
<p> The company announced the two phones during an event in Taiwan, its homeland. The ASUS ZenFone 7 devices continue the ZenFone 6’s legacy, and include a flip camera setup. </p>
<p> These two phones are actually quite similar, though there are some differences. The vanilla model comes with an inferior SoC, though only barely, and it also offers less RAM and storage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 & 7 Pro are quite similar, with several differences </p>
<p> The two phones do look the same, though, and share a lot of their specs. So, let’s first talk about the differences, and then we’ll list what they have in common. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 is fueled by the Snapdragon 865. The ‘Pro’ model, on the other hand, comes with the Snapdragon 865 Plus. The difference between these two SoCs is minimal, they’re both considered to be Qualcomm’s flagship offerings. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 7 comes with 6GB or 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and 128GB of UFS 3.1 flash storage. The ZenFone 7 Pro, on the flip side, includes 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. Both phones offer storage expansion, by the way, up to 2TB. It is also worth noting that they do differ in the camera department a bit, more on that later. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both of these smartphones feature the same display. You’ll find a 6.67-inch fullHD+ (2400 x 1080) AMOLED display on both phones. Both of those displays offer a 90Hz refresh rate, and both are flat. </p>
<p> A 5,000mAh battery can be found inside both devices, which is a good battery size for this display size and refresh rate. The phone also supports 30W ASUS HyperCharge fast charging, 27W Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0, and USB Power Deliver 3.0. Wireless charging is not included. </p>
<p> Both phones include a side-facing fingerprint scanner. That is your regular capacitive fingerprint scanner, which ASUS opted for over an in-display fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These two phones offer the exact same flip camera setup </p>
<p> You’ll find the same camera setup on both devices. Both phones come with a 64-megapixel main camera (4-in-1 pixel binning, Sony's IMX686 sensor, f/1.8 aperture, 0.8um pixel size, PDAF, EIS. OIS is included in Pro model only), backed by a 12-megapixel ultra-wide unit (Sony's IMX363 sesor, 113-degree FoV, f/2.2 aperture, Dual PDAF, 4cm macro photography), and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera (3x optical zoom, 12x total zoom, f/2.4 aperture. Pro variant has OIS). </p>
<p> Those three camera sensors serve as both the phone’s front and rear-facing cameras. They’ll naturally sit on the back, as rear-facing units. Once you switch to the selfie camera in the camera app, though, they’ll flip up, and become front-facing cameras. </p>
<p> Android 10 comes pre-installed on this smartphone, along with ASUS’ ZenUI 7. ASUS’ software is quite clean, it’s very close to stock Android, with some of the company’s additions. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These two devices measure 165.08 x 77.28 x 9.6mm. They each weight 230 grams, so they're not exactly one of the lightest phones around. The two phones have been announced in Aurora Black and Pastel White color options. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 is priced at the equivalent of $750 in Taiwan, while the ‘Pro’ model starts at $950. It remains to be seen what will their price tags be elsewhere, but they'll probably be more affordable outside of Taiwan. These two phones are expected to launch in a number of markets all over the world. </p>

<p> ASUS ZenFone 7 Will Be A Steal If The Rumored Price Is Accurate </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 is coming soon, and its price has just surfaced. In addition to the price tag, Roland Quandt, a well-known tipster, has also shared some spec information. </p>
<p> Mr. Quandt claims that the phone will be fueled by the Snapdragon 865 Plus SoC. That is Qualcomm’s most powerful processor at the moment, and the SoC mentioned on Geekbench quite recently. </p>
<p> He also says that one variant of the phone will include 8GB of RAM, which is also something that was mentioned in a Geekbench listing. The tipster says that 256GB of storage will be included in this model as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A 5,000mAh battery will be a part of the package as well, it seems. That variant of the device will cost €549, but it won’t be the only variant. It seems like ASUS is planning to release a 6GB RAM model as well. </p>
<p> The base model of the ASUS ZenFone 7 will be a steal at this price </p>
<p> That variant, with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, will set you back €499. That is also something that Mr. Quandt clarified in a reply to his original tweet. </p>
<p> So, as you can see, the ASUS ZenFone 7 may turn out to be a steal at that price tag. 6GB of RAM is still more than enough for most phones and users, and the Snapdragon 865 Plus will make sure everything is running fine. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Getting a flagship-grade phone for €499 these days is not easy, that’s for sure. ASUS still needs to deliver in other areas, though. We still don’t have the information on its display, and other parts of the device. </p>
<p> I hope that the company will utilize an OLED panel this time around. If I had to guess, I’d say that a fullHD+ OLED display will be included, and that it will be flat. It remains to be seen, though. </p>
<p> The company may utilize a rotating camera setup yet again </p>
<p> It also remains to be seen whether ASUS will utilize a rotating camera setup once again. The ASUS ZenFone 6, as most of you know, included a rotating camera setup, which served as both front and rear-facing camera setup. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If ASUS ends up utilizing something like that, the phone won’t have any display holes or notches. ASUS will, once again, be able to trim down those bezels, without taking away screen real estate. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 will become official on August 26. That is something ASUS confirmed already. The phone will get announced in Taiwan, ASUS’ homeland. This device will become available in a ton of other markets, though. </p>
</doc>
<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2020/07/asus-zenfone-7-pro-flip-cameras.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485000" filename="asus-zenfone-7-pro-flip-cameras.html">
<p> ASUS Will Use Flip Cameras For Its Zenfone 7 But Will Add More Lenses </p>
<p> ASUS' next-generation Zenfone 7 flagship series will continue the company's tradition of using mechanical flip cameras. But the company will also be packing in more lenses to improve the experience, according to recent reports. </p>
<p> ASUS has used flip cameras in the past, well before the Zenfone 7. In fact, that's been among the series' top features. The flip mechanism allows the flagship's primary snappers to also be used as the selfie snapper. </p>
<p> No new details have been provided with regard to exactly what sensors might be used but the dual-camera arrangement of the Zenfone 6 will reportedly be replaced. Or, at the very least, more sensors will be included. The ASUS Zenfone 6 utilized a 48-megapixel primary snapper and a 13-megapixel, 125-degree field of view wide-angle snapper. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So it's not outside reason to assume that the new camera array will also include a telephoto lens. Given the current trend in smartphones, ASUS may also include a dedicated depth sensor. That would take the total number of cameras to four from the standard two. </p>
<p> Finally, ASUS will undoubtedly bolster the main cameras with new sensors that deliver a higher megapixel-rating too. </p>
<p> Aside from rumors about cameras, what else is known about Zenfone 7? </p>
<p> Previous leaks about the ASUS Zenfone 7, looking past its cameras, have hinted at a gadget powered by the Snapdragon 865. That's based on a benchmark listing and statements made by Qualcomm. But the benchmark also showed that processor in this Android 10 handset as being backed by a massive 16GB RAM. Wi-Fi 6 support and the latest in Bluetooth connectivity are expected too, based on those same statements. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When is Zenfone 7 expected to hit shelves? </p>
<p> ASUS is presently expected to provide details about the latest Zenfone series just after it launches its next-gen gaming phone. That's the ASUS ROG Phone 3, expected to launch on July 22. But there is some extra detail available for the Zenfone series too. The ASUS Zenfone 7 is expected to launch in a standard edition and a "Pro" variant, just for starters. </p>
<p> It's also expected to ship in a black or white color variation. But it isn't immediately clear whether those will be standard colors or lean toward gradients, iridescence, or have other special overlays. </p>

<p> Android News / ASUS ZenFone 7 Promo Video Shows Off World's First Triple Flip Camera </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 7 Promo Video Shows Off World's First Triple Flip Camera </p>
<p> ASUS has published the very first ZenFone 7 promo video. In it, the company shows off the phone’s flip camera, along with several other features this device has to offer. </p>
<p> This video has been published on YouTube, and it has a duration of around a minute. The video is focused on both the ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro, which is not surprising considering they’re quite similar. </p>
<p> These two phones do come with slightly different SoC, different RAM and storage setups, and OIS is not included on the ZenFone 7. Other than that, the two phones are exactly the same, that even goes for their design. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The first thing this video focuses on is the design, and the display of the ZenFone 7 series. Both phones are made out of metal and glass, and both feature a 6.67-inch fullHD+ NanoEdge 90Hz display. That is an AMOLED display, by the way, and it’s flat. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 series offers the world’s first triple flip camera </p>
<p> Both phones even include an all-in-one smart key on the side, just to give you more options. Three cameras are included on the flip camera module here. That makes the ZenFone 7 a pioneer in that regard, as this is the world’s first triple flip camera setup. </p>
<p> A 12-megapixel unit on the phone is Sony’s IMX363 sensor, and that is an ultrawide camera. The second one is a 64-megapixel unit (Sony’s IMX686 sensor), and that is the phone’s main camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The third camera is a telephoto one, and it enables a 12x maximum zoom for the device. All three of those cameras can become front-facing cameras when needed. This phone features a motorized flip-up camera module. </p>
<p> This video will also let you know that the ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro is fueled by the Snapdragon 865 Plus. The ZenFone 7, on the other hand, comes with the Snapdragon 865. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A large battery is included in both smartphones </p>
<p> Both phones include a 5,000mAh battery, and they do support Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4.0. At the very end of the video, two color variants of the phone are shown. </p>
<p> Now, this promo video did share quite a bit of information when it comes to the ZenFone 7 series. It did not share everything, of course, so if you’d like to know more about these phones, click here. </p>
<p> We’ve also compiled a specifications-focused article yesterday, when the phone launched. So if you’re interested in checking out the spec sheets of these two handsets, follow this link. </p>

<p> ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro Teardown Offers Closer Look At Its Flip Camera </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 series launched recently, with a flip camera setup, similar to the ZenFone 7. Well, now a ZenFone 7 Pro teardown surfaced, offering us a closer look at that flip up camera. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro are the first two phones with a triple flip camera, in the world. This setup is quite different than the one on the ZenFone 6, even though it looks the same on the outside. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro teardown shows that a motor is built into the camera module itself </p>
<p> The teardown video, which is embedded below, reveals that. The ASUS ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro have a motor built into the camera module itself. The ZenFone 6, on the other hand, was located right next to the camera module. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone still features the stacked PCB design, though, just like the ZenFone 6. What does that mean? Well, there are two boards on top of each other. Both of them are cooled through thermal paste and copper. </p>
<p> Two heat pipes are also included, and they’re supposed to push the heat away from the chipset, and dump it into a copper block. That copper block is glued down to the back of the display. </p>
<p> Based on the provided video, the ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro is not exactly difficult to disassemble, at least by today’s standards. The adhesive does make things a bit more difficult in specific areas, though, while there are also a ton of cables on the inside. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The provided ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro teardown video has a duration of around 9 minutes. It is actually quite detailed, and the flip camera is not the only thing you’ll see here. </p>
<p> This video will show you pretty much every part of the device </p>
<p> You’ll get to see basically every part of the phone. This video can actually be quite useful if you need to repair your phone, or you need to get someone else to do it. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro are actually quite similar. They look the same from the outside, while their internals are a bit different. The ‘Pro’ model does include a newer SoC, More RAM, more storage, and OIS. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Other than that, however, they’re pretty much the same. A 5,000mAh battery is included in both phones, while both support 30W fast wired charging. Wireless charging is not a part of the picture. </p>
<p> Both phones feature a side-facing fingerprint scanner, and stereo speakers. Android 10 comes pre-installed on both, along with ASUS’ ZenUI 7. Both phones include a 6.67-inch fullHD+ AMOLED display, with 90Hz refresh rate. </p>
<p> These two phones are actually quite compelling, as they offer a lot in the spec and design departments, while they do not cost as much as other flagships. </p>

<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro actually looks the same as its sibling. The two phones do share a lot of their specs, but they’re different in the SoC, RAM, storage, and camera departments. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro is made out of metal and glass. The device comes with no display notches or holes, and its bezels are extremely thin. ASUS managed to do that thanks to the flip-up camera, which made a comeback. </p>
<p> That camera setup is far more advanced than the one on the ZenFone 6. You’ll find considerably newer camera sensors here, Those cameras serve as both the phone’s front and rear-facing cameras. </p>

<p> The phone is fueled by the Snapdragon 865 Plus, and it features a 90Hz display </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro is fueled by the Snapdragon 865 Plus SoC. The device packs in 8GB of RAM, and it features a 6.67-inch fullHD+ AMOLED display. This is a 90Hz panel, by the way. </p>
<p> A 5,000mAh battery is included here, and it supports 30W fast wired charging. Wireless charging is not included, though. The phone does support hi-res audio, and comes with two SIM card slots. </p>
<p> 64, 12, and 8-megapixel cameras are included on this handset. Android 10 comes pre-installed on the device, along with ZenUI 7. ZenUI 7 is quite close to stock Android, by the way. If you’d like to know more about the device, click here. </p>

<p> Real-Life Images Finally Reveal The ASUS ZenFone 7 Design </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 is expected to launch in two days, and its design has finally been revealed. A couple of real-life images have surfaced, showing us the design of the ASUS ZenFone 7. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, only the back side of the device is shown here. Luckily for us, that’s the most interesting part of this phone, due to its flip camera on the back. Speaking of which, some of the phone’s specs surfaced as well, along with a retail box. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 (partial) design has finally been revealed </p>
<p> Let’s talk about the design first. Two separate Twitter handles shared this design, the first one shared the phone’s image (its back side), its charger, and charging cable. On top of that, this user also shared the phone’s specs. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The second source offers yet another image of the phone’s back, along with its retail box. As you can see in the gallery below the article, the retail box will be quite minimalistic. </p>
<p> You can clearly see that the phone will be made out of metal and glass. Its back side is curved towards the left and right sides, and ASUS’ branding is included on the back, vertically. </p>
<p> You can clearly see that the flip camera is included, and that it contains three sensors there. That camera module does protrude on the back, just a little bit, though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When you switch to the front-facing camera in the camera app on this phone, the whole module will flip up, and allow you to use all three cameras as selfie shooters. </p>
<p> The device will not include a display camera hole or notch </p>
<p> That’s probably why this phone doesn’t have a display notch or a display hole on the front. The only question that remains is… how thick is the device’s bottom bezel. We’ll have to wait a bit longer to find out. </p>
<p> The source claims that the device will be fueled by the Snapdragon 865. Do note that the ‘Pro’ model is also rumored, and that device is said to include the Snapdragon 865 Plus SoC. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both devices will support 5G connectivity, in case you were wondering. The ASUS ZenFone 7 will feature a 6.67-inch fullHD+ display, according to the source. That will be an LCD display, if rumors are to be believed. </p>
<p> This phone will also include 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. Two SIM card slots have also been mentioned by the source. The last piece of spec info shared here has to do with the phone’s cameras. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 will feature 64, 12, and 8-megapixel cameras on the back. We’re presuming that those are its regular camera, ultrawide unit, and a telephoto camera, respectively. We cannot be sure, though. </p>

<p> ASUS ZenFone 7 Series Debuts Next Week </p>
<p> ASUS has officially announced when the ZenFone 7 series will debut. Which is next week. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 series is going to be announced on August 26 at 2PM in Taiwan. That's 6AM GMT and 2AM EST for those on the other side of the world. </p>
<p> With ASUS calling it the "ZenFone 7 series" we are expecting to see more than one device this time around. Last year, with the ZenFone 6, there was only a single smartphone, which was actually pretty impressive. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ZenFone 7 series has big shoes to fill </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6 was pretty popular for its price tag. It was almost like the new OnePlus smartphone, with a pretty low price tag, but high-end specs. </p>
<p> It sported the Snapdragon 855, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It also had a 6.4-inch FHD+ display. But what was really impressive was the back camera. Not necessarily the sensor, but the fact that the back camera flips up to act as the front-facing sensor. Which is pretty neat. </p>
<p> This was priced at $499, which is pretty impressive, even if it did only come with 64GB of storage on-board. Though there was a micro SD card slot available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What we're expecting from ZenFone 7 series </p>
<p> We haven't seen a whole lot of leaks about the ZenFone 7 series, other than the certifications it has already received. </p>
<p> But what we're expecting from the ZenFone 7 is a 5,000mAh capacity battery, like its predecessor. It will also likely use 18W charging. </p>
<p> It wouldn't be surprising to see it running a Snapdragon 865 chipset and it will support 5G networks. Since that's something you basically have to have in 2020. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With ASUS announcing it so early in the morning for the western hemisphere, you can draw the conclusion that it may not be coming to the US or even Europe. The ZenFone 6 did come to the US, but with very little fanfare. In fact, most people probably didn't know it was available in the US, but it was. </p>
<p> With smartphones pushing closer to that $1500 price point – like the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is $1299 now – it's going to be nice to see a really decent smartphone for nearly a third of that price. Though we don't expect to see it priced at $499 like its predecessor, since it is going to have 5G. And that is going to make the phone a lot more expensive, as we've seen with other smartphones released in 2020. Even OnePlus had to hike its prices pretty substantially this year. </p>

<p> ASUS ZenFone 7 Series Detailed Specifications </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 series flagships have been introduced earlier today, and we’re here to take a closer look at their specifications. These two phones are quite similar in the spec department, but there are a number of differences. </p>
<p> That being said, let’s check out everything they have in common first, shall we. Following that, we’ll focus on their differences, of course. Before we begin, however, do note that the two phones look exactly the same. They’re made out of metal and glass, with very minimal bezels. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 series offers powerful specifications </p>
<p> The display is exactly the same on these two phones. Both phones feature a 6.67-inch NanoEdge display. This is a fullHD+ (2400 x 1080) Super AMOLED display, provided by Samsung. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It offers a 20:9 display aspect ratio, and 100000:1 contrast ratio. This is also a high refresh rate display, it offers a 90Hz refresh rate. 200Hz touch sampling rate is also a part of the package, and it has a 1ms response time. </p>
<p> The display is flat, and it’s protected by the Gorilla Glass 6, from Corning. The display is also HDR10+ certified, and it features DC Dimming and HDR Tone Mapping. </p>
<p> Now, ASUS decided to use Gorilla Glass 3 on the back side of this phone, not Gorilla Glass 6. It is also worth noting that neither of these two phones offer IP certification for water and dust resistance. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both phones include a large battery, and fast wired charging </p>
<p> A 5,000mAh battery sits inside both of these phones. That battery is not removable, while it supports fast wired charging. It supports 30W ASUS HyperCharge, 27W Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0, and USB Power Delivery 3.0. Wireless charging is not supported. </p>
<p> A fingerprint scanner is included in the package, and it sits on the right-hand side of both phones. Software-based facial scanning feature is also enabled here. </p>
<p> A 3.5mm headphone jack is not included, while a Type-C USB port sits at the bottom of both phones. Three microphones are included, and boosted by ASUS’ noise reduction technology. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both phones also offer stereo sound. They include 5-magnet speakers with dual smart amplifiers (NXP TFA9874 smart amplifier). Both phones are also 5G-enabled, and offer dual SIM card support. </p>
<p> Android 10 comes pre-installed on both phones, with ASUS’ ZenUI 7 skin. The two phones measure 165.08 x 77.28 x 9.6mm, while they weight 230 grams. They do come in Aurora Black and Pastel White color options. ASUS also includes a transparent case in the box (silicone). </p>
<p> That’s basically all that they have in common, but there are some differences as well. The two phones are not fueled by the same SoC. They also come with different RAM and storage setups, plus there are some differences in the camera department. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> They do ship with different SoCs, different RAM & storage setups, and slightly different camera offerings </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 is fueled by the Snapdragon 865 SoC. The ‘Pro’ variant comes with the Snapdragon 865 Plus processor. The difference between those two SoCs is not big at all, though. </p>
<p> The vanilla ZenFone 7 comes in both 6GB and 8GB LPDDR5 RAM options. Each of those variants includes 128GB of UFS 3.1 flash storage. They also offer microSD storage expansion up to 2TB. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro, on the other hand, comes with 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. It also offers microSD card expansion up to 2TB. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The two phones offer the same triple camera setups, with two notable differences. The ZenFone 7 does not include OIS for its main or telephoto cameras, the ‘Pro’ model does. </p>
<p> You’ll find a 64-megapixel main camera (Sony’s IMX686 sensor 4-in-1 pixel binning, f/1.8 aperture, PDAF, EIS) on both phones. A 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera (f/2.2 aperture, Sony’s IMX363 sensor, 113-degree FoV, 4cm macro photography) is also included. The last camera on these two phones is an 8-megapixel unit (3x optical zoom, 12x total zoom, f/2.4 aperture). </p>

<p> Both ASUS ZenFone 7 & ZenFone 7 Pro Coming With Different SoCs </p>
<p> Both the ASUS ZenFone 7 and ZenFone 7 Pro will be announced, it seems, and they will feature different SoCs. That is, at least, the information that a new report has shared. </p>
<p> This information comes from dealntech, who spotted the info on a website of a spare parts retailer. The motherboard and battery are listed on that website, and we’re seeing two models here. </p>
<p> The motherboard listing with model ZS670KS basically confirms that the ASUS ZenFone 7 series will come in both Snapdragon 865 and Snapdragon 865 Plus variants. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 & ZenFone 7 Pro likely coming with different SoCs </p>
<p> Now, this probably means that the regular ASUS ZenFone 7 will include the Snapdragon 865, while the ‘Pro’ model will pack in the Snapdragon 865 Plus. </p>
<p> The listing also shows that the regular model will pack in 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The other model, presumably the ‘Pro’ unit, will come with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. </p>
<p> A 5,000mAh battery was also mentioned, and it is possible that the same battery will be included in both models. That is a really nice battery size for the device, presuming it will sport a 6.4-inch fullHD+ display as reports are saying. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These phones will include 5G connectivity, as a recent certification stated. Now, this website did not share an image of the ZenFone 7 or the ZenFone 7 Pro, in case you were wondering. </p>
<p> It was reported earlier that the ZenFone 7 will feature a 6.4-inch fullHD+ display with a 60Hz refresh rate. It seems that will be an LCD panel, unfortunately, but we’re not sure just yet. </p>
<p> The devices will include a triple camera setup, as part of its flip camera module </p>
<p> The phone is also expected to include a 64-megapixel main camera from Sony (IMX686 sensor). A 12-megapixel ultrawide camera from Sony (IMX363) will also be included. On top of that, a ToF (Time-of-Flight) camera will also be included on a flip camera module. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A fingerprint scanner will be a part of the package as well, and it could actually be included on the back. Though it’s possible ASUS will place it on the side. It will not be included under the display, if rumors are accurate. </p>
<p> It was also mentioned earlier that the base model of the device will cost €499, while the model with 8GB of RAM will be priced at €549. Well, similar price tags are listed on the retailer’s site (€505 & €549, respectively). </p>
<p> The two phones will likely have identical specifications, save for the RAM and storage counts, as already mentioned. The ASUS ZenFone 7 series will become official on August 26. </p>

<p> What Is Audible? Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> Audible is a pretty popular service from Amazon. Allowing you to listen to your favorite audiobooks on the go, and even at home. But what exactly is Audible, and is it worth it for you to sign up for this service? </p>
<p> In this guide, we will walk you through the ins and outs of Audible, explaining the different plans, the pricing, and why it is (or isn't) a great service. </p>
<p> What is Audible? </p>
<p> Audible is a service that offers "books on tape" as it was called, 25 years ago when it first launched. Nowadays it offers a lot of other content from TV, to podcasts, and much more. Making your membership even more impressive than ever before. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When Audible first launched in 1995, it was a pretty revolutionary product. Think about it, in 1995, we didn't have the iPod or MP3 players. So even getting music was tough, it was all done on CDs. Audible did launch its own digital audio device in 1995, which could only hold two hours of audio. That was due to the proprietary format that Audible was using at the time. </p>
<p> Now Audible, gives you access to over 500,000 titles that you can listen to anytime and anywhere. Which can be downloaded or streamed on smartphones, tablets, smart speakers, TVs, and even in your car. Audible has come a long way in those 25 years, including being bought by Amazon in 2008 for around $300 million. And now the company is worth a whole lot more than that. </p>
<p> What titles are available on Audible? </p>
<p> There are over 500,000 titles available on Audible right now. Including some of the newest books, that have been released. </p>
<p> Some of the newest releases available on Audible include: </p>
<p> And many more. Most of the books that have come out recently, make their way to Audible pretty quickly. So you can start listening to them, without having to wait weeks or even months for them to become available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Audible Originals vs audiobooks </p>
<p> Like every entertainment company these days, Audible also has its own list of originals. Which you can listen to as many as you want. </p>
<p> Audible Originals are simply put, those produced by Audible. Which also means that they aren't on other services, only on Audible. </p>
<p> Most audiobooks are produced by the published of the physical book. So the number of Originals available on Audible is not as high as you might think. </p>
<p> How much does Audible cost? </p>
<p> There are two different plans available for Audible. The first on is Plus, which is a cheaper plan, costing only $7.95 per month. This will only give you access to the Audible Plus Catalog. That includes unlimited listening to select audiobooks, Originals, Podcasts, Wellness programs and more. If you're a casual audiobook listener, then this is a really good one to check out. </p>
<p> You can tell the difference from those included in the Audible Plus plan and those that are not by the wording on the listing. If it says "included" then it is part of the Plus Catalog. If not, it will tell you the price. For example, on Michelle Obama's book below, you'll see that it tells you to upgrade to Premium Plus to get this book. As it does require a credit. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The other plan is the original plan, Plus Premium Plus and it costs $14.95 per month. So you get access to the catalog, plus a title of your choice every month and exclusive discounts on other titles, as well as access to exclusive sales. So with Premium Plus, you get a credit each month which can be used for any title in their catalog. You're limited to one credit per month though, which is where the 30% exclusive discount comes in handy for this plan. </p>
<p> Is there a free trial available? </p>
<p> There is a free trial available for Audible. You can head to this link and sign up for your free 30-day trial. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that if you don't cancel before the end of the 30 days, you will be charged for a month of the service. So if you don't want to keep it, make sure you cancel before those 30 days are up. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Is it discounted for Prime members? </p>
<p> No, unfortunately Audible is not discounted for Amazon Prime members. Unlike Amazon Music Unlimited which does offer discounts for Prime members. However, Amazon does sometimes give out special free trial deals for those that are Prime members. </p>
<p> For example, right now if you sign up for a 30-day free trial of Audible, you can get two free audiobooks instead of the standard one. Normally you get one per month. So you're doubling up on your free trial. </p>
<p> What are credits? </p>
<p> As mentioned already, Audible offers credits on the Premium Plus account. You'll get one credit each month that your account is active. Basically, that $14.95 per month is paying for a credit. </p>
<p> These credits are used to purchase audiobooks. These audiobooks are yours to keep, even after you've decided to cancel your Audible account. However, that is only applicable to the Premium Plus plan. Any audiobooks you listened to on the Plus plan, will be removed from your library. Basically, any audiobook you purchased with a credit, will remain, the others will be removed. </p>
<p> The cool thing with these credits is that if you don't like a book you "purchased" with one of these credits, you can swap it out for another title at any time. Now it's worth mentioning that there is no hard limit on swapping titles, but if you do abuse this system, Audible will know and it will stop you from being able to swap. So don't go about swapping titles just because you can. </p>
<p> Can credits roll over from month-to-month? </p>
<p> The other cool part about Audible is the fact that the credits do roll over. So say this month there aren't any titles that you want to purchase and listen to. Well you don't need to purchase any. You can keep that credit in your account and use it next month. </p>
<p> But do keep in mind that these credits do expire after one year. So you won't be able to keep more than 12 credits, unfortunately. That's more than fair, on Amazon's behalf. But do make sure that you remember when these credits expire, so you can use them before they expire. Since you already paid for them, you might as well use them. </p>
<p> You also can put a hold on your account for up to three months, once every 12 months. This is going to be great for those that are in a situation where they aren't listening as much as they used to. So instead of just straight up cancelling your account, you put a hold on it. You aren't charged, but don't have to worry about signing up again. Just restart your account and you'll pick up where you left off. </p>
<p> What platforms is Audible available on? </p>
<p> Audible is available on just about every platform that you can imagine. These include Android, Android tablets, Android Auto, iPhone, iPad, Apple CarPlay, Mac, Amazon Fire Tablets, Fire TV, Kindle devices, Sonos Speakers, Amazon Alexa speakers, and on Windows. </p>
<p> So whether you're in the car driving to work, on the subway heading home, or working from home, you can listen to a new book. </p>
<p> How can I sign up? </p>
<p> Once you click that link, click "Try Premium Plus Free" and it'll take you to the checkout page. You'll pay nothing up-front, but it will show you when your month is up. Even though that is pretty easy to figure out, that is a nice touch that Amazon has added for the sign up process. So you can cancel before the 30 day trial is up, if you decide not to keep Audible. </p>
<p> And that's it. It's pretty simple. If you're a Prime member though, you do get a second audiobook for free when you sign up, which is really neat. So with your free trial you get two audiobooks instead of one. </p>

<p> Avoid The Outside & The Coronavirus & Play These Games Instead </p>
<p> Stay away from the coronavirus and play games instead. The coronavirus continues to take its toll on communities around the globe, and people are urged to stay inside in many cases to avoid possible contact. Lucky for you, because now you have more of a reason to stay inside and play games which is what we all know we'd rather be doing anyway. </p>
<p> So your local supermarkets are out of toilet paper and bottled water is also on the decline. If not already gone in your area. You nearly had to throw a few elbows just to buy the one or two bottles of hand sanitizer. So what? It's not all bad. </p>
<p> You can stay inside and play a number of fantastic games across the many platforms or services that you have at your disposal. You could even have things delivered through Amazon Prime if you have a membership. We've rounded up some excellent choices for games to play to help you pass the time while you're stuck at home avoiding most human contact and the coronavirus. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Games to play while avoiding the coronavirus </p>
<p> There's a lot of options out there. And your list of games may be entirely different from this one. These are just some examples of great games that are definitely worth a look if you're going to be spending some of your time diving into games while you lock yourself away for however long. </p>
<p> Destiny 2 </p>
<p> Games are supposed to be fun, but they're also supposed to be an escape from everything else. A form of entertainment meant to help you de-stress and relax from time to time. </p>
<p> Destiny 2 is a great game with tons of content, and it's fun too! And, the new Season of the Worthy just launched this week. Which means you have even more to do. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Trials of Osiris also just launched today, so you've got something to work towards. Although it won't necessarily be something to help you de-stress as it's a high-stakes activity that may have you pulling your hair out. Still, it could be fun if you have a team of people to play with. And worst case scenario you can just spend your time preparing. </p>
<p> Not to mention, Destiny 2 is part of Twitch Prime, and is currently giving away free loot through months of drops. There's never been a better time to hop into the game and take up the mantle of a guardian. The last bastion of hope for the last city. </p>
<p> Call of Duty Mobile </p>
<p> If you play games on mobile, either exclusively or just sometimes, Call of Duty Mobile is definitely one of the games you should be playing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's not one of the most popular games on mobile for no reason. Multiplayer is just like you remember it being on consoles and PC. Fast, frantic, and full of chaotic moments where you're forced to make decisions that will either mean victory or defeat. </p>
<p> You also have the second part of the Season 3 battle pass to work through and there's just 19 days left on it. Hell, for all you know you may need to stay inside for the next 19 days. Grind out those battle pass ranks. Because you have the time now. </p>
<p> So utilize that time in a way that could lead to a sweet new gun once you hit rank 50. All those crates you get from ranking up are nothing to shake a stick at either. </p>
<p> Darksiders Genesis </p>
<p> Forget about the fact that there's currently a pandemic going on and people are raiding supermarkets to stockpile rations like it's the end times. </p>
<p> Instead, slay hordes of demons in Darksiders Genesis, a game where it's actually the beginning of the end times. It's a nice take on the popular series game and is essentially a prequel to the events of the first title in the franchise. </p>
<p> It's still an action RPG, but it's isometric rather than third-person like the other three games that came before it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is a great game because there's just something about mowing down hell's legions with cool-looking combat. There's loads of cool unlocks that will have you striving for more, and the game is available on Stadia as well as other platforms. </p>
<p> Final Fantasy XIV </p>
<p> If you need a game to fill your time, as you may now have A LOT of it to go around over the next week or two, look no further than Final Fantasy XIV. </p>
<p> This game is filled to the brim with content. More than enough to keep you busy and it's possible you may not even finish it all by the time you have to go back to work. Or school. Or wherever it is you have to go when it's safe to brave the wilds of the outside world and human interaction again. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Because this game is an MMO, you have a very lengthy story to follow with tons and tons of campaign quests that cross three expansions after you've finished the main story quests of the base game. Which is.. exceedingly long on its own. </p>
<p> Let's also not forget about the side quests. There are tons of those too. And this is all just mostly solo player content. Once you've gotten through all of that, there's still dungeons and raids (though admittedly some of these cross paths with the main story quests). </p>
<p> You could even play mini games at the Golden Saucer casino to fill your time, or work on any number of the alternate character classes that the game offers once you've finished leveling up your main class. There's so much to do in this game. And because it's an MMO you can still interact with other people so you're not entirely isolated. </p>
<p> Borderlands 3 </p>
<p> Borderlands 3 is the fourth installment in the franchise, and it's another looter shooter which means quite a bit of content to go through and tons of different weapons to chase. </p>
<p> It also just recently launched on Steam which means PC players who didn't want to buy it from the Epic Games Store now have a chance to play it on their PC. </p>
<p> Borderlands 3 is a wonderful game for so many reasons. Part of it is the quests and all the gameplay content. Part of it's the gun play and combat. A large part of it though is the continued comedic value it brings to the world of video games. </p>
<p> There are few games that have made me personally laugh harder than many of the moments and dialogue in any Borderlands game. And to be frank, a little bit of comedy while you play games is something a whole lot of people could use right now during the craziness of this coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p> If this would be your first time romping through the vast lands of Pandora, there's no need to start at the beginning. You can totally start here and love every minute of it. If you like shooters of course. </p>

<p> Get Your Baby Yoda Echo Dot OtterBox Case Before They Sell Out </p>
<p> Pre-orders are over for the OtterBox-built Baby Yoda case for Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo Dot. More directly, that's for the Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) and branded to match as The Mandalorian: The Child, Stand for Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen). </p>
<p> As its branding implies, this is a stand-style wrap for the third-generation Echo Dot from Amazon. But shaped to look like the Mandalorian's ward from the hit Disney+ series. Or at least to mimic that, since it's really just the robes and the ears. </p>
<p> Now, users can buy the gadget accessory directly from both OtterBox and Amazon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Aside from looking cute, what does this baby Yoda case do? </p>
<p> Now, the baby Yoda case for the Alexa-powered Echo Dot (3rd Gen) may not look like it does a whole lot. And, in fact, it really doesn't bring any extra functionality to the table. OtterBox's aim here, as with other entries in its Den Series, is to bring a bit more security and a savvy design instead. </p>
<p> That means that this will effectively add a less slippery base to keep the Amazon Echo Dot where users want it to be, preventing sliding. And that the materials used will be similar to those in OtterBox's world-renowned protective phone cases. That's setting aside child safety standards certification and the OtterBox lifetime warranty. </p>
<p> Otherwise, this stand is designed to add some style without interrupting daily use. That includes leaving plenty of space for interactions, without diminishing the quality of audio. And precision-designed cutouts for all ports. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The only real drawback is going to be that this won't work for Amazon Ech0 Dot or the second generation. It is solely and explicitly designed for use with the latest in Amazon's line-up of Echo-branded mini speakers. </p>
<p> This stand isn't going to cost you a lot either </p>
<p> As of this writing, those who buy this stand aren't going to have to wait long to receive the item either. That will almost undoubtedly change as the stock begins to dwindle. Better still, it isn't going to be expensive. Regardless of whether users opt for Amazon or OtterBox, the price is set at $24.95. </p>

<p> BenQ HDMI Streaming Dongle Powered By Android TV Spotted On FCC </p>
<p> The demand is growing rapidly for projectors in the home entertainment category. Several brands such as XGIMI and Anker already offer home projectors with built-in Android TVs. Now, BenQ is coming up with its own HDMI streaming dongle that adds Android TV support to its existing projectors. </p>
<p> Recently, Epson also started offering Android TV-powered projectors. Unlike other HDMI streaming devices available in the market, the BenQ QSO1 is targeted towards projector users who want to get the best Android TV experience. BenQ's HDMI streaming dongle was first spotted on the FCC's website by Janko Roettgers, Senior Reporter at Protocol. </p>
<p> BenQ to soon launch its own Android TV dongle </p>
<p> According to the Android TV Guide website, the BenQ QS01 is actually a rebranded Inspiron D3000 Ultra HD HDMI Stick. The photos from the FCC listing also confirm the same. Additionally, the included quick start guide also revealed the hardware specifications of the dongle. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The BenQ QS01 is powered by an Amlogic S905Y2 processor featuring 4x Cortex-A53 cores. Moreover, it includes 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. The dongle also supports dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 LE. In terms of I/O, it features one each of HDMI 2.0b and MicroUSB ports. </p>
<p> BenQ QS01 is capable of streaming up to 4K resolution </p>
<p> It even supports Dolby Audio and DTS for an enhanced audio experience. The dongle comes accompanied by a full-size remote and includes dedicated buttons for Google Assistant, Amazon Prime Video and BenQ FamiLand apps. Speaking of the BenQ FamiLand, it offers content curated for kids. </p>
<p> Users can also pair it with their smartphone for even more parental control options. In addition, the remote controller for QSO1 includes buttons for changing projector settings. Interestingly, there is even a mute/unmute button which is very rare on Android TV remote controllers. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It can play Ultra HD content combined with HDR and 10-bit colour depth. The dongle can be powered by connecting the MicroUSB cable to the MicroUSB port which can provide just 5V/1A power. It measures 97 × 32 × 13.5 mm. </p>
<p> Thanks to the stock Android TV OS, the UI on the BenQ QS01 looks clean and makes navigation easier. Most likely, it should be running on the latest Android TV 9.0 out of the box. However, we need to wait for the official announcement from the company to learn more about the pricing and availability of the BenQ's HDMI streaming dongle. </p>

<p> Top 9 Best Amazon Alexa Smart Speakers – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> When it comes to Amazon Alexa smart speakers, there are a ton on the market, making it tough to find the best one. </p>
<p> Amazon has one for just about every use-case, and its partners also have a number of great Alexa-enabled smart speakers. This list highlights the best Amazon Alexa smart speakers that are currently available. Whether you're looking for a smart speaker with an incredible audio experience, one that can be used in your bedroom, or one that has a display. There's something here for everyone. </p>
<p> Top 9 Best Amazon Alexa Smart Speakers </p>
<p> There are quite a few great smart speakers available with Amazon Alexa built-in. However, finding the best one can take some work. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon's partners also have a number of great options available. Like Sonos, Ultimate Ears, JBL and many more. Now if you are looking for Google Assistant-enabled speakers, you won't find any here. But you can check out our list of the best Google Assistant speakers. </p>
<p> We've done a lot of research on these smart speakers and have used the majority of them. So when we say this is the best, it's coming from experience, and not just because we like the name, or the company. </p>
<p> Best overall Amazon Alexa smart speaker </p>
<p> Amazon Echo (4th Generation) </p>
<p> Amazon's fourth-generation Echo smart speaker is the best one yet, and perfect for those that are building a smart home. Since it has a Zigbee hub built into the speaker. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With this fourth-generation speaker from Amazon, it has improved the audio and also redesigned the speaker. You're getting premium audio on the Amazon Echo, so you won't need to use something like a Sonos or Bose speaker to get great audio. </p>
<p> The redesign on the Amazon Echo means that it is going to be able to better project audio in your home. As well as looking really unique. The Alexa ring is now on the bottom and can light up the table, which looks really nice. </p>
<p> The new Amazon Echo is available for pre-order now, shipping on October 22. </p>
<p> Best affordable Amazon Alexa Smart Speaker </p>
<p> Amazon Echo Dot (4th Generation) </p>
<p> The Echo Dot also got a redesigned, and looks very similar to the Echo that is listed above. But of course, smaller. So it has a new spherical shape, which looks really futuristic and a bit like the Nexus Q. </p>
<p> But the Echo Dot still does its job and does it well. It's a small smart speaker that offers some good audio now. It also has Alexa built-in. So you can ask about the traffic, weather and much more. Not to mention, streaming music. There is support for Spotify, TiDAL, Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music and many more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At just $49.99, this is a really great option. </p>
<p> The new Amazon Echo Dot is available for pre-order now and will ship on October 22. </p>
<p> Best sound quality Amazon Alexa smart speaker </p>
<p> Sonos One (Gen 2) </p>
<p> The Sonos One (Gen 2) is the newest version of its most popular smart speaker. Not only does it work with Amazon Alexa, but it also has support for Google Assistant. Making it a very versatile speaker. </p>
<p> With the Sonos One, you're going to get a really impressive audio experience, with some deep bass, as well as crystal clear mids and highs. Now since the Sonos One outputs so much sound, there isn't any room for a battery. So the Sonos One is not a portable speaker, and needs to stay plugged in at all times. </p>
<p> It also works with the new Sonos S2 app, so you can use it to create a full surround-sound system in your living room, and that is definitely worth thinking about before you decide to invest in the Sonos ecosystem. It works better than Alexa does for surround sound too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Finally, the Sonos One (Gen 2) is an absolutely beautiful looking smart speaker from Sonos. It's available in all black or all white. </p>
<p> Best smart display with Amazon Alexa </p>
<p> Amazon Echo Show 8 </p>
<p> You might be wondering why there's a smart display on a list of the best Amazon Alexa smart speakers. Well, that's because the Echo Show 8 can also work just like a smart speaker. Because it does have a smart speaker inside. But the reason why we have it listed here, as it's a different form-factor, and something some may prefer over a smart speaker. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Echo Show 8 was our pick over the 5-inch and 10-inch models, because it's the perfect size. It's not super big, and it's not tiny. But it is big enough to still sit in your kitchen on a counter, or even in your bedroom. Though with it having a camera, that might not be a great idea. </p>
<p> With the Echo Show 8, you have the ability to use Alexa just like you would on a smart speaker. But since it has a display, you get some added visuals with it. This includes being able to actually see the weather when you ask about the weather. You can also do video calls, in addition to voice calls. Since, well it has a screen. </p>
<p> The Echo Show 8 can also bring up the security camera feeds from outside your home, or the video doorbell. Which is a really cool feature to have available. </p>
<p> Best portable speaker with Amazon Alexa </p>
<p> Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST </p>
<p> When it comes to portable speakers that are also smart speakers, the pickings are pretty slim. So there wasn't a lot of competition here, but that doesn't mean that the Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST is a bad speaker. Quite the contrary. It's a really good smart speaker actually. </p>
<p> The Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST continues with what made the BOOM and MEGABOOM speakers very popular. Offering up loud, but good sounding audio, in a 360-degree speaker. Making it easy to fill the entire room with sound. The Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST can do all of that, and also has Alexa included. Which makes it a contender for the best Amazon Alexa speaker overall. </p>
<p> The Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST does not offer up always-listening Alexa. So you are going to need to press the button to turn it on and then talk to Alexa. When it's off, it's not listening, but when it's on it is listening. The reason for this is that always-listening is going to use up a lot of juice. This is why a lot of Amazon Alexa smart speakers are not portable. And always need to be plugged in. </p>
<p> Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST is available in a number of colors, and if you can't find one you don't like, just wait a couple of months. Ultimate Ears normally releases new colors every few months. As well as some new designs from artists that it commissions. </p>
<p> Best sound bar with Amazon Alexa </p>
<p> Sonos Beam </p>
<p> The Sonos Beam is one of the few sound bars with Amazon Alexa built-in. It's actually a pretty compact sound bar by a lot of standards. But just because it's small, doesn't mean that the sound is bad. It's actually quite impressive. </p>
<p> Sonos Beam offers the same level of sound as the PLAY:5 speaker that the company sells. It can also be grouped with two Sonos One smart speakers or really any other speakers that Sonos sells. Since it does still support multi-room audio, and in our experience, it does it better than Amazon does through Alexa. </p>
<p> Alexa is included inside the Beam. So you can ask for the weather, traffic, news headlines and even tell Alexa to turn off your lights from your sound bar. Which is pretty unique. Now the Beam does work via HDMI CEC, which does control your TV. So you can actually tell your Sonos Beam to turn off your TV, as well as adjust the volume and such. </p>
<p> The Sonos Beam is one of the more expensive products on this list, but if you are serious about audio quality, and are looking for something with Amazon Alexa built-in, this is going to be the one to get. </p>
<p> Best for the hallway/bathroom </p>
<p> Amazon Echo Flex </p>
<p> Amazon's Echo Flex is a pretty small smart speaker from the company, and one that is meant to just plug in, and leave it. Making it great to use in the bathroom or even a hallway. This is a really good option for those that want to have Alexa in every room in their home, without spending a ton of cash. </p>
<p> Echo Flex is good to put into the bathroom because it doesn't have a camera. So you won't have to worry about it watching you do stuff in the bathroom. Though it does still have a microphone. It's also good for your kids' bedroom, as it can serve as a nightlight and also read stories to your kids before they go to bed. </p>
<p> The Echo Flex comes in at less than half the price of the Echo Dot, which makes it a pretty great option for adding Alexa into more rooms in your home. </p>
<p> Best Amazon Alexa smart speaker for your bedroom </p>
<p> Amazon Echo Dot with Clock </p>
<p> The Amazon Echo Dot with Clock is the perfect Echo for the bedroom for one main reason: it has a clock. Otherwise this is the exact same as the Echo Dot that is listed earlier on this list. The only difference is that it has an LED clock on the front. </p>
<p> Adding that clock to the front was a really big deal actually. As it means that it can replace the clock that's next to your bed now. And you'll be able to see the time when you wake up in the middle of the night now. </p>
<p> It's easy to read and doesn't do much else other than show you the time. You can still play music, ask Alexa for the weather and much more though. </p>
<p> Best for your existing stereo system </p>
<p> Amazon Echo Input </p>
<p> Those that are audiophiles likely already have a pretty expensive stereo setup in their home and none of the speakers on this list will be able to replace it. Amazon knows this, not to mention those systems are usually very expensive. So, Amazon made the Echo Input. </p>
<p> This is a tiny Echo device, that is shaped like the Echo Dot, but much thinner, and it essentially just plugs into your stereo and gives you Alexa support. You can connect via a 3.5mm cable or Bluetooth. But in our opinion, the 3.5mm cable is going to be the better bet. As Bluetooth can cause lag when using Alexa. </p>
<p> Now with the Echo Input, you're going to be able to ask Alexa to play Big Sean from Amazon Music Unlimited on your stereo system. It's a very small and inexpensive product that will make your legacy speakers and stereo, smart. </p>

<p> Top 8 Best Android 11 Beta Features – June 2020 </p>
<p> The Android 11 beta has been out officially for exactly a week now, and these are the best features that the new software has to offer to users. </p>
<p> Not all features will be big, user-facing changes, but they're still useful nonetheless. They're definitely some of the best android features to date, and worth checking out if you have a Pixel device that you can install the Android 11 beta onto. </p>
<p> In the near future, you should be able to install the Android 11 beta software onto non-Pixel devices. But for now, you need a Pixel phone, and you need to be a part of the Android beta program. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Top 8 Best Android 11 beta features </p>
<p> There's lots of little changes in Android 11 that Google has shown off in the beta, at least in this version of it, and some of the best features are ones you may not think about. </p>
<p> Not all of the features will be as noticeable either. Which is another reason for putting together this list. As some of the features might be easy to skip over and go unnoticed. </p>
<p> Some of the features will also probably be more important to some users than others. But all of the deserve a little bit of attention. We may also update this list and swap some features out when the next version of the beta is released. As Google plans to release more than just this version. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Best Android 11 beta feature overall </p>
<p> Quick settings media controls </p>
<p> The brand-new media controls feature that places them in the quick settings menu is the best feature in the Android 11 beta thus far. </p>
<p> It makes accessing your controls extremely easy and without having to worry about the persistent notification media controls disappearing as they often can. Because they're notifications, they can be swiped away by accident which will then close out your media app. </p>
<p> With these new quick settings controls, that's not the case. The controls will stay there until you intentionally close out the app you're streaming from. Best of all is that they're at the very top of the panel. So when you pull down the quick settings menu it's one of the first things you'll see. When it's fully extended of course. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In these new controls there's also an ability to switch to different Bluetooth devices that your phone may be paired with at the same time. And, the new controls support multiple media playback cards. </p>
<p> In the beta this feature is called Media Resumption, and it needs to be turned on from the Developer Options menu in settings. Though, it should be in a less hidden spot in a final release of the software. </p>
<p> Best Android 11 beta feature for smart home device owners </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Smart home access from the power menu </p>
<p> One of the best features of the Android 11 beta is definitely the new power menu. Specifically the device controls that have been added to it. </p>
<p> In the most recent version of Android 10, when you press and hold down the power button you'll get your cards and passes shown at the top of the screen. Along with the familiar options to restart your device, power it off, or take a screenshot. </p>
<p> In the first Android 11 beta, Google added the option to display controls for smart home devices. Such as light bulbs, the TV, the front door camera and more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Using them does require some configuration. After setting everything up though, you no longer need to open up the relative apps to turn up the heat or turn down the lights. Simply tap your power button and have a small set of controls at your finger tips in a matter of seconds. </p>
<p> These are a quick and easy way to adjust the smart devices around your home. And Android 11 will be all the better for it. </p>
<p> Best Android 11 beta feature for conversationalists </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Chat bubbles </p>
<p> This one is a little bit of a sticky situation as it's not quite available in the beta yet. That's because apps have to support the feature for it to be implemented. And right now the closes to that is Google's Messages app. </p>
<p> The chat bubbles feature is nothing new to the world of Android thanks to Facebook and some third-party applications. </p>
<p> But as a native feature it's never been part of Android as a whole. Not for stock Android. Android 11 changes that with the beta and allows communication apps to show the active conversations on top of all other apps in a bubble, making it one of the best features. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Why is it one of the best? Because it makes talking with your friends and family that much easier. Simply tap the bubble and open the active conversation, respond, and close it back out. All without having to exit your other app. The bubble stays readily available too. </p>
<p> That is unless you close it out entirely. Then it will remain out of view until another message is sent back to you. </p>
<p> Best Android 11 beta feature for multiple conversations </p>
<p> Conversation groups for the notification panel </p>
<p> Not everyone communicates through the same application. And if you're someone who talks a lot then you probably have multiple conversations going all of the time. </p>
<p> Some of your family might use Facebook Messenger. Some of your friends might use Telegram or WhatsApp. And people from work might use something like Slack or Google Chat. </p>
<p> The new conversation groups in the notification panel will take all of the notifications that come from communication apps and place them directly in their own little space. That way they're easier to identify and interact with if you have a lot of unchecked notifications. </p>
<p> Google also gave them a priority over other types of notifications. Meaning your conversations will always take precedent over any other notification that comes in and be listed as the top group. </p>
<p> Best Android 11 beta feature for making tutorials </p>
<p> The screen recorder </p>
<p> The screen recorder is back in Android 11 after having been slashed from the Android 10 feature lineup. </p>
<p> This is a great feature to have if you enjoy making tutorials for any reason whatsoever. Whether it's part of your job or you just like being able to show people how to do things should they ask for help. </p>
<p> One thing to keep in mind is that Google did remove this feature once before with the last version of Android. So there's no telling if it would decide to take it out again. </p>
<p> But for now, it's here and it's certainly usable. Even if it does come with a couple of bugs. To access it, extend the quick settings all the way, tap the edit button, and then find and drag the screen recorder setting into the active panel. </p>
<p> Best Android 11 beta feature for accessibility </p>
<p> Supercharged Voice Access features </p>
<p> Voice Access itself is not a feature baked into Android, but rather an app that can be installed on Android devices. </p>
<p> With Android 11, Voice Access gained a lot of improvements that will make it way better for anyone who might need it. Instead of just listing numbers on the screen next to everything you can interact with, Voice Access now understands the context of what's actually on your display. </p>
<p> So instead of saying the number 10 because it's listed next to the Twitter app, which would then launch it, you can just say launch Twitter and it will understand. Then launch Twitter as you requested. Further, you can tell it to tweet after you're in the app and it'll do that too. </p>
<p> It still has numbers next to everything, but that's no longer the only way you can interact with your phone by voice using the app. It's a whole lot smarter than before and it will certainly bring some ease of use in Android 11's final state. </p>
<p> Best Android 11 beta feature for style enthusiasts </p>
<p> The new customization options for the Always-On Display Clock </p>
<p> There aren't really a whole lot of new options for customization and style in Android 11. At least not in the first beta. </p>
<p> There is however at least one thing that stands out. The new customization options that you can find for the Always-On Display clock. In Android 11, if you press and hold down on the homescreen you can bring up the Styles and Wallpapers options. </p>
<p> In here you will now find a tab for the clock. Currently there appears to be only one style available. The default option. But presumably there will be more style choices in the final release of Android 11. </p>
<p> With more options to choose from, even for such a small thing, this will surely peak the interest of style hounds. Especially if you're always looking at the clock on your device through the Always-On Display. </p>
<p> Best Android 11 beta feature for heavy app users </p>
<p> App Suggestions in the Pixel Launcher dock </p>
<p> This is probably going to be an underrated feature for many users. Especially if they don't understand exactly how it works. </p>
<p> It's a brilliant idea though and it really lends itself well to anyone who uses a metric ton of different applications on their phone. App Suggestions in Android 11 works to place your most used apps in the dock. So the apps are consistently rotating and surfacing the apps you are using the most at that time. The feature also suggests apps that are part of your routines or that you used recently (even if you don't use them as often). </p>
<p> It doesn't remove the apps you have placed in the dock though. It will only suggest apps if you leave any spaces in the dock blank. This is great if your routines change. And if you're using a lot of apps, that's likely to happen, and probably more often than you'd think. </p>

<p> Starting things off is the new Bubbles feature. This is something that isn't new to Android entirely as some apps already offer it. </p>
<p> Facebook's Messenger app for example has had this for years. Bubbles is now a native feature in Android 11 though. Which means any messaging app can implement it. </p>
<p> This is still something that developers will have to utilize. The new Bubbles API is available as part of Android 11, but it won't be a feature in apps that don't take advantage of it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Right from the start, Google's Messaging app now has bubble conversations. Allowing it to sit open on top of other apps. </p>
<p> More will be on the way, too. Google Chat is likely to implement it soon enough. And other top messaging apps probably will in due time. </p>
<p> ADB incremental installations </p>
<p> This is a feature that's directed more at developers. It will trickle down to users though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With ADB incremental installations, developers now have the ability to load APKs onto devices about ten times faster than before. This means developers can test out applications quicker. </p>
<p> And in the long run that means they'll be able to push out updates faster, launch apps faster, and more. Which means users get updates faster, and access to trying out new apps faster as well. </p>
<p> Overall it's a good change for everyone. Even if at its core it's more of a developer thing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> New media controls </p>
<p> Not everyone is a fan of this one but the new media controls are definitely one of the best new features this software has to offer. </p>
<p> There are two major things about the way media controls have changed. The first is that media controls no longer show up in your notification panel as a notification like they used to. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Instead, Google has moved them to the quick settings panel. So when you drag down the notifications panel, you drag it down again to open quick settings. </p>
<p> That's where the media controls now live. The other major change is that if you have more than one streaming media app open and running, you'll be able to see them both. What's more is that you can easily flip between them by swiping left or right. </p>
<p> Initially the one that's playing when you open the quick settings panel will be the one you see. And if you swipe to the left you'll see whatever else you have open. Naturally the controls have buttons for pause/play, and skipping tracks. </p>
<p> No longer will you have to worry about accidentally swiping away your media control notification and closing the app. Which means no more accidental shutdowns of the music you were listening to. </p>
<p> One-time permissions </p>
<p> Quite simply put, this enables more granular control over permissions for the user. </p>
<p> When you download and app and want to use it, you have to grant it permissions. That's never changed. But now, users can grant permissions for an app for various things for a single-use only. </p>
<p> This does mean that every time you want to use an app, you'll have to grant permissions to it again. But that's the price you pay if you want that kind of control. </p>
<p> It's a small user-facing feature, but one that is no doubt appreciated by many users. Since now users will have the ability to grant permissions on a case by case basis, instead of granting them one time and then they're granted every time there after. </p>
<p> Better support for curved and waterfall displays </p>
<p> This is another feature that's primarily developer-facing, but again it ends up trickling down to the user. </p>
<p> Specifically, in Android 11 developers now have more support and new tools to make their apps better for phones with these kinds of displays. </p>
<p> This should improve things both from a functional standpoint and from a visual standpoint. </p>
<p> What the change includes is a new API that developers have access to. And what that API does is allow developers to designate the area of the screen that they want to be interactive. </p>
<p> On the user side of things, this will make using certain apps much easier on phones with these types of displays. And for developers that can translate to better reviews and overall improved user retention. </p>
<p> Native screen recording </p>
<p> This has probably been one of the more requested features for a long time. </p>
<p> Users have been begging for a native, built-in way to record their screen for many versions of the Android software. While screen recording has been possible for a while, it's only been doable through third-party apps. </p>
<p> Which meant you had to find a good one that was not only trusted, but actually worked well. Now screen recording is just baked into the software and anyone on Android 11 can use it. </p>
<p> Whatever your reasons for wanting it, it's here now. So make good use of it because you can record anything from your screen that you like. Also worth noting is that native screen recording is simply new to stock Android. </p>
<p> Some forked versions of Android may have offered it without an app prior to now. </p>
<p> Dedicated conversations section in the notification panel </p>
<p> Communication is the big theme with this version of Android. As part of that, Google is making it easier to manage all of your ongoing conversations from the notification panel. </p>
<p> There is now a dedicated tab in that panel where all of your conversations will reside. </p>
<p> It'll be separate from the rest of the notifications that you may have present. So it's way easier to keep track of everything and keep those conversations going in a timely manner. </p>
<p> In addition to that you can even prioritize the conversations that matter most to you. Ensuring that you always answer without making them wait. Or missing the messages entirely. </p>
<p> Power menu access for all your connected smart devices </p>
<p> Smart homes are much more prominent these days. And more and more people are starting to outfit their homes with things like smart bulbs, smart plugs, smart speakers and more. </p>
<p> It's now never been easier to manage all of those devices on Android. By simply holding down the power menu, you can see a new set of controls for all of those devices that you have connected in one single place. </p>
<p> Turning them on or off at your leisure without having to talk to google or go into the apps for those devices. It's like a one-stop shop, but for controls, and you're not shopping for anything. </p>
<p> Wireless Android Auto </p>
<p> If you've ever used Android Auto before, then you know how much of a pain it can be if you're using it through your phone. </p>
<p> Because it had to be connected to the vehicle using a cable plugged into the car's phone charging port, and you had to activate Android Auto mode on the infotainment center. Well, no longer. As long as you have a phone that runs on Android 11, and your vehicle is compatible with Android Auto, you can link it up wirelessly. </p>
<p> This is likely to drain more battery, so keeping it plugged in anyway might still be a good idea. As you can keep your phone charged that way. </p>
<p> New screenshot interface </p>
<p> Screenshots in Android 10 were fine, but in Android 11 they're definitely better. </p>
<p> Why? Because there's more you can do with them now. The new interface sees the screenshot image you take shrink down to a tiny thumbnail version in the left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> With it there are buttons for sharing and editing the screenshot. Making it pretty simple to do either with very little extra effort. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Card Games – June 2020 </p>
<p> Card games are something that plenty of people can get into and these are some of the best ones on Android. When you think of card games, what comes to mind likely depends what generation you're from. </p>
<p> For example, you might think of card games as classic options like Solitaire or Hearts. If you're on the younger side and grew up around classic video game consoles like the Super Nintendo and beyond, you might think of games like the Pokémon card game or Yu-Gi-Oh. This list not only has some of the best card games on Android but it also has a variety of different options. </p>
<p> Something for everyone if you will. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Android Card Games Summary </p>
<p> Below is a summary table of which card games are on this list. If you're short on time and simply want to see which games we picked, you can view them all directly from the table included here. </p>
<p> If you want to read a little more about each of our picks, as well as check out the associated game trailers if available, you can view the actual longer list below the summary table. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Android Card Games List </p>
<p> Microsoft Solitaire Collection </p>
<p> If you grew up with an old Dell, Gateway, or Hewlett-Packard PC in the 90s, you have probably played at least one game of Microsoft Solitaire. Microsoft has brought back that nostalgic feeling and wrapped up five different solitaire games into one glorious collection for the players, making this one of the best card games on Android. </p>
<p> Having five different solitaire games in one isn't the only reason this is a game worth picking up though. There's daily challenges for you to complete so you can earn rewards and badges. There's also millions of players, and you can play with friends if you sign into the game with your Xbox Live account. </p>
<p> In this collection you'll find Klondike Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, Freecell Solitaire, Tri Peaks Solitaire, and Pyramid Solitaire. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pokémon TCG Online </p>
<p> Pokémon is most famous for the Game Boy games that came out decades ago, but since then has grown into a worldwide phenomenon across various forms of media and entertainment. One of those is the Pokémon Trading Card Game, and this is the mobile version of it. </p>
<p> Pokémon TCG Online is a lot like the physical version of the game, except you can take it with you anywhere without having to carry a bunch of physical cards with you. Which is one of the reasons why we picked it for the best android card games list. </p>
<p> The only downside here is that you can only play the game on tablets. As it won't support phones. Which means it will limit who can play it. Still, it has all the hallmarks of a great Pokémon card game, letting you build your perfect deck, earn booster packs and more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you've always been a Pokémon card game fan and have a tablet (or plan to get one), check this out. </p>
<p> Reigns: Game Of Thrones </p>
<p> There are a few different versions of Reigns, and this one is themed after Game of Thrones. Making it perfect for fans of the series. </p>
<p> Reigns: Game of Thrones tasks you with deciding the fate of the seven kingdoms. Rule on the Iron Throne with the different leaders (all characters from the show and books), and unlock new leaders as you progress. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Each leader also offers up unique challenges for you to complete, which expand the stories of those particular characters. In addition to the main game, which is a single player experience, there are also mini-games for you to sink your teeth into. </p>
<p> The Elder Scrolls: Legends </p>
<p> Fan of The Elder Scrolls series? The Elder Scrolls: Legends has what you'd probably want in a card game. It's a strategy-based card game which means you'll battle it out against other players for victory. </p>
<p> While there are PvP-based modes, there's also a fair amount of single player content. For instance, there are numerous campaigns for players to finish, and there's a solo arena that lets players practice their skills. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Since this is a strategy card game, winning is all about having a good deck filled with powerful cards, and playing the right cards at the right time. In other words, knowing what to play or how to respond to a card played by the enemy. </p>
<p> As you collect more cards and grow your deck, you can level the cards up to make them stronger. Which you'll definitely want to do. There's daily and monthly login rewards to acquire as well. So even if you don't plan on playing some days, make sure to log in and at least get your bonuses. </p>
<p> Card Thief </p>
<p> Card Thief takes the style of Solitaire when it comes to gameplay and fuses plenty of its own interesting elements into it. It's a fresh take on a classic game that people have loved for years. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And it's why Card Thief is one of the best card games on Android. Among other reasons. Matches in this game play out as heists. You're a stealthy thief, and your goal is to acquire items and make your way back to your hideout at the end. </p>
<p> In your hideout you can unlock equipment cards with great power to play in your next match. There are four different heists to play, and each one has a unique type of enemy to mix things up. </p>
<p> Matches are also set up to be no more than a few minutes each. So this is a perfect game to play if you only have a little bit of time. </p>
<p> There's also a lot of tactical gameplay involved, so you'll still need to think about the moves you make each turn. </p>
<p> Card Thief is filled with fun and has some pretty cool visuals. It's also free, and it's one of the titles included with Google's Play Pass service. </p>
<p> Mythgard CCG </p>
<p> Like many of the options on this list, Mythgard is collectible card battler. There's a huge card collection that includes over 400 cards, offering up plenty of variety in the way you play your hand. </p>
<p> Players can dive into the the magic-filled world of Mythgard and take on the game solo, or play in 1v1 or 2v2 battles against other players. </p>
<p> While there are in-game purchases in Mythgard, every card can also be earned through gameplay. Every. Card. Which means you don't have to spend any money to acquire the most powerful cards there are. </p>
<p> Once you become a little bit more familiar with the gameplay mechanics, feel free to try your skills out in the ranked mode. Or build the best deck you can early on and dive into the ranked more as soon as possible. </p>
<p> Exploding Kittens </p>
<p> Exploding kittens is a card game where victory relies a little bit on chance, and a little bit on strategy. The goal is to be the last person in the game. </p>
<p> You and anyone else playing must draw cards in sequence, and whoever gets the exploding kitten card is blown up and knocked out of the game. There are however ways to avoid getting knocked out. Certain cards will let you nullify the exploding kitten card. Such as the laser pointer card. </p>
<p> There are also other various cards that can help you dictate the direction of the game. All of the cards are drawn by Matthew Inman, the artist behind The Oatmeal. So there's a good amount of comedy baked into the gameplay. </p>
<p> It might seem ridiculous at first, but trust us. This is a fun one and it's a wonderful game for parties or small groups of friends. You can play online with strangers, or you can play with up to five friends locally. Or as little as two. </p>
<p> Hearthstone </p>
<p> Hearthstone needs little introduction as it's been one of the most popular card games out there for a few years now. This is also a card battler and is one of the best card games on Android simply because it's just one of the best card games. </p>
<p> It centers around the lore of the World of Warcraft universe and features numerous adventures and expansions that have added in hundreds of cards over the years. </p>
<p> It even gets seasonal events just like WoW. It's possible to dive into Hearthstone right away with little to no knowledge of how to play. You will however want to try and learn the game if you want to eventually win your matches. </p>
<p> There's a deep story to follow, but also a rich and complex tactical nature to the way you play. Duel against one other player in ranked and non-ranked games, or against seven other players in the Battlegrounds mode. You can even enjoy the game in the solo adventures where you play against the computer. </p>
<p> GWENT: The Witcher Card Game </p>
<p> GWENT is a card battler much like Hearthstone but it comes from the universe of The Witcher. Developers CD Projekt Red have deemed it to have a fair and fun progression system. </p>
<p> What that should tell you is that GWENT is easy to pick up, difficult to master, and progressing through the game and getting better cards for a more powerful deck isn't something that you'll need to spend a whole lot of money to do. </p>
<p> GWENT also features multiple modes for you to dive into. A PvP mode, a solo mode, Arena mode for ranked matches, and more. Wins grant you new cards through unlocks, so aiming for the victory is in your best interest. </p>
<p> And one interesting element of the game is that you can play any of the cards in your starting hand immediately. You don't have to wait until you have enough runes to play a specific card. </p>
<p> This is a strategic card game though. So playing your strongest cards at the very beginning may not be the best move. Then again maybe it is. </p>
<p> Legends Of Runeterra </p>
<p> Last but not least on this list of best Android card games is Legends of Runeterra. It's the newest card game on this list and probably one of the newest on Android in general. </p>
<p> This is based on the universe of League of Legends, and though it has a different set of characters and is based around a different game world than the others, it's still a card battler. So your goal is to take on enemies with a strong deck and try to beat them with your best hands. </p>
<p> What sets it a little bit apart is the ability to react to cards played at any time. Your opponents can do this as well though. So matches can get heated pretty quickly. </p>
<p> If you're a big fan of League of Legends, then this is the card game you want to play. It's actually very fun and it has some really cool graphics to help make it stand out. </p>

<p> GWENT finally launched on Android a little bit earlier this year and brings some of the game's most popular elements to mobile users. </p>
<p> GWENT of course is a game that was first introduced in The Witcher 3, as a mini-game you could play against opponents in taverns. Now CD Projekt Red has turned it into a fully-fledged card game that you can play against other players. </p>
<p> It isn't exactly like the version of GWENT in The Witcher 3, but it carries plenty of the same characteristics. If you're a fan of The Witcher series and TCG games, don't miss out on GWENT because it's one of the best in a long while. </p>

<p> Though the gameplay is fun and easy to learn, the graphics and visual effects are another wonderful part about this game. And it's part of why GWENT was one of our picks for the best Android games list this month. </p>
<p> Dead by Daylight Mobile </p>
<p> Dead by Daylight was a pretty big hit on consoles and PC, and now that same game experience is available on mobile devices with Dead by Daylight Mobile. </p>
<p> According to the game's developers gameplay has only been slightly changed. Things that may have required the player to rely on audio cues to make a certain move in-game are now visual. Other than that though, the experience is unchanged. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This means anyone who has played Dead by Daylight before in its original form can expect to enjoy the game without compromise. </p>
<p> There's even some cool new features to help the game run smoothly. For example, if a player gets disconnected due to a bad internet connection, a bot will take over for them and continue playing as their character until the player can get back into the match. </p>
<p> Dead by Daylight Mobile is one of the best Android games out right now, and it's a new offering, having only launched in mid-April. </p>

<p> Dirt Bike Unchained </p>
<p> Dirt Bike Unchained is everything you'd want it to be in a mobile game about the sport of motocross. </p>
<p> It has easy controls, excellent graphics, engaging gameplay, and a fair amount of replay value. The game is also free and so far in-game purchases don't seem to be very aggressive which is always a good thing. </p>
<p> In this game you start out as a lowly rider trying to break into the scene. You'll have to work your way up the chain by racing others, and in doing so can unlock new bikes, new character customization gear, and earn cash for upgrades. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As you progress the races will get harder too so you'll definitely want to upgrade what you can when you can. </p>
<p> Mr. Pumpkin 2: Walls of Kowloon </p>
<p> This is a point and click adventure game that has you scouring Kowloon Walled City in search of answers. </p>
<p> Explore the densely populated city and talk to just about everyone to see what mysteries they hold. Solve numerous challenging puzzles before you can progress to further parts of the game, and appreciate the complexity of the game's design with artfully crafted elements that bring the city to life. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you loved games like Machinarium, then you will probably love this game too. There's a lot to see and even more to uncover, so you should have hours of gameplay at your fingertips with Mr. Pumpkin 2: Walls of Kowloon. </p>
<p> This delightful little game is well worth the $2 it costs to buy it, and is more than deserving of being one our best android games list this month. </p>
<p> Fortnite </p>
<p> Fortnite is popular enough that it probably doesn't need much of an introduction. It's a battle royale game that spans mobile, PC, and consoles and allow all players to play together regardless of their chosen platform. </p>
<p> That's one of the beauties of this game. The cross-platform play. The even better part is that you can now download the Android version straight from Google Play. </p>
<p> Which means you don't have to do that silly workaround of grabbing the Epic Games launcher APK from the Fortnite Mobile website just to install it. </p>
<p> If you haven't checked out Fortnite yet, give it a try and see if it strikes your fancy. It's a pretty decent game when it comes to quality and it has a lot to offer. </p>
<p> Between the second chapter of the game and unique experiences like the virtual Travis Scott concert that took place recently, you will almost always likely find something in this game that can keep you entertained. </p>
<p> GRIS </p>
<p> GRIS is equal parts emotional and visually striking. And it's these two things together with the lack of any vocal context that really makes this an amazing game. </p>
<p> There's more to it than that of course. GRIS features excellent music to help really lift the overall mood of the game. And it plays rather harmoniously with the gameplay and visual storytelling. </p>
<p> GRIS also features platforming elements and puzzles that aren't too difficult. In fact they have just the right amount of difficulty to keep you interested but not enough to induce frustration or push away the player. </p>
<p> You can even partake in optional challenges that are skill-based if you feel like you do need something that is a bit harder. GRIS is definitely one of the best Android games available today, and it's really one of the best games available in general. </p>
<p> This is also a paid game with no ads or micro transactions. So it's a one-time buy and you can enjoy it as much as you want without having to spend another dime. </p>
<p> War Of The Visions </p>
<p> War Of The Visions is the latest mobile Final Fantasy game to hit Android. It's part of the same universe as Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, but it features an all-new story that isn't tied to the original FFBE. </p>
<p> What makes this such an interesting game is the graphical style and gameplay. It's a tactical RPG much like Final Fantasy Tactics, and it even has the same design. </p>
<p> If you play other Final Fantasy games then you'll also love the fact that Square Enix will do collaborations from time to time. The first one for instance was a collaboration between this game and Final Fantasy XIV. </p>
<p> Which allowed players to pick up characters specific to that MMO entry in the franchise. War of The Visions features everything from hours of gameplay to really fantastic voice over work. Definitely give it a shot. </p>
<p> Sky: Children of Light </p>
<p> If you ever played Journey from thatgamecompany inc, check out Sky: Children of Light. It's developed by the same game studio and it more or less looks like a mobile version of Journey. </p>
<p> It is of course it's own game. While it looks like Journey and sort of plays like Journey, it's not Journey. It has an original story and its own gameplay elements to fall in love with. </p>
<p> Just like Journey though, there won't be much text dialogue or any vocal dialogue. Most of the game's story is told through visual and audio. And that's part of what makes the game so magical. </p>
<p> Sky will be an evolving game that will have more content added to it over time. That gives it some more value and even if you happen to beat it faster than you'd have liked, you can come back to it later once more content is added in future updates. </p>
<p> Legends of Runeterra </p>
<p> Legends of Runeterra is one of the few new games that Riot was looking to bring to its fans. Moving away from the massively popular League of Legends MOBA game for PC. </p>
<p> Legends of Runeterra officially launched on April 30 and is a trading card game. It's similar to games like GWENT (which is also on this list), and Hearthstone. </p>
<p> It pits you against other players in PvP card battles where you duke it out for supremacy on the game board using your best deck. Cards are based on characters and abilities from the League of Legends universe, too, so LoL players may find themselves becoming familiar with Legends of Runeterra faster than they anticipate. </p>
<p> You can play the game solo, against friends, or random opponents online. But there is certainly a level of strategy to the game you will need to become accustomed to. If you thrive on games that require you to think tactically in order to win, this shouldn't dissapopint. </p>
<p> Call of Duty Mobile </p>
<p> Call of Duty Mobile is without a doubt the best FPS game on Android. It is without equal and it just keeps getting better. </p>
<p> Recently the game just launched into its sixth season, called Once Upon A Time in Rust. The new season ushers in a host of new weapon skins, new soldiers, and of course new maps and game modes. </p>
<p> There's a new battle pass too. Which allows you to unlock some of the new stuff you can acquire. </p>
<p> Gameplay in Call of Duty Mobile is and has always been fast-paced, chaotic, and devilishly satisfying when you see your plays on the kill cam at the end of the match. Activision is also holding qualifiers for the Call of Duty Mobile World Championship right now and for the next few weeks. </p>
<p> If there was ever a time to give the game a try, this is it. Dive in there and start scoring those wins. </p>

<p> Best Android Phones – December 2017 </p>
<p> 2017 is now coming to a close and it has been an interesting year to say the least. There has been a number of winning smartphones released as well as some which were not quite as good. Although overall the number of smartphones released has been prolific making 2017 a great year to consider buying a new smartphone. The only downside with the number of new phones is that it can sometimes feel like there are too many new phones now available. Which is where this list comes in. If you are looking to close out 2017 with a new smartphone purchase then here are out best smartphone picks for December, 2017. </p>
<p> 10. Moto Z2 Force </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> By smartphone standards the Moto Z2 Force is now starting to become an older phone. Yes, it was only released in the summer of 2017 but since then there has been a number of new options arriving, boasting better specs and newer design traits. That said however, none of the new arrivals have quite managed to bring to market the modular compatibility offered by the Moto Z line, making the Moto Z2 Force a unique option among the current flagships. For those looking for a phone that can do more, there is probably no better choice than the Moto Z2 Force right now. </p>
<p> Modules aside, there are a number of other selling points offered with the Moto Z2 Force including the employment of a dual rear camera setup and a heightened level of protection through the phone’s use of ShatterShield technology. As for the more common numbers, the the Moto Z2 Force features a 5.5-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution, 4GB RAM, 64GB of internal storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, two 12-megapixel rear cameras, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 2,730 mAh battery. </p>
<p> Similar to the Moto Z2 Force, the HTC U11 is another phone which originally looked to be unique due to features(s) not found on other smartphones. Although that has since changed with the U11’s flagship feature (is squeezing sides) having now made its way to the likes of the Google Pixel 2 and 2 XL. Having said that, the feature (Edge Sense) is much more user friendly on the HTC U11 due to its added ability to be customized for use with other actions. Which means the HTC U11 does remain a unique phone in this respect. For those that do like the idea of squeezing a phone to initiate a command, the HTC U11 at present is the best phone to squeeze. </p>
<p> Other than that, this is also a smartphone that comes with a top notch camera experience. One which has received rave reviews from the industry and consumers. So this is not quite the one-trick smartphone but a true flagship smartphone from HTC. As for its general spec list, the HTC U11 features a 5.5-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution, 4GB RAM, 64GB of storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 12-megapixel rear camera, a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,000 mAh battery. </p>
<p> The two original Google Pixel phones are the only 2016 smartphones to remain on the list this month. Not only were these the first phones to emerge as Google-branded smartphones but they also proved to be highly popular phones and in no small part due to their emphasis on providing a stock-like version of Android. Making them an ideal option for those looking for a version of Android as Google intended. In fact, these phones came with their own ‘Pixel Launcher’ which improves the user interface in subtle yet positive ways. So this is not strictly speaking a bare bones version of Android, but more of a slightly tweaked by Google version. In addition, the Google Pixel and XL proved to be highly capable camera phones so those looking for a smartphone that takes some really great pictures (at a more affordable price than the current 2017 crop of flagships) then these two phones are worth considering. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Back to the topic of software, one of the Pixel main selling points in 2017 is that they are quick to receive software updates. So if being on the very latest version of Android is a priority in your decision making process, then these are phones that do, and will deliver on that point. Right now they are capable of running Android 8.0 (Oreo) and are set to continue receiving monthly security updates as and when they become available. As for their specs, the two models are largely the same underneath with both variants sporting 4GB RAM, 32GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and USB Type-C connectivity. Their differences include display size with the standard Pixel measuring 5-inches and the XL measuring 5.5-inches, the display resolution with the standard Pixel sporting a 1920 x 1080 resolution and the XL boasting a 2560 x 1440 resolution, and their battery capacities with the standard pixel loaded with a 2,770 mAh battery and the XL a 3,450 mAh battery. </p>
<p> The LG G6 was a return to form for LG following what was a disappointing and experimental LG G5. Bringing to market a device that looks to offer as much screen real estate as possible within a body as small as possible. Resulting in a phone which LG marketed as display-focused but still small enough to be used with one hand. Which makes this one very clearly aimed at those looking for a smaller smartphone footprint without having to sacrifice on the size or quality of the display. So while the 5.7-inch included display might sound big, the LG G6 phone is much similar in size to a 5.2-inch smartphone from last year. Not only is the display more maximized on the front panel, but the display adopts an 18:9 aspect ratio which results in a thinner smartphone overall – another aspect which further adds to its level of comfort when used with one hand. </p>
<p> Other than the display, the cameras on offer with the LG G6 is another clear selling point as this was one of the first major 2017 smartphone released featuring a dual rear camera setup. As for the core numbers, the LG G6 comes loaded with 4GB RAM, 32GB internal storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, two 12-megapixel rear cameras, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,300 mAh battery. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are arguable two of the best phones you can currently buy. They are for sure two of the most attractive and probably the most attractive Samsung phones of 2017. As while the Galaxy Note 8 is newer and more feature packed, the design of the Note 8 is more squarish and boxy compared to the sleek nature of the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. So for those looking for the ultimate in Samsung style, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus remain the best options to go for. </p>
<p> Style aside however, these are two very powerful smartphones. Not only do they come with an Edge display and Edge functionality, but they also come packed with all the OTT Samsung features you can think of, including Samsung Pay and Bixby. In terms of their general specs, both the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus feature 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US), a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and an iris scanner. As for their differences, the standard Galaxy S8 will be better suited to those who prefer a smaller phone due to its 5.8-inch display (which is powered by a 3,000 mAh battery). While those looking for a larger phone will be more at home with the Galaxy S8 Plus and its 6.2-inch display (powered by a 3,500 mAh battery). </p>
<p> If the LG G6 was not quite to your liking the LG V30 might be. This is a newer device compared to the G6 and is one aimed more at those looking for a larger phone overall. Although this is also a smartphone that is as aimed at those looking for a better audio listening experience and those looking for more advanced mobile photography features. In fact, this is one of those phones which will largely appeal to many different consumers due to just how many features and selling points it offers. </p>
<p> For example, if you are all about the display then here you will get a 6-inch display along with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Great for watching videos and especially when taking into account the added audio tweaks on offer, such as the quad-DAC. Alternatively those looking for greater control over image capturing will love the various manual controls that are on offer, while those looking for more of a point-and-shoot experience will benefit from the automatic features. In either case, this is a smartphone boasting a dual rear camera – another 2017 checkbox checked. In terms of the general numbers, the LG V30 features 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 16-megapixel primary camera and a 13-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,300 mAh battery. </p>
<p> While the Razer Phone is technically a debut phone from Razer, it is also one which landed with a thump. Many had been expecting the game-focused company to release a smartphone but few had expected it to be quite so powerful on paper. Yes, it does suffer a little in terms of its design and is not quite as attractive as a number of other 2017 smartphones due to its boxy look and feel, but underneath this is a powerhouse phone and one which the company notes is specifically beneficial to gamers. </p>
<p> Or at least, its main features have been tuned a little to be more gamer-like with the display being a prime example. As the Razer Phone display (which measures in at 5.72-inches and boosting a QHD resolution) features a 120Hz refresh rate. An aspect which is currently unique to the Razer Phone and will make for an even better mobile gaming experience. Underneath, this is no slouch of a phone with the Razer Phone packed with 8GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. If cameras are more your thing then this phone also features a dual rear camera setup comprised of two 12-megapixel cameras, along with an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. While the rest of the features include a 4,000 mAh battery, microSD card support, and Quick Charge 4+ support. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 5T is the newest smartphone to hit the market. Although, in many ways this is just the OnePlus 5 re-packaged and therefore most of the specs and selling points remain exactly the same. That is of course, with the exception of the display. As the huge selling point with the 5T over the 5 is the change in display which sees the newer model boosting an 18:9 aspect ratio. The benefit of this is that while the overall size of the 5T has remained about the same as the 5, the level of display on offer (and by association the viewing experience on offer) has been greatly improved. </p>
<p> Another upgrade is in the camera department. While this is a phone which once again boasts a dual rear camera setup, OnePlus did swap out of of the rear cameras for another to offer improved low-light capturing. In addition there has been a number of software improvements to the cameras resulting in a much more photographic-friendly smartphone. As for the rest of the specs, in common with the OnePlus 5, the 5T features a choice of either 6 or 8GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 20-megapixel rear camera and a 16-megapixel rear camera, a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,300 mAh battery. </p>
<p> The choice between the number 1 and 2 spots on this list is more of a preference thing than anything else. As the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is about as feature-packed as a phone can get. So if you are more of the Samsung persuasion then there is little arguing with the Galaxy Note 8 being the best phone for you right now. It just is. Not only does it come with an 18:9 aspect ratio for a slimmer and taller build to match its exceedingly large 6.3-inch display, but it is also the first Samsung flagship smartphone to come boasting a dual rear camera setup. Making this phone as much camera-focused as anything else you will find on the market. Likewise with this being Samsung, the photography experience is further enhanced through the use of software, as is most of the other features as well. If you are worried about security than Samsung has you covered with not only the usual security measures but also additional ones such as face and iris unlocking, Secure Folder, and more. </p>
<p> As for the general specs, the Galaxy Note 8 packs in 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US), an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, wireless charging, fast charging, and a 3,300 mAh battery. That is, all in addition to also coming equipped with an S Pen and all the stylus-related writing features you would expect from a new Galaxy Note phone. </p>
<p> Maintaining its position at the top of our list this month is the Google Pixel 2 and its launch partner device, the Google Pixel 2 XL. These are simply the two best Android phones on the market. While their hardware might not necessarily impress most on paper, the difference here is the optimization between the software and that hardware. Google gives you what you need in terms of hardware and fine tunes it to work harmoniously with the software. Making the overall Android experience on offer with these two phones – second to none. A prime example of this is the cameras, or more specifically the camera. As unlike the rest of the flagship options on this list the Google Pixel 2 line only comes equipped with one rear camera. However, Google has tweaked the software to ensure owners can still benefit from features which are more commonly found on dual rear camera-touting smartphones. This philosophy has been extended to the rest of the hardware as well with everything that is included, included for a reason. It is just simply, a very smart smartphone. </p>
<p> Of the two phones, while size will play a role in the decision making process, so will the displays as this is the most obvious difference between the two. The larger Pixel 2 XL features an 18:9 aspect ratio which means in spite of being larger in size, it provides an even larger display than the difference in overall size would normally suggest. Making the Pixel 2 XL a display-first type of phone. In contrast to the more traditional phone look on offer with the standard Pixel 2. The different in size also results in a difference in battery life with the larger model featuring a greater capacity battery. Otherwise, both phones come loaded with Active Edge (the ability to squeeze the sides to initial Google Assistant), 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, Goggle Lens, Android Pay, and Android 8.0 (Oreo). </p>

<p> Best Android Phones – February 2018 </p>
<p> With MWC 2018 due to take place at the end of the month it is expected there will be a number of new phones announced and/or already available to buy by this time next month. So there are plenty of new release smartphones to look forward to over the coming weeks and months. If, however, you find yourself in the market for a new smartphone right now – then here are our best Android phone picks for February, 2018. </p>
<p> 10. HTC U11 </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The HTC U11 offers buyers an experience they will not find on most other smartphones as this is the ‘squeezable phone.’ Thanks to the inclusion of Edge Sensors, the U11 provides owners with a way to initiate any pre-set feature simply by squeezing the sides of the phone. Making this a rather unique smartphone in a market where most of the features on offer at the premium level are fairly generic across brands </p>
<p> What might be a downside for some, however, is this remains one of the few phones on the list which has not adopted an all-screen design. As a result, accompanying the 5.5-inch display is a traditional aspect ratio and a 2560 x 1440 resolution. Another example of where the U11 sticks with tradition is in the rear camera department with his phone adopting a single 12-megapixel rear camera. Most of the core specs are in line with what one would expect from a flagship smartphone, including 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. </p>
<p> The original Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the oldest phones on this list having been launched in the second half of 2016. However, they do remain one of our top picks for those looking for a new phone due to their build quality, emphasis on running the very latest version of Android, and their overall appeal. These are seriously good smartphones for the money and as to be expected the value on offer has increased with age due to their prices dropping. Making these two phones a solid option for those not looking to spend quite as much as what the other options currently go for. </p>
<p> Of the two phones, the experience on offer is largely identical with buyers mainly charged with choosing between a bigger or smaller phone. As both phones feature 4GB RAM, 32GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC. As well as the same 12.3-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and Android 8.0 (Oreo) – after updating. With size, however, does come a difference in battery capacity. So not only will those opting for the XL get a 5.5-inch display (compared to a 5-inch display) but also a 3,450 mAh battery (compared to 2,770 mAh). </p>
<p> One of the clear trends of late is the overall increase in the size of smartphones. Something that is unlikely to appeal to everyone. Although those buyers looking for a smaller phone do have the option of the LG G6. As while this one comes in a much smaller package it does not compromise of screen real estate due to its inclusion of a FullVision (18:9 aspect ratio) display that manages to provide a 5.7-inch screen backed up by a 2,880 x 1440 resolution. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The display is not the only newer design trait the G6 adopts as it also features a dual rear camera setup comprised of two 12-megapixel cameras. While the rest of the specs include 4GB RAM, 32GB internal storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,300 mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus are literally just around the corner with their announcement due to take place before the end of this month. So while it is natural for the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus to now start dropping down this list, these two devices still remain top quality options for those in the market for a new phone. Arguably, with recent price drops taken into consideration, they are even better value than some of the higher-ranked options. Not only do they make use of a stylish design and sloped edges, but they also pack in the features and the support. </p>
<p> For example, both phones support Samsung Pay, Samsung Bixby, and both make use of Samsung’s Edge technology to offer a more usable front display. Likewise, both feature 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US), an iris scanner, a 12-megapixel rear camera, and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. Where they differ is in terms of the size of the display (5.8-inch vs 6.2-inch) and in battery capacity (3,000 mAh vs 3,500 mAh). </p>
<p> The Razer Phone is a strange mix of old and new as while it does come with some features that you won't find on other flagship smartphones, its general design and more boxy nature looks far more dated compared to the rest of the flagships. So for some, this one will likely be a matter of deciding between a more stylish phone and a more powerful one. As when it comes to the power the Razer Phone does not disappoint. Not only does it feature a core combination of 8GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, but its display offers a refresh rate of 120Hz – making it ideal for those looking for a gamer-optimized phone. </p>
<p> As for the display in general, the Razer Phone offers a 5.72-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. Cameras consist of a dual rear camera setup (comprised of two 12-megapixel cameras) while an 8-megapixel camera can be found on the front. Also on offer is a 4,000 mAh battery, Quick Charge 4+ support, and stereo front-facing speakers </p>
<p> Although the Mate 10 Pro is not strictly speaking a new phone, it is new in terms of US pre-orders only having opened up this month. So for those who had been waiting for this phone to become available in the US, now is the time to place an order. One of the Mate 10 Pro's key selling points is its cameras as not only does the Mate 10 Pro sport a dual rear camera setup (comprised of a 20-megapixel monochrome camera along with a 12-megapixel RGB camera), but it also includes a number of software tweaks to further improve the overall camera experience. </p>
<p> As for the rest of the specs, the Mate 10 Pro features a 6-inch display along with an 18:9 aspect ratio resulting in a 2160 x 1080 resolution. Inside, as much as 6GB RAM and 128 GB storage is on offer, along with a Kirin 970 SoC. Android 8.0 (Oreo) is included, as is an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, USB Type-C connectivity and a 4,000 mAh battery. </p>
<p> The LG V30 is easily one of the best phones of last year and this is also while arguably being one of the most overlooked phones of the year. If none of the main options have caught your attention so far the V30 is one worth taking a closer look at. This is even more true for those who would like a phone which places a greater emphasis on either its camera capabilities or its audio enhancements – as the V30 does both. Providing buyers with greater and more granular control over both aspects. </p>
<p> This is also a phone which adopts a number of 2017 trending features as the 6-inch front panel makes use of an 18:9 aspect ratio (resulting in a 2880 x 1440 resolution) while the back plate does house a dual camera setup (consisting of 16-megapixel and 13-megapixel cameras). The rest of the specs include 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,300 mAh battery, and a quad-DAC. </p>
<p> Those who follow smartphone news will likely need no introduction to the OnePlus 5T as this is a phone that has hit the headlines a lot over the last few months. One of the main reasons is the sheer value it offers as it packs in high-end core specs at a very competitive price – for the flagship market. However, this is a core smartphone in general and therefore with the exception of the main specs there is not a lot of additional value on offer with the OnePlus 5T lacking in OTT features, resulting in a smartphone that is missing as much as it offers. </p>
<p> Compared to the standard OnePlus 5 model which launched earlier in the year the T’s biggest upgrade is the display which now boasts an 18:9 aspect ratio. As a result buyers can expect more screen real estate to be offered with the 6-inch (2160 x 1080 resolution) screen within a frame that is not that dissimilar in size to the OnePlus 5. There has also been some camera improvements to the dual rear camera setup (made up of 20-megapixel and 16-megapixel cameras). The rest of the specs include up to 8GB RAM, up to 128GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,300 mAh battery. Which of course is capable of very fast charging due to the inclusion of Dash Charge support. </p>
<p> Not much has changed this month with the top two spots and arguable both can be considered to be the best phone you can buy today. Although the two could not be more different making the choice for consumers and easy one. If you are someone who likes extra added value with your smartphone then the Galaxy Note 8 from Samsung is the phone for you. As this is a powerhouse smartphone packed to the brim with added features. Whether you are looking to pay for goods with your smartphone (the Note 8 offers two options), looking for a more secure smartphone (the Note 8 offers multiple ways to secure your phone – including iris scanning), or a more assistant-focused experience (the Note 8 can not only use Google Assistant but also features its own Bixby AI solution), the Galaxy Note 8 has you covered. </p>
<p> It is also worth noting this is the first flagship smartphone from Samsung to feature a dual rear camera setup, which also includes a number of software tweaks that do add to the experience overall. As for the main specs, there's nothing missing here with the Note 8 equipped with a 6.3-inch display which adopts an 18:9 aspect ratio, 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US). In addition to an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,300 mAh battery, fast charging support, wireless charging support, and fast wireless charging support. There's so much on offer with this phone in fact, that it is easy to forget the Galaxy Note 8 is actually all about the stylus. </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL do not come with anywhere near the amount of features offered by the Galaxy Note 8. So by comparison these are rather plain and generic smartphones. Likewise, even on features that can be compared, the two Pixel 2 devices lack clear trending design traits – such as a dual rear camera setup. This is even more prevalent with the standard version of the Pixel 2 which also lacks an 18:9 aspect ratio. Having said all that though, these remain our picks for the best Android phone overall. One of the main reasons for this is the tight integration between the software and the hardware resulting in smartphones which offer an overall solid experience. Furthermore, Google’s use of AI is massively in effect with these two phones where many aspects have been tweaked to perform even better than their hardware might suggest. The cameras being a prime example, as in spite of lacking a dual camera setup, the quality (and features) offered with the Pixel 2 and 2 XL is as good, if not better, than everything else on this list. </p>
<p> As for their main specs, both the Pixel 2 and 2 XL feature 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. In addition to a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and Android 8.0 (Oreo). In spite of being limited (compared to the Note 8), these phones do offer some added features, including Google Lens, Google Assistant, and Active Edge – the latter of which lets the user activate Google Assistant just by squeezing the phone. Unlike the previous generation devices, however, there are some notable differences between the two models. Firstly, the standard Pixel 2 features a 5-inch display along with a 16:9 aspect ratio, compared to the Pixel 2 XL which features a 6-inch display along with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Likewise, the Pixel 2 packs in a 2,700 mAh battery compared to the 3,520 mAh battery on offer with the Pixel 2 XL. </p>

<p> Best Android Phones – January 2018 </p>
<p> It is the start of a new year and for some, the opportunity to make some changes. If upgrading your smartphone game is something you are considering doing soon, there are plenty of great smartphones available to choose from. If anything, there is almost too many which is where this list comes in. As here we will be taking a quick look at our best smartphone picks for those looking to buy in January, 2018. </p>
<p> 10. Moto Z2 Force </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Moto Z2 Force is an excellent phone to consider picking up. While there are better phones out there, touting better specs, and some at lower price points, the Moto Z2 Force offers something you won’t find with those other phones – the option to swap out ‘Mods’ and gain added functionality. Want a better camera experience? A bigger sound output? A larger display? Moto Mods can help and the list of Mods is growing every day making this a phone that will be just as capable throughout 2018 as it was during last year. </p>
<p> As for the specs, the Moto Z2 Force is equipped with a 5.5-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. Inside, you can expect to find 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. This is also a phone which features a dual rear camera setup (consisting of two 12-megapixel cameras), as well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, a 2,730 mAh battery, and an added level of protection thanks to the inclusion of ShatterShield technology. </p>
<p> The HTC U11 is another option for those looking for a more unique smartphone as this phone comes loaded with Edge Sense. While a similar version of this feature can now be found on the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, the HTC U11 was the first smartphone to properly flaunt the ability to squeeze the sides of the phone to initiate a command. Likewise, HTC’s version is far more customizable so if you have ever wanted to squeeze your phone to take a selfie – you can with the HTC U11. In fact, you can largely set the squeeze action to do just about anything you like. How's that for cutomization? </p>
<p> As for the specs, the HTC U11 is loaded with a 5.5-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. Inside, you will find 4GB RAM, 64GB of storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. This is one of the few devices that came through last year boasting only one rear (12-megapixel) camera, although the camera experience on offer is one which has been praised widely by consumers and reviewers alike. </p>
<p> With 2018 now here, the original Google Pixel line from 2016 is starting to show its age. Although that is only in time, as on paper, and in terms of the experience, these two phones remain solid contenders for those looking to upgrade and especially for those looking to spend less – as the age of the original Pixel line has resulted in a number of price drops. Right now, these are two of the best value smartphones on the market. Especially considering that at the software level there is next to no difference between the Pixel and Pixel 2 lines. As the original Pixel phones are able to be updated to the latest version of Android as and when the Pixel 2 phones are. Which means these are already Android 8.0 (Oreo) eligible and will be first in line to get the next major Android update when it is released… a selling point in its own right. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In terms of the specs, the two devices are largely the same although they do differ in display size, resolution, and battery capacity. The standard Pixel, for example, boasts a 5-inch display along with 1920 x 1080 resolution and a 2,770 mAh capacity battery. In contrast to the Pixel XL which comes loaded with a 5.5-inch display, a 2560 x 1440 resolution, and a 3,450 mAh capacity battery. Otherwise, both models feature 4GB RAM, 32GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. </p>
<p> For those looking for a smaller phone which packs in the specs and performance, look no further than the LG G6. While this is still a big phone, it is not quite as big as most of the others on this list, resulting in a device that offers an impressively large display for its size. This is due to the LG G6’s use of a ‘FullVision’ display which when coupled with the overall size of the device has afforded LG the ability to market this as a phone designed for use with one hand. Something which is not quite on offer with a number of the larger current flagship devices that do require two hands for use. </p>
<p> As for the specs, the LG G6 features a 5.7-inch display along with an 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2880 x 1440 resolution. Inside, the LG G6 comes packed with 4GB RAM, 32GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC. This is another phone which also features a dual rear camera setup (consisting of two 12-megapixel cameras), as well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,300 mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are due to be superseded by their next incarnations within the next couple of months and while the next in line Galaxy S devices are seemingly already shaping up to be impressive smartphones, nothing should be taken away from the current models. If anything, now is one of the best times to pick up a Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus as both have been the subject of price reductions over the last few months and especially since the arrival of the Galaxy Note 8. Speaking of which, while the Note 8 is technically a better phone, it is arguably a less attractive phone compared to the sleek and stylish design on offer with the two Galaxy S8 models. </p>
<p> As for which phone you should choose, this largely comes down to a size preference as most of the main specs are common to both models. For example, the Galaxy S8 is the smaller of the two boasting a 5.8-inch display along with a 3,000 mAh battery, while the Plus model features a 6.2-inch display and a 3,500 mAh battery. Otherwise, both include 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US). As well as a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, an iris scanner, sloped edges, Edge features, Samsung Pay support, and Samsung’s Bixby. </p>
<p> The Razer Phone is a new phone in all respects as it not only launched in the latter part of 2017, but also as the debut phone to come through under the Razer branding. Although many will find the design a little familiar due to its look taking a number of design cues from the Nextbit Robin. Which means, for some, this phone will be a little squarer than they would probably like it to be. Offsetting that more boxy look is a performance powerhouse and a phone which has been built with gamers in mind. Therefore, if you are gamer and looking for a new smartphone then this should be at the very least one you do consider. </p>
<p> In terms of its numbers, the Razer Phone features a 5.72-inch display which not only boasts a 2560 x 1440 resolution, but also a 120Hz refresh rate – something you won’t find on any other phone on this list. Inside, the Razer Phone comes loaded with 8GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. Following in the trend of a number of 2017 smartphones this is another model which features a dual rear camera setup (comprised of two 12-megapixel cameras), as well as an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, a 4,000 mAh battery, and Quick Charge 4+ support. </p>
<p> Another strong contender for best phone of the year is the LG V30. As this is a phone which literally packs in the features, making it an ideal option for anyone and everyone. Besides the general specs which are largely on point, the LG V30 has been designed with both audiophiles and mobile photographers in mind. So both sets of consumers can expect a number of OTT features included just for them, such as a quad-DAC and more granular camera controls. Resulting in a smartphone that offers as much or as little as you need from it – those looking for a more advanced experience will be getting one, while those just looking for a standard flagship smartphone experience will be getting one too. </p>
<p> As for the specs, the LG V30 comes equipped with a 6-inch display along with an 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2880 x 1440 resolution. Inside, the LG V30 features 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. Once again, this phone is equipped with a dual rear camera setup (comprised of 16-megapixel and 13-megapixel cameras), a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,300 mAh battery. </p>
<p> Like the Razer Phone, the OnePlus 5T is another phone which arrived late but sporting the hallmarks of another smartphone – in this case the OnePlus 5. As the T model has been designed to bring an almost identical device to market albeit one which does sport a small number of improvements to enrich the experience. The most notable of which is the display as unlike the standard OnePlus 5, the T model arrived with an 18:9 aspect ratio resulting in a taller and slimmer smartphone overall, as well as a greater amount of front-panel allocated screen. One of the other changes to come into effect with the T model is the changing of one of the two rear cameras which was made to offer owners an improved low-light shooting experience. So think of this as a OnePlus 5 but with a better display and camera. </p>
<p> As for the specs, the OnePlus 5 features a 6-inch display along with an 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2160 x 1080 resolution. Inside, as much as 8GB RAM is on offer, along with up to 128GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. In addition to the 20-megapixel and 16-megapixel cameras that make up the dual rear camera setup, the OnePlus 5T also sports a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,300 mAh battery, and Dash Charge technology. </p>
<p> For some, the Galaxy Note 8 from Samsung will be the best phone to currently buy as it is one which is packed to the rafters with features, specs, and therefore offers substantial value for money. Although this is by no means an affordable phone with the Galaxy Note 8 closing in on the $1,000 marker. So while this is expensive phone, what it offers is a phone that is hard to compete against – on paper. If you are after a dual rear camera setup then the Galaxy Note 8 has one, and even comes with a number of software tweaks to further enhance the camera experience. If you are after a smartphone which maxes out on the display then the Galaxy Note 8 does, as the display comes in at 6.3-inches while maintaining an overall size which is more much akin to a smaller smartphone. While those looking to take advantage of the various Samsung OTT features, this one has them all including support for Samsung Pay and Bixby. Which is in addition to the various additional security-focused features that have also been thrown in for good measure. And of course, before even getting into the Note 8’s main selling point – its inclusion of a stylus and a wealth of stylus-related features. This really is an all singing, all dancing smartphone. </p>
<p> As for the specs, the Galaxy Note 8 comes loaded with a 6.3-inch display along with a 2960 x 1440 resolution. Inside, the Galaxy Note 8 features 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US). As well as a dual rear camera setup, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,300 mAh battery which supports fast charging, wireless charging, and fast wireless charging. </p>
<p> Once again, the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL remain our go-to picks for a new Android phone. While on paper they might not seem like anything too out of the ordinary, it is the overall package that makes these two devices so worthwhile. In particular how the hardware has been perfectly matched to the software. So while you will not get the number of OTT features and hardware elements offered by some of the other flagship options, what you are getting is hardware that is fine-tuned to take advantage of the best Android has to offer. The rear camera experience being a good case in point. As in spite of only boasting one rear camera the software tweaking allows owners to make use of features more commonly associated with dual rear camera setups. A level of software tweaking that led to the Pixel 2 immediately gaining rave review at launch. This is a mantra which Google has applied to the Pixel 2 line in general resulting in two phones which are smarter than your average smartphones and ones that are easily worth a recommendation to pick up. </p>
<p> As for their differences, size is the main one to take note of, although the size difference does also lead to a difference in display design. As the smaller Pixel 2 makes use of a 5-inch display along with a more traditional 16:9 aspect ratio. In turn, this model also sports a lesser battery capacity. Compared to the Pixel 2 XL which sports a 6-inch display thanks to its use of an 18:9 aspect ratio. Which in turn results in the employment of a larger battery. Otherwise both models come running on the very latest version of Android (Oreo), and packed with 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as a 12.3-megapixel rear camera (with Google Lens), an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and a greater degree of integration with Google Assistant through the use of Active Edge. </p>

<p> Best Android Phones – November 2017 </p>
<p> The Holiday season is pretty much here now and so it is time to start thinking about what presents you might buy for your loved ones, and just as importantly – what presents you hope to get from them. Whether you are looking for a new smartphone for yourself or for someone else, November has a number of great options available. In fact, no less than three new phones have already been announced during this month (with one of them having entered this list quite high up) – and with OnePlus confirming it will unveil its latest smartphone on November 16th, the list of new phones will have grown even more before the month is out. In the meantime, however, here are our top 10 Android smartphone picks for November 2017. </p>
<p> 10. Essential PH-1 </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Essential PH-1, more commonly known as the Essential Phone has proven to be an interesting device. This one has parted opinions somewhat and has seen a number of major price changes taking effect over the last few weeks. Which is highly unusual for a smartphone as new as this. The good news, however, is that it is one which can now be picked up at the lowest price it has been since its release, making now a great time to buy it. As for the actual phone, this is one which places a significant amount of its focus on being a bezel-less device as even by bezel-less standards, it's rather impressive. </p>
<p> Adding to its 2017 nature, the Essential PH-1 also comes boasting a dual rear camera setup comprised of two 12-megapixel cameras. As for the rest of the specs, the PH-1 features a 5.71-inch display along with a 2560 x 1312 resolution, 4GB RAM, 128GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,040mAh battery, USB Type-C connectivity, and Android 7.0 (Nougat). </p>
<p> The Moto Z2 Force is not the newest phone to come from Motorola as the company has since released other models including the latest revamp of its popular Moto X line in the form of the Moto X4. However, when it comes to which Motorola phone is the best to buy, that title largely remains with the Moto Z2 Force. This is in every respect a premium smartphone and one which offers a very unique ability – well, unique to Moto devices that is. As the Moto Z2 Force is capable of being paired with the various (and growing number of) Moto Mods. These modules allow the user to instantly improve on select areas of the smartphone and are quickly interchangeable. So while they are sold as additional accessories, they do offer a ton of customization options to the Z2 Force experience. This is also a device which features a now-common dual camera setup, and like the Essential Phone is made up of two 12-megapixel cameras. </p>
<p> Another key selling point is its durability as while most premium devices do come with some protection nowadays, the Moto Z2 Force employs the established ShatterShield technology, resulting in a highly durable smartphone. As for the core numbers, the Moto Z2 Force offers up a 5.5-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. Inside, expect 4GB RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera and a 2,730mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> Like the Moto Z2 Force, the HTC U11 is not actually the newest device to come from HTC. In fact, the company announced two new U11 models in November alone, the HTC U11 Plus and U11 Life. Although the former is not expected to become available in all regions (including the US) and the U11 Life is more of a mid-range device. Therefore, right now, the standard HTC U11 remains the best option for those looking for an HTC style of phone. Which is not a bad thing as the HTC U11 is a powerhouse smartphone and one which has been credited with an excellent camera experience. Unlike most of the other devices on this list, however, and in spite of the rave reviews, the HTC U11 does not employ a dual rear camera setup and instead relies on the included 12-megapixel camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One of the clear selling points with this phone is its Edge Sense functionality. This was the first phone to properly market the ability to squeeze the phone to initiate a command and unlike the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL which share the same squeeze DNA, the HTC version is far more versatile allowing the user to dictate the action. When it comes to the rest of the device, the HTC U11 competes with the best thanks to the inclusion of a 5.5-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution, 4GB RAM, 64GB of storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,000mAh battery, and USB Type-C connectivity. </p>
<p> As Google is still considered to be new to the smartphone-making game, it does seem strange to consider the Google Pixel and Pixel XL to be old devices now. But in the quickly-changing market that is the smartphone world, they are. However, they do still remain very capable and appealing devices, and due to the emergence of the next-generation models, the Pixel and XL have routinely become available at much cheaper prices recently. Making them more appealing than ever for those looking for an excellent smartphone at a slightly better price than usual. For example, while other phones on this list come with more or newer features, the Pixel and Pixel XL are already capable of running the latest version of Android, Oreo. So besides the OTT features manufacturers throw in for added-value, these two phones come running on a software version that you will not find on most of the other phones on the list. Therefore, those looking to take advantage of the latest Android improvements only have to look as far as the Pixel and the Pixel XL. </p>
<p> In terms of their core numbers, the two models share a majority of common features including 4GB RAM, 32GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC. As well as a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and USB Type-C connectivity. Leaving their main differences to be summed up as the difference in display size (5.0 vs 5.5-inch), the resolution (1920 x 1080 vs 2560 x 1440), and their battery capacities (2,770 mAh vs 3,450 mAh). </p>
<p> The LG G line of smartphones has always remained a solid option to consider each year and that has never been truer than now. The LG G6 came to the market on the back of a rather unfavorable predecessor and saw a number of aspects changed for the better. Resulting in a phone that is easily capable of standing against anything else on this list. In fact, for those looking for a smaller phone form factor, the LG G6 is likely to be one of the best choices as this one is much smaller than the other options. Which is in spite of still coming with a display that is of a very similar size to its alternatives, if not bigger in some cases. LG achieved this by being one of the first to make use of an 18:9 aspect ratio and thereby is able to offer G6 owners a 5.7-inch display on a body size more commonly associated with smaller phones. </p>
<p> Another common 2017 feature on offer with the G6 is the inclusion of a dual rear camera setup made up of two 12-megapixel cameras. Also on offer is 4GB RAM, 32GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC. As well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera and a 3,300 mAh battery. </p>
<p> When a major Samsung phone from this year has already fallen to fifth place, you know it has been a good year for smartphones. Which is the case in 2017 with the latest Samsung Galaxy S smartphones already starting to drop down the pecking order. However, do not be mistaken by their ranking as these remain two of the most popular smartphones on the market. Which is not surprising when you consider the build quality, the specs, and the number of features on offer with these two smartphones. They literally are feature-packed and offer some of the best value for money. Especially now as they are consistently available at lower prices compared to the ones they originally launched at. </p>
<p> Unlike their predecessors, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are largely the same phone. They both offer an identical user experience and largely come with an identical spec list. Meaning the only real choice to be made is which size is better suited to the buyer's needs. If they prefer smaller phones than the Galaxy S8 with its 5.8-inch display is likely to be the best option. While those looking for a larger phone will not find many better options than the 6.2-inch display on offer with the S8 Plus. Both manage to offer these larger sizes while still maintaining a thinner and slimmer profile due to the employment of an 18:9 aspect ratio. Powering the two devices is a different-sized battery (3,000mAh vs 3,500mAh) but otherwise, both phones feature 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US). As well as a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, an iris scanner, Samsung Pay, Samsung Bixby, and more. </p>
<p> The LG V30 is a unique phone in many ways including its release schedule. This is still a very new phone having only become available to buy quite recently. However, this is a phone that feels much older as it was announced all the way back at the end of August. Which is a long time between an announcement and release in the smartphone world. The downside of this delayed release is that some will have likely forgotten all about the LG V30 though they shouldn't have, as this is a seriously good phone and easily one worth considering. Not only does the LG V30 come with a number of 2017 features but also packs in a ton of functionalities aimed at photographers and audiophiles alike. Making this a really good option for many different buyers. </p>
<p> As for those 2017 features, this is a device that offers both an 18:9 aspect ratio (with its 6-inch display) and a dual rear camera setup, spearheaded by a 16-megapixel primary camera and a 13-megapixel wide-angle module. Also on offer is 4GB RAM, 64GB storage and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as a 3,300mAh battery and a quad-DAC. </p>
<p> Say hello to the Razer Phone. Not only is this a new phone from Razer, and the first phone from Razer, but on the face of it, it is one designed to impress. Razer has packed this phone full of features and specs to rival everything on this list. So if pure numbers is all you care about then stop reading now as you have reached your destination. First up, and what is arguably one of its key selling points, is that the Razer Phone packs in a 5.72-inch QHD display which boasts a 120Hz refresh rate. Try finding that on another phone – you won’t. Adding to that, Razer has packed the Razer Phone with 8GB RAM, 64GB storage, and the latest from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835 SoC. A combination which already makes this one of the most powerful smartphones on the market. Which, of course, is not surprising when you take into consideration that Razer has aimed this phone at gamers – gamers need power and the Razer Phone looks to deliver it. </p>
<p> However, that is just the beginning as this is also a phone which manages to include a dual rear camera setup which should take care of those looking for a camera experience typical of 2017. This dual combo consists of two 12-megapixel cameras where one adopts the role of a wide-angle camera. Of course, these are all power-draining aspects and to compensate, Razer has packed the Razer Phone with a fairly hefty 4,000mAh capacity battery. That is, as well as microSD card support (up to 256GB), Quick Charge 4+ (another first for a smartphone), an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and Android 7.1.1 (Nougat). It is a little early to say for sure just how good this smartphone is, but on paper, it is shaping up to be as good as a smartphone currently gets. At the moment, you cannot buy the Razer phone, but you can register your interest. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 could easily be the best smartphone available right now, and for some it will be. This is not only the newest smartphone to emerge from the House of Samsung, but is one which comes packed with just about everything Samsung could think of. So if you are after advanced security features, then Samsung has you covered with the usual measures including a fingerprint sensor, as well as face recognition technology and the rest of the Samsung security-focused software tweaks. If cameras are more your concern, then this is the first Samsung device to come packed with a dual rear camera setup and Samsung has even tweaked that experience to offer owners even greater control over elements like background blur. </p>
<p> Then there is the display. Samsung has always brought to market some of the best smartphone display experiences and the Galaxy Note 8 is no exception. Not only is this display extremely large (coming in at 6.3 inches) but it manages to do so in a body much smaller due to the use of an 18:9 aspect ratio. So this is literally one of the biggest displays around on a body which is not noticeably bigger than the previous model. This is all of course while ignoring the fact that the Galaxy Note 8 comes loaded with its own stylus, the now-famous S-Pen. Although as this is Samsung, the inclusion of the hardware is only part of the equation with the Note 8 also offering multiple software tweaks to make better use of the S-Pen, including the new ability to personalize messages even more with Live Messages. As for the rest of the specs, the Galaxy Note 8 packs in 6GB RAM, 64GB storage and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US). As well as a 3,300mAh battery, fast charging support, wireless charging support, and support for just about every Samsung service you can name, including Pay and Bixby. </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are the 2017 smartphones from Google. Unlike their predecessors which largely only differed in display size, resolution, and battery capacity, these newer models look more different than they do alike. As while the standard Pixel 2 features a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio, the Pixel 2 XL comes sporting the new standard – an 18:9 aspect ratio. Which not only means the Pixel 2 XL adopts a taller and thinner profile, but also offers more display compared to the size of the smartphone overall. In fact, the display on the Pixel 2 XL comes in at 6 inches (compared to the 5.5-inch screen on offer with the standard model) making the XL version an ideal option for those looking for an entertainment-focused device. </p>
<p> In spite of their cosmetic differences though, the two Pixel 2 phones offer an identical user experience and one which is arguably as good as it gets on Android. Not only do these phones come running on the latest version of Android (Oreo) as standard, but these are Pixel phones and therefore do come with a number of Pixel software tweaks. Likewise, and in spite of only adopting one camera on the back of the device, the Pixel 2 camera has been awarded the best smartphone camera rating around. Which is in spite of nearly every other 2017 flagship device now coming with a dual rear camera setup. One of the ways Google has managed to improve the camera experience so much is due to the software. Which is the running theme with this phone as all of the hardware elements have been purpose-included to match up with the software. Like for example, Active Edge. This is a brand-new feature of the Pixel line and one which is almost the same as HTC’s Edge Sense, although Active Edge has been included to specifically make it easier and quicker to activate Google Assistant. </p>
<p> So if you are looking for a smartphone that places virtually all of its focus on the user experience, the Google Pixel 2 and 2 XL must be the ones to consider. Although you might also want to note that both of the phones come packed with 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, Goggle Lens, Android Pay, and more. </p>

<p> Best Android Phones – October 2017 </p>
<p> A lot has happened over the last few weeks and months and with October now here the flagship smartphone landscape has changed quite considerable with new arrivals from some of the biggest players in the Android world, including Samsung, LG, and most recently, Google. So if you are after a new smartphone this month then the choice now on offer is about as good as it will ever get during 2017 and with that in mind – here are our top 10 Android smartphone picks for October, 2017. </p>
<p> 10. Essential PH-1 </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In spite of the Essential Phone (aka the Essential PH-1) being a 10th spot smartphone pick this month, this is a device that only recently made it to market. So for those looking for a very new device, then this is one to consider, and especially for those looking for something a little bit different to the rest of the pack. As the Essential Phone does make use of a rather unique design and offers buyers design traits they are unlikely to find on other smartphones. Above all else, one of the most notable features is that the Essential Phone not only offers a bezel-less display, but one which is about as bezel-less as a display can currently get. Making this a device that does place the lack of bezels at the heart of its design. </p>
<p> Although when it comes to the rest of the core specs and in spite of its flagship price, the Essential Phone does not offer quite as much as what you will find with other 2017 flagship smartphones. That said, this is a device that does come equipped with a 5.71-inch display along with a 2560 x 1312 resolution, 4GB RAM, 128GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, and a dual rear camera setup consisting of two 13-megapixel cameras. Additional features include an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,040 mAh battery, USB Type-C connectivity, and Android 7.0 (Nougat). </p>
<p> The Moto Z2 Force is still the current and major flagship release from Motorola, although those looking for a more affordable option may want to consider the newly-announced Android One version of the Moto X4. When it comes to the Moto Z2 Force though, this is a device that is designed to offer incredible value for money due to the Moto Z2 line’s ability to be used along with Moto Mods – modules that can be attached to the device to offer access to additional functionality. Which does mean the Moto Z2 Force offers something that most other devices on this list do not – which is saying something in 2017 when most flagship smartphones offer the same features, albeit sometimes with a different name. </p>
<p> Moto Mod compatibility aside and the Moto Z2 Force is built to be a durable phone as it does comes equipped with the company’s ShatterShield technology. In addition, this is a device that features a 5.5-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution, 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, and a dual rear camera setup consisting of two 12-megapixel cameras. Additional features on offer include a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, a 2,730 mAh battery, and Android 7.1.1 (Nougat). </p>
<p> Ever since its release the OnePlus 5 has proven itself to be every part the flagship smartphone while also being one which looks to significantly undercut the cost associated with other flagship options. So while this is the most expensive smartphone to ever come from the House of OnePlus, it is also the richest in terms of specs and features, and is one which still manages to retain a very competitive price, by flagship standards. Of course the one downside here is that you will not get quite the number of OTT features offered with some of the other devices on this list, although what you will get is a solid device that performs well and one which comes with a popular version of Android, OxygenOS. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As for the specs, the OnePlus 5 features a 5.5-inch display along with a 1920 x 1080 resolution, as well as the option to choose between a 6GB RAM (with 64GB storage) model and an 8GB RAM (with 128GB storage) model. Both versions do come powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, and both also include a dual rear camera setup consisting of a 16-megapixel RGB sensor along with a 20-megapixel telephoto sensor. Which is all in addition to a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,300 mAh battery, USB Type-C connectivity, and Android 7.1.1 (Nougat). </p>
<p> By all accounts the HTC U11 is a very new device as it was only announced back in May of this year. However since then there has been a number of other devices that have come through and pushed the U11 further out of the limelight. That said, this is still one of the best phones on the market and also one of the most unique with arguably its most unique feature (although less unique now thanks to the arrival of the Pixel 2) being its 'squeezable smartphone' nature. As users are able to squeeze the sides of the device to initiate a command thanks to the U11’s inclusion of Edge Sense technology. This has proven to be an interesting add-on and one which makes it much easier and quicker to activate some of the most commonly used features on a smartphone. </p>
<p> Edge Sense aside, the HTC U11 is also a fairly spec-packed phone as it is one which comes loaded with a 5.5-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. This is in addition to also coming equipped with a 12-megapixel rear camera, a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,000 mAh battery, USB Type-C connectivity, and Android 7.1 (Nougat). </p>
<p> The Google Pixel and Pixel XL broke new ground for Google as these were the first devices the company released as part of its ‘made by Google’ brand. Times have changed though and in spite of being debut smartphones from Google, they have now been succeeded by their successors, the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. However, when it comes to the best smartphones you can currently buy, the Google Pixel and XL still remain competitive enough and are likely to see a number of price drops over the coming weeks, making them both even more appealing options for those looking for a new smartphone this month. </p>
<p> Of the two, the Pixel XL is positioned as the more premium device as not only does it come with a larger display with a greater resolution, but it also comes packed with a greater battery capacity as well. However when those aspects are taken out of the equation what is left is largely two identical devices with both models featuring the same design and software tweaks. As well as both coming loaded with 4GB RAM, 32GB storage at a minimum, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, USB Type-C connectivity, and Android 7.0 (Nougat). Adding to their value – both phones are already capable of being instantly updated to the latest version of Android, 8.0 (Oreo). </p>
<p> For those looking for a smaller smartphone which still boasts a big display, the LG G6 is a great option to consider. In spite of the display on this device coming in at 5.7-inches, this is a phone that is designed to be easily used in a one-handed mode as and when needed. This is largely due to the body on this phone being smaller than usual (compared to phones with a similar-sized display) and in no small part thanks to the inclusion of an 18:9 aspect ratio. So while this is a more compact phone than some of the others on the list, it is also a more than capable and powerful smartphone. As the LG G6 also features a QHD+ resolution, 4GB RAM, 32GB internal storage, and is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC. </p>
<p> Additional features on offer include a dual rear camera setup which is made up of two 13-megapixel cameras, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,300 mAh battery, and Android 7.0 (Nougat). Best of all though is the price as in spite of this being a current and major flagship device it has been the subject of a number of price drops recently and can currently be picked up for under $500 – which makes this a bargain purchase at the moment. </p>
<p> In spite of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus being 2017 smartphones it is already starting to feel as though it has been a long time since they were first announced. Something which is now representative in their position on this list. Both come packed with many of the features you would expect from a 2017 smartphone, as well as a design that is more suited to those looking for a smaller and thinner form factor. So for example, if the Galaxy Note 8 is too large for your needs, either the Galaxy S8 Plus or the standard S8 will likely be far more accommodating. And especially if you take into consideration the price, as while these were very high-priced items at launch, they are more often than not now available at deal prices. </p>
<p> In terms of their differences, these mainly come down to the display size with the Galaxy S8 featuring a 5.8-inch display and the Galaxy S8 Plus a 6.2-inch display, and their battery capacity with the Galaxy S8 equipped with a with a 3,000 mAh battery and the Galaxy S8 Plus with a 3,500 mAh battery. Otherwise, buyers of either model can expect the inclusion of an Infinity Display with a QHD+ resolution, 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US), a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, an iris scanner, support for Samsung’s various OTT services (such as Pay and Bixby), and Android 7.0 (Nougat). </p>
<p> The LG V30 is one of the devices that has really taken its time in becoming available as it has only just recently hit stores in spite of being announced back on August 31, 2017. So for those that have been waiting for the latest phone from LG to become available, it now is, and along with a few promos. For example, in addition to a free Daydream headset Verizon is also offering a $200 Visa prepaid card with the purchase of the V30. However, that deal is only valid for this month as it is due to end on November 5, 2017. </p>
<p> As for the actual phone, the LG V30 is the sum of a number of 2017 trending design points and features. For instance, not only does this phone come loaded with a 6-inch display that adopts a 18:9 aspect ratio, but this is also a phone that comes loaded with a dual rear camera setup. One that has been receiving much praise of late and one which consists of a 16-megapixel primary camera, backed up by a 13-megapixel wide-angle camera. The rest of the features are not too bad either with the LG V30 packing 4GB RAM, 64GB storage and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as a quad DAC, microSD card support, a 3,300 mAh battery, and Android 7.1 (Nougat) pre-installed. </p>
<p> 2. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is arguable one of the best phones you can buy, and for some will be the best phone on the market. So in spite of it now dropping down to second position this month, this is certainly a phone that you should be considering. After all, the Galaxy Note 8 not only packs in the design points, but also the specs and features, making this one of the richest phones now available and one that in spite of its high cost, does offer a considerable amount of value for the money. Which is all before even taking into account the Galaxy Note 8’s main selling point – its compatibility and optimization for use with a stylus – the S Pen. </p>
<p> Besides its note-taking abilities, the Galaxy Note 8 is also the first device from Samsung to come sporting dual rear cameras and has already received much praise for the quality of the images captured. If all that was not enough then this is another device that makes use of a taller and slimmer display thanks to its employment of an 18:9 aspect ratio. Speaking of which, and as a result of the display design, the display is fairly spacious coming in at 6.3-inches. Other than that you can also expect the Galaxy Note 8 to come loaded with 6GB RAM, 64GB storage at a minimum, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US), a 3,300 mAh battery, fast charging support, wireless charging support, Android 7.1.1 (Nougat), and more. </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL have just been announced, are now available to pre-order, and have already topped this list. To be fair, it is the Pixel 2 XL that makes the number 1 spot as that already seems to be the better phone. However, the Pixel 2 XL does come with a 6-inch display and for those that find that size a little too big, the Pixel 2 with it 5-inch display might be more fitting. Besides the display size (and resolution) there is also a difference in aspect ratio with the Pixel 2 XL making use of an 18:9 aspect ratio compared to the Pixel 2’s more traditional 16:9 ratio. The last notably difference is in the battery capacity as the Pixel 2 XL is loaded with a 3,520 mAh battery compared to the 2,700 mAh capacity battery on offer with the standard Pixel 2. </p>
<p> Otherwise, much of the rest of what is on offer is the same as both phones feature 4GB RAM, 64GB storage at a minimum, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 12.2-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and Android 8.0 (Oreo) pre-installed. Of course there is also a number of OTT tweaks on offer with these phones, and most notably the likes of Google Lens and Active Edge. The latter of which (like the HTC U11) allows the user to squeeze the sides of the phone to initiate a command – taking a selfie for example. In either case, and regardless of which Pixel 2 model you opt for, you can be assured of having one of the smoothest and most up to date Android experiences available. </p>

<p> Best Android Phones – September 2017 </p>
<p> With IFA 2017 having now come and gone, there has been a few new smartphones announced. Although, these are only smartphones that are confirmed as on their way and not ones that are now available to buy. While some may want to hold out for those new arrivals, for those looking for a smartphone to buy this month there is plenty to currently choose from. Smartphones to suit all budgets and some which come with unique selling points that you will not find on other smartphones. To help narrow down the search a little, here is our top 10 picks for best Android phones in September, 2017. </p>
<p> 10. Moto Z2 Play </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Starting off the list this month is a smartphone that is by design more affordable than the rest. This also means that by design it is not quite as premium as the others. Although, for what this phone does offer for the money, this is an easy phone to recommend. For instance, the Moto Z2 Play can be picked up for a little over $400 making it the most affordable smartphone on the list this month. </p>
<p> For that price, this is a smartphone that features a 5.5-inch display along with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. Inside, the Moto Z2 Play is available with a minimum of 3GB RAM, a minimum of 32GB internal storage, and is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 SoC. On the camera side of things, this smartphone boasts a 12-megapixel rear camera, along with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. While additional features include a 3,000 mAh battery, and Android 7.0 (Nougat). Not forgetting of course, with this being a Z series smartphone from Motorola, it is also one which is fully compatible with the company’s line of Moto Mods. Something which adds immense value considering the current price of this smartphone. </p>
<p> The Essential Phone (or the Essential PH-1) has been a long time coming, although it is now here. After an extensive pre-order phase, the Essential Phone is now reaching the hands of those who pre-ordered. Although one of the downsides that still remains with this phone is that it is not quite as widely available as some of the others. With the Essential Phone currently only available to buy either as an unlocked model, or through Sprint. In either case, this is a phone that comes with a $699 price attached. For that price though, you are getting a very unique and appealing design. One which in spite of making use of an en vogue all-screen approach, is one which looks fairly different to the rest of the current all-screen smartphones. So it is is one to consider for those looking for something a little different. </p>
<p> As for the main specs, this is a fairly standard flagship device on paper, with the Essential Phone features a 5.71-inch display along with a 2560 x 1312 resolution. As well as 4GB RAM, 128GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. Other aspects worth noting include an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,040 mAh battery, USB Type-C connectivity, and Android 7.0 (Nougat). On a last note, and again in a similar vein to a number of 2017 flagship smartphones, the Essential Phone boasts a dual rear camera setup, with this particular configuration consisting of two 13-megapixel cameras. </p>
<p> BlackBerry has now brought to market a number of new smartphones, and in quick succession. However, the BlackBerry KEYone is quite likely the best of what BlackBerry’s currently has to offer. In fact, due to its inclusion of a physical QWERTY keyboard, this is also a smartphone that is fairly unique compared to the current crop of seemingly-similar flagship smartphones. Not to mention, in spite of the keyboard being physical, it is also one which comes with its own ‘smarts’ due to it having been fine-tuned to offer a number of OTT features that you won't find on other smartphones. So if you are looking for something different, and not the Essential PH-1 different, then the BlackBerry KEYone is certainly another one to consider. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As for the rest of what is on offer with the BlackBerry KEYone, this is a smartphone that features a 4.5-inch display along with a 1620 x 1080 resolution – a size which allows for the accommodation of the keyboard. Inside, the KEYone features 3GB RAM, 32GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC. In addition to a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,505 mAh battery, and Android 7.1.1 (Nougat). As for the price, the BlackBerry KEYone currently costs just under $550. </p>
<p> At IFA this year, Motorola announced the return of the Moto X line with the Moto X4. Although, if you are after the best that Motorola has to offer then the Moto Z2 Force is still the one to go for. Not only does this smartphone continue the Z line’s ability of making use of Moto Mods – resulting in one of the most unique smartphone lines on the market, but it also comes with a spec list to rival anything else on the market. </p>
<p> For example, the Moto Z2 Force is a smartphone that features a 5.5-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. In addition, this is a smartphone loaded with 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. Like a number of 2017 flagship devices, the Moto Z2 Force also features a dual rear camera setup, consisting of two 12-megapixel cameras. Which is in addition to a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, a 2,730 mAh battery, and Android 7.1.1 (Nougat). Of course, one additional point worth noting is that the Moto Z2 Force also comes equipped with the company’s ShatterShield technology. Making this phone one of the most durable flagship smartphones currently available. </p>
<p> When it comes to value for money, there are few smartphones that offer more than the OnePlus 5 does. While this is actually less-heavy on OTT features, when it comes to the core specs and features the OnePlus 5 is a powerhouse of a smartphone – and at a bargain price. As the baseline model (which is not that baseline in terms of the specs) can be picked up for under $500. Making this a great option for those who want a solid and reliable Android experience, along with a very competitive core spec list. </p>
<p> Speaking of which, the OnePlus 5 is a smartphone that features a 5.5-inch display along with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. Inside, the OnePlus 5 comes loaded with either 6GB or 8GB RAM, 64GB or 128GB internal storage, and is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. The cameras have been a big focus with this smartphone and in part due to the OnePlus 5 being equipped with a dual rear camera setup. One that consists of a 16-megapixel RGB sensor, along with a 20-megapixel telephoto sensor. Additional features worth noting include a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,300 mAh battery, USB Type-C connectivity, and Android 7.1.1 (Nougat). Not forgetting of course, this is also a smartphone that claims one of the fastest charging speeds around, thanks to its Dash Charge support. </p>
<p> In many ways the HTC U11 has not quite got the publicity it deserves. This is not only the newest smartphone from HTC, but also the best one. Offering consumers a unique user experience due to its Edge Sensor functionality, as well as a camera experience that rivals any smartphone on this list. So if nothing else, the HTC U11 is one of the smartphones you should be considering if you are in the market for a new smartphone this month. At present, those looking at picking up the HTC U11 can expect to pay around $649.99 for the pleasure. </p>
<p> For that price, this is a smartphone that features a 5.5-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. Inside, the HTC U11 comes loaded with 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as a 12-megapixel rear camera, a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,000 mAh battery, USB Type-C connectivity, and Android 7.1 (Nougat). Although as mentioned the big selling point with this one is its Edge Sensors – which basically allows you to squeeze the sides of the device to initiate assigned features. For example, a very quick and easy way to take a selfie. </p>
<p> It was not that long ago the Google Pixel and Pixel XL were our favorite devices. However, a lot has changed since then and especially with the arrival of a number of 2017 smartphones boasting more features and offering more for your money. In fact, it has been so long since these phones were originally announced that the second-generation Pixel and Pixel XL are also now knocking at the door – with their announcement expected to take place next month. However, if you are more of the stock Android persuasion, then there are few, if any, smartphones currently available to buy better than the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. These are not only well-built devices, but also ones which comes with a number of Pixel-specific features and selling points. Aspects which manage to keep the Pixel and Pixel XL on this list and above a number of other smartphones that have come through since then. </p>
<p> As for the differences, these largely reside in the display size, resolution, and battery capacity. Those aspects aside, the rest of the Google Pixel experience is the same with both smartphones, featuring 4GB RAM, a minimum of 32GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC. As well as a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, USB Type-C connectivity, and Android 7.0 (Nougat). Speaking of which, these phones are already able to be updated to Android 8.0 (Oreo) – a selling point in its own right. </p>
<p> Technically speaking, LG now has a new smartphone on the scene, the LG V30. However, the LG V30 has yet to become available to buy, or even pre-ordered. While that is expected to change this month, with no firm details on price, it remains to be seen how good of a purchase the V30 will be. Therefore in the meantime, if you are looking for the best of what LG has to offer, then the LG G6 is the one to consider. And by all accounts, this is a smartphone which easily holds its own. The LG G6 is in stark contrast to its predecessor (the LG G5) and has widely been praised from industry experts and the general public, alike. Not forgetting of course that with a new LG phone having been announced, the LG G6 has been the subject of a price drop of late, and can now be picked up for as little as $449.99. Which is an extremely good price for this screen and camera-centric smartphone. </p>
<p> As for general background, the LG G6 is a phone that is all about the display thanks to its inclusion of an 18:9 aspect ratio which results in a taller and slimmer display. One which measures in at 5.7-inches, while boasting a QHD+ resolution. Inside, the LG G6 features 4GB RAM, 32GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC. As well as a dual rear camera setup consisting of two 13-megapixel cameras, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,300 mAh battery, and Android 7.0 (Nougat). </p>
<p> Since becoming available, the Samsung Galaxy S8 (as well as the Galaxy S8 Plus) has remained our go-to smartphone. This is in spite of multiple smartphones arriving in the meantime. However, that has now changed with the Galaxy S8 series having now been bumped off the top spot – albeit by another Samsung smartphone. Of course, the good news is with the arrival of a newer Samsung smartphone, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus have now started to see some serious price drops. Which adds more to their appeal and results in the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus now being two of the best value smartphones for your money. </p>
<p> Generally speaking, the two models are largely identical with the main differences coming in display size and battery capacity. With the Galaxy S8 sporting a 5.8-inch display (with a 3,000 mAh battery) and the Galaxy S8 Plus a 6.2-inch display (along with a 3,500 mAh battery). Otherwise, both models make use of an Infinity Display with a QHD+ resolution, 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC in the US. As well as a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, an iris scanner, Bixby, Android 7.0 (Nougat), and more. </p>
<p> After months of speculation, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has now arrived and lands in the number one position this month. Technically speaking, the Galaxy Note 8 is not quite available to buy just yet, although it will be before the month is out as the Galaxy Note 8 due to become generally available on September 15. However, this one is already available to pre-order for those who do want to be one of the first to get their hands on the latest Samsung flagship smartphone. </p>
<p> Speaking of which, this is pretty much a flagship device in every sense of the word. Not only is the Galaxy Note 8 sporting a premium spec list, but it is also the first major Samsung device to come equipped with a dual rear camera setup. Adding to that, the Note 8 adopts an Infinity Display (as found on the Galaxy S8 series) and of course, comes with its own stylus.

<p> Top 10 Best Android Puzzle Games – May 2020 </p>
<p> We know a lot more people have been spending time at home these days and gaming can be a great way to pass the extra time, so we've put together a new list of the best Android puzzle games. Though for many PC and console gaming will still be the go-to platforms of choice, mobile games have gotten so good these days that it's hard to ignore them. </p>
<p> And puzzle games are some of the best out there due to their ability to appeal to just about everyone. It's a genre that's less niche than say, an MMO or a shooter game. </p>
<p> Not all mobile puzzle games are good though. And that's just the nature of things when there are so many at your disposal. It's a big reason why we've rounded up some of the best Android puzzle games and compiled them here in this list. To save you some time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That means less time searching and more time playing. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Android Puzzle Games – Summary </p>
<p> Below is a summary table of which puzzle games are on this list. If you're short on time and simply want to see which games we picked, you can view them all directly from the table included here. </p>
<p> If you want to read a little more about each of our picks, as well as check out the associated game trailers, you can view the actual longer list below the summary table. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Android Puzzle Games – List </p>
<p> One Piece Bon! Bon! Journey!! </p>
<p> This one is for the One Piece fans. One Piece Bon! Bon! Journey!! is a match 3 puzzle game that carries the theme of the hit anime. Which is still running mind you. </p>
<p> While the main gameplay is match 3 puzzle, there's a cool little element where you can build out an island. Not quite like with Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but it's an interesting addition to a game like this nonetheless. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The game does have a story to it so if you like the story of One Piece then you'll appreciate what's been done here. Each bonbon also has their own special attacks that can be unleashed that are modeled after the attacks from characters in the anime/manga. </p>
<p> Match 3 puzzle games can be fun in general, but this is sure to be more of a hit with fans of the anime series. </p>
<p> I Love Hue Too </p>
<p> The gist of this puzzle game is to rearrange the geometric tiles into their correct colorful order. There are over 900 levels to solve. And as you progress through the game so too will the challenge of certain levels. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What can make this so challenging is the fact that as each level starts the colors and tiles are all out of order. You'll need to spot very small differences between the hues of each tile. </p>
<p> Then once you discover the difference, you need to move it to the correct spot on the board. You complete levels once each tile is placed in the right spot to make up a mosaic of perfect colorful harmony. </p>
<p> There are multiple gameplay modes to dive into and a really cool ambient soundtrack to match the theme of the game. I Love Hue Too is a really well-designed puzzle game that will give you hours upon hours of play, and that's a big reason why we selected as one of the best android puzzle games for this list. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Kenshō </p>
<p> The puzzle aspect of Kenshō is that of sliding blocks around on the board to match them up and complete the level. </p>
<p> The gameplay as a whole though is much more than that. With the help of 11 original soundtracks and vibrant, colorful nature-filled landscapes, Kenshō has a narrative that unfolds into a unique and intriguing story. </p>
<p> It's these particular elements that make it one of the best puzzle games on Android. It's definitely not anything like most puzzle games on the market. So if you want to try a puzzle game that's different, check out Kenshō. You won't regret it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Prune </p>
<p> Prune is a bit of a classic now that it's around five years old, but it's so worth it. This minimalist puzzle game has a really cool art style and a unique gameplay mechanic of pruning your trees just right so that they make it into the sunlight. </p>
<p> Just as the name suggests. While it might seem easy enough to prune the tree as it needs to be done, you'll have to avoid various hostile elements in each level to ensure you complete the job. </p>
<p> There is no one way to prune the trees on each level. This particular trait helps to make this one of the best puzzle games on Android. Because it gives the player multiple choices in how to achieve their goal. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's a feature where you can also share your uniquely pruned trees with friends. Helping to make the game a little bit social. There's a pretty cool soundtrack too that gives off a very zen-like feel to it. </p>
<p> This is definitely the puzzle game you want if you're looking for a much more relaxing experience. </p>
<p> Gorogoa </p>
<p> Gorogoa is one of the best puzzle games on Android and absolutely one you have to play if you love puzzles. </p>
<p> At its core you need to move around the intricately designed hand-drawn panels to solve the puzzle. But just moving them around in the right order will get you nowhere. You will also need to make sure the panel is focused on the right element in the illustration. </p>
<p> To do this you can zoom in and out, and even drag to a different part of the illustration. It's tiptoeing around this element that makes it the challenge. Because before you can put things in order you'll need to find the right part of the image that needs to be on screen. </p>
<p> Did we mention that all of the illustrations are hand-drawn? If there's one puzzle game off this list that you pick to try out, this should probably be it. </p>
<p> Energy: Anti Stress Loops </p>
<p> Price: Free </p>
<p> In-game purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Download: Google Play </p>
<p> Energy is a great game for many things. The puzzles are intriguing and engaging, the visuals are pleasing, and it helps to reduce stress thanks to its relaxing gameplay. </p>
<p> It was also designed to help increase your logic skills and is filled to the brim with various brain teasers. Tap the different lines on the screen to twist and shift the connections and light up the bulbs. </p>
<p> The main idea is connecting the bulbs to the power source, which are indicated on the screen by their respective icons. Energy: Anti Stress Loops is packed with hundreds of levels and most certainly one of the best puzzle games on Android. </p>
<p> Aside form the hundreds of levels, the game also boasts having very quick level completion. Which should make it perfect for even those that only have a very short time to play. </p>
<p> Definitely give this one a spin. </p>
<p> Bridge Constructor Portal </p>
<p> This is Bridge Constructor plus Portal (a beloved first-person puzzle game on PC), so what's not to love? </p>
<p> As the name of the game suggests, the goal of the game is to build bridges on each level. But it throws in plenty of twists from the Portal franchise. For one the game takes place in the Aperture Science labs. </p>
<p> You'll also need to watch out for sentry turrets, move equipment through a vast network of portals, and earn achievements. Normally this game costs $4.99 but it's currently on sale for $2.49. </p>
<p> It's also one of the games included in the Play Pass monthly subscription. If you pay for that, then you get to play this game and hundreds more for free. </p>
<p> Monument Valley 2 </p>
<p> This became an instant classic the moment it came out simply because of how good the first one was. </p>
<p> While some might prefer the first one, Monument Valley 2 is definitely one of the best puzzle games on Android and it's an excellent follow up to the original. </p>
<p> It takes the same style of art and applies it here with new characters, new worlds, and more puzzles to progress through. If you enjoyed Monument Valley then it only makes sense to give the second game in the series a try. </p>
<p> inbento </p>
<p> We've talked about this one before and we'll keep adding it to lists where it fits in because it's that good of a game. </p>
<p> The puzzles here are made up of bento lunch boxes, and you'll need to match the items in the box up with the original image so all of the food is in the right spot. </p>
<p> Building off of that, inbento features a cute, non-vocal story that plays out throughout the game. You're a mother cat who is making bento boxes for her child. And as you complete each level you'll see illustration story boards of these two. </p>
<p> Throw in some peaceful and upbeat music and you have yourself a winner here, and one of the best puzzle games on Android. </p>
<p> There are over 120 different levels to complete too. Meaning you shouldn't get bored here. </p>
<p> Infinity Loop </p>
<p> Infinity Loop comes from the same team that made Energy: Anti Stress Loops, and sort of has a similar gameplay mechanic. </p>
<p> Though this time around you're not trying to connect lamps to power sources. Instead your goal is to restructure the lines so that as they all connect together, they do so in one infinite loop. Just like the title says. </p>
<p> There's also a Dark Mode where you essentially do the opposite, and break the connections to each picture. Which is a reverse of what you do in the normal mode. </p>
<p> Work your way through hundreds of levels and enjoy the relaxing gameplay and music while you do it. </p>

<p> Top 5 Best Android Racing Games – June 2020 </p>
<p> No matter how you slice it, racing games are always a good time thanks to the high-octane gameplay, but which ones are the best ones on Android? </p>
<p> Which racing games on Android are the best is more or less subjective, as not everyone will enjoy the same stuff. But the ones we've picked for our best android racing games list are all really good titles. They're extremely popular and for good reason. </p>
<p> Even if racing games aren't your favorite, Android does offer a lot of good options and the best ones out there are definitely worth a look. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Top 5 Best Android Racing Games – Summary </p>
<p> Below is a summary table of which racing games are on this list. If you're short on time and simply want to see which games we picked, you can view them all directly from the table included here. </p>
<p> If you want to read a little more about each of our picks, as well as check out the associated game trailers, you can view the actual longer list below the summary table. </p>
<p> Top 5 Best Android Racing Games – List </p>
<p> Mario Kart Tour </p>
<p> Mario Kart Tour is the mobile adaption of Nintendo's hit kart racer on consoles. It's one of the best racing games on Android for a number of reasons, but the main one is because it's a lot of fun. </p>
<p> It will likely never be as good as the console versions. And that's OK. Because Nintendo has never intended it to be as good. Its console titles are still its bread and butter and it's likely to stay that way. For a long while at least. </p>
<p> In Mario Kart Tour, you do get a lot of the same elements you might get from a console version of the game. You can now race multiplayer against other players, you have a multitude of boosts to use during races, and there are a TON of different racers and karts available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While there does seem to be more gacha mechanics than people would like, you can get buy without spending a dime on this game and still thoroughly enjoy it. If you like Mario Kart on Nintendo consoles, definitely give it a try on smartphones. </p>
<p> This is Nintendo's most popular game on Android, and it shows. </p>
<p> Need For Speed No Limits </p>
<p> This is a racing game on Android that's quite a bit older since it launched around four years ago, but it's still one of the best offerings out there. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Need For Speed series is well-known because it's been around forever. With Need For Speed No Limits, you get some awesome graphics along with easy-access gameplay that is chunked up into bite-sized bits. </p>
<p> Races don't last long which makes them easy to complete even if you only have around ten minutes. The game does offer micro transactions, but again it is easy to avoid these and just play and progress. </p>
<p> It's also still being updated with new content being added. The most recent update was back on June 8 and in that update, EA added new cars like the McLaren Senna, the Jaguar XKR-S GT, and the Porsche 718 Cayman GT4. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can customize your rides in this game, though it isn't as extensive as the console Need For Speed games that have come out over the past few years. There's also a pretty decent story to follow. </p>
<p> Most importantly, the racing is smooth and the controls aren't overly complicated. Which means it's easy for just about anyone to pick up and play. Even newcomers to the racing genre. Plus, you really can't argue much with a free game of this quality. </p>
<p> Asphalt 9: Legends </p>
<p> Gameloft's long-running Asphalt series has spawned 9 games in the mainline franchise and even a few offshoots. The mainline titles have generally been the best among the company's racing games on Android, and 9 might be the best of them all. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Asphalt 9: Legends is so popular, that it has a pretty decent Esports scene where the top players can compete for money and prizes. And of course recognition. </p>
<p> When it comes to game content, this has some of the best graphics around for a mobile racing game. There's loads of cars to choose from, though you won't have access to all of them right away. Many of them you will have to unlock through gameplay, while some you will only be able to buy. </p>
<p> Aside from the cars, the game contains a wide variety of different modes to play and tracks to race on. Unlike some of the earliest Asphalt games, the cars in Asphalt 9: Legends are real vehicles from top brands including Acura, Porsche, McLaren, Jaguar, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Ford, and more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It has pretty tight controls, and it supports both touch controls and Bluetooth gamepads. So if you prefer physical buttons, you're in luck with this one. All you need is a good gamepad like the Razer Kishi. </p>
<p> You can also play single player or multiplayer. In fact the multiplayer can be up to 8 live players. Letting you test your skills against other racers. </p>
<p> Forza Street </p>
<p> Forza used to be a game you could only play on the Xbox console. But eventually Microsoft launched the Xbox Play Anywhere initiative and it's now possible to play Forza games on Windows PCs too. You can even play them through xCloud if you're part of the beta. </p>
<p> But, you don't have to do that. Because with the launch of Forza Street on Android, one of the best racing games is available on mobile through Google Play. </p>
<p> Forza Street launched on Android earlier this year and offers a similar experience to Need For Speed No Limits. It has a single player campaign you can go through but also offers multiplayer experiences. </p>
<p> The coolest element of this game though is that it shares some progress with the console and Windows versions of the game. Letting you earn and use cars between platforms. That being said this is not a cross-platform game. </p>
<p> Not in the way that Fortnite is. In Forza Street for Android you don't control the cars like you would in any of the other games in this list either. Instead, the races are all about shifting at the right times to win. </p>
<p> The rest of the movement of the vehicle is entirely controlled by the game itself. While that won't mesh well with everyone, it's actually a lot of fun and it makes the game very easy to get into. Some races will definitely be challenging if you don't time things right or if your cars aren't upgraded enough. </p>
<p> But it's not overly difficult to learn how to play. There are plenty of cars to acquire and store in your garage, and the whole affair was designed to offer a cinematic feel. Blending a racing game you can play with races you can watch. It's a cool concept, and it's worth checking out. </p>
<p> GRID Autosport </p>
<p> GRID Autosport is the most realistic racing game in this entire list and that is a big reason why it may appeal to many players. </p>
<p> Not only is it the most realistic, it also costs money. You will pay $9.99 for the game but it's a one-time buy and there are literally zero micro transactions. So you get a full-game experience on mobile with tons of extra bonuses. </p>
<p> It's got excellent graphics, fantastic controls, over 100 cars to race, loads of tracks and more. It kind of feels like Gran Turismo on mobile. So if you like real driving simulators this game is for you. </p>
<p> Controls are even customizable. So if you don't like the way they're set up by default, switch things up. Find your sweet spot and dominate the track in over 100 circuits. </p>
<p> Perhaps the only downsides are that one, this is a massive game. It's nearly 4GB in size. So if you have a low amount of space then you'll need to free some up. </p>
<p> The other downside is that it's not compatible with as many phones as the other four games. So there will be some players that aren't able to play it. Unfortunately. It also requires Android 9 Pie or later, so that will limit things even more. </p>
<p> However, if your phone meets the requirements, definitely grab this game if you like racing games and you want the best possible experience with them on mobile. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Smartphones – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> Finding the best Android smartphones can be tough. Even tougher to narrow that list down to the one you want, or should buy. That's where we come in. Throughout the year, a lot of Android smartphones come across our desk, making it easier to find which ones are the "best". It also makes it easier to find out which ones are not worth your attention. </p>
<p> This list has the best smartphones in different areas like battery life, camera experience, 5G, etc. So no matter what you're looking for, you'll find the right smartphone for you. If you are looking for something a bit cheaper, you can check out our Top 10 Best Value Smartphones. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Android Smartphones 2020 </p>
<p> We're in the midst of Techtober, where many new smartphones are being released. And right now, we still have a couple more devices to be announced and made available this month – like the OnePlus 8T. But these are the best Android smartphones you can buy (or pre-order) right now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We've done a lot of research and have reviewed just about every smartphone that is listed here. There are a couple that we weren't able to get our hands on long enough for a review, unfortunately. So you can trust our judgement when we say this particular phone is the best you can buy. </p>
<p> Best Overall Smartphone </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra </p>
<p> The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is now our pick for the best overall smartphone. It sports the best in several different categories. That includes the best display, best processor, big battery, and even the S Pen is here. For $1299, it is a really good phone, and you'd expect that for that price. </p>
<p> With the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, you're getting a 6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED display at 120Hz. As well as the Snapdragon 865+ chipset, 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. There is a micro SD card slot for expanding storage as well. Samsung has also included a 4500mAh capacity battery on this one. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The cameras have been upgraded as well, with there being a 108-megapixel main sensor, capable of 50x zoom (not the 100x zoom on the Galaxy S20 Ultra), and then 12-megapixel periscope telephoto and ultra wide cameras. It's a really great smartphone, especially for those that want the best of the best, and the S Pen. </p>
<p> Best Battery Life Smartphone </p>
<p> OnePlus 8 Pro </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 Pro is our new pick for the best battery life smartphone, because well, it has incredible battery life. Which is honestly quite surprising given the fact that this has a 120Hz Quad HD+ display, and only a 4510mAh capacity battery inside. But it will get you through a full day and then some. And if you tweak the settings a bit, you can get even more juice out of this one. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It also sports a 6.78-inch Quad HD+ OLED display, at 120Hz. There's a Snapdragon 865 chipset inside, along with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. For another $100, you can up that to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage too. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 Pro also supports wireless charging now at 30W. That's the same speed as the wired charging that OnePlus offers. Which means that you can quickly recharge the OnePlus 8 Pro when the battery is running low. </p>
<p> Best Camera Smartphone </p>
<p> Google Pixel 5 </p>
<p> The Pixel 5 is no surprise, the best camera smartphone you can buy today. Sure there are other phones with crazier camera setups like the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro, or the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. But from a pure photo quality perspective, nothing is able (still) to beat the Pixel. </p>
<p> Pixel 5 is the company's latest smartphone. It comes with a 6-inch FHD+ OLED 90Hz display, the Snapdragon 765G chipset, with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It is available in two colors: Just Black and Sorta Sage. And it is powered by a 4080mAh capacity battery too. </p>
<p> With the Pixel 5, Google finally gave users what they wanted. An ultra-wide camera. So this one has a 16-megapixel ultra-wide and a 12-megapixel main sensor. It also has 4K60 video support, Cinematic Pans, Night Sight Portait Mode and so much more. All for just $699. </p>
<p> Best Compact Smartphone </p>
<p> Google Pixel 4a </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 4a is our pick for the best compact smartphone. It's not necessarily a high-end smartphone, but at 5.81-inches, it is definitely compact. And offers a lot of the same features as the larger and more expensive Pixel 4 XL. </p>
<p> That includes the same great Pixel camera. Allowing you to capture some really great looking portrait shots, as well as stunning photos at night, all on a phone that is under $400. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Internally, the Pixel 4a has a Snapdragon 730G chipset, with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Which is right on par with some of the smartphones on this list, at a much cheaper price. </p>
<p> Best 5G Smartphone </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra is the only 5G phone worth buying, and that is mostly due to the battery capacity. It sports a 5,000mAh capacity battery, which will get you through the day, if not two full days. And that's needed for 5G. Seeing as the technology hasn't matured yet, it is still very battery hungry. So having a larger battery is definitely a nice thing to have. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additionally, the Galaxy S20 Ultra sports a 6.9-inch Quad HD+ AMOLED display, powered by the Snapdragon 865 chipset, 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. There is also a 16GB/512GB model available for $1,599. There's a triple camera setup on the back, which includes a 108-megapixel sensor that is capable of shooting 8K video. It also has support for Space Zoom, which allows you to zoom in at up to 100X. That's fairly impressive for a smartphone. </p>
<p> At $1,399, you are getting what you pay for here, which is a whole lot of smartphone. And this is also a pretty heavy one, so you'll want to take that into account before you pick one up. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Smartphone </p>
<p> ASUS ROG Phone III </p>
<p> The ASUS ROG Phone III isn't yet available to buy in the US, but it will be soon. So only the Chinese version is available without a warranty. So do keep that in mind here. </p>
<p> The ROG Phone III is by far the best gaming smartphone available. It kept that huge 6000mAh capacity battery, which will keep you gaming for hours. It also sports a 6.59-inch FHD+ display that has a 120Hz refresh rate. It's powered by the Snapdragon 865+ chipset, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. There are models that go up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage as well. </p>
<p> This is a monster of a phone, which is what makes it great for gaming. And that battery is going to last all day and then some. Even with some heavy gaming. </p>
<p> Best smartphone with stock Android </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 6 </p>
<p> You might be a bit surprised that ASUS is the one with the best stock Android experience. Given, a few years ago ASUS had a pretty heavy skin on their smartphones. But starting with the ZenFone 6, ASUS started going fully stock Android. It removed a lot of its own pre-installed apps, and ones it kept, it redesigned to match the design of Android 10. Making it look and feel really good. </p>
<p> On top of it having stock Android, the ASUS ZenFone 6 is a really powerful device for the money. It sports a 6.4-inch Full HD+ display, with the Snapdragon 855 chipset, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It also has a pretty sizeable 5000mAh capacity battery that should get you through the day and then some. </p>
<p> You might have noticed that the front of the ZenFone 6 doesn't have a camera. And that's because technically, there is no front-facing camera. Instead, the rear camera will pop up and take care of any selfie needs. And that's a 48-megapixel camera sensor, that also has a 13-megapixel ultrawide lens accompanying it. </p>
<p> All of this for just $549 might sound pretty insane, and that's because it kind of is, but that's why this is such a great value. </p>
<p> Best Flagship Value </p>
<p> OnePlus 8 </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 is our flagship value pick now, since it offers basically everything that every other smartphone on this list does, but at a much cheaper price. Starting at just $699. Considering most other smartphones here are around$999, that's a really good deal. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8 sports a 6.55-inch FHD+ OLED display, with a hole punch for the camera. Inside, you'll find the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chipset, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. For another $100, you can up that to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. </p>
<p> It is unlocked and will work on AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon in the US. Both T-Mobile and Verizon are selling the device too, and if you want Verizon 5G, you'll need to buy it from Verizon. </p>
<p> Best smartphone with a stylus </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ </p>
<p> There aren't many smartphones available with stylus', so it really comes down to the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+. We ended up going with the standard Note 10 here, because it is cheaper and still has all of the same flagship features as the Galaxy Note 10+. Which we have listed at the top of our best Android smartphones right now. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Note 10 also has a smaller display. That's a thing that many people have been asking Samsung for, for many years now. It's a 6.3-inch full HD+ display. And it is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. There is no micro SD card slot available though. All powered by a pretty hefty 3500mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> The S Pen is available on the Galaxy Note 10. Allowing you to write and draw, and of course do some air gestures. Which can be very useful for swiping through photos or controlling a Powerpoint presentation. </p>
<p> Galaxy Note 10 is a really good phone, not just in the "Best Stylus" category either. And if you're looking for a new phone, this is a good option. </p>
<p> Best foldable smartphone </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5G </p>
<p> For August, we are replacing the Galaxy Z Flip with the Galaxy Z Flip 5G. </p>
<p> The phone is basically the same as the non-5G model, but with a newer chipset. Inside, you'll find the Snapdragon 865+ chipset. Which is a big upgrade over the Snapdragon 855 found in the original Galaxy Z Flip. </p>
<p> Samsung also outfitted it with a newer paint job. So instead of it being glossy and a fingerprint magnet, it is now more of a matte finish. </p>
<p> It's the best foldable phone on the market, at least until the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is officially announced on September 1. </p>

<p> Best Android Smartphones – April 2019 </p>
<p> The old adage of “April showers” certainly holds true for the world of smartphones this month, as April 2019 is refreshing the top 10 list in a big way. 4 out of the 10 phones on this list are brand new to the market and represent fantastic refreshes of the previous year’s phones. There’s something for everyone here, so be sure to check out the entire list before making the decision as to what your next phone will be! </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Fold </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Foldable phones are the latest smartphone craze, and while they’re on the very edge of cutting-edge, Samsung isn’t wasting any time with its launch of the Galaxy Fold. Announced back in February and teased several times before that, Samsung Galaxy Fold is considered to be the first true foldable phone since it has a single large screen that can be unfolded to enhance your viewing experience. </p>
<p> Samsung’s design differs from other “foldables” that have already been launched by offering up a single, large foldable screen inside a dual-frame chassis complete with 6 cameras in total. A smaller screen is included on the outside for using the phone while it’s folded up, and the App Continuity feature ensures that moving from the smaller to the larger screen is a cohesive experience for supported apps. </p>
<p> There’s no denying that the $2,000 price tag of the Galaxy Fold is going to shut more than a few users out of this revolutionary experience and, to further complicate matters, this is a limited edition phone anyway, so Samsung is only producing a certain amount of units. The initial batch of pre-orders are sold out but it’s highly likely that Samsung will enter a second round of production to meet demand. If you want to be on the bleeding edge of tech, there’s simply no better place to find it than on the Galaxy Fold. </p>
<p> A family of phones that’s far more in reach, both in availability and in budget, is Samsung’s Galaxy S10 line. This year, Samsung has launched 3 phones to fit a wide variety of budgets and preferences. The Galaxy S10+ is the largest of the three, with the Galaxy S10 sitting in the middle, and the Galaxy S10e residing on the smallest end of the chart. </p>
<p> All of these phones deliver an identical software experience but differ in price and hardware specifications. Shared among all three sizes is the new punch-hole camera up front, which places a camera in a literal hole cut out of the brilliant OLED display. You’ll also find the incredible new Samsung OneUI, built atop Android 9 Pie, powers the experience on all phones, sporting levels of customization and features that no other OEM can top. All three phones also have a brand new ultra-wide 123-degree angle camera on back alongside the standard camera as well, giving users a wider view of the world than any other range of phones available. </p>
<p> What’s different between these three devices? The Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ feature a telephoto camera in addition to that ultra-wide angle one, and both of these phones have a significantly higher resolution screen than the Galaxy S10e as well. There’s no denying that the side-mounted fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S10e is a superior design to the in-glass ultrasonic fingerprint scanner on the other two devices though, which makes choosing between these phones more difficult than a simple price-to-size equation. </p>

<p> LG G8 ThinQ </p>
<p> https://youtu.be/O3vWU4Pl7UQ </p>
<p> LG’s G-series of phones has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride over the years, but 2019’s G8 ThinQ is back on the upswing with some fantastic new features. Chief of the improvements is the Crystal Sound OLED display, which isn’t just the first OLED display on a G-series device from LG, it’s also the first time we’re seeing stereo speakers on an LG flagship phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sound comes straight from the display itself, a new technology LG debuted with its OLED line of premium TVs, as well as the bottom-firing single speaker and the fantastic Boombox speaker on back. This, paired with the DTS:X virtual surround sound on the phone makes for some incredible audio fidelity without need for headphones or external speakers. </p>
<p> Folks wanting the absolute best audio experience need to look no further than the amazing quad-DAC system, available by plugging your headphones or external audio system into the 3.5mm audio jack on the bottom of the phone. LG’s range of sound and the overall fidelity of the audio that comes from this port is simply unparalleled. </p>
<p> Lastly is the new TOF camera on front. This depth-sensing 3D camera enables some interesting gestures that need a bit of work, but LG’s Hand ID technology, complete with proper secure facial recognition means that the brevity of ways to biometrically secure your phone aren’t just locked into fingerprint recognition. This new TOF camera also helps the front-facing camera take the best selfies we’ve ever seen from an LG phone, and puts the G8 at the top of the charts for best selfie cameras on the market right now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There’s some killer deals for the G8 through various US carriers right now too, so hit up the link below to see the best prices for the phone and where you could score a price that’s almost too good to be true. </p>
<p> Huawei has been churning out quality flagship titles every 6 months, and right on queue is the Huawe P30 family. It took some years before Huawei caught up to the best in the smartphone camera business, but 2018’s P20 Pro finally surpassed that mark, and 2019’s P30 family looks to continue that pedigree. Following up with the Fall’s fantastic Mate 20 Pro’s introduction of an ultra-wide angle camera that also doubles as a super-macro camera comes the introduction of a periscope zoom camera on the P30 Pro. </p>
<p> This new 5x optical zoom camera seems to break all conception of physics in smartphone photography as we knew it, enabling up to 10x hybrid zoom and 50x digital zoom for an unbelievable experience that you simply cannot get anywhere else. Both phones ship with a 40-megapixel rear camera but the P30 Pro, once again, has the better setup with an improved f-stop rating and the ability to raise that ISO up to an insane 409,600. </p>
<p> This bests even its own record, set on the Mate 20 Pro, and gives the P30 Pro the crown of low light champion by several leagues. There’s more to it than camera prowess, for sure, but it’s clear that Huawei has found its niche in the photography realm and is willing to go all-in to make sure it doesn’t lose that title any time soon. It’s also actually available in the US as well, which might be a shocker to many throughout the globe that have been following tech headlines. </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s Mi series started the “cheaper is better” hardware craze many years ago, and Xiaomi is still offering more bang for the buck than most other OEMs on the market. The Mi9 is a driving force of several new technologies, one of which is super-fast wireless charging, all without driving up the expected price of the phone. </p>
<p> At under $500 there’s no mistaking this for the ultimate blend of premium and budget, especially considering you’d never peg this phone for a budget model by any definition. Sporting the latest in mobile processing tech, plenty of RAM, a beautiful screen, build and design, and the latest MIUI 10 OS that throws everything and the kitchen sink into the mix without confusing users with overwhelming design. </p>
<p> It’s more practical than the Mi MIX 3, another excellent phone by Xiaomi, and improves upon that phone in several ways as well. Xiaomi fans will be more than happy with what’s available here, and folks looking for an equally excellent, if not better experience than those other names don’t need to look further or spend more money. This is the “everyman's phone” without a doubt. </p>
<p> HONOR View20 </p>
<p> https://youtu.be/-yKLN4ZkX4E </p>
<p> HONOR was the first to market with a punch-hole style camera on the front of its latest phone, but that wasn’t the only headline-making reason for this phone to exist. HONOR has been the king of value for quite some time now, and while the View20 doesn’t represent their least expensive phone, it does hold the title of best camera on an affordably-priced phone. </p>
<p> Despite a relatively affordable price, the HONOR View20 sports an impressive 48-megapixel camera, which is the first of its kind in a new camera sensor generation. It’s also got Huawei’s latest and greatest HiSilicon Kirin 980 SoC, which is not only capable of some pretty fantastic processing power but also packs in dual Neural Processing Units (NPU) to help enhance photography and videography alike. </p>
<p> A sizable battery sits inside and will net most users an easy 2-day battery life, something that most flagship phones could only dream of. A super unique texture and pattern exist on the back of every available color of View20, and the Magic UI 2.0 that’s based on Android 9 Pie will deliver just as solid of an experience as the hardware. Looking for excellent photography and videography without breaking the bank? You’ve come to the right place. </p>
<p> OnePlus has never been one to shy away from controversy, and while we’re seemingly on the heels of a new product announcement from the company, the OnePlus 6T remains one of the best values you can find in the smartphone world. This especially holds true in the US, where carrier T-Mobile officially carries and promotes the phone with excellent pricing and promotions. </p>
<p> At around half the price of the Samsung Galaxy S10, and with a far superior in-display fingerprint reader, the OnePlus 6T delivers quick performance, lots of features, and an impressively beautiful build, all without the high price of the competition. You’ll notably miss some extra features like waterproofing or wireless charging, but some users might be OK with the lack of support in these areas. </p>
<p> OnePlus has quickly become one of the best OEMs for regular updates too, a huge turnaround for a company that was once in the running for worst post-purchase support on the market. OnePlus’s rise from small OPPO spin-off to massive worldwide manufacturer is part of this improvement in customer service, and its goals to dominate a specific segment of the market seem closer to being within grasp than ever. </p>
<p> For a time, Sony was behind the curve for design aesthetics and camera performance. With the Xperia XZ2 and XZ3, that all changed for the better, and the Xperia XZ3 represents the finest flagship Sony has made thus far. Sporting a gorgeous new design, including a curved OLED screen for the first time on a Sony flagship, the Xperia XZ3 is gorgeous to look at from any angle. </p>
<p> It’s also got those phenomenal front-facing stereo speakers that Sony is so well known for, and that unique dynamic vibration system that makes the vibration motors in the phone behave more like a subwoofer when you’re watching shows and movies. That slightly modified Android 9 Pie build sports better multitasking than stock Pie does, in addition to offering a number of value-added features that don’t muddy up the experience. </p>
<p> LG’s flagships have improved significantly over the past few years, and there’s little better example of that than the LG V40. It’s been 6 months since the phone launched and it still feels like a brand new device, with snappy performance, a uniquely gorgeous design and build, and a manual camera experience that’ll make any fledgling content creator happy. </p>
<p> It’s this manual camera experience that sits at the core of what makes the LG V40 such a fantastic phone. We’ve been using the LG V30 and V40 since their releases for filming content on our YouTube channel, and the experience has been nothing short of stellar. </p>
<p> You don’t need to be a content creator in order to appreciate what LG has built here though. A stunning OLED display complete with the best vibration motors in the business make for an experience that’s excellent all around, and LG’s snappy and convenient software experience makes sure the experience doesn’t degrade over time. </p>
<p> Waiting for that Android 9 Pie update has been long in the tooth though, so while the experience is a solid one, LG doesn’t appear to have prioritized the update schedule for its latest flagships. If frequent updates are a requirement, this phone probably won’t make you happy, but if a solid experience that offers quite a bit more than stock Android if your gig, this could be the phone for you. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Note 9 </p>
<p> https://youtu.be/5gi4wtUbuWc </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 was our 2018 Phone of the Year for a reason. Samsung threw everything and the kitchen sink at their most expensive flagship phone for a year, and the experience reflected that in every way. The Galaxy Note 9 represents everything that’s excellent about mobile computing including an amazing display, phenomenal speakers, a range of audio output options, great software updates, tons of useful features, a wide range of customization options and, of course, the S-Pen. </p>
<p> The S-Pen has been the defining piece of the Note series since its inception, and the S-Pen is better than ever on the Galaxy Note 9. While it looks the same on the outside, there’s a brand new Bluetooth radio on the inside that provides new ways of launching and interacting with content on screen than ever before. Use it as a remote shutter button for the camera, or as a way to quickly launch your favorite note-taking app, among a swath of other options. </p>
<p> We’ve been quick to highlight Samsung’s Good Lock app in our recent reviews of Samsung flagships, and it’s on the Galaxy Note 9 that the rebirth of Good Lock appeared. This oddly named app brings about the most customizable experience on any smartphone in the world and allows users to truly make their Galaxy Note 9 a unique looking and operating device. Want the phone that does it all? That’s the Galaxy Note 9. </p>

<p> Best Android Smartphones – March 2019 </p>
<p> Nokia’s comeback as an Android vendor has been a bit of a slow rollout, but 2019 is ready to deliver one of the most anticipated flagship devices in recent memory: the Nokia 9 PureView. Rumored for months and dreamed about for years, Nokia’s legendary mobile photography skills have been put to the test and have generated one of the most interesting concepts in mobile photography that we’ve ever seen. A 5-camera array sits on back, providing a uniquely detailed and color-accurate view of the world, touting the ability to create significantly more accurate “bokeh” effects as well as the ability to refocus the entire scene after taking a picture. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At a special $599 price the Nokia 9 PureView represents the most advanced mix of computational photography and hardware prowess in the industry, and there’s plenty of processing power left over for every day tasks too. It’s also part of the Android One ecosystem which means that it gets all the latest updates as soon as they’re available from Google. Nokia’s support of its Android One-powered phones over the years has been phenomenal, to say the least, and they’re still providing major OS upgrades for phones that are several years old without delay. Looking for an affordable, pure Android experience with one of the best cameras in the business? Look no further but be sure to act quick, as this is a limited edition phone. </p>
<p> There’s no doubt that camera technology has been a huge selling point of phones lately, somehow even more so than years past, but there have been some significant technological achievements to create this extra buzz. The HONOR View20 is the first phone to launch with Sony’s latest generation IMX586 sensor, the first 48-megapixel camera sensor ever equipped on a smartphone. This, combined with HONOR’s truly excellent camera software and image processing makes the View20 one of the very best cameras you can buy, especially when considering the price of the View20. </p>
<p> At $499, the HONOR View20 undercuts most flagship phones by selling at half the cost, all while delivering an identical (or better) camera experience and even packing Huawei’s latest-generation flagship SoC, the Kirin 980. It also ships with a heavily modified version of Android 9 Pie, dubbed MagicUI 2, and bears a striking resemblance to Huawei’s EMUI 9. HONOR has created a design that’s incredibly attractive, including unique colors and a pattern that catches the eye immediately. The HONOR View20 isn’t just a great value, it’s also an unmatched camera experience at the price. </p>
<p> As a brand, Razer has long been a staple for gamers that want both style and performance. This DNA has been brought over to Razer’s second generation Android-powered smartphone, which features all the performance you want, coupled with that glowing RGB style that you know and love. Razer just dropped the Android 9 Pie update, as well as a huge drop in the price. Retailing for $499 for the month of March, the Razer Phone 2 is an easy recommendation for folks who want a snappy OS, liquid smooth 120Hz screen, the loudest stereo front-facing speakers on any phone, and some notable enhancements for mobile gaming. </p>
<p> Sony’s mobile division is known for pumping out many similar-looking flagship devices several times per year, but the past few releases have curbed this idea for a more dramatic approach. The Sony Xperia XZ3 represented a big shift in design language from past Xperia flagships, including the inclusion of Sony’s first-ever OLED panel on a smartphone, as well as the company’s first curved display. This without detracting from any of what made the Xperia XZ2 incredible, such as stereo front-facing speakers and an amazing selfie camera, all while shrinking bezels and slimming down the build. </p>
<p> The rear camera is no slouch either, and while it’s not quite as impressive in every situation as some other smartphones, Sony’s got plenty of tricks up its sleeve. 4K HDR video recording is something that only LG offers on the V40, while Sony now has two flagship phones with this ability. It’s also got the best super slow-motion video recording in the business and a unique way of predicting when a picture needs to be captured, offering ways to select the best picture taken from an automated burst. Our review below will fill you in on all the details if you’re interested in Sony’s latest. </p>
<p> LG’s V-series has earned a name for itself in many ways, and the V40 ThinQ has caught plenty of attention since its launch back in the Fall of 2018. Since then the phone has seen a handful of updates that addressed a few issues at launch, including the addition of a bunch of new features specifically related to the camera experience. As is the case with many flagship phones, the LG V40 ThinQ places a heavy emphasis on the camera experience, but LG does it a little differently by offering up a more versatile camera experience than most OEMs could dream of having on their phones. </p>
<p> 3 cameras on back and 2 cameras on front, all offering a wide range of focal lengths and manual settings controls for each and every one. These manual settings aren’t just for pictures either, they’re also for video, which is something no other smartphone line on the market does. It’s also got the highest quality audio output on any smartphone, with a quad-DAC that reduces white noise and provides a significant increase in overall quality and balance when compared to other phones. Check out the links below to find out more, particularly our reviews for LG’s latest. </p>
<p> OnePlus’s ascent in the market is nothing short of extraordinary, coming from an invite-only smartphone OEM to one of the largest OEMs in quite a few parts of the world. With the OnePlus 6T the company officially expanded to the US, thanks to T-Mobile, and can now be bought in any T-Mobile store as well as the usual online retailers. The OnePlus 6T represents one of the best values in the smartphone industry, which is something OnePlus has been doing since its original OnePlus One smartphone. Offering one of the fastest experiences on any Android phone, the OnePlus line is also marked by an excellent update schedule that’s faster than most other OEMs, all while continually offering meaningful feature updates and additions over the years. </p>
<p> Huawei’s Mate 20 Pro heralded in the era of reverse wireless charging and brought a gorgeous curved OLED screen, an in-glass fingerprint scanner and a sleek curved body design to Huawei’s already incredible line of flagship devices. The Mate 20 Pro packs an award-winning triple camera system around back, making this the single best smartphone photography experience on the market without a doubt. This system provides a brand new ultra wide-angle camera around back, which doubles as a super macro camera, as well as a 5x optical zoom telephoto lens too. Be sure to check out our in-depth camera review below to find out why it’s such a great experience and why Huawei’s phones have been so lauded for their abilities. </p>
<p> Much like the other phones on our list that primarily focus on the camera, the rest of the experience isn’t lacking in any way. A full-featured EMUI 9 OS that’s built upon Android 9 Pie powers the experience alongside a huge 4,000mAh battery which reliably delivers 2-day battery life for the average user. It’s also got a super-fast Kirin 980 SoC and plenty of RAM to keep the experience smooth without compromising on everything else. Aside from the price being a deterring factor, it’s nearly impossible not to recommend Huawei’s latest, especially if taking photos is an important part of your life. </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s Mi MIX line has been incredibly innovative from the beginning, launching the whole “no bezel” craze back in 2016 when the original Mi MIX launched. Since then we’ve seen a further reduction in bezels, specifically with the Mi MIX 3 which has virtually no bezel around the entire phone. This is achieved by using a sliding mechanism to reveal the front-facing cameras, which are hidden behind the screen normally, and makes for not only an interesting phone, but a beautiful one too. To further enhance this look, Xiaomi has kept the ceramic build across all three generations of Mi MIX phones, giving the MIX 3 a unique look and feel when compared to other smartphones. </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s own MIUI 10 is a brilliant OS that’s build upon Android 9 Pie and brings about some significant visual and navigational changes from Google’s own. The Overview/Recents screen, for instance, looks completely different from stock Android which, in this case, is a very good thing since it not only allows for more information on the screen at once, but also makes multitasking a far easier and quicker process. Couple this with fantastic battery life, the best camera Xiaomi has ever put on a smartphone, and frequent updates on a regular schedule and you’ve got a phone that’s well worth taking a look at. Oh, and don’t forget the price, which is regularly half the price of similarly specced flagships from companies like Samsung or LG. </p>
<p> Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 may have launched before every other phone on this list, but that just goes to show how much of a powerhouse phone it was back in early Fall 2018. Samsung held nothing back with the Note 9 and it feels just as good today as it did over half a year ago. Sure, it seems ridiculous to think that half a year sounds old for a product, but given the rate of change in the smartphone industry, 6 months can be a very long time in making a product look or feel old. That said, the Galaxy Note 9 remains the single most well-rounded device on the list, especially at the reduced prices you can find it for across the globe. </p>
<p> What makes the Galaxy Note 9 so good? Everything, really. There’s no real shortcomings to the Note 9 as a product that’s purpose-built to fulfill every need you could have for a smartphone. Industry-leading display, fantastic audio output quality, a 3.5mm audio jack with great audio reproduction, huge battery with full-day battery life, wireless charging, IP68 water and dust resistance. Basically, you name it, the Note 9 probably has it, and the venerable S-Pen was an industry-changing idea when it launched and remains the best built-in stylus on any device. Need a phone that does it all and does all of that very well? The Note 9 is a perfect choice. </p>
<p> Samsung is changing things up in big ways with the Galaxy S10 family, which now comes in four different sizes and prices. Available this month are the Galaxy S10e, Galaxy S10, and the Galaxy S10+. Two of these devices are nearly identical aside from size, while the Galaxy S10e packs similar components in a smaller, less expensive package. The experience is largely the same, no matter which model you pick, and the choice in the end revolves around how capable you need your smartphone to be on a daily basis. All three have brilliant screens, big batteries, fast processors and plenty of RAM, and the S10e even changes out that curved display for a flat one, giving users a choice if they don’t like curved displays. </p>
<p> The biggest differences will be found in the camera experience, where the Galaxy S10 and S10+ both feature three cameras around back, while the S10e only features two. These cameras brings about the widest focal length on any Galaxy series phone to date, and the widest ultra-wide angle camera on any smartphone as well. It’s not just about cameras though, as OneUI brings a fresh new look to Samsung’s software experience, as well as a brand new ultrasonic in-glass fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S10 and S10+. That fourth model, the Galaxy S10 5G, won’t be available for a while yet, but when it launches it’ll bring about a faster wireless experience and even more premium features than the already top-specced Galaxy S10+. Take a look at all your options below to see what fits best for you, but know that whichever you choose, it’s likely the very best experience you’ll find on an Android-powered device without fail. </p>

<p> Best Android Smartphones – May 2019 </p>
<p> May is bringing about more than just Spring flowers, it’s also changing up the list of must-have Android phones and adding in something we don’t normally see on this list: a mid-range device. Typically, the best-of-the-best is relegated to the most expensive devices around, but there are plenty of reasons why this isn’t always the case. Find out why in our list of the very best Android phones to buy in May 2019! </p>
<p> Google Pixel 3a </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We’ve shied away from including Google’s Pixel 3 family on our top 10 list since launch because, well, the phone has been plagued with bugs and problems from the start. Google has a chance to start over with its promise of delivering a true, solid pure Android experience with the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. </p>
<p> These phones offer the same everyday experience as the Pixel 3, seemingly minus the bugs, for half the price. </p>
<p> Starting at $399, the Pixel 3a, surprisingly, delivers an identical camera experience to the more expensive Pixel 3. This even includes the amazing Night Sight mode, which means the Pixel 3a is by far the best camera experience you’ll probably ever find on a phone in this price category. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Everything else, from the OLED display to the fingerprint scanner, stereo speakers and the quick delivery of updates, is right on par with many flagship phones without spending all the extra money on the experience. Simply put, if you want an excellent camera but don’t need all the bells and whistles that higher price tags bring, this is the phone to get. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 7 Pro marks the absolute most expensive phone that OnePlus has created by quite a wide margin. At well over $100 more than last year's OnePlus 6T, itself the most expensive phone OnePlus has ever made, the OnePlus 7 Pro can no longer hold fast to the title of "Flagship Killer", as it is now a full-fledged flagship in its own right. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What makes the OnePlus 7 Pro worth it when compared to every other phone on this list? Value and speed. While it's nowhere near as affordable as previous generations of phones from OnePlus, the OnePlus 7 ups the ante in many ways, including a pop-up selfie camera as well as a triple camera system around back. </p>
<p> In addition to that, OnePlus is sticking with its mantra of offering more speed than the competition by providing a 90Hz OLED display on the front, capable of delivering 50% higher framerates than the vast majority of other phones on the market, including every other phone on this list (all of which have screens that run at 60Hz). This means the phone feels buttery smooth in every app and game, and the new higher resolution panel means it looks better doing it too. </p>
<p> T-Mobile is selling only the higher spec model in the US, coming in at $699, while OnePlus's website will be selling all versions of the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro on its website. </p>
<p> Samsung’s Galaxy S10 is the most feature-rich, well-rounded set of phones on the market, bar none. There’s little the Galaxy S10 family does wrong, all four phones the lineup as a matter of fact, and it’s far harder to find negative points about the phone than it is to find good ones. </p>
<p> We’ve highlighted our ‘Good Review’ here specifically because this phone line offers so much good in so sleek a package. Sporting a brand new design that features less bezel than ever and just a small camera cutout in the display, the Galaxy S10’s build and design looks and feels better than any Samsung device before it. </p>
<p> All four models offer the very first ultra-wide angle camera on any Samsung device, which rounds out the camera experience to provide an incredibly versatile experience no matter what size Galaxy S10 you choose. It’s not just about camera improvements though, as OneUI delivers the most solid software experience to ever grace a Samsung phone, including some impressive tie-ins with third-party software as well. Outside of sheer price, it’s difficult to find a reason not to recommend the Samsung Galaxy S10 this Spring. </p>
<p> Huawei’s phones of late have all been focused on delivering a world-class camera experience, and for good reason. Huawei has gotten exceedingly good at creating smartphones designed around bringing a professional feel to the average user’s daily events. </p>
<p> Huawei’s unmatched fusion of camera software and hardware has reached a new height with the P30 Pro, which features the industry’s first 10x hybrid zoom and can digitally zoom up to 50x. That’s not a typo, the camera really is that stellar, and it’s not just zooming that’s this great either. </p>
<p> Huawei has kept the ultra-wide angle lens from the Mate 20 Pro, complete with autofocus and super-macro mode, in addition to the ultra-high detail 40MP main sensor too. It’s a camera experience like no other, and something to seriously take into consideration if you care about cameras at all. </p>
<p> The bonus? You can actually order one if you live in the US as well, contrary to what headlines might make you think about the state of Huawei products in the country. </p>
<p> LG’s 8th generation flagship has gotten a lot of grief around the web, and for little reason when you boil the reasons down. To start things off, the G8 packs a brand-new crystal sound OLED, which adds stereo speakers to an LG flagship for the first time. This, in addition to the award-winning audio output via the 3.5mm jack at the bottom, creates the absolute best combination of sound experiences you’ll find on any modern flagship, even if you’re not an audiophile. </p>
<p> LG’s modified design also features a larger battery in addition to removing the camera hump; something many users and critics alike have pined about for years. Then, there’s the addition of a third camera for most regions, which adds in a telephoto lens that complements the already excellent ultra-wide angle one that other LG flagships have been shipping with for years. </p>
<p> LG’s vision of Android 9 Pie includes more customization than Google’s version, as well as one of the absolute best camera interfaces on the market. Anyone who’s even remotely interested in starting their own YouTube channel, or just filming excellent everyday content with more manual controls than any other flagship offers should seriously consider LG’s latest, which can features manual video controls up to 240FPS at 1080p resolution. </p>
<p> While the OnePlus 7 Series was just announced, it marks the most expensive pair of phones OnePlus has ever launched. The OnePlus 6T, conversely, can be found for significantly less and offers an incredible experience that's still blazing fast, no matter what you do with it. It’s not quite as inexpensive as the Google Pixel 3a but it offers a significantly faster experience than that phone, including more RAM and storage.. </p>
<p> OnePlus has had a stellar update schedule lately, including fast updates to the latest versions of Android without all those nasty bugs that regularly come with early-release software. It also regularly claims the title of fastest phones in the land with every new release, something that’s not easily overtaken even by newer generations of phones. </p>
<p> OnePlus was among the first manufacturers to debut a phone with an in-glass fingerprint scanner, and while it’s not quite as fast as a dedicated fingerprint scanner, it opens up a new gesture system to quick-launch apps without needing to even raise your thumb. </p>
<p> HONOR has been in the mindset of many when it comes to good, inexpensive phones, but not often in the minds of those looking for a phone that also has a great camera. That all changed with the HONOR View20, a phone that packed in a brand new generation 48-megapixel Sony sensor that does it all. It’s not often that a single-camera can rival the experience of phones with multiple cameras, but this phone certainly can. </p>
<p> The View20 sports the very same processor and nearly identical operating system as the Huawei P30 series, yet it costs quite a bit less money. Part of this is the reduction in camera quantity, while the other is a less impressive LCD display, but it all ends in a similar experience without having to save up all that extra dough. </p>
<p> It’s an excellent fusion of speed, where the View20 sits side-by-side with every other flagship on the market, and quality optics and camera software, in addition to running the latest version of Android as well. Looking for a fantastic mid-ranger with a particular focus on camera and speed? Here it is. </p>
<p> While the Pixel 3a is the only actual mid-range specced device on this list, the Xiaomi Mi9 is only priced like one. Keeping with its mantra of providing excellent phones at rock-bottom prices, Xiaomi’s latest continues to impress in every regard, especially the price. </p>
<p> At around $400, the Xiaomi Mi9 is the same price as the Google Pixel 3a, yet it packs in a significantly faster processor, more RAM, more storage, more cameras, a higher quality design and build, and more features than any Pixel phone will likely ever have. </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s MIUI 10 is arguably the best OEM skin on the market too, one that’s updated consistently with new features and security patches, as well as significant design enhancements over stock Android. It’s an incredibly fast, light-feeling and yet somehow feature-rich version of Android that just looks and feels great. </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s hardware never fails to deliver either, and everything from the super-fast wireless charging to the fantastic camera experience delivers well beyond what anyone would expect at $400 and meets expectations with phones several hundred dollars more expensive. Xiaomi has delivered unprecedented bang-for-your-buck for a long time now, and the Mi9 continues that pedigree. </p>
<p> LG V40 ThinQ </p>
<p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55QKFXIYBpI </p>
<p> While the LG G8 is available and offers much of the same functionality, not all regions received the model with three cameras. For those regions, particularly the US, the LG V40 ThinQ is still an excellent way to experience some of the best LG has ever made. This includes a similar build and design to the G8, the same amazing vibration motors, high quality OLED screen and fantastic overall performance. </p>
<p> The V40 is likely an easier buy for some as it’s been heavily discounted at a number of carriers and may be an even more attractive offer than the G8 if price is a main concern. </p>
<p> The biggest draw of LG’s flagships continues to be the manual photo and video modes in its camera software which enables DSLR-level control over the image quality. While some phones offer some manual controls over photo modes, no one else offers this same functionality in video mode, and that’s really where LG shines. We’ve been using the LG V-series on our YouTube channel since 2017 as a main camera, and it continues to be a joy to use every time. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Note 9 </p>
<p> https://youtu.be/5gi4wtUbuWc </p>
<p> The Galaxy S10 might be the latest Samsung flagship, but there’s nothing that’s quite like a Galaxy Note phone to deliver the complete experience. The Galaxy Note 9 was the complete package in 2018, garnering our award for phone of the year (the first time a Samsung phone has won that in some time). There were many, many reasons for this, but mainly because the phone wasn’t lacking in any real areas. </p>
<p> Folks that don’t want a notch or punch-hole in their display will be happy with the small bezels on the Note 9, which aren’t quite as tiny as the Galaxy S10, but also don’t feature any portions of the display removed. Aside from this fairly minor cosmetic difference, the Galaxy Note 9 features the veritable S-Pen, a tool that millions of consumers have used and loved for years, and one that sets the Galaxy Note series apart from every other phone on the market. </p>
<p> The S-Pen is more than just a simple stylus. It’s powered by a Wacom digitizer that’s completely separate from the touch digitizer that recognizes your fingers, meaning inputs from your fingers register as completely separate from the S-Pen itself. This makes the Note 9 the best note-taking and doodle-making machine around, something that’s especially helpful if you’re someone who regularly finds themselves taking notes or jotting down ideas throughout the day. </p>
<p> Want the phone that does it all? The Note 9 still qualifies as the phone that does everything you need and likely more. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Value Smartphones – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> The world of the high-value cheap android smartphones continues its relentless push forward with the launch of new flagships but not everybody either wants or can afford to spend an exorbitant amount of money on their next smartphone. </p>
<p> The reality is that there’s no real reason to spend the cost of a new computer or a used car on a smartphone either. Most smartphones above a certain price and value point will more than meet the needs of most users. The majority of those will be replaced by users with a new gadget within just a few years' time. </p>
<p> Fortunately, the technology keeps moving forward too, whittling away at the contrasts between a ‘premium’ device and a ‘budget’ device. That shift offers potential buyers a bit more flexibility when it comes to brands and models. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Budget Smartphones 2020 Summary </p>
<p> But not all high-value Android smartphones are quite up to par and some could legitimately be described as 'cheap' in the pejorative sense. There are still plenty of differences and caveats to consider for those looking for a great experience that suits their individual needs. Given the sheer number of OEMs and devices to consider, choosing one can be a daunting task. Here at Android Headlines, we do a lot of research and reviews to help make the decision easier. </p>
<p> That doesn't mean that every device that deserves placement here is going to have earned it. Device evaluations are subjective and there are dozens upon dozens of devices to select from. A significant portion of those may suit any single user's needs as well as the phones listed here. </p>
<p> With that in mind, here’s our take on the top devices available to buy now. Each offers a great value to users that we feel surpasses all others without breaking the bank. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Below the summary, you'll find a slightly longer description of each item along with the where to buy links. </p>
<p> Best world-ready cheap Android smartphone </p>
<p> Realme 6 Pro </p>
<p> Price: From $339.95 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> The Realme 6 Pro may be designed for use in India, first and foremost, but it works in the US. So it likely works in quite a few other regions — although network bands should be checked first. And it's easily among the best cheap Android smartphones on the market at below $350. In fact, it can often be found for purchase for under $250 despite packing in some of the best features in any smartphone under $600. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A lot of what makes this Realme device great stems from a decision to launch a brand new Realme UI OS overlay. That operates almost as smoothly as stock Android and leaves behind the majority of the bloatware found in some other handsets. It's also well-optimized for gaming at a level that's comparable to top-tier mid-rangers. However, that's hardly the entire story. </p>
<p> Realme settled on a 6.6-inch FHD+ display panel with a 90Hz refresh rate, to begin with. It also determined that a Snapdragon 720G would be the best SoC. Backing that, the company includes configurations with either 6GB or 8GB LPDDR4x RAM. Storage weighs in at a healthy 64GB or 128GB. Behind that, there's a 4300mAh capacity battery that's capable of keeping the screen going for well over 8-hours. </p>
<p> Dolby Atmos support, 30W VOOC charging, a dedicated gaming mode, and respectable cameras round out the package, making this a high-value smartphone that's well worth consideration. Realme sells this handset in Lightning Blue or Lightning Orange. </p>
<p> Best cheap smartphone for gamers </p>
<p> Poco F2 Pro </p>
<p> Price: From $524 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> The Poco F2 Pro is arguably the most budget-friendly flagship around, packing up to 8GB LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. That's sitting behind a Snapdragon 865 flagship SoC. The 4,700mAh battery also lasts over 9 hours on a single charge and charges up in just over an hour. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But this is also a gaming handset with a 6.67-inch Super AMOLED HDR+ display panel — setting aside the lower-than-expected 60Hz refresh rate. The company utilized a pop-out camera and razor-thin bezels to ensure that screen is all users really see while gaming. And there are plenty of extra features under Settings to improve visual quality and touch accuracy too. </p>
<p> Now, Poco additionally packed in Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6 to make connections as solid as the internal components. And, thanks to advanced cooling, this phone never really heats up under pressure. The cameras are well beyond acceptable, as is sound quality — despite relying on a single bottom-firing speaker. A 3.5mm audio jack is part of the build so that headphones can be used if that's more desirable. </p>
<p> There's plenty of customizations in terms of LED notification lighting, theming, and the LEDs surrounding the front camera too. </p>

<p> But the real kicker for this device is its price. While not among the most affordable Android smartphones overall, it is comparatively cheap for its class. Available in Neon Blue, Phantom White, Electric Purple, or Cyber Gray, this handset only costs between €499 and €599 — roughly $561 to $673 brand new. That places it, despite its flagship underpinnings and gaming focus, at around half the cost of a top-tier device from Samsung or others. </p>

<p> Sony Xperia 10/Xperia 10 Plus </p>
<p> Price: From $257.99 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Those who want the best of what Sony can offer can pick up the relatively cheap — among any Android smartphones — Xperia 10 priced as low as just $257.99. That makes it a real bargain that's going to be hard to match. For a bit more, at just a few pennies shy of $279, the Xperia 10 Plus takes things a bit further. One of the things that make the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus so unique is its form factor. </p>
<p> At a ratio of 21:9 and either 6-inches or 6.5-inches, the Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus from Sony pack in an FHD+ display. That drives Android 10, bringing the latest software and innovations from Google to users. </p>
<p> But the real selling point is that this is the first phone that brought all of Sony's various hardware divisions together. So the screen is among the most cinematically accurate in terms of color on the market. Audio features DSEE HX and LDAC encoding, added by Sony’s audio division. </p>
<p> The cameras are similarly geared toward the top end. The company included a dual-lens 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel primary snapper. The latter is boosted to 8-megapixels with 2x optical zoom in the Plus variation. </p>
<p> Under the hood, the Sony Xperia 10 features 3GB RAM and a Snapdragon 630 SoC. A Snapdragon 636 SoC and 4GB RAM are included in the Xperia 10 Plus. Both pack in 64GB expandable storage up to 512GB. Providing power to all of the hardware, the smaller Xperia 10 features a 2,879mAh battery compared to the 3,000mAh capacity battery in the larger Plus model. </p>
<p> Best cheap smartphone for battery life </p>
<p> Moto G Power </p>
<p> Price: $249.99 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Motorola </p>
<p> For those who are looking at smartphones that are cheap but have a ton of battery without skimping on power, Motorola has stepped forward its 'Power'-branded offerings this year with the launch of the Android 10-powered Moto G Power. And it's available unlocked for use on all GSM carriers. </p>
<p> The now-Lenovo-owned Moto division built the G Power with to serve those who need a smartphone that can last up to 3 days. But Motorola also stuffed its latest G-series smartphone with enough specs to fit in just about anywhere. To begin with, there's a respectable 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, doubling down on last year's G7 Power. </p>
<p> That hardware is backing up an updated Snapdragon 665 SoC. There should be plenty of performance to power through most smartphone tasks and even enough for most mobile games without issue. </p>
<p> The company also built-in a 5,000mAh capacity battery to drive the other components. That's including a 10W fast-charging system this time around. So, not only is that coupled with a more battery efficient chipset. Moto made sure this handset will refuel comparatively quickly. </p>
<p> The previously released Moto G7 Power was capable of surviving two full days of use still left the 30-percent to 50-percent battery mark remaining. That's a serious step above what's usually available in the mid-range value segment. At just under $250, if battery life is what really matters, this device should only improve on that and at a price that is well worth the expenditure. </p>
<p> Best cheap smartphone under $350 </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy A51 </p>
<p> Price: From $349 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Samsung </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy A-series is now a firmly-set staple when it comes to high-performance, high-value Android smartphones on the cheap. Centered in the middle of that range is Samsung's newest available entry, the Galaxy A51. Like other handsets in the Galaxy A-Series, this Samsung handset is all about testing experimental upcoming features for flagships. For end-users, that means it delivers a flagship-like experience at a fraction of the cost. </p>
<p> The Galaxy A51 comes in at a slightly higher cost than its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy A50. It starts out at $349.99 in the US, direct from Samsung. An upgraded in-house Exynos processor lies at the center of the price increase, as well as a larger 6.5-inch Super AMOLED 6.4-inch slim-bezel Super AMOLED Infinity-O display. In the states, that's backed by 4GB RAM with 6GB available internationally and up to 128GB storage. </p>
<p> The big-ticket item, however, is its quad-camera array centered around a 48-megapixel primary snapper with Super Steady OIS Mode. An-display fingerprint scanner, top-tier Android 10-based OneUI 2.0 software experience, and fast charging 4,000mAh capacity battery round things out. </p>
<p> Of course, that's loaded with the same features found in the reputation-building flagship Galaxy S series. And it's all packed into a premium-looking frame that's delivered in </p>
<p> All of that is packed into a frame that comes in three colors. Those include a gradient-laced Black, White, or Pink, although US buyers appear stuck with just the black option for now. </p>
<p> Fans of Samsung would do well to start their buying process by considering the Samsung Galaxy A51 or the next entry in place of its much pricier flagships. At under $350 in the US, the Galaxy A51 performs and delivers its complete package at a bargain. </p>
<p> Best cheap smartphones for a great display </p>
<p> TCL 10 Pro/10L </p>
<p> Price: From $249.99 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Any discussion surrounding the best cheap Android smartphones on the market would be remiss to exclude the TCL 10 series. That includes the TCL 10L and TCL 10 Pro. These two devices are easily a cut above the rest for their price. </p>
<p> Now, other devices here, it's fair to start by pointing out that there's no waterproofing rating for this device. But, due mostly to TCL's history and a partnership with Pixelworks, these phones arguably have the best display in their class. In fact, they function much more closely to flagships than just about any device at their price point. And there are plenty of advanced features and options underneath to ensure a personalized experience. </p>
<p> That personalized experience carries over to the OS side for both handsets too. With Android 10 and at least one update guaranteed atop frequent security updates promised, this device is nearly stock where it matters. If users want a gesture-driven experience, they can have it. If they like more traditional navigation or a combined experience, that's possible too. Meanwhile, the app drawer functions as a straightforward aftermarket launcher. And there's no lag to speak of on either device. </p>
<p> The primary differences are going to be in terms of camera features, display size and technology, and internal components. But, even there, the devices are incredibly similar and more than capable. At the more budget-friendly end, starting at just under $250 is the 6.53-inch 24-bit color panel-equipped TCL 10L. That packs a 1080 x 2340 resolution, powered by a somewhat older Snapdragon 665. TCL backed that with 6GB of RAM, coupled with either 64GB or 128GB storage. </p>
<p> The TCL 10 Pro, conversely, features a Snapdragon 675 octa-core chipset and with 6GB of RAM, coupled with 128GB storage. A 4,500mAh battery capable of upwards of 8-hours of screen-on time drives that package, compared to the 10L's 4,000mAh. The latter handset can last over 7-hours in terms of screen-on time with no issues. </p>
<p> Build-quality, meanwhile, approaches flagships in terms of design and in-hand feel. Summarily, neither phone feels cheap or performs like it is. These two phones prove that TCL is going to be a company to watch when it comes to cheaper Android smartphones. And either is well-worth a deeper dive for those who are looking for a device that performs well without breaking the bank. </p>
<p> Best cheap smartphone for 5G via Android </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy A71 5G </p>
<p> Price: From $599 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Samsung </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy A71 5G, while undeniably one of the best Android smartphones around, could hardly be described as cheap. But it's a great value so we're not just talking about its nearly $600 price tag. </p>
<p> Samsung engineered its Galaxy A71 5G around a more-than-capable Snapdragon 765G and support for 5G. And that means this phone very nearly reaches flagship levels of performance. But also tosses 5G support into the mix. Conversely, that allows for more stable connectivity and a relatively small speed increase. As opposed to massive speed gains most users would see with mmWave connections. </p>
<p> That is unless consumers by the Verizon variant for mmWave support. But that handset costs an extra $50 at $649.99. So it borders on leaving the affordable category. </p>
<p> In any case, what Samsung is giving users here is a top-of-the-line mid-ranger that should match the latest flagships in terms of core features. The company built the phone on a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED Infinity-O platform. Inside that smaller-than-average front camera housing, there resides a 32-megapixel selfie snapper. </p>
<p> The main cameras are no slouch either. Of course, this is a quad-camera array with a 64-megapixel primary sensor, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 5-megapixel dedicated macro shooter. </p>
<p> With all of that stacked atop a capable 4,500mAh battery with fast charging, a microSD card slot for expanded storage, and a great fingerprint-resistant design, this is undoubtedly a top choice for gaining access to next-gen networking. </p>
<p> Best cheap smartphone with stock Android </p>
<p> Nokia 7.2 </p>
<p> Price: $349.99 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Nokia's follow-up to the brilliant 7.1, the Nokia 7.2 is priced at just a penny short of $350. But that doesn't mean it's a slouch in any regard. In fact, it's easily one of the best high-value smartphones on the market today. </p>
<p> The Nokia 7.2 starts out with an HD+ PureView display that's been vamped up with an HDR 10-compatible tech. The company bolstered its size from the last model, resulting in a 6.3-inch screen with a dewdrop cutout. That houses a camera for selfies at a whopping 20-megapixels. Around the back of the phone, there's a 48-megapixel tri-camera. That's a quad-pixel camera for better light and detail capture. </p>
<p> The primary camera is accompanied by an 8-megapixel wide-angle and 5-megapixel depth sensor lenses. That's a Zeiss-built snapper too. </p>
<p> The glass on the back and front is accented by a Charcoal Grey, Ice Silver, or Cyan Green coloration. Or at least it is on the rear-panel. </p>
<p> Under the hood, Nokia is providing Android 10 powered by a Snapdragon 660 SoC. That's backed by 4GB or 6GB RAM options and 128GB on the storage side — expandable to 512GB. A 3,500 mAh battery powers the package for multi-day performance under the right conditions. </p>
<p> Now, what makes this device truly special is that it's still a part of the Android One program. That means that Android 10 will be updated fairly frequently, falling in line with stock Android. It also means that Android 10 will be followed up by its predecessor at a more rapid clip than many other phones. But the biggest advantage is the ease of use and its clean, bloat-free install. </p>
<p> Best cheap smartphone that's an Android flagship </p>
<p> LG Velvet </p>
<p> Price: $599.99 </p>
<p> Where to buy: LG </p>
<p> Any conversation to be had about the best 'cheap' Android smartphones will need to include the LG Velvet. Originally sold under the company's "G" branding as a flagship, that's effectively what this phone is. But with a price as low as $599.99, it's not priced like one. And with 5G included out-of-the-box at AT&T — and arriving at T-Mobile and Verizon before 'Summer' ends — it's definitely a heavy-hitter. </p>
<p> That's not the only place this phone competes directly with Samsung's second entry on this list either. A 6.8-inch FHD+, OLED Display panel has been used here at 395 pixels-per-inch. Embedded in that is a camera that's rated at 16-megapixels. Meanwhile, the primary rear camera is rated at 48-megapixels, accompanied by a wide-angle 8-megapixel snapper and a time-of-flight sensor at 5-megapixels. </p>
<p> On sound, LG packs in dual-speakers with LG 3D Sound Engine. Bluetooth 5.1 keeps audio clean on that side of the equation. Under the hood, a Quick Charge 4.0+ enhanced 4,300mAh battery keeps things going all day or refuels in a snap as needed. </p>
<p> LG packed all of that into a completely re-imagined design that's dust-, water-, and shock-resistant. Summarily, LG Velvet isn't just one of the most beautiful sub-$600 Android smartphones on the market — even if it isn't "cheap" compared to others on this list. It's also durable. But that isn't all. </p>
<p> The company set up the LG Velvet with an overlay for Android 10 that's been exceptionally widely-lauded too. So much so that LG is bringing it to just about every other flagship-level phone it makes. That says quite a lot about the software experience here. It's a decidedly flagship-like affair. </p>
<p> Best cheap Android smartphone overall </p>
<p> Google Pixel 4a </p>
<p> Price: $349 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google </p>
<p> Now, Google's newly announced Pixel 4a isn't going to start shipping until August 20. And it's only available in a single color configuration. That's black to reduce fingerprints and accented with a lime-green power button. So it isn't the flashiest or most personalized device out-of-the-box. The same goes for its fingerprint scanner. Google embedded that on the polycarbonate rear panel here instead of under the display. </p>
<p> Despite that, it is the most easily-recommendable Android device among cheap smartphones. It's also among the most highly-reviewed for that reason. </p>
<p> Priced at just $349, this phone comes with a processor that should stand out easily among others on this list. That's the Qualcomm-built Snapdragon 730 octa-core SoC. It isn't quite as powerful as some others but it's more than enough for most users. The search giant backed that up with a healthy 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. </p>
<p> Additionally, the same general rule applies to the phone's size. The Google design measures just 5.81-inches, not accounting for the punch-hole housing the 8-megapixel selfie snapper, and that's an FHD+ OLED panel. By most accounts, Google made the right choice in terms of scale here. The in-hand fit is going to be just about perfect for most users. Especially since many smartphones are beginning to approach the 7-inch mark. </p>
<p> All of that, of course, leads up to this phone's biggest features. Regardless of the fact that the Pixel 4a follows in the footsteps of its predecessors with a single snapper at the back, this phone will hands-down offer the best camera experience. That's because Google pulled the 12.2 MP dual-pixel camera on the back directly from the more expensive Pixel 4 series. </p>
<p> And it packed the camera with features too. Even though the telephoto lens from its larger counterpart is gone in the Pixel 4a, it can even accomplish a similar "Super Res Zoom" effect. And that's setting aside Pixel standards such as Night Sight, Top Shot, and everything else from the Pixel 4. As is Astrophotography. </p>
<p> It makes very little sense that other cameras in phones can't quite keep up despite that those are using multiple lenses. Setting aside the decent battery life, respectable performance, design, and stock Android, the cameras alone would make this the device to buy in this price category. </p>

<p> Best Chinese Smartphones – December 2017 </p>

<p> Best Chinese Smartphones – February 2018 </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus managed to make its way to our best Chinese smartphones list this month, even though it’s not exactly a flagship phone. The Redmi 5 Plus does have a lot to offer considering its price point, which is why it’s listed along with a number of flagship handsets down below. The OnePlus 5T is still leading the pack here, though there are a number of appealing options if you’re in the market for a new smartphone. Upcoming months will be quite interesting when the Chinese smartphones are concerned, as the Huawei P11 / P20, its ‘Plus’ counterpart, Xiaomi Mi 7, OnePlus 6 and Honor 10 are all expected to launch in the first 6-7 months of this year. In any case, let’s check out this month’s list, shall we. </p>
<p> 5. Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus is not exactly one of the most powerful Chinese smartphones, but it deserves a place on this list as it does offer a lot for the asking price. The Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus is essentially a successor to the Redmi Note 4, and unlike the Redmi Note 4, it sports rather thin bezels, which makes it look far more modern. The Redmi 5 Plus is made out of metal, it sports a rear-facing fingerprint scanner, and it is fueled by the Snapdragon 625 64-bit octa-core processor. The device comes in 3GB and 4GB RAM variants, while it sports a 5.99-inch fullHD+ (2160 x 1080) display. The phone’s 3GB RAM variant is priced at $179.99 on GearBest, while its 4GB RAM counterpart can be purchased for $199.99. </p>
<p> The Honor 9 is still the company’s compact flagship, despite the fact it’s no longer the most powerful Honor-branded device, as the Honor View 10 landed recently. The Honor 9 is still a compelling phone, though, as it is even more affordable now than it was back when it launched in mid-2017. The Honor 9 is made out of metal and glass, it sports a dual camera setup on the back, and a front-facing fingerprint scanner. This handset is fueled by the Kirin 960 64-bit octa-core processor, while it sports 4GB or 6GB of RAM, depending on where you buy it. Both the phone’s 4GB and 6GB RAM variants are currently available on GearBest, and interestingly enough, they cost the same at the moment, $350. The device is also available from Amazon, but it’s considerably more expensive at $469. </p>
<p> The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus have been announced about a year ago, and even though the Huawei P11 / P20 and its larger counterpart are expected to launch in the near future, the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus are still more than capable of running through anything without a problem, and are quite compelling if you’re looking for a new handset to get. The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus are made out of metal, they both sport a dual camera setup on the back, and Leica’s lenses are a part of the package. Both phones are fueled by the Kirin 960 64-bit octa-core processor, the Huawei P10 comes with a fullHD panel, while the P10 Plus features a QHD display. These two handsets are no longer available from GearBest (out of stock), but you can still get them from Amazon if you’d like. </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 is the company’s most powerful smartphone to date. This handset comes in two design variants, the more affordable variant is made out of metal and ceramic, while the most expensive option features a ceramic unibody build. The Mi MIX 2 sports a 5.99-inch fullHD+ display, while it is fueled by the Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core processor. The Mi MIX 2 sports a single camera on the back, and it also features a rear-facing fingerprint scanner. This handset comes with a set of really thin bezels, and the device is available in both 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. The Xiaomi Mi MIX 2’s pricing starts at $459.99 on GearBest, and a number of variants are available for purchase. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 5T is OnePlus’ second flagship of 2017. This handset comes with considerably thinner bezels than the OnePlus 5, while it is made out of metal. The device sports a 6.01-inch fullHD+ Optic AMOLED display, while it is available in both 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. Two cameras are included on the back of this phone, while you will find a rear-facing fingerprint scanner on the device as well. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core processor is also a part of the package, and the same can be said for the phone’s 3,300mAh non-removable battery which can be recharged using the company’s Dash Charge fast charging (charger included). The OnePlus 5T’s 6GB RAM variant is priced at $519.99 on GearBest, while you can get its 8GB RAM counterpart for $599.99. </p>

<p> Best Chinese Smartphones – January 2018 </p>
<p> Our first ‘Best Chinese Smartphones’ list in this year is here, and not much has changed compared to the end of last year. Huawei did introduce the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro flagships, but we’ve decided not to list them here due to their still limited availability, the same goes for the Honor View 10 aka Honor V10. Having said that, the Huawei P9, P9 Plus and Honor 9 are here instead, as they were until now, while the OnePlus 5T is still leading the pack. If you’re interested in checking out the list, read on. </p>
<p> 5. Honor 9 </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Honor 9 is the most powerful, compact flagship Honor has to offer. This smartphone sports a 5.15-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display, while it comes with 4GB / 6GB of RAM and 64GB / 128GB of native storage. This handset is fueled by the Kirin 960 SoC, which is no longer the company’s flagship processor, but it is still plenty powerful. The Honor 9 is made out of metal and glass, and it both looks and feels premium, while this phone also comes with a set of really capable cameras on its back. You will find 20-megapixel and 12-megapixel cameras on the back of the Honor 9, while the phone ships with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, with Huawei’s Emotion UI (EMUI) skin on top of it. The Honor 9 can be purchased from Amazon for $469, while it is priced at $339.99 on GearBest. </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Mi 6 is one of the company’s flagships for 2017. This is the company’s compact flagship, which sports a 5.15-inch Full HD display, compared to the Mi MIX 2’s 5.99-inch panel. The Mi 6 comes with considerably thicker bezels than the Mi MIX 2, but it’s quite compact despite that. This handset is fueled by the Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core processor, and it actually comes in two different RAM models, the more affordable model sports 4GB of RAM, while the more expensive variant comes with 6GB of RAM. This phone’s pricing starts at $409.99, all the links have been included down below. </p>
<p> The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus had been announced back in February last year, and even though the Huawei P11 / P20 is right around the corner, these two phones are still very compelling. The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus are basically identical in terms of the design, though the P10 is much more compact than its ‘Plus’ sibling.

<p> The Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 is the most powerful smartphone Xiaomi had released to date.

The device features a 6.01-inch Full HD+ Optic AMOLED display, while you can grab either 6GB or 8GB RAM variant of this handset. The OnePlus 5T is fueled by the Snapdragon 835, while it sports a 3,300mAh non-removable battery on the inside, which you can recharge using OnePlus’ proprietary Dash Charge fast charging technology. The 6GB RAM variant of the device can be grabbed for $499.99 from GearBest, while you’ll need to splash out $569.99 for the 8GB RAM variant. </p>

<p> Best Chinese Smartphones – September 2017 </p>
<p> A new month came knocking, and a new list of top Chinese smartphones along with it. This month’s list is slightly different than the one we shared last month, the OnePlus 5 still leads the race and is followed by some compelling smartphones from Huawei, Honor and Xiaomi, all of which have made the list this time around. Having said that, let’s take a look at what the list looks like, shall we. </p>
<p> 5. Xiaomi Mi MIX </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Mi MIX is Xiaomi’s ‘bezel-less’ smartphone, and one of the most interesting devices of 2016. The Mi MIX sports a 6.4-inch display, while it packs in 4GB or 6GB of RAM, and is fueled by the Snapdragon 821 64-bit quad-core SoC, which is the same processor the Mi Note 2 comes with. The 6GB RAM variant of this phone can now be purchased for $499.99 from GearBest. </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Mi 6 is the company’s current flagship smartphone, and this phone has plenty to offer. It is made of metal and glass, while it comes with high-end specs, and an affordable price point. The Mi 6 sports a 5.15-inch fullHD display, while it packs in 6GB of RAM. This handset sports two cameras on its back, and Android Nougat comes pre-installed on it with MIUI 8. There are several variants available from GearBest, and the most affordable one costs $419, offering 6GB RAM and 64GB of native storage. </p>
<p> The Honor 9 is a direct competitor to the Xiaomi Mi 6 and the OnePlus 5, as this phone is quite affordable, and yet it’s very sleek-looking and packs a punch in terms of specs. The device is made of metal and glass, and it sports a 5.15-inch display, just like the Xiaomi Mi 6. This handset comes in 4GB and 6GB RAM variants while being fueled by the Kirin 960 64-bit octa-core SoC. The Honor 9 is now available from Amazon but it is out of stock on GearBest, at least for now. </p>
<p> The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus handsets are identical in terms of design, but they’re different in size. The Huawei P10 sports a 5.1-inch fullHD display, while its larger sibling comes with a 5.5-inch QHD panel. Both phones are made of metal, and both ship with a dual camera setup on the back, with Leica’s lenses on top of those sensors. The Huawei P10 is currently priced at $679.99 over at Amazon, while the Huawei P10 Plus costs $669. Both phones are presently unavailable from GearBest. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 5 is yet another metal-clad smartphone on this list, with this handset being fueled by the high-end Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core SoC while packing 6GB or 8GB of RAM, depending on which variant you opt to purchase. The device sports a 5.5-inch fullHD (1920 x 1080) Optic AMOLED display and Android 7.1.1 Nougat comes pre-installed on it with OnePlus’s OxygenOS skin. The 6GB RAM variant of the device costs $473, while its 8GB RAM model can be purchased for $570. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Chromebooks For Back To School 2020 </p>
<p> School is nearly back in session and that means it's time to sift through the top available Chromebooks to find a great new device, whether for students or educators. </p>
<p> Under ordinary circumstances, that's going to be a fairly straightforward process. But with ongoing work- and learn-from-home trends, finding a Chromebook that's worth the cash can be a challenge. Not only are OEMs continuing to release new devices at a relatively rapid clip. Those that are released are also selling out quickly. </p>
<p> Chrome OS itself doesn't necessarily make matters easier either. To begin with, advancements in the operating system have created a divergence among top Chromebooks — for school, students, or otherwise. Summarily, there are more choices across more form factors than ever before. So choosing the best device is going to depend quite a lot on what it will be used for. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To help with that decision, we've compiled a list of our top ten choices for consideration. This list includes everything from devices that are a bit more expensive to those that should fit just about any budget and from standard clamshell laptops to tablets. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Chromebooks for Back to School 2020 Summary </p>
<p> Now, there is a wealth of Chromebooks to choose from for school, especially when it comes to top devices for students and educators. Chrome OS has continued to evolve and so have devices available. Choosing the 'best' devices among those can be and often is a challenge. And some of the best available devices are going to be specifically available through educator-only platforms and storefronts. </p>
<p> Moreover, the term best can be extremely subjective. There are a lot of gadgets for purchase fitting into just a handful of easily-discernable categories. When it comes to schooling, power isn't going to be the biggest determining factor for most of the devices on this list. For obvious reasons, neither students nor educators will likely need the latest, top-tier processors. Or the most RAM. Far more important are the form factor, battery life, durability, reliability, and the like. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That doesn't immediately reduce the options buyers have to choose from either. But it does provide a focus for the decision-making process. And, fortunately, here at Android Headlines, as a matter of course, we spend a lot of time conducting reviews and engaged in research regarding Chromebooks. And that provides a deeper insight to provide a list of to Chromebooks that should be better suited to a school environment for students and others. </p>
<p> So, without further regress, here's our take on the best Chromebooks currently available to that end. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook overall for educators </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Pixelbook Go </p>
<p> Price: From $649 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google </p>
<p> Google's Pixelbook Go is an obvious shoo-in for anybody in need of a reliable Chromebook. Comprised of a series of different but similar Chromebooks, this device is not only powerful enough for instructors overseeing students at school. It's powerful enough for just about anybody. </p>
<p> There are two base models for Pixelbook Go. Those ship with 8GB RAM but there's split between one device with 64GB or 128GB storage. The former, like the Google Pixel Slate above, utilizes a more-than-capable Intel Core m3 processor while the later is an Intel Core i5. Stepping up from there, Google also sells a Core i5 model with double the storage at 256GB. And that model ships with 16GB RAM. </p>
<p> The top model for Google's best Chromebook ships with an Intel Core i7 processor backed by 16GB RAM and 256GB storage. It also bumps things forward in terms of its 13.3-inch display. The top model goes replaces the Full HD display panel found in more budget-friendly variants with a 4K screen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Pixelbook Go from Google features a grippy, rugged magnesium alloy design in Just Black or Not Pink. And all of the screens, regardless of the model chosen, are topped with Corning Concore Glass for more durability. So it should better survive long-term, long-session use, in addition to being capable. </p>
<p> In terms of comfort and security, Google includes a Titan C security chip, ambient light sensors, a backlit keyboard with Hush Keys, a 1080p 60fps webcam, and an etched glass trackpad. </p>
<p> Two USB-C ports and a headphone jack round out the package. </p>
<p> Best 2-in-1 Chromebook for educators </p>
<p> ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 </p>
<p> Price: From $463.91 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Now, the Google Pixelbook Go is a pricier, clamshell-style offering that can readily fill the role of a standard laptop. But sometimes, a 2-in-1 device that can be used as a tablet or laptop is needed. And similarly, sometimes more ports are needed. That's where the ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 comes in. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ASUS's Chromebook Flip lineup has been among the most popular device series in the Chrome OS category. In large part, that comes down to the above-mentioned 2-in-1 design. The ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 packs a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution display at a 14-inch panel too. So buyers get a bit more screen real-estate. That's despite a similarly-sized design centered around an ultra-slim-bezel all-metal package. </p>
<p> This laptop also comes with up to an Intel Core i7-8500Y chipset. So there's plenty of power to spare. And that doesn't necessarily disappear with the base model, packed with an Intel Core M3-8100Y processor. Those models ship with 8GB or 4GB RAM, respectively, and 128GB or 64GB storage. </p>
<p> Dual speakers are included to make video chatting with the built-in webcam or recording a bit better too. And, for long typing sessions, ASUS includes its unique ergonomic-lift backlit keyboard. That's raised at the back when the lid is opened in clamshell mode. The keys are set at a travel distance of 1.4mm as well. All of that equates to one of the best typing experiences in the business. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Aside from ports, this laptop also features a microSD card slot for more storage and storage that can be easily moved around on-the-go. </p>
<p> Best of all, pricing is as low as $463.91 for the base model, as of this writing. So all of that can be had at a better value than some other Chromebooks on the market. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook tablet for educators </p>
<p> Google Pixel Slate </p>
<p> Price: From $799 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google </p>
<p> Tablets, of course, tend to cost a bit more than laptops. But, when it comes to the top Chromebooks or other electronics that are meant for use in school — by students or educators — sometimes a tablet is needed. Fortunately, Google also has a Chromebook that skirts both worlds seamlessly, taking the form of the Pixel Slate. </p>
<p> Sold alone as a dedicated tablet starting at $799, Google packed its Pixel Slate with up to an Intel Core i7 processor. Behind that, the company includes up to 16GB RAM at the upper end and 256GB storage. The base model features 32GB storage and 4GB RAM with an Intel Core m3 chip. But specs aren't everything and a Molecular LCD 3,000 x 2,000 LTPS display is packed into the all-metal frame for better viewing despite the diminutive 12.3-inch size. </p>
<p> There's also an 8-megapixel camera sensor at both the front and back. So web chats and meetings aren't the only use for cameras on this device. Meanwhile, a magnetically mounted full-size keyboard and a pressure-sensitive stylus can be had for an additional $199 and $99, respectively. So this device isn't limited to use as a tablet either. And its USB-C charging port does deliver with video-out capabilities, just in case that's needed. </p>
<p> Best small budget Chromebook for students </p>
<p> Samsung Chromebook 4 </p>
<p> Price: From $229 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Shifting over to school-specific Chromebooks for students, the top devices aren't necessarily going to be centered on performance. Because Chrome OS is so capable and efficient, even budget-friendly devices are going to perform more like a mid-range windows machine. That's one of many perks, in addition to Android and Linux apps that set these devices apart. </p>
<p> Perhaps nowhere does that concept shine better as a real-world example than in the Samsung Chromebook 4. At least in the small-form-factor segment of the market. Priced to move at just $229 to start and maxing out at $279, this device eschews fancy bells and whistles. Instead, Samsung's Chromebook 4 packs an 11.6-inch display. And it's intended to deliver a lot of functionality, performance, durability, and portability. </p>
<p> Samsung built the Chromebook 4 around a platform that's MIL-STD-810G certified for transit drop, vibration, high temperature, freezing, temperature shocks, humidity, and low pressure. Of course, as is the case with most laptops, there's no water-resistance rating to be found here. But that certification does ensure this Samsung gadget will survive abuse much better than a large swath of the competition. </p>
<p> There are no fewer than three configurations for the Samsung Chromebook 4 on Amazon as of this writing. Each features an Intel Celeron N4000 processor but users can choose between 4GB and 6GB RAM. 64GB of storage is packed into the 6GB model. Samsung packs the 4GB model with 32GB storage. </p>
<p> Unlike many Chromebooks, the Chromebook 4 can last all day too, ensuring students aren't every left looking around their school for a plug. Samsung says it tested its battery to last up to 12-hours. </p>
<p> Best full-size budget Chromebook for students </p>
<p> ASUS Chromebook C523 </p>
<p> Price: From $338.49 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Moving up to devices that are still affordable but come with a larger screen is the ASUS Chromebook C523. With an MSRP of just $379.99, and often sold for less, this device centers its design around a 15.6-inch display. What's more, that's not a cheap 1,366 x 768 display panel either. It's a 1080p touchscreen. Although, there is an even more budget-friendly variant that does ship with that resolution. </p>
<p> The more budget-friendly version also packs a less capable Intel Celeron processor and just 32GB storage. So it will make more sense for most users to go with the Intel Pentium N4200 processor configuration, which packs in 64GB of storage alongside the standard 4GB RAM. Or, for even more power, this device can be had with up to 8GB RAM. </p>
<p> Setting that aside, battery life from this ASUS-branded device, like many of our top Chromebooks listed here for students or school, is going to be more than acceptable. ASUS claims up to 10-hours on a single charge. And that should be easily attainable with the use we're talking about here. </p>
<p> Despite being a relatively inexpensive Chromebook, ASUS built this gadget's lid from metal. That's linked up in a clamshell configuration to a plastic keyboard deck that is, nonetheless, comfortable to type on. And the same goes for the touchpad. </p>
<p> As a budget Chromebook, this should be a great device for any student to work with. </p>
<p> Best mid-range Chromebook for students </p>
<p> Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Flex 5 </p>
<p> Price: From $409.99 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> When it comes to stepping up a notch to the mid-range in performance, this gadget is going to be difficult to argue against. In fact, it's going to be difficult to argue that the Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Flex 5 isn't one of the best options for any user. With pricing starting at just $409.99, this Chrome OS 2-in-1 packs a 13.3-inch display panel with a 1080p resolution. It lasts well over 7-hours on a single charge, taking under 2-hours to charge. </p>
<p> But that's not all this device has to offer at that low cost. Aside from featuring an extremely comfortable design with a great keyboard and mylar-coated touchpad, this Chromebook is spill-resistant. And that same keyboard is backlit, as a standard. The touchscreen, conversely, is a 10-point touch display with support for a — not-included — USI universal active stylus. </p>
<p> Carrying forward with what makes this a great mid-range option, the company sells this gadget at its lowest cost with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, backing up an Intel Core i3-10110U tenth-gen processor. But it can be purchased, when available, with up to 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. Variants are also expected with up to an i5 processor instead. </p>
<p> That's great, to begin with, but there's no shortage of ports either. Lenovo gives users 2 USB-C ports and an additional USB-A port. Bluetooth 5.0 and Wi-Fi 6 compatibility are built right in. So this is a Chromebook that's not just going to last a year or two through abuse at school. It's going to last and be usable for years, with plenty of power for use outside of school. </p>
<p> Best premium Chromebook for students </p>
<p> Acer Chromebook Spin 713 </p>
<p> Price: From $629.99 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> The only direction to go from the brilliantly-built Lenovo above is up. That means building up to a gadget that will not only last throughout the school year. But also well beyond, with care. For a device that's built to offer the best experience available with a reasonable value and without going too overboard for a student, we're looking at Acer's Chromebook Spin 713. </p>
<p> As noted above, this isn't the most powerful premium laptop around. And it's pricing is going to fall in line with that. Acer starts this laptop at a respectable $629.99. That price nets buyers a 10th-gen Intel Core i5-10210U processor with 8GB DDR4 SDRAM and 128GB of SSD storage. It also nets them a 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 3:2 aspect ratio touch-enhanced display. </p>
<p> All of that means that buyers can simply buy the base model — for school, at any rate — and ignore just how powerful this device can be for a lot more money. </p>
<p> Stacking atop those top-level specs, Acer designed this Chromebook to meet third-party certified MIL-STD-810G standards for durability. That' includes the use of a Gorilla Glass display and touchpad. And it's without consideration for the fact that there are two USB-C ports, a USB-A port, microSD card reader, and a full-sized HDMI port. </p>
<p> The comfortable-to-type-on keyboard is backlit. WiFi 6 is part of the bundle. And the battery lasts over 10-hours despite the power under the hood. </p>
<p> One caveat here is that there's no stylus and no USI stylus support for this screen. But all of that is packed into a stylish design that's meant to last and still somehow measures just over a half-inch thick. With the weight at just a smidge over 3lbs, it's not going to be too difficult to lug around in a backpack either. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook 2-in-1 for students </p>
<p> Dell Inspiron Chromebook 14 2-in-1 (7486) </p>
<p> Price: From $494.99 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> For a great convertible design that won't break the bank but doesn't skimp on features, Dell's latest Inspiron Chromebook 14 2-in-1 is going to be a great device to turn to. </p>
<p> Listed as model designation 7486 and found on Best Buy for just $494.99, this Chromebook strives to land on the middle-ground. It's not ruggedized, doesn't feature the latest in networking, and it doesn't have the most brilliant display around. The RAM, conversely, is only at 4GB. Although that won't be an issue at all for Chrome OS, especially with schoolwork. </p>
<p> On the other hand, Dell built this Chromebook with 128GB of storage. So there's plenty of room, even without the cloud, to store all of the files and documents. There's a stylus packed into the backlit keyboard deck, on the bottom, and the display itself is a healthy 14-inches. The resolution of that IPS panel, placed on a 360-degree hinge, is set at 1,920 x 1,080. And Dell built the internals to work with an 8th-gen Intel Core i3-8130U processor. </p>
<p> Rounding out connectivity, Dell includes a full-size HDMI port. Dell has connected that up to the Intel-branded UHD capable graphics chip. A MicroSD card slot is part of the package too, along with two USB-C and a USB-A port. </p>
<p> There's simply very little to dislike about this Chromebook at its cost. Especially where performance and reliability are concerned in a 2-in-1 form factor. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook for students who need something rugged </p>
<p> Acer Chromebook Spin 512 </p>
<p> Price: From $499 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Acer </p>
<p> Acer’s second entry in this list of back-to-school Chromebooks for students and teachers is explicitly built with students in mind. It's also a bit more expensive with its $499 starting price. But the Acer Chromebook Spin 512, on the student-friendly side of things, is a 12-inch 2-in-1 convertible laptop that features a microbe-resistant display coating. And that's leaving alone entirely the fact that it delivers spill protection thanks to drain-through slots positioned over the keyboard. </p>
<p> Acer also says that this students-first device can take a beating that most Chromebooks can't withstand, even at the top. The OEM includes a rubber trim and extra reinforcement with this gadget. So it’s going to survive falls from a reasonable height, well beyond the day-to-day jostle of a backpack. </p>
<p> Despite those extra measures, the protective trim doesn’t take away from the aesthetics either. The ruggedization is melded into the build itself, fitting tightly in a similar fashion to an ultra-slim-fit phone case. And Acer doesn't stop their either. The company includes an EMR stylus with this gadget to take advantage of the flip-around 2-in-1 1,366 x 912 resolution touch screen. </p>
<p> Backing up that hardware and delivering a more-than-usable Chrome OS experience is up to 8GB RAM and 64GB storage. Those two components back up an Intel Pentium Silver N5000 processor. </p>
<p> Best detachable tablet Chromebook for students </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook Duet </p>
<p> Price: From $249 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Best Buy </p>
<p> The last of the Chromebooks to slip into our list for school and students is a top-gadget in its own right. It's also not the most powerful device around but what it lacks in oomph, it more than makes up for in portability, value, and features. Dubbed the Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Duet, this device starts out at just $429 direct from Lenovo or around $279 on Amazon. </p>
<p> The biggest drawback involved when buying this particularly well-priced Chrome OS tablet is its MediaTek P60T processor. For power, users typically look to Intel and even AMD has some competitive devices. But this is effectively a brand new chip from MediaTek and it's not quite like its predecessors. Rather than being underpowered and lag-ridden, this chipset helps push Chrome OS to new heights in this Chromebook. </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook Duet's 4GB RAM and either 64GB or 128GB storage is nothing to smirk at either. To begin with, the difference in cost between the two models, as of this writing, is only around $20. And the hardware is more than enough to run dozens of tabs alongside Android apps for photo editing and documents. Multitasking across those is absolutely not an issue for this tablet. </p>
<p> A second caveat could very well be its 10.1-inch display. But it's blue-and-gray design is meant to withstand a beating too. And users don't need to go out and buy a new keyboard for this gadget either. Instead, Lenovo ships the device with its own keyboard, attached via pogo pins to the 1,920 x 1200 resolution display panel. The frame also houses a single USB-C port for charging, listening via the included 3.5mm adapter, or display output. </p>
<p> There's no stylus included but for those who need one, any active universal USI stylus will work with this display panel. </p>
<p> All of that, combined with a better-than-average speaker experience, the availability of cases for added protection, and ultra-portability stack up to equal a device that's going to be almost without equal. And certainly without equal on the value front, if a Chrome OS tablet is what's needed. </p>

There are all sorts of apps included. </p>
<p> That being said, the world is also battling a pandemic at the moment, the COVID-19 aka Coronavirus.

There are some useful web tools that can be helpful, such as the one Microsoft launched recently. If you navigate to bing.com/covid, you'll be able to get a ton of information regarding Coronavirus, including the exact numbers of infections across the globe. </p>
<p> Coronavirus is something we all need to be vary of, and not take lightly. The pandemic will hopefully be defeated in the near future, and until then, these apps may help, though not directly with Coronavirus. These apps are mostly aimed at those of you who have a cold, flu, or something similar, as a cure for Coronavirus is not available just yet. Maybe talking to a physician online will help ease your mind over Coronavirus, though. If you think that may be the case, then you may find some of these apps useful for that purpose as well. </p>

<p> Top 8 best cold, flu & virus Android apps 2020 downloads </p>

<p> Best cold, flu & virus Android app for analyzing symptoms </p>
<p> Ada </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 4.3+ </p>
<p> Ada is a great app if you're trying to analyze the symptoms you're experiencing. The developer has even added COVID-19 in its database as well, so this app can help you exclude that as an option as well. The developer would like you to think of this app as your health companion, and it kind of is. All you need to do is tell the app what's bothering you, and then answer a number of simple, personalized questions. </p>
<p> Ada will then start assessing what's wrong, and provide you with relevant information about your current health condition. You should, of course, consult your doctor if the condition ends up being serious, this app is only meant to help you get some peace of mind, and point you in the right direction. It is, by no means, a solution for your health condition. </p>
<p> It is worth noting, though, that this app is a Class I medical device in the European Union. Its registration in other markets is also pending. That only goes to show how useful the app can be, of course. The design of its UI is extremely simple, and it really does put all the focus on the content itself. The white background is combined with contrasting letters, graphs, and whatever else the app throws your way. </p>
<p> Best cold, flu & virus Android app for getting help from a real doctor </p>
<p> Doctor On Demand </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>

<p> If you feel the need to talk to a real doctor online, the Doctor On Demand app is the way to go. This app will connect you with "board-certified physicians and doctoral-level therapists" to talk to online, via your phone or tablet. Do note that this service is available in all 50 states (the US), and the District of Columbia. The app is not meant to be used for people who live outside of the US. </p>
<p> The service is available 24/7, so it includes both nights and weekends. You can get help whenever you want / need. This conversation will go similar to what you'd get if you go to a clinic. The doctor will take your history and symptoms, perform an exam, and then recommend the treatment. That includes both prescriptions and lab work, and they can even provide a doctor's note, if needed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This service is more affordable than actually visiting a doctor in the clinic, the developer claims. Considering that these doctors can't have physical contact with their patients, there are some things that they can't help you with. They can be quite helpful when it comes to both cold and flu, no to mention UTIs, allergies, depression, skin and eye issues, and so on. </p>
<p> Best cold, flu & virus Android app for researching treatments & diagnosis </p>
<p> WebMD </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 5.0+ </p>
<p> WebMD is probably the best app for researching treatments and diagnosis. Using this app, you can check your symptoms, and based on that, get a diagnosis.

<p> WebMD also partners with major pharmacy chains in order to offer the lowest prescription drug prices, or at least close to that. This service is completely free to use, no registration required. If you often forget to take your medication, this app can help. Medication reminders are included here as well. </p>
<p> In this app, you can save your conditions, drugs, doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies. On top of that, you'll find healthy living articles for secure access. A drug interaction checker is also included, so you can identify potentially harmful and unsafe combinations of prescription medications. The application's UI is extremely simple, and that's probably for the best, it's really easy to navigate. </p>
<p> Best cold, flu & virus Android app for health video lectures </p>
<p> OpenWHO </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 5.0+ </p>
<p> OpenWHO is designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers. but the app is accessible to everyone, and can be quite useful. It is a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, and it's a great app to have installed during a pandemic, like the one we're facing at the moment. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This app brings great health video lectures to the table, with plenty of information. The app itself features four channels. The first channel is the Outbreak Channel, and it addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information. The Ready for Response channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies. </p>

The last channel is the GOARN channel, and it is dedicated to preparing the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network for international alert and response operations.

<p> Sickweather is actually an extremely useful application. It's essentially a mapping app that maps out sickness. To be accurate, it's an illness crowdsourcing community, and the developer processes 6 million reports a day. This app will let you know when you enter a 'Sick Zone', areas where others have recently reported being sick. The app can alert you of flu, norovirus, pink eye, whooping cough, and 19 other illnesses. </p>
<p> This app has been recognized a number of times thus far, and it even managed to identify the early start of flu season, six weeks before the CDC, at least according to the developer. Thanks to Sickweather Groups, you can follow and report illnesses, and also post messages directly to the locations that matter most to you. Those locations may include schools, workplaces, restaurants, hospitals, and so on. </p>
<p> Various reports are represented by blue 'Sick' map markers at the local level. You can also tap those markers in order to get more information, like a detailed report, and when it has been reported. The app will also color-code more recent reports with a red color, if they've been reported in the last 24 hours. Orange reports will be those reported in the last 24-48 hours, while yellow ones will be those reported between 2 days and a week.

<p> Practo </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>

<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Best Premium Wired Gaming Headset </p>
<p> JBL Quantum One </p>
<p> Look, if you aren't messing around with your gaming setup and you want something that can only be described as otherworldly, get the JBL Quantum One. </p>
<p> This beast of a headset has loads of features and all of them are useful, and amp up the gaming experience to a level you've likely never experienced before. </p>
<p> From the little things like the USB-A to USB-C port connection, to the major things like the head tracking, the JBL Quantum One promises to deliver the most immersive gaming audio experience imaginable. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The head tracking in particular really makes you feel like you're in the game. And when paired with the Active Noise Cancellation you'll definitely stay focused. </p>
<p> Worried about not hearing friends or family if they need your attention for a quick second? Don't be. Because the JBL Quantum One also has a noise pass through. Simply turn this on from its dedicated button on the left ear, and you can now hear everything in the room while the game is basically muted. </p>
<p> I found this to be extremely useful when someone needs to ask me a question. As I could hear them perfectly without having to take the headset off. This is a pricey headset, but it's so, so worth it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Best Gaming Mouse for most people </p>
<p> Razer Viper Ultimate </p>
<p> Razer makes some of the best gaming accessories on the planet. Period. And the Viper Ultimate is near the top of the pile in what Razer offers. </p>
<p> This is the latest version of the Viper mouse. It's wireless, so you can use it without being tethered if you need to. But it can also transform into a wired mouse which helps when you need to charge it. </p>
<p> It also features Razer Chroma, as well as Razer's patented HyperSpeed wireless technology for quick response times. It has a battery life of up to 70 hours as well. Though your mileage may vary depending on whether or not you turn the Chroma lighting on. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Whether or not the lighting is on, how bright the lights are, this all factors into the battery life. So keep that in mind when thinking about the 70-hour mark. </p>
<p> It also features a DPI that goes up to 20,000. Though you probably won't ever need it to be that high. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Keyboard </p>
<p> Glorious Modular Mechanical Gaming Keyboard </p>
<p> There are lots of great gaming keyboards out there, but the GMMK, otherwise known as the Glorious Modular Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, is the best. </p>
<p> It's also one of the best gaming accessories you can pick up, and also necessary since you need a keyboard for PC games. With the GMMK, you of course get mechanical switches but this isn't just any mechanical gaming keyboard. </p>
<p> You can actually swap out the switches. Whether they need to be replaced or not. And you don't have to do any soldering. You can just use the included tool to pop off the keys, pull out the switch, and slot a new one in. </p>
<p> Any MX switch is compatible and you can use any combination of them too. So if you like Cherry MX Reds for most keys. Slot them in. Or you can use Gatreon and Kailh switches. </p>
<p> The GMMK also features RGB lighting, and it comes in three sizes – Full, Tenkeyless, and Compact. This isn't a wireless keyboard so you'll have to keep it plugged in. In terms of function and feel though, this is a stellar keyboard that doesn't need all the bells and whistles. </p>
<p> Best RGB Gaming Mouse Mat </p>
<p> SteelSeries QcK Prism XL </p>
<p> A mouse mat is just a mouse mat. Right? Wrong. Not all mouse mats are created equal. And while the size of the mat you prefer may differ from what others prefer, you want a decent one. </p>
<p> One of the best gaming accessories and the best RGB mouse mat, is the QcK Prism XL from SteelSeries. Since it's an extended mouse mat, it stretches across your desk and you can fit both your keyboard and mouse on it. </p>
<p> This mat in particular also comes with the RGB lighting strip around the edge in a dual section split. Though you don't have to use the 2-zone coloring and can set it to something else. It uses a microweave cloth material for the top so you've got that nice smooth glide for your mouse, and a fairly grippy bottom to make sure the mat doesn't move around. </p>
<p> Best Gaming External Sound Card </p>
<p> EPOS Sennheiser GSX 300 Gaming DAC </p>
<p> If you want to take your audio up a notch, consider the EPOS | Sennheiser GSX 300. It's an external sound card that was designed to work with a pair of gaming headphones to amplify your audio experience while gaming. </p>
<p> Of course it works for all entertainment, so you can use it for movies and music too. </p>
<p> The GSX 300 Gaming DAC features 7.1 Surround support, a fairly minimalist design that doesn't take up too much space, and it comes in white or black. Plus you can easily adjust things with the large dial on the front. </p>
<p> Best Budget Wired Gaming Headset </p>
<p> EPOS | Sennheiser GSP 300 </p>
<p> This is the perfect headset to pair with the GSX 300 Gaming DAC if you aren't looking to spend a boatload of money on the headphone setup. </p>
<p> There's a lot on board here that makes this a fantastic option with an affordable price. For one, it's Sennheiser so the audio quality is going to be amazing. It also has large cushy ear pads and a comfortable yet breathable headband. </p>
<p> The noise cancelling mic also flips up, which also mutes the mic during chat. So it's a very convenient design that makes it easy to pop in and pop out of chat at a moment's notice. </p>
<p> There's an on-ear dial for volume adjustment on the right side, and it comes with an adapter that lets you use the headset with more than just PC. Including PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Mac, Mobile, and any device with a 3.5mm audio port. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Soundbar </p>
<p> Sound BlasterX Katana </p>
<p> You have a vast selection of soundbars to choose from if you're in the market for one. But if you want one that's perfectly suited for gaming, the selection gets smaller. </p>
<p> The Sound BlasterX Katana is going to be your best option if you want something that's exceptional quality and geared towards gaming. It comes with a brushed aluminum finish with an RGB light bar at the base for that extra gamer look. </p>
<p> It also comes with a subwoofer, Dolby Digital 5.1 support, Multi-channel surround sound, and an IR remote for controlling everything. Because adjusting the sound on this thing without a remote wouldn't be very convenient. </p>
<p> Sound Blaster integrated Bluetooth into this as well. Which means you can easily connect it to any device that has Bluetooth. While it is meant for gaming, you could certainly connect your smartphone and stream music to it too if you wanted. </p>
<p> And it works for PC gaming, as well as PS4, Xbox One, and the upcoming Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PS5 consoles. </p>
<p> Best Gamepad For Xbox & PC </p>
<p> Xbox Elite Series 2 </p>
<p> Probably one of the most expensive gamepads you'll ever buy, but worth it if you want a custom gaming experience that's hard to find elsewhere. </p>
<p> The Elite Series 2 is also one of the best gaming accessories because it can be used with both the Xbox consoles as well as Windows 10 PCs. So you can flip it back and forth between your gaming platforms. </p>
<p> Aside from having a wonderfully comfortable design, the Elite Series 2 lets you adjust a ton of stuff. You can adjust the tension on the thumbsticks, swap out the thumbsticks and the paddles, and even set up customized profiles dedicated to specific games. </p>
<p> The triggers have textured grips on them now too. Bluetooth is the wireless technology here, and the controller has a USB-C port for charging or for wired play. You can also get up to 40 hours on a single charge. So it'll last you a while before needing to plug it in. </p>
<p> Best Budget Wireless Gaming Headset </p>
<p> SteelSeries Arctis 1 </p>
<p> Good quality wireless headsets can be expensive, but they don't have to be. Case in point – the SteelSeries Arctis 1 is a good quality wireless headset and it's pretty affordable. </p>
<p> Like nearly all SteelSeries gaming headsets, the Arctis 1 features a ClearCast microphone (this one is detachable instead of retractable) for voice chat. And the headset is Discord-certified so it'll work seamlessly when you're talking to your friends in whatever game you're playing. </p>
<p> It can also be used on multiple platforms including PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Mobile, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, and PS5. </p>
<p> The best part though is that the lossless wireless audio connects to devices using a USB-C transmitter. This makes it very easy to use with your phone if you like your mobile games. Since most phones these days charge using a USB-C port. </p>
<p> You'll need a USB-A to USB-C adapter though for devices that don't have a USB-C port. It also comes in a variety of color and design options. Like your standard black or white, as well as a special Cyberpunk 2077-themed model. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Headphone Stand </p>
<p> Razer Base Station Chroma </p>
<p> If you game, you may want to keep your setup as uniform as possible. That means having a headphone stand that matches the rest of your gear. </p>
<p> The best headphone stand for that is the Razer Base Station Chroma. It comes in the familiar matte black, as well as Razer's Mercury and Quartz colors. Though those models may be more than the black one. </p>
<p> The Base Station Chroma also of course has Chroma lighting at the base. It has three USB ports at the base as well so you can charge additional devices or keep them plugged into your PC without taking up your PC's actual ports. </p>
<p> These are perfect for having a nice organized location for your headphones and it puts them on display. So overall it adds to the aesthetic. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Gaming Headsets – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> A gaming headset is a must-have accessory for your gaming sessions for a number of different reasons and there are lots to choose from, but if you want the best ones as options, then you need to wade through the ones that aren't worth your effort. </p>
<p> We've put together a list that has ten different options for you so you can save some of that precious game time. Which means you can spend more time on gaming with a headset you'll love and less time trying to find something that works. Regardless of whether you're playing on PS4, PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, or other options like mobile or Stadia. </p>
<p> This is a rolling post so we'll be updating the list every month. The options on the list may not always change completely, but there will always be something that works for every user. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Best Gaming Headset Summary </p>
<p> Below you'll find a short summary table of all the best gaming headsets we've selected. </p>
<p> If you're short on time, you can scan the table below and see every option we picked, along with how much they cost and buy links to jump right to where you can get them for yourself. </p>
<p> Should you have a little more time, you'll find short descriptions of each headset below the summary table along with the same information as well as videos and buy links to snag the headset of your choice. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Headset For Xbox Users </p>
<p> SteelSeries Arctis 9X </p>
<p> There are a few reasons why this is the best gaming headset for Xbox users, but the most notable is that it works for both the Xbox One and the upcoming Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S. </p>
<p> Beyond that, it'll also work for PC. So you can use it for two different Xbox console generations, and your laptop or desktop. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When it comes to communication it has a Discord-certified ClearCast microphone so you can be heard in voice chat without any issues. And when this is paired with Discord's noise suppression feature it works even better. </p>
<p> It also offers an adjustable ski goggle headband, swivel ear cups, and Bluetooth technology so you could even connect it up to a mobile device if you wanted to. SteelSeries gave this a battery life of up to 20 hours, so you can game all night and not worry about having to charge it the next day. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Headset For PC Gamers </p>
<p> Sennheiser GSP 670 </p>
<p> When it comes to PC gaming, Sennheiser's GSP 670 is the cream of the crop. It's expensive, but Sennheiser knows audio and it's excellent on this headset. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Perhaps the best part is the mic. The swivel motion that lets you flip it up to mute the mic is the easiest way to mute yourself in chat. Period. The headset is also extremely comfortable and can be worn for all-day gaming sessions without getting uncomfortable. </p>
<p> Speaking of comfort, it features adjustable fit on both sides of the headset as well as on the top of the band for more or less tension. The mic is also noise cancelling. So even if you're using Discord which has a decent software-based noise filter, this just ensures that you're voice is coming through crystal clear. </p>
<p> And, you have separate volume dials for regular game audio and chat audio. Letting you adjust things perfectly. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It works for PC, PS4, and mobile devices too, and it offers extremely low-latency gaming audio. It works ok with PS4 and mobile, but it doesn't have the benefits of the PC software that really make the audio shine. For PC though there is no equal. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Headset For PS4 </p>
<p> Razer Nari Ultimate Wireless </p>
<p> You can't have a gaming headset list without mentioning Razer, because it makes some of the best gaming headsets in the industry. </p>
<p> The Nari Ultimate Wireless is the best option for PS4 players, because it's a good mix of function and form without being too pricey like other options, such as the Astro A50. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the Nari Ultimate Wireless, you can also use it for PC and not just PS4. So you get some dual use there. This headset features a retractable mic so you can put it away when you don't need it. </p>
<p> It also has lag-free, TXH spatial audio with 7.1 surround sound. Making the game immersion that much better while you play. </p>
<p> Razer made it comfortable too, and used cooling gel in the ear pads so your ears don't get overly warm during longer periods of use. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Best Gaming Headset For Lossless Audio </p>
<p> SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless </p>
<p> If you want lossless audio, and you want it to be high-quality, and wireless, the Arctis Pro Wireless from SteelSeries should be your pick. </p>
<p> This works with PC and PS4 via the wireless transmitter that you plug directly into the system that you're playing games on. The Headset then connects to that transmitter. </p>
<p> It's Discord certified meaning your game chat is going to be stellar, and it can be used for other devices that accept Bluetooth audio devices. It also has audio in and out plugs, so you could even plug it into home audio systems if you wanted. It can technically be used with Xbox One, but not wirelessly. </p>
<p> For it to work on that console you would need to plug the headset into the controller's audio jack. Even then there's no guarantee that the mic would work for game chat. </p>
<p> Still, this is the best headset for lossless audio if you need something for both PS4 and PC, and this works for mobile and Nintendo Switch too. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Headset For Gamers On A Budget </p>
<p> Razer Kraken X USB </p>
<p> Razer is once again on this list for our selection of the best budget headset. We've been big fans of the kraken line simply because it offered some of the best audio quality at a lower price. </p>
<p> And the Kraken X USB is essentially the pinnacle of that. It even comes in a 3.5mm version that's $49.99 instead of $59.99 if you have the hardware on your PC to support 3.5mm audio headsets. That version is also perfect for the Nintendo Switch, and mobile phones with an audio jack. </p>
<p> These feature 7.1 surround sound for more immersive gaming audio, soft leatherette ear cushions and a plushy headband cushion, a bendable mic, and in-headset audio controls. They're pretty basic, but the no-frills setup means you still get great audio for gaming without spending a whole lot. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Headset For Mobile </p>
<p> SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless </p>
<p> Razer isn't the only brand returning further down the list. SteelSeries makes all kinds of headsets and the Arctis 1 Wireless is the perfect option for mobile gamers. </p>
<p> This is another headset that's multi-platform, and works with four different systems. While we consider it the best option for mobile specifically, it also works with Nintendo Switch, PC, and PS4. </p>
<p> It has the same high-quality audio drivers as the Arctis 7, ultra-low latency lossless audio, a detachable mic that's Discord certified and features the ClearCast technology (never be unheard again), and of course an adjustable headband for better comfort that's also extremely durable because it's made of stainless steel. </p>
<p> Plus at $99 these are great for the price. </p>
<p> Best Premium Gaming Headset </p>
<p> Audeze Mobius </p>
<p> Audeze makes some truly amazing headphones for all situations. And low and behold they actually make some gaming headsets. </p>
<p> While this isn't quite the same level of premium as it's LCD-GX that costs a whopping $900, it's still up there with a premium price and it reflects that price with high-quality audio. </p>
<p> The Audeze Mobius are fantastic for a few reasons if you want something ultra premium. They're wireless, which means you don't have to be tethered to a cord while you play. They're also compatible with PC, PS4, Mobile, Nintendo Switch, and Mac. </p>
<p> You can also connect the headphones in three different ways. Through USB, Bluetooth, or through an analog cable if you want the best sound possible. </p>
<p> These also feature AAC and LDAC, a flexible and detachable boom mic, and they're Discord-certified. </p>
<p> Best ROG Gaming Headset </p>
<p> ASUS ROG Delta Core </p>
<p> ASUS makes some pretty good stuff in its ROG line which all focused on gaming, and the Delta Core is probably its best headset. It's not wireless, but it is very highly rated and it only costs $76. </p>
<p> So it's an excellent value at its price. It features high-res audio, and it's multi-platform and works with PC, Mac, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices if you have a USB adapter. </p>
<p> It also has on-headset media controls for easy audio adjustment and mic management/muting, as well as a retractable mic and ASUS' airtight chamber audio design for better immersion. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Headset For Spatial Audio </p>
<p> JBL Quantum One </p>
<p> While there are a few wired gaming headsets on this list, none of them can do what the JBL Quantum One can do. In fact none of the other headsets can either. At least not as good. </p>
<p> The JBL Quantum One is a headset that features excellent gaming immersion thanks to spatial audio and head tracking. The head tracking works in such a way that when you turn your head to the left or right, that's the ear that you hear most of the sound from. Just as you might if you turned your left or right ear towards sound coming from the right or left. </p>
<p> It also has active noise cancellation. Once this is on you really can't hear anything but what's playing through the headphones. It's quite amazing when you're knee deep in a game. If you need to talk to someone in the real world though, you can still leave the headset on thanks to the noise pass through. There's even a dedicated button for it. </p>
<p> Press it, and the headset will almost entirely mute the audio of the game and your chat, and let in noise from the world around you. It's rather clear too. This lets you talk to anyone in the real world who might need your attention for a few minutes, then quickly jump back into the game once you can get back to it. </p>
<p> Of course it also has things like a detachable Discord-certified microphone, RGB lighting, and the connection port is USB-C. Rounding out the big features are a super comfy adjustable headband and swivel ear cups. </p>
<p> Best Wired Gaming Headset </p>
<p> HyperX Cloud Alpha </p>
<p> HyperX has been around making gaming headsets for quite some time and the Cloud Alpha is one of its best. </p>
<p> This is a wired gaming headset and like many of the models HyperX makes, it features an aluminum frame so it's pretty durable and still very comfortable. </p>
<p> It also works with just about every platform, comes with dual chamber drivers, and large comfy earpads so you can wear these for long gaming sessions. </p>

<p> Android Buyers Guide / Top 8 Best Google Assistant Speakers – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> Top 8 Best Google Assistant Speakers – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> Those that are new to smart speakers may feel a bit overwhelmed in trying to find the best Google Assistant speaker for you. </p>
<p> These are the best Google Assistant speakers that are available today, in each area. There are speakers, smart displays, sound bars and much more all running the Google Assistant. The main thing to focus on when finding the best Google Assistant speakers is to pick a couple of features that are must-have features and go from there. Whether that be a display, great sound quality, or the form-factor, all of these play into what speaker would be the best for you. </p>
<p> Top 8 Best Google Assistant Speakers </p>
<p> These are the best Google Assistant speakers that you can buy, as of September 2020. From smart displays, to tiny speakers to sound bars, and everything in between. Google Assistant now runs on virtually everything. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's also something here for every price. From $49 all the way up to $1199. So no matter your budget, you can get a Google Assistant speaker for your home. </p>
<p> Best for Google Assistant smart speaker </p>
<p> Google Nest Audio </p>
<p> The Nest Audio was announced on September 30, as Google's newest smart speaker – with Google Assistant built in. This is a really incredible smart speaker to pick up for a number of reasons. But perhaps the most important reason is the fact that it is 100% made from recycled materials. </p>
<p> Nest Audio is now wrapped completely in fabric, and fits in better with Google's audio lineup. This model puts out some really incredible audio quality. With some deep bass, but crystal clear mids and highs. So you're getting a really incredible audio experience here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It comes in a slew of different colors, including chalk (white), charcoal (black), sage (green), sand (pink) and sky (blue). It is only $99, which puts it in-line with the Amazon Echo. </p>
<p> Best value Google Assistant speaker </p>
<p> Google Nest Mini </p>
<p> Formerly called the Google Home Mini, the Nest Mini is a small hockey-puck shaped smart speaker that does everything you'd expect from a smart speaker, for a small price. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is not a portable smart speaker, it does need to be plugged in all the time. As there is no battery built-in. </p>
<p> There are four LED lights on the top of the Nest Mini, which will indicate when Google Assistant is listening or when it is speaking to you. It will also indicate the volume of the speaker. </p>
<p> It can do virtually everything that the Google Assistant can do, but the main difference between this and the Nest Hub Max, is the screen. So Google Assistant will be talking to you only, here and not showing you information. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As a speaker, it doesn't sound incredible, but given the size and speaker, that should come as no surprise. Alternatively, you can connect another speaker to the Nest Mini. This is done over Bluetooth, and the setup is pretty easy. It's the same as setting up any Bluetooth speaker actually, you're just doing it in the Google Home app. </p>
<p> Best for audiophiles </p>
<p> Klipsch The Three </p>
<p> Just the name alone should tell you that this is a smart speaker for audiophiles. Klipsch is pretty well-known in that space, providing some great sounding speakers for those that have a fine-tuned ear for music. And the Klipsch The Three is no exception, even if the name is a bit confusing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This speaker wraps a modern design around the Google Assistant, which makes it a great fit for a bookshelf or a table in your living room. </p>
<p> On the audio front, there's a lot of hardware inside that is making this speaker sound so extraordinary. That includes a single 5.25-inch subwoofer, and two 5.25-inch passive radiators. This is going to provide you with some really good sounding bass that won't drown out the mids or highs. These combine to bring you 60W of power, and a peak of 80W. So it can get very loud. </p>
<p> Then there's the Google Assistant inside, and there's really no limitations on what the Google Assistant can and can't do. Whether you're asking about the weather, for the news, or to change your thermostat, it can do it all. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As expected, there is multi-room support for playing music on multiple speakers throughout your house. That is done through the Google Assistant, which should work better than via Bluetooth. Since the Assistant is using WiFi to sync the speakers. And it means that you can sync Klipsch The Three with a Nest Mini or another cheaper speaker. </p>
<p> Best for multi-room audio </p>
<p> Sonos One (Gen 2) </p>
<p> While multi-room audio is a feature of Google Home and Google Assistant, no one quite does it like Sonos. As Steve Jobs would say, "it just works". </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sonos One (Gen 2) works with all of Sonos' other speakers that are on the market. Including the PLAY:5, Beam, SYMFONISK and even the new Move, to name a few. With the tap of a button, you are able to group multiple speakers together and have them all play at the exact same time. The best part is, there is no lag at all. This is thanks to Sonos doing it all over WiFi. </p>
<p> Google Assistant does have multi-room audio, but it needs to go through a few more things before it plays on another speaker. Which brings some lag between them, so it's not quite the same experience as Sonos. </p>
<p> Sonos One (Gen 2) also brings some really great audio, it's not quite on the same level as the Klipsch the Three, but it's fairly close. While you can ask Google to stream music from Spotify, Google Play Music or another provider, Sonos also has them available in their app. Since Sonos uses WiFi instead of Bluetooth, your favorite service provider also needs to be available on the Sonos platform, to use with voice control. But that shouldn't be a problem, as just about every service you can think of (and some you've never heard of) are available on Sonos. </p>
<p> Google Assistant is built-in (along with Amazon Alexa), and it can do everything that all of these other speakers can do. Answer questions, control your smart home products and so much more. Not to mention the fact that it also looks really nice in either black or white. </p>
<p> Best speaker with a display </p>
<p> Lenovo Smart Display 7 </p>
<p> Smart displays are starting to become a much bigger deal for Google's partners, and the one that is really taking the lead is Lenovo. The new Lenovo Smart Display 7 is the best Google Assistant smart speaker with a display. </p>
<p> It sports a 7-inch display. Lenovo went with a smaller display on this model after feedback from its customers, that wanted to put a smart display into their kitchen, but didn't have the space for a 10-inch model. So with this 7-inch smart display, it's great for placing on the counter-top in your kitchen and use for following recipes and even watching some YouTube videos. </p>
<p> With its pretty small bezels, this is one of the best looking smart displays on the market right now. </p>
<p> Lenovo also put the speaker below the display, as opposed to on the left side, like on its older smart displays, because of customer feedback. The speaker is now much improved and actually sounds really incredible. Lenovo wrapped the speaker in fabric, which gives it a nice modern look, without making the smart display more expensive. It also doesn't affect the audio coming out of the speaker. </p>
<p> While there is a camera on the front of the Smart Display 7, Lenovo has still included a physical camera shutter. So when you turn off the camera, you can actually see that it has been turned off. As the camera turns red, so it literally can't see what you're doing. This is going to save you from needing to put some tape or a post-it note over the camera. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Display 7 is also one of the cheaper options out there, coming in with a price tag of $129. </p>
<p> Best portable speaker </p>
<p> Bose Portable Home Speaker </p>
<p> Believe it or not, there aren't many portable speakers with the Google Assistant built-in. So if you're looking for one, you won't find many. But this brand new portable speaker from Bose is definitely the best that you can buy. Just look at that hardware. </p>
<p> The Bose Portable Home Speaker is available in two colors: black and white. Each of which are made from aluminum and soft-touch plastic. Which just looks incredible. There are also built-in handles, making it easy to take these to the beach, or wherever life may take you. Expect it to last around 12 hours on a single charge, that's with continuous playback. So if it's not playing music the entire time, it will last longer. </p>
<p> Not to mention, this is also waterproof, so you can actually take it to the beach and toss it into the water without worrying about killing the speaker. </p>
<p> Sound quality on the Bose Portable Home Speaker is exactly what you might expect. Especially if you've used a Bose product before. You're going to get some really crisp mids and highs, and a decent amount of bass. It won't be overpowering, but it will sound really good. </p>
<p> Inside you'll find the Google Assistant (and Amazon Alexa, so it does support both like the Sonos One). With the Google Assistant built-in, you can ask to have your favorite music from Google Play Music, Spotify and other providers playing on this speaker. Or you can turn off your smart lights, ask questions and so much more. The abilities that the Google Assistant has are pretty much endless. </p>
<p> Best sound bar </p>
<p> Harman Kardon Citation Bar </p>
<p> It sports a premium industrial design that is also covered in wool fabric. It gives it a very nice look that will fit any home. Especially with the fact that it is available in black or white. </p>
<p> When talking about sound quality, this is the best in the business. Harman Kardon's signature sound is available on the Citation Bar, which is going to provide you with a real upgrade over the speakers that are built into your TV. </p>
<p> It'll allow you to play your music anywhere, seeing as it does have multi-room capabilities with the other Citation speakers in its lineup. Adding more Citation speakers would be great for creating a surround sound setup, which the Citation Bar does support. But of course, you can also do multi-room with the Google Assistant, since that is also available here. </p>
<p> Finally, there is the Google Assistant built-in. Allowing you to ask Spotify to play the latest from Post Malone on your Harman Kardon Citation Bar, without having to pick up your smartphone. Google Assistant can also answer any questions you might have, as well as control your smart home products, and much more. </p>
<p> Best value sound bar </p>
<p> Sonos Beam </p>
<p> Compared to the Harman Kardon Citation Bar, the Sonos Beam is an absolute steal. Coming in at close to a fourth of the price. It's also much smaller, and it features both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. </p>
<p> Sonos Beam can actually control your entire TV, using your voice. This is because it is using HDMI ARC, which is a somewhat new standard (though most TVs made after 2015 should have it), it will allow the device to control the TV as well. So with the Sonos Beam, you can ask the Google Assistant to switch the input to another HDMI port. </p>
<p> It also offers some really incredible sound. There's a ton of bass here, as well as some pretty good sounding mids and highs. This is all customizable in the Sonos app, so if you want more bass, you can turn it up. </p>
<p> Sonos Beam does work with the Sonos One that is also on this list, for some great multi-room audio. Or you can use them to set up wireless surround sound in the living room. This means that you can play the same audio throughout the house, without any lag whatsoever. It's one of the big selling points of Sonos speakers. </p>
<p> It's super simple to setup, and you can control it through the Sonos app. That also includes switching from the Google Assistant to Amazon Alexa – that's right, the Beam is another smart speaker that supports both digital voice assistants. Which makes it one of the best Google Assistant speakers on the market. </p>

<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Skype is one of the most popular video call services in the world. This service has been bought by Microsoft a long time ago, and its Android app is quite great, actually. It works great, and it offers everything a regular video calling service should offer. On top of that, this app does serve as a messaging app as well. </p>
<p> The design is flat, and it's actually quite a joy to both look at and use. You can make HD video calls with Skype, and you can do that with up to 24 contacts. When it comes to chatting, mentions are a part of the offering, and you can also great groups, if you'd like. The SMS Connect feature is also a part of Skype, as you'll be able to replay to your phone's SMS messages via your PC or Mac, thanks to this feature. </p>

In any case, this app has been getting better and better over the years, and it is now one of the top messaging and video calling apps out there. </p>
<p> Messenger actually allows you to conduct a voice chat with up to 8 people at the same time, with high quality audio, and high definition video. On top of that, it offers various interactive content in the form of face filters. Such content is constantly being added to the app, and there are tons of options to choose from at the moment. </p>

<p> This app is, first and foremost, a messaging app, though. That's the area where it truly shines. It has support for GIFs, you can send images and videos via this app, and so on. It is also worth noting that voice calls are also supported, as you may have guessed. You can also send voice messages, if you'd like, while the app does support a dark mode. </p>

<p> Signal </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Signal is one of the most popular 'private' messengers out there. This application is heavily focused on privacy and security, even though it's not as popular as some other offerings on the list. The app offerings "state-of-the-art" end-to-end encryption, which is powered by the open source Signal Protocol. Privacy isn't an optional mode in this app. </p>
<p> That being said, this app does offer HD video calls, while the same goes for voice calls as well. Do note that Signal is not exactly focused on group calls, but it works great when it comes to one-on-one calls, that's for sure. The app also works as a messaging service as well, that is its main purpose </p>
<p> The app's UI is extremely simplistic, and that's a good thing. This app is extremely easy to navigate and use. It combines a white background with mostly blue hues. Signal also allows you to send images, videos, audio, GIFs, or any file type you'd like. Group chats are also supported. </p>

<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Viber is one of the world's most popular messaging platforms, and it's also used for video calls, intensively. Depending on the market you live in, Viber is either extremely popular, or a blimp on the map. Well, it turns out that a lot of people not only use this app for messaging, but also for video and voice calling. </p>
<p> Viber allows you to participate in a group call with up to 20 people, though we're talking about voice calls here. Video calls are also supported, though, and they do function really well. Viber does offer a ton of stickers for you to choose from, while it has support for GIFs as well. </p>
<p> You can send over images and videos via this platform, without a problem. Self-destruct secret chats are also an option in this application, while chat extensions are also at your disposal. All in all, Viber has a lot to offer in all areas, pretty much, so it's not surprising it's so popular. </p>

<p> WhatsApp </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 4.0.3+ </p>
<p> WhatsApp is just as popular, if not more popular than Viber. This app is actually quite similar to Viber. You'll need your mobile phone number in order to activate it on a device you're using. Once you do that, you'll get access to a ton of its features, and those features include video calls. </p>
<p> Despite the fact WhatsApp has a ton of features to offer, this app is extremely easy to use. its menus are not cluttered or difficult to understand. You do have some options to customize the app as well, if you want. You can change the background of your chats, while you can also darken up the app if you want as well. </p>
<p> WhatsApp is also a multi-platform app, so staying in touch with your contacts is fairly easy, as long as they use the app. WhatsApp does support video and voice calls, and they both work really well, at least in our testing. This application is completely free to use. </p>
<p> Best Google Duo Android app alternative for group video chats </p>
<p> ZOOM </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 5.0+ </p>
<p> Zoom has had its fair share of privacy and security-related issues up to this point. The company was under the microscope for quite some time, but it seems like things are handled now. This app became extremely popular earlier this year, and the COVID-19 pandemic probably helped it shine. </p>
<p> ZOOM is a great and simple app for video calls, though its core purpose is to be used for meetings. This app is being used for chatting with friends and family quite a bit, though, and it does a great job at that. You can video chat with up to 100 people at the same time, and that's not something many apps can offer. </p>
<p> We haven't really had a chance to test this app with 100 people at the same time, but it's possible. You can also receive phone calls via this application, and messaging is also included. This app also supports sending over images, links, GIFs, and so on. You can even collaborate on-the-go- with this app, as it offers mobile screen sharing, co-annotation over shared content, and so on. </p>
<p> Best Google Duo Android app alternative for hanging out with friends </p>
<p> Houseparty </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: 5.0+ </p>
<p> Houseparty is yet another app that flourished in the last year or so. This is a face-to-face social network that allows you to hang out with friends. It's a bit different than every other app on the list, as it allows you to even play games with your friends. It truly is supposed to be an online hanging out-type of the app. </p>
<p> You can, for example, play UNO with your friends, in addition to a number of other games. The whole concept aims to make you feel as if you are hanging out with your friends in the same place, even though you're online. Hence the name of this application, which explains it perfectly. </p>
<p> This app allows you to squeeze quite a few of your friends / family into a single conversation. The video call side of things works great, by the way. The app is completely free to use, though do note that in-app purchases are included here. </p>
<p> Best NBA Android app for statistics </p>
<p> JusTalk </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: 4.1+ </p>
<p> JusTalk is quite possibly the least popular app from this list, and yet, it definitely deserves to be here. It's a great video chatting service, that's for sure. It can offer great video quality, even if you're connected to a 3G service at the time, which is great to see. This app does offer various other options while you're in a video call, by the way. </p>
<p> It allows you to doodle on the screen while you're chatting, while you can also send images during video calls. The app also offers some customization options, as you can theme it to a degree. Texting is also included in the package, as you can text your contacts without a problem, as you would with a regular messaging app. </p>
<p> This app has a rather low data usage as well, while voice calling is supported as well. You can conduct group video calls via JusTalk if you want as well, and that service works really well too. The app's design is quite minimalistic, and quite frankly, the UI is laid out perfectly, the app is a joy to use. </p>
<p> Best NBA Android app for radio coverage </p>
<p> Hangouts </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> The Hangouts app will soon become a thing of the past. It will be replaced by an another app, but while it's still here, it's a competitor to Google Duo, kind of. Well, we'd say an alternative, not exactly a competitor. In any case, Hangouts does offer the video call service, similar to Google Duo. </p>
<p> Hangouts app also supports group video calls (up to 10 people), and the same goes for voice calls as well. You can also organize group text chats if you'd like, as you can put a ton of people in a single group. The app also allows you to send over images, video, while it does have support for GIFs (via Gboard) as well, and the same goes for stickers. </p>
<p> You can even connect your Google Voice account for phone calling and SMS texting to this application. The design of Hangouts is still quite relevant, even though Google almost completely abandoned this app, in terms of development. Hangouts is still worth using, while it's around. </p>

<p> Top 9 Best Google Hangouts App Alternatives For Android – 2020 </p>
<p> It has been quite some time since Google announced the demise of Google Hangouts. The app is still around, though, even though it probably won't linger around for long. The company already released a number of updates which removed some of the app's features, and the app hasn't really gotten a new feature in a long time. Google has a tendency of killing its services, service that it deems are not doing good enough. Google Hangouts is one of those services, and that's why we've compiled a list of Google Hangouts app alternatives for Android, for you to check out. </p>
<p> Do note that both Google Meet and Google Chat will remain available, at least for the time being. Google is basically keeping these two apps around to replace Google Hangouts, in a way. Many would argue that there are much better alternatives out there, which is why we've put together a list of them. There are tons of instant messaging services available in the Google Play Store, many of which do a better job than Google Hangouts did. We've tried to compile a rather versatile list of applications here, so no matter whether you need a more business-oriented service, or something for communicating with your friends, we got you covered. </p>
<p> Top 9 Best Google Hangouts App Alternatives For Android 2020 </p>
<p> Below is a quick overview of the top 9 best Google Hangouts app alternatives for Android for 2020, including any download and in-app purchase costs. </p>
<p> Top 9 Best Google Hangouts App Alternatives For Android 2020 Downloads </p>
<p> Below is a little more information on each app, a suggestion for the type of user the app is best suited to, and a direct link for easy downloading. </p>
<p> All download links go to the app's Google Play Store listing. Users are always recommended to download apps from Google Play or an authorized app store. </p>
<p> Best Google Hangouts Android app alternative from Google </p>

<p> Google Messages </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> The 'Messages' app, also known as Google Messages, is a solid alternative for Hangouts, but only if its RCS messaging is available in your region. The 'chat features' of the Google Messages app have rolled out to a number of regions around the world. Those are also referred to RCS messaging features, and that is something you need to activate within the app's settings. </p>
<p> If you enable it, you'll be able to send messages over the Internet to users who have that option activated as well. It sounds a bit convoluted, and it currently is, so it probably isn't the best solution for everyone. The benefit here is, that you can send SMS messages to users who don't have that option activated, from the very same chat window. This is essentially Google's competition to iMessage, though it needs to mature, that's for sure. </p>
<p> Best Google Hangouts Android app alternative for minimalists </p>
<p> WhatsApp </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 4.1+ </p>
<p> WhatsApp is one of the world's most popular instant messaging platforms, and it's a great alternative to Google Hangouts. The downside of this app is that you can use it on only one smartphone at the moment, as it ties in with your mobile number. That being said, the design of the app is really flat, and minimalistic, and the app works really well. It's extremely fluid, and that has been the case for a long time. </p>
<p> This app, much like various other instant messaging apps in the market, allows you to send images, videos, GIFs, and so on. The app also allows you to make free calls over the Internet as well. Group chats are supported, while the WhatsApp Web option is also available, as you can chat with people over your desktop computer, if you want. There are a ton of additional features here, and yet the app doesn't push things too far in that regard. </p>
<p> Best Google Hangouts Android app alternative for speed </p>
<p> Telegram </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Telegram is one of the fastest instant messaging apps in the market, if not the fastest one. This app is extremely well-optimized, and it will offer you a great experience. The app also puts a huge focus on security. Everything you send via this application is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie-Hellman secure key exchange. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In other words, if you're worried about security, this is one of the best apps you can have installed. The app allows you to send images, videos, GIFs, and even documents, if that's something you need. Ads are not included, and the app is completely free to use. The UI design is quite simple, and yet extremely functional. The bottom line is, Telegram is a joy to use. </p>
<p> Best Google Hangouts Android app alternative for security </p>
<p> Signal </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 4.4+ </p>
<p> If security and privacy is your main worry when it comes to messaging apps, Signal is one of the best options out there. This application offers end-to-end encryption, and is completely independent. This is an open-source platform, it's non-profit. Its development is supported by users, while it doesn't have trackers, at all. It is powered by the open source Signal Protocol (end-to-end encryption). </p>
<p> The app's UI is extremely simplistic, and that's what many people will appreciate. This app doesn't throw unnecessary features your way, but everything you'd expect out of an instant messaging app is included. You can send your pictures, videos, and GIFs without a problem. Both voice and video calls are supported by the application, and you do have some added options here. </p>
<p> Best Google Hangouts Android app alternative for Facebook users </p>
<p> Facebook Messenger </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Facebook's 'Messenger' platform grew into one of the most popular messaging platforms on the planet. Tons of people use this service, and it has gotten a lot better in the last couple of years. Facebook Messenger used to be extremely bloated, and had issues with performance, but that's no longer the case. The app is extremely snappy, while it also has its own unique look, which people don't seem to be opposed to. </p>
<p> Messenger is also packed with features. Sending photos, videos, GIFs, stickers, and files is a piece of cake here. You can also make voice and video calls, and both group chats and calls are also supported by the app. Pitch black dark mode is also supported here, while you can also send money via this app, though that feature is enabled in the US only. Sharing a location is also an option, and so on. There are a ton of features included here. </p>
<p> Best Google Hangouts Android app alternative for group calls </p>
<p> Viber </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Viber is yet another extremely popular instant messaging app. It's extremely popular in some regions, so it all depends on where you live. The app is packed with features, and one that we'd like to highlight are group calls up to 20 people. I've tested the app in a group call with about 6-7 people, and it worked just fine. So if you'd like to replace Google Hangouts with an app that supports such a feature, in addition to regular messaging, Viber is a great choice. </p>
<p> The app's UI is also really well thought out. The app looks quite flat, and yet different from its competitors. The app does offer end-to-end encryption, and it allows you to send images, videos, GIFs, stickers, and so on. There are various chat extensions that you can utilize in Viber, such as Yelp, Booking, Spotify, and so on. The app does also offer in-app purchases, and ads, but it won't force you to buy anything. </p>
<p> Best Google Hangouts Android app alternative for gamers </p>
<p> Discord </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: 5.0+ </p>
<p> If you've, by any chance, used Hangouts to talk about games… well, there's a much better solution for that. Discord is a dedicated app for gamers, which comes with its own set of features. Discord is kind of a unique app, and it's definitely not your regular instant messaging application. The good news is, it has a ton of users at the moment, and if you're a gamer, this app is a must-have. </p>
<p> You can create a community for your friends via this app, or perhaps for your fans. The app does allow you to chat with people, and also send over images and videos. Do you need voice calls? Well, don't worry, as that feature is also enabled here. Custom moderation tools are included, while you can also create moderators for the community you make. The app also looks really nice, while it offers in-app purchases. You won't be forced to purchase anything, though. </p>
<p> Best Google Hangouts Android app alternative for random chats </p>
<p> Kik </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 4.1+ </p>
<p> Kik is an instant messaging app that most of you probably newer tried out, even though you may have heard of it. This app is quite popular in some circles, as many people use it for random chats with people they don't know. That's not its only use case, of course, as you can add people you know to your list of contacts. It is, however, great for random chats with strangers, if you ever feel like you're up for something like that. </p>
<p> This app does come with a really simple UI, like most apps on this list. It does allow you to send images, videos, stickers, and so on. Just like a regular instant messaging app. On top of that, you can purchase additional sticker packs if you're interested. Group chats are supported, and so are video chats. </p>
<p> Best Google Hangouts Android app alternative for businesses </p>
<p> Slack </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Slack is a great productivity tool, first and foremost. This is not your regular instant messaging app, as it's more oriented towards businesses. Well, it's oriented towards groups of people who work together, basically. Slack allows you to create channels for communication, and helps you work on various projects and tasks. It also allows you to call a co-worker, if needed. </p>
<p> You can also open various documents in Slack, as it offers integration with a number of services, including Dropbox, Asana, Twitter, Google Drive and so much more. Notifications are also customizable in Slack, while the app allows you to easily search for conversations and files. The app offers a really simple design, and it does not sports ads nor in-app purchases. </p>

<p> Top 7 Best Google Pixel 4a Cases </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 4a is officially out, and that means that it is time to find a good case to put on your brand new smartphone. So, we have rounded up the very best cases available right now, for the Pixel 4a. </p>
<p> Even though the Pixel 4a has a plastic back, and therefore not as fragile as other smartphones, it's still a good idea to get a case and protect it. You never know when you might end up dropping it. Even though the Pixel 4a is only $349, it's still a good idea to protect that investment. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Google Pixel 4a Cases </p>
<p> The cases on this list run from fabric cases – like the official Google one – to some clear cases, even some polycarbonate cases that are pretty plain. But the one thing that all of these cases have in common is, the fact that they will protect your phone. That's the most important thing when it comes to a case, is does it protect the phone you're buying it for. And all of these do. </p>
<p> Best case </p>
<p> Google Pixel 4a Fabric Case </p>
<p> The fabric case from Google is by far one of our favorites for any Pixel device. But these are not cheap cases. They are normally around $40, right now the fabric case is only in stock in one color and it's discounted for now. That's because the phone just launched, but we should see the cases come back in stock pretty soon. </p>
<p> We like this case so much because it feels really nice in the hand. It adds a ton of grip, in fact I don't think I've ever dropped a phone with this case on it. It's also made from recycled material, which is a bonus. And finally, it protects the phone rather well. As you can see from the image above, it does have a lip over the display too. </p>
<p> Best semi-rugged case </p>
<p> Spigen Rugged Armor </p>
<p> The Spigen Rugged Armor is a tried and true case. It is available for virtually every smartphone released in the past five years. It hasn't really changed much either, and that's not a bad thing. </p>
<p> This case is a pretty thin TPU case from Spigen, but it also provides plenty of protection. There is a slight lip for the display, to keep it protected if it does fall. It also covers all the sides and the back of the device. There are no cutouts for the power or volume buttons, but they are still pretty usable in the Rugged Armor case. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's a pretty plain looking case. With a soft-touch plastic backside and some carbon fiber towards the bottom. This isn't going to win any awards for the best looking case for Google Pixel 4a, but it does its job. And that's the important part here. </p>
<p> Best dual-layer case </p>
<p> Incipio DualPro Case </p>
<p> The Inicipio DualPro is another case that's pretty good for the Pixel 4a. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's a dual-layer case that will provide a ton of protection for your Pixel 4a. It has a soft inner layer that protects the phone. And then a hard-shell on the outside that will protect your phone if it does fall out of your hands. The DualPro is a pretty thick case actually, but it does its job, of protecting your phone quite well. </p>
<p> Best case with kickstand </p>
<p> Spigen Tough Armor </p>
<p> The Spigen Tough Armor is similar to the Rugged Armor case that is already on this list. Except it's thicker and a bit more expensive. </p>
<p> If you're a bit of a klutz or drop your phone somewhat often, then this is going to be the case to get. It's thicker, with reinforced corners and edges, that will take more impact when the phone is dropped. It isn't guaranteed to keep your phone from cracking or shattering, but it is more likely to do so. But it does have MIL-STD 810G-516.6 certification. Thanks to the Air Cushion Technology that is in the sides and corners of the case. </p>
<p> Of course, there is a pretty decently sized lip on the Pixel 4a with this case, so that it will protect that beautiful display. There are tactile buttons on the side for power and volume. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is going to add a bit of weight and bulk to your Pixel 4a. So keep that in mind before you opt to get this one. Additionally, it will still work with wireless charging. So if you were worried about that, don't be. Most cases will still work with wireless charging, unless they are insanely thick – like an Otterbox. </p>
<p> Best textured case </p>
<p> Caseology Vault for Google Pixel 4a </p>
<p> The Caseology Vault case for the Pixel 4a is a heavy-duty yet lightweight layer of TPU that provides shock absorption for most impacts. It has also been precision engineered to snugly guard your phone’s most vulnerable points, down to detailed cutouts paired with tactile button response. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Along with being certified military grade protection backed by drop tests–minimal design meets maximum protection. It means that it is definitely going to do a great job of keeping your phone protected. </p>
<p> This is all while being pretty thin, considering how much protection it is offering the Pixel 4a here. </p>
<p> Best thin case </p>
<p> Huness Google Pixel 4a Case with Screen Protector </p>
<p> The Huness Google Pixel 4a Case with Screen Protector is a really good value for this phone. And it also comes with a screen protector, so you can definitely keep the Pixel 4a protected. </p>
<p> This is a pretty thin case for the Pixel 4a, which is great for those that don't want their phone to be big and bulky. It does protect everything on the Pixel 4a, and even has a pretty decent lip over the display. Which is really nice to have. There are also cut outs for the headphone jack, and even the microphones. So the user experience isn't hindered. </p>
<p> Best rugged case </p>
<p> OtterBox Commuter Series Case </p>
<p> Those that are prone to dropping their phone, may want to spend their $40 on the OtterBox Commuter Series Case. This is a rugged case for the Pixel 4a that does very well with drops and such. It comes in a ton of other colors, other than this "Cupids Way Pink" that OtterBox is calling this. </p>
<p> It's a dual-layer case, with a soft shell that goes against the phone and then a hard outer layer that will protect it from any drops. It will also take the impact too. That way your case gets damaged and not your phone. It's much easier to replace a $40 case than a $350 smartphone. </p>

<p> Google announced the Pixel 5 on September 30, and opened pre-orders the same day. It's available from a wide-array of retailers and carriers, some of which are offering some really incredible deals for the Pixel 5. </p>

<p> AT&T will be offering the Pixel 5, but has not yet announced pricing or opened pre-orders. </p>
<p> You can also purchase the Pixel 5 from Amazon, B&H Photo and the Google Store. All three retailers offer up the unlocked Pixel 5 (Google Store also does Google Fi and Verizon). Pixel 5 is available in Just Black and Sorta Sage. </p>

<p> Some see the Sony WH-1000X M3 as the best noise canceling headphones around. And well, everyone is entitled to their opinion. </p>
<p> But the reason why so many people love these, is because of the impressive noise cancellation, ambient sound and how comfortable these are. The Sony WH-1000X M3 are made of plastic, which makes them lighter. And that also makes them more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. </p>
<p> Noise cancellation is really good on the Sony WH-1000X M3, because there are microphones on both sides. You can change the level of noise cancellation as well. Which is very helpful.

<p> The AUKEY Bluetooth Headphones are the cheapest on this list, and have the most vanilla name on this list. But these are the best, inexpensive headphones available. At just $25, these offer a lot. And they are great for those that don't need the best audio quality, or truly wireless headphones. But just need something for those Zoom calls. </p>
<p> These headphones offer up some decent audio quality, though they can't compete with Bose or Sony. These also offer some decent battery life. We're looking at around eight to ten hours of battery life on a charge with these. </p>
<p> And they are super compact, so they won't take up much space on your desk, which is nice to see. </p>
<p> Best Truly Wireless Headphones with Amazon Alexa built-in </p>

<p> Top 7 Best Keyboards For Working From Home – May 2020 </p>
<p> Many of us are still adjusting to working from home, and something we all need is one of the best keyboards available. This is because we spend the majority of our day using a keyboard if we are working on a computer. And AndroidHeadlines staff definitely knows the best keyboards that are available. Considering we spend the majority of our day typing articles on the site, writing tens of thousands of words a day. </p>
<p> So we have rounded up the very best keyboards for working from home. </p>
<p> Top 7 Best Keyboards For Working From Home – May 2020 </p>
<p> These keyboards range from mechanical, to gaming, to even OS-specific keyboards. Bringing you the best keyboard for whatever type of user you might be. I myself use the Apple Magic Keyboard since I use a MacBook Pro and absolutely love it. These keyboards also hit all sorts of price points, some are around $50, and some can be over $100. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's important to keep in mind that you will want a good and comfortable keyboard. And to get that, you may need to spend a bit more than you'd want, normally. </p>
<p> Cost </p>
<p> Where to buy </p>
<p> Logitech MX Keys Advanced Wireless Illuminated Keyboard </p>
<p> Best keyboard </p>
<p> Logitech MX Keys Advanced Wireless Illuminated Keyboard </p>
<p> The Logitech MX Keys Advanced Wireless Illuminated Keyboard is the best keyboard you can buy, because it checks so many boxes. This is a mechanical keyboard, but not the best mechanical keyboard. It also works on both macOS and Windows with ease, and it's wireless. Not to mention the fact that it has a dedicated number pad. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Since this is a Logitech keyboard, it also has Flow functionality. What this means is that you can use it multiple devices at the same time. This is really cool for copying things from a phone to a computer, or to type on multiple devices at the same time. </p>
<p> At $99, this a pretty decent price for the Logitech MX Keys Advanced keyboard. As many others on this list are going to cost more. </p>
<p> Best RGB Keyboard </p>
<p> Corsair K55 RGB Gaming Keyboard </p>
<p> The Corsair K55 RGB Gaming Keyboard is a RGB keyboard that is also a mechanical keyboard. Which is going to be good for gaming, but also looks really cool on your desk. It has a built-in wrist pad that is going to make it super comfortable to type on, on your desk, which is always nice to have. </p>
<p> Surprisingly, it is also dust and water-resistant at IP42. So if you do spill your drink on your keyboard, you aren't totally screwed, which is some good news for most people. For the gamers out there, the Corsair K55 RGB Gaming Keyboard also has six macro keys that are programmable as well. </p>
<p> Best e-Sports Keyboard </p>
<p> SteelSeries is pretty well-known for its gaming products, and this gaming keyboard is really no different. The SteelSeries Apex 7 TKL Compact Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a great looking gaming mechanical keyboard that offers up some sweet RGB lighting too. </p>
<p> What sets this one apart though is the mini OLED smart display that is on the right side of the keyboard. It is an integrated command center for adjusting settings and tracking on the fly info straight from your game, Spotify, discord, and more. Which, is actually really cool. Imagine interacting with Discord without leaving your game. </p>
<p> For those interested, these use Red Switches for the mechanical keys. </p>
<p> Best Ergonomic Keyboard </p>
<p> Logitech Ergo K860 Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard </p>
<p> You're going to be at your desk for a while, if you're working from home. So you'll want to be comfortable. And you'll want a very ergonomic keyboard. Luckily, the Logitech Ergo K860 Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard is very ergonomic. In fact, it's even in the name. And this particular one has a wrist pad built-in, making it even more comfortable. </p>
<p> This is going to take a few days to get used to typing on, but once you do get used to it, it's going to be amazing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is a wireless keyboard, but it does not use Bluetooth. Instead, the Logitech Ergo K860 Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard uses a USB dongle. So you're going to want to make sure you don't lose that one. </p>
<p> Best Mechanical Keyboard </p>
<p> HyperX Alloy Origins </p>
<p> The HyperX Alloy Origins is a really good mechanical keyboard that you can pick up and use for gaming too. Now, this keyboard doesn't have the macros of some of the other keyboards on this list. So it's not perfect for gaming, but it'll get the job done. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As with most mechanical keyboards, this does also have RGB available, for some really cool colors and to give your desk a bit of color. </p>
<p> The HyperX Mechanical Switches are rated for over 80 million keystrokes. So this should keep you going for quite some time – or at least until the office opens up again. This is also a great keyboard because it does have the dedicated number pad on the right. </p>
<p> Best for Mac Users </p>
<p> Apple Magic Keyboard </p>
<p> All of the keyboards on this list do work with the Mac, but this is still the best option for Mac users. This has all of the Mac functionality built right in, and it pairs seamlessly. Not to mention the fact that it also has some pretty incredible battery life. We're talking months on a charge. </p>
<p> Now unlike its laptops, the Magic Keyboard still uses the Scissor switches and not the Butterfly switches. So you won't have any problems with this keyboard dying after a while. </p>
<p> For Mac users this keyboard is so great because it has the same layout as their laptops' keyboard, making it pretty seamless. And those scissor switches are really nice too. </p>
<p> Best minimal keyboard </p>
<p> Artech 2.5G Wireless Keyboard </p>
<p> This is the cheapest keyboard on this list, by a long shot. But it is also the most minimal keyboard on this list. Offering up a pretty low profile, the Artech 2.5G Wireless Keyboard is great for those with a smaller work space, or those that just want to stay minimal. Making it one of the best keyboards for working from home. </p>
<p> The Artech 2.5G Wireless Keyboard uses a USB dongle for wireless connectivity. So there's no Bluetooth here, which is what likely makes this keyboard so cheap, honestly. </p>
<p> This is a stainless steel keyboard and would work great for your laptop, phone, TV or anything else that needs a keyboard. </p>

<p> This Is The Best Laptop For Students </p>
<p> Does your student need a new laptop for school this year? Well, we have found the very best laptop for students, and it fits all students. From elementary up to College. Though elementary students may not need a computer this powerful, unless they want to do some gaming. </p>
<p> That laptop is the Microsoft Surface Laptop 3. </p>
<p> Why is it the best laptop for students? </p>
<p> Firstly, the Surface Laptop 3 is a lightweight, and clean looking laptop. That also comes in a few different colors, so students can get one that fits their style the best. </p>
<p> It's also pretty well specced. And comes in two sizes, 13.5-inch and 15-inch. So whether your student wants something on the smaller side, or something on the larger side, there's something for both of them. </p>
<p> We also cannot forget about the Alcantara on the keyboard and trackpad. Which makes typing on this laptop an absolute joy. Especially if you're spending all day in front of the screen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Battery life on the Surface Laptop 3 is pretty good, coming in at 11.5 hours of usage. That should be enough to get through a school day and then some. And if you need some extra juice, you can use your phone charger to charge the Surface Laptop 3. That's right, it charges via USB-C, though you will need something bigger than a 18W charger to charge this one. </p>
<p> Surface Laptop 3 also uses Windows Hello, making it super simple to login in a pinch. This uses the webcam that is built into the bezel, and that's something that students are going to need for those Zoom and BlueJeans calls that they will be on all semester long. </p>
<p> Speaking of things students will be using all semester long, you can also access Microsoft Office 365 on the Surface Laptop 3. Making it easier to deal with email, Word documents, Powerpoint presentations and much more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's a really great package, even though you can probably get something higher-specced for a lower price, the features, and portability of the Surface Laptop 3 make it a much better option. </p>
<p> Is it a good laptop for gaming? </p>
<p> The Surface Laptop 3 is not a gaming laptop. But that does not mean you can't use it for gaming. </p>
<p> It runs on a tenth-generation Intel Core i5 chipset, and you can get an upgraded model with an i7 inside. So this is a very capable machine. </p>

<p> The 13.5-inch model comes with Intel Iris Plus graphics. Those aren't the best, but it will get the job done. </p>
<p> If you want something with a more powerful graphics card, pick up the 15-inch model. This year, the 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 is an AMD-powered laptop. With the Ryzen 5 running things. And it comes with the AMD Radeon Vega 9 or you can upgrade to AMD Radeon RX Vega 11 Graphics. That's a big upgrade over the 13.5-inch model.

<p> How much is it, and where can I get it? </p>
<p> The Surface Laptop 3 normally starts at $1299 for the 13.5-inch model and $1499 for the 15-inch model. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, at the time of writing this, all of the Surface Laptop 3 configurations are at least $300 off of their regular prices. So you can get a 13.5-inch for $999, or the 15-inch for $1199. Which are really great prices, putting them on par with the MacBook Air. </p>
<p> The base model comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage. There are also models with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD and finally 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. </p>
<p> For the majority of people, the base model is going to be perfectly fine. But if you would like more RAM, then the 16GB/256GB is another good option. That price is $1249 currently ($1549 normally). </p>

<p> Both the 13.5 and 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 comes in four colors – Platinum, Cobalt Blue, Matte Black, and Sandstone. The Sandstone and Cobalt Blue come with alcantara on the keyboard.

<p> Best Value Laptop </p>
<p> Microsoft Surface Pro 7 </p>
<p> The Microsoft Surface Pro 7 might not be the cheapest option on this list, but it is the best value. Even at $1199 – there are cheaper models, but they have been out of stock for weeks now. </p>
<p> The Surface Pro 7 comes with a 12.3-inch touchscreen display, that makes it turn into a tablet. It also has a kickstand on the back, making it easy to work from anywhere. Even with it sitting on your lap. </p>

<p> Internally, this particular model has the Intel Core i5 processor, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage as well. </p>
<p> Now, unfortunately, the type cover is not included here. You will need to pay $129 for that keyboard. But this is a really great alternative to your plain old laptop. </p>
<p> Best Budget-Friendly Windows Laptop </p>
<p> ASUS ZenBook 13 </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenBook 13 isn't the cheapest laptop out there, but it is the best budget-friendly laptop, at $700. </p>
<p> This particular model comes with a 13.3-inch Full HD NanoEdge display. That's lower resolution than most other laptops on this list, but still usable. </p>
<p> Internally, it has an Intel Core i5-8265u processor. Along with 8GB of DDR3 RAM, and 512GB M.2 PCIe SSSD storage here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It also has a full suite of ports. Including HDMI, USB-C, WiFi 802.11 AC and a micro SD card reader. That is really clutch, especially for creatives, as most laptops have opted to get away from the SD card reader. So good to see it here. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenBook 13 also comes in a lightweight package. At about 2.5 pounds. And that is even with the aluminum unibody design. And of course Windows 10 Home is pre-installed here. </p>
<p> Best Budget-Friendly Mac Laptop </p>
<p> Apple MacBook Air </p>
<p> The Apple MacBook Air is the best budget-friendly Mac laptop, right now, at just under a grand. </p>
<p> It is also the thinnest laptop on this list, all while still being somewhat powerful. It sports a 13.3-inch Retina Display with True Tone Technology. </p>
<p> Inside you'll find the tenth-generation Intel Core i3 chipset, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage on-board. </p>
<p> Apple has also included the backlit magic keyboard – meaning that this does NOT have the butterfly keyboard! As well as Touch ID for easy authentication. Apple also has stereo speakers included here for wider stereo sound. </p>
<p> Of course, Apple packed in a pretty large battery, that is going to get you about 11 hours of work. </p>
<p> Best Budget-friendly Gaming Laptop </p>
<p> HP Pavilion Gaming 15-Inch </p>
<p> The HP Pavilion Gaming 15-inch laptop is a really good choice for those that want to do some gaming. And it's under $800, which makes it budget-friendly. </p>
<p> This sports a 15.6-inch FHD IPS display, that is also sporting anti-glare coating. </p>
<p> Inside, you'll find the Intel Core i5-9300h processor, which is a quad-core chipset clocked at 2.4GHz, and can turbo boost up to 4.1GHz. There is 8GB of DDR4 RAM inside, with 256GB of PCIe M.2 SSD storage. For graphics, we have the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 with 3GB of GDDR5 RAM. </p>
<p> The battery life is pretty good here too, with about 10 hours of mixed usage. Streaming will get you around 7 hours. And of course, this laptop has RGB, because it wouldn't be a gaming laptop without it. </p>
<p> Best cheap laptop </p>
<p> Acer Spin 1 SP111-33-C6UV </p>
<p> Not everyone needs the very best of the best in the world of laptops when they need to work from home. For them, the Acer Spin 1 is a really good option. This is not a high-end laptop, but at $300, it is a very good value. </p>
<p> It's worth noting that this comes with Windows 10 S included. So you will need to pay to upgrade to the full version of Windows, if you need it. </p>
<p> This has a 11.6-inch HD IPS touch display. Internally, you'll find the Intel N4000 chipset with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. </p>
<p> So as you can tell, this is similar to a Chromebook's spec sheet. So don't expect it to be powerful or even good for gaming. </p>
<p> Best budget-friendly Chromebook </p>
<p> ASUS Chromebook C423NA </p>
<p> The ASUS Chromebook C423NA is one of the best Chromebooks you can buy, even if it is actually a budget device. This particular Chromebook has a 14-inch Full HD non-touchscreen display here. With a 180-degree hinge. </p>
<p> Inside, you'll find the Intel Celeron N3350 processor at 1.1GHz, as well as 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. There is support for WiFi 802.11 AC, as well as Bluetooth 4.0. </p>
<p> It also offers up really great battery life. We're looking at 10 hours on a single charge, which is pretty incredible, even for a Chromebook. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Laptop </p>
<p> Razer Blade 15 Advanced </p>
<p> The Razer Blade 15 Advanced is hands-down the best gaming laptop that you can buy right now. It's also the most powerful, hence the nearly $3,000 price tag. </p>
<p> With the Razer Blade 15 Advanced, you are getting an eight-core Intel Core i7-10875H chipset, 16GB of RAM, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX S080 SUPER Max-Q for graphics, along with a 1TB SSD. You also are getting a 15.6-inch FHD display that is capable fo 300Hz refresh rate. Making this a really great laptop for any fps games. </p>
<p> Finally, the Razer Blade 15 Advanced also comes with Razer's Chrome RGB lighting, because of course it does. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook </p>
<p> Google Pixelbook Go </p>
<p> Perhaps the best of the laptops on this list for work from home, is the Pixelbook Go. Especially if all you need to use a laptop for is the internet. Since this has Chrome OS on-board and also offers a really great look and feel. It is also super light weight. </p>
<p> Now, the Pixelbook Go comes in a number of variants, but the cheapest one that's $649, comes with the Intel Core M3 processor, 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage on-board. That is pretty powerful, actually for a Chromebook, but you can also upgrade. All the way up to an Intel Core i7 chipset with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that Chromebooks just have Chrome inside, and Android Apps. This is not an entire operating system, like a Windows or Mac laptop would have. </p>

<p> Top 7 Best Mesh WiFi Routers – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> These days, we are all using our home WiFi a lot more than in the past. With most of us working from home, streaming a lot more content and even our kids are now going to school virtually. That means that we all want the very best WiFi connection, speed and coverage available. Mesh WiFi can do that for you. </p>
<p> Mesh WiFi routers are set up to blanket your home in WiFi. So you will never need to worry about coverage gaps ever again. It extends coverage much further than a traditional router would. It's kind of like having three routers in your home, except it's all the same network. Mesh WiFi routers also have a pretty simple setup these days. Making it super easy, even for the most technology illiterate person to set up. </p>
<p> Mesh WiFi vs Range Extenders </p>
<p> You might be wondering why you would want a Mesh WiFi system over a range extender? Well there are a couple of reasons why. The big one being the fact that range extenders "repeat" your signal. This results in more coverage, but slower speeds. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Mesh WiFi is better in this regard, because it doesn't repeat the signal, and in a lot of instances, you will get faster speeds than your ISP actually markets for your plan. For example, I pay for the 300Mbps plan from Comcast. But I can usually pull down around 375Mbps. </p>
<p> Best overall Mesh WiFi Router </p>
<p> Nest WiFi </p>
<p> Nest WiFi is by far the best mesh WiFi router. It offers up a very easy setup process. Basically download the Nest WiFi app, and it'll walk you through the setup process. </p>
<p> It's also great for blanketing your home in WiFi. This two-pack can cover 4,400 square-feet. Additionally, you can add more Nest WiFi routers to your setup, if you need a bit more coverage. Nest WiFi is also really good about moving devices from the 2.4GHz network to the 5GHz network when needed. It can handle up to 200 devices on the network. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Nest WiFi makes it very easy to setup a guest network and even share your WiFi password with others. </p>
<p> Best for larger homes </p>
<p> eero 6 Mesh WiFi </p>
<p> Amazon recently announced a brand new eero Mesh Wifi Router, it's the eero 6. This particular model has all of the popular features of the other eero routers, but now it has support for WiFi 6. Making it future proof, for a good amount of time. </p>

<p> Android Buyers Guide / Top 7 Best Micro SD Cards For Android – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> Top 7 Best Micro SD Cards For Android – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> When you are looking for a new micro SD card for your smartphone, there are a ton of options. And there's also a lot of numbers and letters in their name that indicate different things. But for most people, they may not know that these are important. For instance, a 60Mb/s card versus a 90Mb/s card, why does someone need a faster read/write speed? Well mainly for recording video. But that's just one of the things to look for when getting a new micro SD card. </p>
<p> Micro SD cards can be used in your smartphone (that's where they most commonly are used). But they can also be used in GoPro's, Nintendo Switch's and much more. </p>
<p> Top 7 Best Micro SD Cards </p>
<p> In this list, we have rounded up the best micro SD cards available for different use-cases. Like the most affordable, the absolute best micro SD card, the one that's going to last you the longest, etc. These do range in price from a few bucks to a few hundred bucks. So it's worth checking out. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These will all work with smartphones, a Go Pro or a Nintendo Switch, and they also all come with a SD card adapter so they can be used in a laptop or even a DSLR camera too. </p>
<p> Best overall micro SD card </p>
<p> Samsung EVO Plus 128GB </p>
<p> The Samsung EVO Plus 128GB micro SD Card is the best overall micro SD card for a few reasons. Firstly, it's pretty cheap. Secondly, it has great read and write speeds and thirdly, it has a pretty decent capacity. </p>
<p> This card has read and write speeds of 100MB/s and 90MB/s respectively. That's pretty fast, and that's going to make it easier use it in your smartphone to save video and pictures, and even have apps running on it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At 128GB of storage, that's a ton of space for photos and videos to store on your smartphone. Especially good if you are one that uses your phone to make vlogs and stuff. It is also available in a few other capacities too, including 64GB and 256GB in case you want to spend less, or you need a bit more storage on your smartphone. </p>
<p> Best capacity micro SD Card </p>
<p> SanDisk Extreme 1TB </p>
<p> Who would have thought a few years ago that we could fit 1TB of storage on something as small as a micro SD card? Well it's possible and it isn't priced insanely either. It's currently priced at $259, which is about the same price you'd pay for a portable SSD of the same capacity (if not less). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At 1TB, you're going to have a ton of storage for everything. Whether that's just photos and videos, or some apps, music or something else for your smartphone. This is actually a really great option for content creators and those that shoot a lot of content on their smartphone. As you're going to get plenty of room for all of that 4K footage. </p>
<p> This particular micro SD card can read at up to 160MB/s and write at about 90MB/s. This means that you aren't going to have any issues with your phone taking extra time to write the footage you just shot, to your micro SD card. And best of all, it's rated at A2, which means that it is going to be about the same speed as the storage in your smartphone, and making it easier to run apps from it. </p>
<p> Best Affordable micro SD Card </p>
<p> PNY Elite-X 64GB </p>
<p> This is the best affordable micro SD card because it doesn't skimp on quality to make it a pretty inexpensive micro SD card. And you still get a pretty good amount of storage here. The PNY Elite-X 64GB is available for around $13 (sometimes less), making it the cheapest option on this list. </p>
<p> With 64GB of storage, there is plenty of space for storing your photos and videos. As well as running apps off of your micro SD card. This is rated at A1, so it is going to be really good for running apps on your smartphone. So if you have a device that supports Adoptable Storage, the PNY Elite-X 64GB is a really good option. </p>
<p> PNY also has some pretty good read and write speeds on the Elite-X 64GB. We're looking at 100MB/s on both the read and write. That's fast enough to move files around pretty much instantly, as well as shooting 4K video with ease. </p>
<p> Best for Apps & Games storage </p>
<p> SanDisk Ultra 256GB </p>
<p> The SanDisk Ultra 256GB is actually a really good micro SD card for just about everything. But it is particularly good for storing apps and games on your phone. That is because it does have the A1 rating. This means that the storage is optimized for storing apps and games inside your smartphone. Allowing you to add more storage to your smartphone with ease. </p>
<p> On top of that, you are also getting 256GB of storage here. That's plenty of space for storing some games, as well as some photos and videos. So it's also really good for content creators because it is a high capacity card. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Much like a number of other options on this best micro SD cards list, the SanDisk Ultra 256GB also has support for 100MB/s on both read and write. That's fast enough for doing just about anything. </p>
<p> Best for recording 4K video </p>
<p> Samsung EVO Select 128GB </p>
<p> We are listing this Samsung EVO Select micro SD card as the best for recording 4K content for one big reason. It's write speed. It is 100MB/s write and also on the read side, which is great for recording 4K content. Especially if you are doing some 4K60 content. This is because it allows you to record it and it'll write to the micro SD card instantly. If you are using a slower card (say around 80MB/s) you may have to wait a few seconds or even minutes before you can record again, because the content hasn't been written to the card yet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With this capacity, it is also really good for recording 4K content because it's plenty of space. And 4K60 content in particular can really use up a ton of storage, pretty quickly. So getting a 128GB card is definitely a good move. And it's going to save you in the long run. </p>
<p> Samsung is known for its really great micro SD cards, and the EVO Select is no exception. In fact, this brand was the most popular micro SD card brand in 2019. </p>
<p> Best for Nintendo Switch </p>
<p> SanDisk 128GB Micro SD Card </p>
<p> This is hands-down the best micro SD card available for the Switch. And part of that is because it is officially licensed by Nintendo. But it's also because SanDisk optimized this micro SD card for the Switch. So that it works better and it is a great way to expand the storage for games on your Switch. </p>
<p> Read and write speeds here are also 100MB/s so you can load games pretty quickly. If you were to get a micro SD card that did not have these fast write speeds, then you would likely not be able to play games seamlessly from the micro SD card, as they would be slower to load. </p>
<p> 128GB really gives you a ton of storage too. Since the Switch comes with 32GB by default. You'd be giving yourself four times the storage in this tiny little micro SD card. And that's enough room to store a ton of games. Especially since Switch games are usually much smaller than PlayStation 4 and Xbox One games. </p>
<p> Best For GoPro </p>
<p> SanDisk High Endurance 128GB </p>
<p> For GoPro's getting a micro SD card that can endure loads of reading and writing, and one with fast read and write speeds is important. And that's why the SanDisk High Endurance is our pick for this category. </p>
<p> The SanDisk High Endurance micro SD card allows you to use it constantly, without worrying about it breaking down and needing to replace it. If you use your GoPro a lot, then this is the one to get. </p>
<p> And with 128GB of storage, you'll be able to record around 10,000 hours of footage in 4K on this micro SD card. So there's going to be a ton of space for recording footage from your GoPro. And if your GoPro only does 1080p video, then that number is going to more than quadruple. And not to mention, this one is also very affordable. </p>

<p> Top 8 Best Monitors For Working From Home – September 2020 </p>
<p> With many of us working from home now, we've had to make a home office, which includes getting a couple of monitors. For many, finding the right monitor could be like finding a needle in a haystack. Luckily, for you, we've rounded up the very best monitors that are on the market right now. So that you can get the best monitor for your setup and work flow. </p>
<p> Top 8 Best Monitors For Working From Home – September 2020 </p>
<p> In this list, we have rounded up the best 4K monitors, best 1080p monitors, best USB-C monitors and much more. So no matter what feature you're looking for, we have it in this list. Making sure that there is something for everyone. </p>
<p> These monitors are going in and out of stock right now, with many looking to make a home office since they have to work from home now. So keep that in mind. </p>
<p> Best 4K Monitor </p>
<p> LG 27UD68-W 27-Inch 4K UHD IPS Monitor </p>
<p> When deciding the best monitors for working from home, we factored in a number of things. Like the best value for the money. While this 4K monitor is not the very best monitor that money can buy, this is the best one that most people should buy. In fact, I have one and absolutely love it. </p>
<p> The LG 27UD68-W 27-Inch 4K UHD IPS Monitor is a 4K monitor with a pretty incredible display. The viewing angles are impressive and it is also plenty bright. This is great for those that have brighter working environments. </p>
<p> On top of that, there are two HDMI ports on the back, so that you can connect multiple devices to this monitor. </p>
<p> Best 1080p Monitor </p>
<p> Dell Professional P2417H 23.8" Screen LED-Lit Monitor </p>
<p> This monitor from Dell is a really good option for those that want a good, 1080p monitor. What is really great about this monitor is that you can rotate the display 90 degrees and make it portrait instead. Which could be very useful for those that are doing code and such. </p>
<p> There is also a ton of I/O available on this monitor. With two USB ports on the side for connecting things like a mouse or keyboard. There are two more USB ports on the bottom, with a HDMI port, DVI and even a VGA port. For those with much older laptops. </p>
<p> Best Value Monitor </p>
<p> ViewSonic VA2259-SMH 22 Inch IPS 1080p Monitor </p>
<p> For those that are looking for a monitor to add to their setup that's not going to break the bank, we introduce the ViewSonic VA2259-SMH 22 Inch IPS 1080p Monitor. </p>
<p> This monitor is just over a hundred bucks. But it is a really good option. It's a 22-inch 1080p monitor that offers a great picture, and a larger screen for getting some work done. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Obviously this one drops some of the features that make the other monitors on this list impressive. Like multiple input options, and USB ports. But if you just need a larger screen for your laptop to get some work done, this is a really good option to pick up. </p>
<p> Best Gaming Monitor </p>
<p> HP Envy 27-Inch UHD 4K IPS Monitor </p>
<p> This monitor is perfect for those that want to get some gaming done during this quarantine. It also works great for those that need to get some work done here and there as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The HP Envy 27-Inch UHD 4K IPS Monitor is a 27-inch monitor which offers up AMD FreeSync, making the lag for gaming almost non-existent. Which makes it pretty important for gamers. It also has a really good looking display at 4K resolution. </p>
<p> It also has USB-C for power, which is really impressive. Being able to plug your laptop into this monitor and have it charge simultaneously without having to use another cable for charging your laptop. </p>
<p> Best USB-C Monitor </p>
<p> BenQ EW3270U 32 Inch 4K HDR Monitor </p>
<p> The BenQ EW3270U 32 Inch 4K HDR Monitor is the best USB-C monitor on the market right now. The USB-C port can be used for both input and output. So you can use it to plug it into the wall, or you can use the port to plug in your laptop. Which means you won't need any dongles. And that right there is a really important aspect. </p>
<p> It is also a 4K HDR monitor, which is going to give you a really great picture, and it's really good for watching content while you're supposed to be working. </p>
<p> On top of all of that, the BenQ EW3270U 32 Inch 4K HDR Monitor is also good for gaming. With AMD FreeSync included. </p>
<p> Best Portable Monitor </p>
<p> ASUS ZenScreen Go </p>
<p> If you don't have an area in your home for an office, but still need a second screen to get some work done, then the ASUS ZenScreen Go is a really good option. This one is a 15.6-inch monitor that is portable and runs off of USB-C. </p>
<p> The fact that you can have a dual display setup with just a single USB-C cable is pretty impressive. And definitely useful. It also has its own internal battery so that it doesn't drain your laptops' battery. Making it great for being on the go, or moving around in your own home. </p>
<p> Best Ultrawide Monitor </p>
<p> LG 34UM69G-B 34-Inch 21:9 UltraWide IPS Monitor </p>
<p> Instead of getting two monitors on your desk, you can simply opt for an ultrawide monitor, which can act as two monitors. This is a 21:9 aspect ratio monitor, which is great for those that are multi-tasking and need several windows open. </p>
<p> The LG 34UM69G-B 34-Inch 21:9 UltraWide IPS Monitor is 34-inches, diagonally, and comes in at a resolution of 2560×1080. Which is about 1080p, unfortunately, it's not 4K, but that is still okay here. As this is a really good panel. LG does use some really good IPS panels in its ultrawide monitors. </p>
<p> Like many of the others on this list, this one is also great for gaming, with AMD FreeSync included. </p>
<p> Best 4K HDR Monitor </p>
<p> Acer Predator X27 </p>
<p> The Acer Predator X27 is perhaps one of the craziest monitors on this best of list for working from home. But it is the very best 4K HDR monitor that is on the market right now. </p>
<p> It's a 27-inch 4K monitor with a refresh rate of 120Hz, and can be overclocked to 144Hz. It's great for gamers because of that higher refresh rate, and it also has NVIDIA G-SYNC Ultimate. </p>
<p> Acer has packed this with high brightness and contrast, with VESA certified Display HDR 1000. It also has 99% of the Adobe RGB Color Gamut. </p>
<p> But it's not all about the display, the Acer Predator X27 also has a number of ports. Including a Display Port v1.4, HDMI 2.0, and four USB 3.0 ports. </p>

<p> Bose 700 </p>
<p> The Bose 700 are ironically the newest pair of headphones on this list. They also have a really sleek style, though it's not for everyone. Bose has kept the really thick leather ear cups, which makes it really comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is definitely a good thing here. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Office Desks For Working From Home – May 2020 </p>
<p> For many, working from home can be pretty tough, and a big adjustment. But you're going to need to choose from a number of office desks for working from home, before you get started. </p>
<p> Working from home brings all sorts of distractions, from kids to pets, to even just getting in bed because you're tired. We here at Android Headlines have been working from home, the entire time we've worked here. So we know a thing or two about working from home. And we have rounded up the very best office desks for working from home. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Office Desks For Working From Home – May 2020 </p>
<p> A desk is the biggest part of making a home office. Without a desk, it just doesn't feel like a real office. You're going to need something that fits your needs and your work flow. If you only use your laptop to work, then you can get away with a smaller desk. But if you use a double monitor setup, then you're going to want a larger desk. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In this list, we have a little something for everyone. Here are some of our favorites and they hit all sorts of price points. </p>
<p> Best simplistic desk </p>
<p> SHW Home Office 55-Inch Large Computer Desk </p>
<p> This is one of the more simplistic office desks for working from home. It's basically just a table with some reinforced legs that can take some more weight than others. But this is great for those that have a more simplistic working space, and use maybe just a laptop or even a smaller, single monitor setup. </p>
<p> It's a good looking desk, that is actually fairly large. This is about 55-inches wide, which is pretty large for a desk. Most are around 30-inches or so. There's no built-in cable management on this one, but for the price, you don't really expect that. </p>
<p> Best corner desk </p>
<p> SHW L-Shaped Home Office Wood Corner Desk </p>
<p> For some people, a corner desk might be a better option. And this is a really good looking one. It's going to give you lots of space, with some built-in shelves so you can be better organized. There is some built-in cable management here, though it's not the best that we've seen. It will get the job done. </p>
<p> The finish on this desk is really nice looking actually, and will be great for those that want a good looking desk. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you have a simplistic setup, but still want some more space, then this SHW L-Shaped Home Office Wood Corner Desk is going to be a really good option for you. </p>
<p> Best cheap office desk </p>
<p> FURINNO Efficient Computer Desk </p>
<p> This is a cheap but a good desk to pick up for those that are new to working from home. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At $32, you don't really expect a whole lot out of this desk, but it will get the job done. If you're not planning to work from home much longer – after the quarantine is over – then this is a good one to grab. </p>
<p> This one is about 36-inches wide, so it's one of the smaller ones out there. But it does also have some nice shelves available for storing things. Like even a desktop or gaming PC. Which is going to keep it out of the way. </p>
<p> Best industrial design desk </p>
<p> Flash Furniture Clifton Computer Desk </p>
<p> If you're looking for office desks for working from home that are strong, and can handle a lot of weight, then look no further than the Flash Furniture Clifton Computer Desk. </p>
<p> This is a really good looking desk, but it can also handle a good amount of weight. This is going to be good for those that use a heavier laptop or computer, like a gaming computer. And those that really need to utilize the top and bottom shelves on this desk for different things, like books. </p>
<p> It is a minimal desk, but it still gets the job done, while being strong. </p>
<p> Best standing desk </p>
<p> SHW 55-Inch Large Electric Height Adjustable Computer Desk </p>
<p> Standing desks are amazing. They are really great for those that sit at a desk all day long, as it allows you to stand up and stretch your legs while you're working. And really allow you to burn more calories, rather than just sitting in a chair all day. These are also good for helping you be more productive. </p>
<p> Now this desk is a pretty expensive one at $399. But the SHW 55-Inch Large Electric Height Adjustable Computer Desk is a motorized standing desk. So you can use it while sitting down, or use it as a standing desk. Which can be very helpful for different things. And it means that you can raise and lower it at the touch of a button. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There is also built-in cable management, which is a huge deal for a standing desk. As you can pull things out of the outlet by raising and lowering your desk. </p>
<p> Best easy to assemble desk </p>
<p> Convenience Concepts Modern Desk </p>
<p> This is meant to be a student desk, but it can also work as an office desk for getting some work done. This is a really good looking desk that will take no tools to setup. Now that is a great thing. Especially if you're not super handy with tools and such. </p>
<p> The Convenience Concepts Modern Desk is a great looking desk to pick up, especially in the black. It has shelves on each side, with one across the top of the desk. So there's plenty of space for storing different things like books, your backpack and much more. Which is really nice. </p>
<p> Best office desk with storage </p>
<p> Techni Mobili Modern Office Desk with Storage </p>
<p> Price: $219 </p>
<p> Buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Rounding out our list, we have this desk from Techni Mobili. This is a very cool looking desk that is also functional. On the left side, there is a cabinet that you can put your desktop PC into. And on the right are a few drawers for more storage. And there's plenty of space on the top of the desk for putting your laptop on or even your monitor (or two). </p>
<p> This is a pretty large desk too, about 51 inches by 23 inches. Which is big enough for most people, even those that use two monitors. </p>

<p> Best Of IFA 2019 – Lenovo Smart Display 7 </p>
<p> Lenovo made the first real competitor to Google's Nest Hub </p>
<p> Lenovo was a launch partner for Google Assistant displays, about a year and a half ago, with the Smart Display 8 and 10. Now Lenovo's back, with a slimmer and cheaper smart display that might be the best one yet. </p>
<p> It's smaller, and that doesn't always mean better, but when it comes to the Smart Display 7, it does. </p>
<p> Lenovo slimmed down the bezels and improved the speaker </p>
<p> The company listened to feedback from its customers, over the first two smart displays that it released. One of the big things that customers were complaining about was the speaker placement. Because it was on the left side of the display, it was not a stereo speaker, and depending on the angle that the Smart Display was at, the sound could be very hit or miss. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So Lenovo put the speaker on the bottom, and it improved the sound of the speaker. Giving it a more immersive sound. That also makes the Smart Display look smaller. Seeing as it is not as long as the 8-inch and 10-inch models. </p>
<p> Another thing that makes the Smart Display 7 look smaller, is the smaller bezels. </p>
<p> It's 2019, and everything needs to have smaller bezels right? The Lenovo Smart Display 7 also gets smaller bezels, though they are still quite large. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These bezels are still going to be a bit larger, since there are some sensors built-in, like an RGB sensor and of course that camera for making video calls too. </p>
<p> Smart Display 7 has no problem standing out in the crowded Smart Display market </p>
<p> Since the first Smart Display by Lenovo was released in 2018, there has been a ton of competition coming out. From Google, LG, JBL, Amazon and others. But that competition isn't a problem for the Smart Display 7. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Display 7 is a smart display that can stand on its own. It does compete pretty heavily with Google's Nest Hub (formerly the Google Home Hub), with the same price point and and same screen size. But what sets Lenovo's apart is the better speaker, and better looks. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo opted for a fabric wrapped speaker, which makes the Smart Display 7 look pretty great. Especially in the gray fabric with white plastic making up the rest of the Smart Display 7. </p>
<p> As it stands right now, there is almost no reason to buy the Nest Hub over the Lenovo Smart Display 7. Which says a lot about Google and Lenovo. </p>
<p> Lenovo has just set the bar again, for smart displays, which makes things clear as to why it has earned Best Of IFA 2019. </p>

<p> Best Of IFA 2019 – Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab </p>
<p> Lenovo's new Yoga Smart Tab is the most versatile tablet ever </p>
<p> Lenovo introduced the new Yoga Smart Tab at IFA 2019 earlier this week. And it might look and sound familiar. </p>
<p> That's because it is essentially a Google Assistant version of the Lenovo Smart Tab P10 that it released earlier this year. The Smart Tab P10 was a tablet that could dock and become an Amazon Alexa smart display. The Yoga Smart Tab is a tablet that can also be a Google Assistant smart display – it doesn't need the dock. </p>
<p> Being both a tablet and a smart display, makes the Yoga Smart Tab a pretty versatile tablet from Lenovo. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Yoga Smart Tab is an elegant tablet </p>
<p> The Yoga Smart Tab is a pretty elegant looking tablet. Which might sound odd, since it does look like some older tablets that Lenovo has released over the years. But, it has a built-in stand, and can also hang in your kitchen. Making it easy to take it just about anywhere. </p>
<p> The built-in kickstand comes in handy when you are watching movies on the tablet, especially while traveling. As you won't need to hold it in your hands. Imagine being on a plane and watching a movie. You can just set it down on the tray-table and watch your movie without holding it for two hours. </p>
<p> This kickstand can also be put into four different positions. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's a metal slab, with some pretty small bezels all around the screen. And then the cylinder on the side makes it even easier to hold onto the tablet. Something we really loved from the Yoga Tab 3 series that this is replacing. </p>
<p> Lenovo also worked with JBL and Dolby Atmos to provide a really great sound experience with this tablet. Which is super important when it comes to a tablet. Since most people are using tablets to watch movies and videos. </p>
<p> A Google Assistant Smart Display you can take anywhere </p>
<p> Google Assistant smart displays are pretty cool. But the big problem with them is the fact that you have to keep them plugged in. You can't take them anywhere. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Well the Yoga Smart Tab solves that problem. </p>
<p> You can put the Yoga Smart Tab into Ambient Mode, and it becomes a 10.1-inch Google Assistant Smart Display. One that you can take with you anywhere you go. This makes moving it back and forth around your home much easier. Say you want to take it into the kitchen while you're cooking? No problem, especially since you can hang it on a cabinet. </p>
<p> A tablet that is also a smart display is pretty amazing, and shows why the Lenovo Yoga Smart Display earned a Best Of IFA 2019 award. </p>

<p> Best Of IFA 2020: ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro </p>
<p> Flip up camera setup makes a return with the ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro, making the phone kind of unique, and also one of the best phones to take selfies with. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro launched alongside its sibling, the ZenFone 7, quite recently. We’ve decided to hand the ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro one of our Best of IFA 2020 awards for several reasons, but mainly its uniqueness. The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro comes with a flip up camera, just like its predecessor. It comes with the world’s first triple flip up camera. That makes it completely unique in the smartphone space, a breath of fresh air, if you will. </p>
<p> The phone’s flip up camera does stand out, and we’ll talk more about it soon. This is not the only great thing about this phone, though. The device comes with Qualcomm’s most powerful processor, while the rest of its specifications are good as well. Despite that, its price tag is not too high, the device is actually much more affordable than most mainstream flagships. All that, mixed with its sleek design, makes this phone deserving of this award, that’s for sure. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro flip up camera module has two major positives, and only one negative </p>
<p> Including moving parts in a smartphone may not seem like a great idea. That is one major negative when it comes to the flip up camera setup on the ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro. If you can live with it, and trust ASUS it did a great job with this camera module, there are a lot of positives you should be paying attention to. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The first one is… the fact it allowed the company to offer a full screen design without obstructions. The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro does not include a display camera hole, nor a display notch. It allows you to take full advantage of the phone’s gorgeous display. Bezels are even smaller than they were on the ASUS ZenFone 6, and the phone looks great because of it. </p>
<p> The second major positive is… the fact you can take amazing selfies with this phone. When you’re ready to take a selfie, all three cameras will flip up towards you, and you’ll be able to take advantage of everything this phone has to offer in the camera department. The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro may not be the best camera smartphone in the world, but it may just be the phone that can take the best selfies around. </p>
<p> The phone is also quite powerful, and it looks extremely nice </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro is made out of metal and glass. The phone looks quite sleek, and modern. It doesn’t have a display notch, nor hole, and its bezels are quite thin. Its display is flat, which is something many people will appreciate, while the phone’s back doesn’t look bad either. ASUS improved the design of this handset quite a bit compared to its predecessor, the ASUS ZenFone 6. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone is also quite powerful. It is fueled by the most powerful processor Qualcomm has to offer, the Snapdragon 865 Plus, and it supports 5G connectivity. That’s not all, though, not even close. The phone also sports a large AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate, and plenty of really fast RAM and storage. A large battery is a part of the package, same as on its predecessor, while ASUS made sure fast charging is also available. There’s very little not to like about the ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro, which is why we’ve decided to award it. </p>

<p> Best Of IFA 2020: Blink Indoor & Outdoor Security Cameras </p>
<p> With up to four years of battery life, Blink's new cameras are the ones to beat </p>
<p> Blink announced a couple of new smart security cameras at IFA 2020 this week. The Blink Indoor and Outdoor. </p>
<p> These new security cameras are pretty impressive for a number of reasons, including the fact that they can last for four years on a single set of batteries. Meanwhile, its competition can barely hit six months. </p>
<p> That reason alone is enough to make the Blink Indoor and Outdoor cameras worthy of our Best of IFA 2020 award. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The epic battery life is thanks to AA batteries </p>
<p> Most security cameras run off of removable and/or rechargeable batteries. So you can easily recharge them and then put it back in the camera after a few hours. But Blink is different. It runs on two AA batteries. </p>
<p> And thanks to those two AA batteries, the Blink Indoor and Outdoor cameras can last two years on a charge. Blink is able to do this thanks to their proprietary chip that is inside, it conserves a lot of battery life. Blink cameras only record when it sees motion or people. This helps conserve power, but also makes sure that your library isn't full of clips that have nothing happening. Which is also important. </p>
<p> Blink is able to get to four years of battery life, thanks to the battery expansion pack that it'll be selling later this year. This battery expansion pack can add two more AA batteries, for a total of four. And that will give you four years of battery life, before you need to think about changing them. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What this means is that you won't need to worry about replacing the batteries anytime soon. Even on the most aggressive settings, the Blink cameras will last for years. </p>
<p> Blink cameras offer a lot of features, for not a lot of cash </p>
<p> The Blink Indoor and Outdoor security cameras are still very cheap. These are under $100, with the Indoor model being $79. That's a fraction of the cost of other wire-free security cameras on the market. And it still offers up plenty of great features. </p>
<p> These cameras will record in 1080p video, and also offer night vision. So you can see what's going on outside of your home (and inside your home) even when there are no lights on. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Two-way audio is also available, allowing you to speak to whoever is in the view of the camera. You will also get alerts on your smartphone (or via Alexa), when there is motion or people detected. </p>
<p> Finally, Blink allows you to store video clips locally. But you can also subscribe to its cloud storage plan. It is not required for any other features, other than storing your content in the cloud. </p>
<p> These are all great reasons for honoring the Blink Indoor and Outdoor cameras with AndroidHeadlines Best of IFA 2020 Award. But for us, the epic battery life of four years, really put it over the top. </p>

HONOR refers to the design of this laptop as “X-Yacht” design, by the way. </p>
<p> Powerful internals, fast charging </p>
<p> The HONOR MagicBook Pro is fueled by the AMD Ryzen 5 4600H processor. That chip comes with integrated Radeon graphics, 6 cores, and 12 threads. To back that all up, the company also included an ultra-fast 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD storage drive, and 16GB DDR4 dual-channel RAM.

<p> The HONOR Watch GS Pro is a rugged smartwatch with staggering 25-day battery life! </p>
<p> HONOR had introduced two new smartwatches at IFA 2020. We’ve decided to award one of those smartwatches with our Best of IFA 2020 award, the HONOR Watch GS Pro. This is a smartwatch for all of you who don’t like to baby your watches, as it’s a rugged smartwatch. On top of being a rugged smartwatch, it’s also fitness-oriented, and it offers truly staggering battery life. </p>
<p> The HONOR Watch GS Pro offers great battery life of 25 days, on regular usage. That is what HONOR claims in its press release at least. This managed to surprise us a bit, even though the company’s previous smartwatches, like the HONOR MagicWatch 2, come with two-week battery life. The point is, this smartwatch has a lot to offer, which is why we’ve decided to award it. </p>
<p> Great battery life, plenty of fitness prowess </p>
<p> HONOR did not disclose what size is this watch’s battery, but 25-day battery life is a great offering. On top of that, this watch is rugged, it is MIL-STD-810G certified. It passed 14 different tests in order to meet that standard. The watch does have GPS built-in, and it also comes with more than 100 workout modes for you to choose from. Those workout modes include mountain climbing, hiking, skiing, indoor and outdoor running, and so on. </p>

<p> Those workout modes in addition to GPS make a great combination for fitness-oriented users, not to mention great battery life, so that you don’t have to worry about charging this watch in the middle of your workout. Thanks to the fact it’s rugged, you won’t have to worry about it getting in touch with some snow, rain, or even it getting scraped up against a rock or something, depending on what your workout preferences are. </p>
<p> Heart rate sensor, SpO2 monitor & more </p>
<p> The HONOR Watch GS Pro does ship with a heart rate sensor. The watch can monitor your heart rate 24/7, thanks to Huawei TruSeen 3.5 technology. The SpO2 monitor for blood oxygen saturation level is also included, but not even that is all. Sleep monitoring is a part of the package as well, thanks to Huawei TruSleep 2.0. This watch offers great battery life, so you can wear it to bed without a problem, unlike many other smartwatch offerings out there. </p>
<p> The watch can not only monitor your sleep habits, but also offer various recommendations to improve your sleep based on that. If you’re trying to get your stress levels down, that’s also where the HONOR Watch GS Pro can come in handy. This watch measures stress levels thanks to Huawei TruRelax. It will help you relax in the long term, just give it a chance. All of this makes the HONOR Watch GS Pro deserving of our Best of IFA 2020 award. </p>

<p> Best Of IFA 2020: LG Wing </p>
<p> The LG Wing shows that the company still isn't afraid to try new things </p>
<p> Smartphones these days feel like they've hit a little bit of a plateau, but that's not really the case with the LG Wing, a pretty unique device that for its out of the box design has earned it our Best Of IFA 2020 award. </p>
<p> LG didn't officially announce the Wing at IFA 2020, but it did tease the device during the event. And it's set to make a debut on September 14. </p>
<p> Though LG is hardly the only company out there right now to have a unique smartphone or mobile device, it's still one of only a few. The LG Wing is LG's take on a smartphone that has more usable screen space. And not just by making a larger phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Rather, the Wing uses a secondary display that's attached to the back which can rotate outward to the side. This design presents a multitude of different ways to use the phone. Ways in which wouldn't be possible on a phone with one single display. </p>
<p> Multitasking is going to be a big feature for the LG Wing </p>
<p> As noted LG hasn't officially announced this device yet. But it has leaked recently and some of the uses were shown off. </p>
<p> The Wing is going to be a very useful multitasking device. Some examples include having navigation displayed on one screen while streaming music is displayed on the other. And both could be interacted with independently. This independent usability is what will really make the device stand out. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Another example is playing a game or watching a video on the main display in landscape mode. Meanwhile you could respond to incoming text messages on the secondary display that would be in portrait mode. </p>
<p> On top of these examples there are bound to be others. Though it'll be easy to know more on exact capabilities once the device is fully revealed. </p>
<p> An elevated viewing experience and respectable hardware </p>
<p> Based on the limited information and rumors that are already out there on the LG Wing, it'll potentially feature some respectable hardware. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Such as the Snapdragon 765G and possible 5G support. Meaning this will be a phone that is ready to take on the more advanced mobile networks of the future. LG is touting this device as being part of its newly created Explorer Project. </p>
<p> offering an elevated viewing experience to users in a way that no other device will be able to do. This slightly strange and yet, exciting and innovative concept for a smartphone has our interests at AndroidHeadlines piqued, and it's the main reason why the LG Wing is being honored with the Best Of IFA 2020 award. </p>

<p> Best Of IFA 2020: Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Tab S7+ is the best Android tablet you'll ever put your hands on </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ is Samsung's greatest achievement in the tablet space, and its slim and slender profile, high-quality features, and attractive design is why it's being honored with the Best Of IFA 2020 award. </p>
<p> There aren't many companies out there making Android tablets anymore. Samsung though, has continued to soldier on and advance its tablet lineup. Offering new tech and new features, all while improving on the design in any ways that it could. If there were improvements to be made. </p>
<p> Announced officially at Unpacked in early August, Samsung launched the Galaxy Tab S7+ and made it available for pre-order during IFA 2020 this year. And it comes with some pretty impressive specs and features. Not the least of which is its no limit refresh rate. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This time around Samsung isn't using an adaptive refresh rate. Samsung instead lets you choose to keep the Galaxy Tab S7+ at 120Hz all the time if you wish. Which makes using the tablet and gliding through menus a very smooth and enjoyable experience. </p>
<p> A display unlike any other for a tablet </p>
<p> Samsung makes its own panels. So it's in a unique position to give its own devices the best of the best. And Samsung's panels are generally some of if not the best panels around. </p>
<p> When it came time to design the Galaxy Tab S7+, Samsung used its own Super AMOLED panel. Specifically the Galaxy Tab S7+ comes with a 12.4-inch WQXGA+ Super AMOLED panel, and it's the only tablet on the market to have it right now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Which means it carries a display unlike any other for a tablet. That paired with the 120Hz refresh rate that isn't limited, gives the screen a very smooth user experience with bright, vibrant colors, and superior clarity. </p>
<p> Because of these specs, the Galaxy Tab S7+ is the perfect media machine. Delivering great experiences for watching videos, doing work, and even playing games. </p>
<p> Loaded with features to help you make the most of your usage </p>
<p> Samsung has positioned this tablet to be a device that does many things. Though it does run on Android, Android as an OS has become very capable these days. Thanks to the number of full-featured productivity apps and tools. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ takes full advantage of that by adding in features like wireless DeX. Simply engage this feature by connecting the optional keyboard accessory. Which by the way is an exceptional add-on that you'll definitely want. </p>
<p> Once DeX is turned on, you can wirelessly link the tablet to any smart TV or display that supports Miracast technology. Beyond that, you have apps and features that utilize the new and improved S Pen. Whether it's making notes on documents or drawing your latest masterpiece, the S Pen and Galaxy Tab S7+ combo is a match made in heaven. </p>
<p> And for the gamers, the Galaxy Tab S7+ is one of the few devices Samsung offers which comes with Xbox Game Pass. Meaning you have access to a ton of games to play on that large, gorgeous screen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All in all, Samsung's Galaxy Tab S7+ is a masterclass in what can be done with a tablet for many reasons, which is what earned it the Best Of IFA 2020 award from AndroidHeadlines. The most standout feature for us though is that beautiful display with a high refresh rate. </p>

<p> Top 8 Best OnePlus 8 Cases – September 2020 </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 will be available on April 29, but you don't have to wait until then to purchase your case to protect it. These are the best cases available for the OnePlus 8, and we'll be updating this list as more become available. </p>
<p> Since the OnePlus 8 is a glass sandwich smartphone, it's going to be a good idea to get a case for it. That way you don't risk dropping it and destroying your brand new smartphone. </p>
<p> Top 7 Best OnePlus 8 Cases </p>
<p> These cases on this best of list for the OnePlus 8 are pretty different. Ranging from under $10, all the way up to $40 or even higher. So there's going to be something here for everyone, which is definitely a good thing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As some people may prefer an inexpensive clear TPU case, while others might prefer something like the karbon fiber case that OnePlus offers. And they are on different ends of the spectrum, price wise. </p>
<p> Best Case Overall </p>
<p> OnePlus Nylon Bumper Case </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 Nylon Bumper Case is by far our favorite case for the OnePlus 8. It's a somewhat thin – though not super thin – and does offer some good grip for your OnePlus 8. </p>
<p> The Nylon finish makes it more durable too, so that you won't need to worry about it getting damaged in everyday things. And with the nylon back, it's super easy to hold onto. Now that is pretty important. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It only comes in black, but because the camera cut out includes the flash, you can still show off some of the Interstellar Glow color of the OnePlus 8. Which is really cool. It does also cover a bit of the display, to protect it when it does hit the ground. </p>
<p> Best Rugged Case </p>
<p> Ringke Fusion-X </p>
<p> Price: $12.99 </p>
<p> Buy: Amazon </p>
<p> This may not be one of the best looking cases for the OnePlus 8, but it is one of the more rugged cases out there. The Ringke Fusion-X has reinforced sides and corners, that will protect the OnePlus 8 if it does go for a fall. With the case taking all of the damage, which is a good thing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now the Ringke Fusion-X does come in a few different colors. But they do mostly look the same. So it's all clear, with the reinforced sides coming in either clear or black. Or there is a somewhat translucent camo color that looks really good on the glacial green color of the OnePlus 8. </p>
<p> This is a really good case to buy, since it does also have a really nice lip over the display. Protecting it from getting damaged if it gets dropped too. </p>
<p> Best TPU Case </p>
<p> Spigen Tough Armor </p>
<p> Price: $16.99 </p>
<p> Buy: Amazon </p>
<p> If you're looking for a TPU case for your new OnePlus 8, then this is a really good option. Spigen has always made some really great cases for just about every phone out there. And coming in at $17, the Spigen Tough Armor is another great option. </p>
<p> This is a slightly thicker TPU case, compared to others on the market. But the reason for this is the reinforced sides and corners, as well as the shock absorption inside. This makes it better for protecting your phone. Especially since it does have the lip over the screen. Even though this is a curved screen device, it does still work well with this case. </p>
<p> Of course, we cannot forget the fact that this case also has a kickstand built-in. Given the impressive screen on the OnePlus 8, having that kickstand built-in is a really nice feature. Allowing you to prop up your phone while you're watching a movie or video. This is great for those that do a lot of traveling. </p>
<p> Best Clear Case </p>
<p> OnePlus 8 Clear Bumper Case </p>
<p> If you picked up the Interstellar Glow color of the OnePlus 8, then grabbing a clear case is definitely a good idea. That is going to allow you to still show off the incredible color of the phone, while also protecting it, and keeping it free of fingerprints. </p>
<p> Now the OnePlus 8 Pro does come with a clear case in the box, unfortunately the OnePlus 8 does not. So you'll have to buy this one from OnePlus. Luckily, it does not say "Never Settle" in big letters along the side on this one. So this is actually the better option. Unless you liked seeing that along the side of a case that is on your OnePlus phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This case has a cut out for the alert slider, so you can still easily put your phone on vibrate. But there's no cut outs for the buttons. So they might be a bit stiff at first, but that will change after a few days of usage. </p>
<p> Best Ultra Thin Case </p>
<p> anccer Ultra Thin Case </p>
<p> Many people would rather have an ultra thin case, that doesn't add a lot of bulk to their phone. And that's where the anccer Ultra Thin Case comes in. It's pretty thin, so it won't make the OnePlus 8 all that much bigger or bulkier. But it does add some grip. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Most of the time, these rather thin cases do not provide a lot of protection, but this one does a good job at it. There's no lip here to protect the display, which might be a good thing with this curved display. But it does cover the entire back and sides of the phone. </p>
<p> On top of that, anccer also offers it in a number of colors that match the colors the OnePlus 8 is available in. </p>
<p> Best Matte Case </p>
<p> Spigen Rugged Armor </p>
<p> The Spigen Rugged Armor has always been a staple on our best cases list, and it likely always will be. This particular mode for the OnePlus 8 is something we all love for our phones. </p>
<p> It's a matte black case, which looks really nice and also keeps those fingerprints off of your new OnePlus 8. It is also a TPU case, so it's somewhat thin – though there are much thinner cases out there. It has a carbon fiber look at the bottom and the top of the device. Giving it a rather nice look. </p>
<p> There are cut outs for the alert slider, as well as the ports on the bottom. There's no cut outs for the buttons though. But they are still pretty easy to press. So turning the phone on and off is super simple. As well as adjusting the volume. Which is pretty important to a lot of users. </p>
<p> Best Bumper Case </p>
<p> OnePlus 8 Sandstone Bumper Case </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 Sandstone Bumper Case is an old classic for OnePlus fans. The original OnePlus One came in a sandstone finish, which was very different for the time. Of course, this was before everyone started using metal and glass for the backs of their phones. OnePlus is still one of the only companies to use Sandstone on their smartphones. Though, nowadays, it's done in case style. </p>
<p> This case is a bumper case, but unlike usual bumper cases, it does protect the display. Allowing you to protect that display with ease. The OnePlus 8 Sandstone Bumper Case does make it easier to hold onto the OnePlus 8, mostly thanks to the Sandstone finish giving you a lot of grip. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 Sandstone Bumper Case does come in three colors: black, cyan and Smokey Purple, for the OnePlus 8. If you bought the Glacial Green OnePlus 8, then the Cyan color is going to work perfectly with the color of your phone. And really look pretty awesome. </p>

<p> Top 8 Best OnePlus 8 Pro Cases – September 2020 </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 Pro is a pretty impressive device, even now a few months after it has launched. It's still one of the best phones of 2020. And if you're buying a new one, it's time to find the right case for your new OnePlus 8 Pro. </p>
<p> Which include some cases at just about every price point. From those that are around $5, up to around $50. So depending on what you like, there's something for everyone. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best OnePlus 8 Pro Cases – April 2020 </p>
<p> These cases are going to protect the glass-backed OnePlus 8 Pro, which is why they are important and the best. Whether you want something that is pretty thin and will keep from making your OnePlus 8 Pro even bigger. Or something that is very thick and will protect your OnePlus 8 Pro from drops, dings and other things. </p>
<p> Best Bumper Case </p>
<p> OnePlus Sandstone Bumper Case </p>
<p> Price: $24.95 </p>
<p> Buy: OnePlus.com </p>
<p> The OnePlus Sandstone Bumper case is one of the best cases for the 8 Pro, because it is a first party case. It was made by the same company that made the OnePlus 8 Pro. So it's going to fit really well. </p>
<p> Of course, Sandstone is pretty iconic for OnePlus, as the OnePlus One had a sandstone back. So it's a bit of nostlagia for true OnePlus fans. But it also adds a ton of grip to the back of the OnePlus 8 Pro. As Sandstone is very easy to hold onto. So you won't ever need to worry about it slipping out of your hands. Now that, is a good thing. </p>
<p> This year, OnePlus is offering the Sandstone Bumper Case in two colors: Black and Cyan. So you can pick and choose which color you want. </p>
<p> Best Semi-Rugged Case </p>
<p> Spigen Rugged Armor </p>
<p> The Spigen Rugged Armor is always a really great case for any phone. It is a somewhat rugged case from Spigen, that will keep your phone protected. But it's not quite as good as something from Otterbox. And it's also not very thick. Which is definitely a good thing. </p>
<p> This case is basically a TPU case, but a bit thicker. It has a carbon fiber look at the bottom and the top, to give it some character. And it also has a pretty sizeable lip over the display to protect it. This means that if you were to drop the phone, the display would be protected by the Spigen Rugged Armor. And that is pretty important. After all, that's why you buy a case for your smartphone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Getting a somewhat rugged case for just $13 is definitely worth it. And The Spigen Rugged Armor is a good option. </p>
<p> Best Looking Case </p>
<p> OnePlus Karbon Fiber Bumper Case </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 Pro Karbon Fiber Bumper is one of the best looking cases available for the 8 Pro right now. It's got a karbon fiber back that looks incredible. It also is pretty thin. Now the downside to having a case that looks this thin is definitely the fact that it won't be as protective as the Spigen Rugged Armor. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In fact, the OnePlus 8 Pro Karbon Fiber Bumper doesn't even cover the display. So you'd better make sure you hold onto this one. But on the bright side, it means that you can still access the buttons and the alert slider on the right side of the phone. Which is one of OnePlus' key features, to be completely honest. </p>
<p> This might not be the perfect case for the OnePlus 8 Pro, but it is definitely one of the better looking options on the market right now. And even though it is a bit more expensive than the sandstone bumper from OnePlus, it's worth the price. </p>
<p> Best Dual-Layer Case </p>
<p> Tudia Merge </p>
<p> The Tudia Merge might look like a pretty plain looking smartphone case, but this is what makes it stand out. It's a dual-layer case. Which makes it thicker than some others. But the reason for this is because it has a soft TPU layer that goes against the phone to protect the glass back. And then a hard layer on the outside to absorb the impact when you drop your phone (by mistake, of course). </p>
<p> Because of this, the Tudia Merge is a bit thicker. But it also adds some grip to the back of the phone. Which makes it much easier to hold onto. Now that is definitely a big deal here. Especially since the Onyx Black color of the OnePlus 8 Pro is glossy. While the other colors are matte. All of them are very slippery in the hand, unfortunately. </p>
<p> If you are worried about dropping your phone, Tudia Merge is definitely the one to get. </p>
<p> Best Impact Resistant Case </p>
<p> Ringke Fusion-X </p>
<p> The Ringke Fusion-X is great for those that do drop their phones a lot. As this one is made for impact resistance. With the reinforced sides and the reinforced corners. It'll make sure that you're brand new OnePlus 8 Pro does not break or shatter when it hits the ground. </p>
<p> It's also great for those that are looking for a somewhat clear case for their new smartphone. As you're getting a clear case, but with the black corners and sides that are reinforced. Which still allows you to show off that incredible look of the OnePlus 8 Pro. Especially if you got in the Ultramarine Blue as shown above. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Ringke Fusion-X is also one of the cheaper cases on this list, that is going to do a good job at protecting your shiny new OnePlus 8 Pro. Which makes it a no-brainer purchase for a lot of people. </p>
<p> Best Clear Case </p>
<p> Pulen TPU Case </p>
<p> If you're looking for a clear case for your new OnePlus 8 Pro, look no further than the Pulen TPU Case. This is a clear TPU case that is pretty thin, but still allows you to show off that Glacial Green or Ultramarine Blue color of the OnePlus 8 Pro. Or even the Onyx Black if you went with the boring color. </p>
<p> This one does have buttons available for you to use the power and volume rocker, as well as a cut out for the alert slider. So you'll still be able to use that, which is definitely a good thing here. </p>
<p> As far as protection goes, the Pulen TPU Case does a good job there too. It offers up shock absorption, so if you do drop your phone, the case will take the damage. That way your new OnePlus 8 Pro is not damaged and you can keep using it. After all, that's why you buy a case anyways. </p>
<p> Best TPU Case </p>
<p> Osophter Flexible TPU Case </p>
<p> Those that are looking for a TPU case, that isn't too thick, but does add some grip to the OnePlus 8 Pro. Then look no further than the Osophter Flexible TPU Case. We'd even say it's one of the best cases for the OnePlus 8 Pro, hands down. </p>
<p> The Osophter Flexible TPU Case comes in a number of colors. Including red, blue, gray and black. So no matter your style, there's a color available for you. Now it does look a lot like the Spigen Rugged Armor, with the carbon fiber towards the bottom of the phone. But it adds in the brushed aluminum look, which frankly, looks really incredible. Not to mention it is available in a lot more colors than Spigen has. </p>
<p> If you are looking for a really good TPU case for your OnePlus 8 Pro, then you really can't go wrong with the Osophter Flexible TPU Case. And at just $8, it's definitely the best case available, for its price. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Smartphone Chargers </p>
<p> With all the talk of smartphone makers deciding to nix the charger in the box next year. It might be a good time to pick up a new phone charger or two. </p>
<p> There are many (probably millions) of different phone chargers on the market. From some popular brands like Anker, RAVPower, AUKEY, Samsung and many more. But which ones are the best for you to buy and use with your smartphone? </p>
<p> That's what we're here to tell you. We've used just about all of the chargers on this list, with many different phones. And know which ones are the best. Phone chargers mostly fall into two categories. USB-C chargers and USB-A chargers. Almost all phones released since 2018 have USB-C, which means that both kinds of chargers will work for most smartphones. But USB-C is more future-proof and will offer faster speeds (depending on the device). So that is our recommendation. </p>
<p> Best smartphone charger </p>
<p> Anker PowerPort III </p>
<p> The Anker PowerPort III is our favorite phone charger. That is because it is super compact, and can still charge at a decent speed. This one does up to 18W. So it's not the fastest charger out there. But where most smartphones are capped right around 18W for USB-C PD charging right now. It makes it a good, and cheap, option. </p>
<p> This will work on older smartphones too, since the PowerPort III is able to adapt its speed based on what is plugged in at the time. </p>
<p> For only $12, this is definitely a charger you'll want to pick up and maybe even carry in your bag to work. </p>
<p> Best dual-port charger </p>
<p> AUKEY Omnia 65W Fast Charger </p>
<p> This is a really great option for a dual-port charger. As it offers both USB-A and USB-C PD for charging. It can output 65W total, which means that you are not getting 65W from the USB-C PD port if you are also using the other port at the same time. </p>
<p> It can do 65W though, which is powerful enough for most USB-C laptops – like the MacBook Pro. However, if you plug your phone into the USB-C PD port, it will not charge at that speed. Depending on the device, it may charge at 18W or even 25W. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's a good versatile phone charger, that can also charge other products like a laptop or a smartwatch. </p>
<p> Best 100W USB-C PD phone charger </p>
<p> Anker PowerPort Atom PD 4 </p>
<p> This is by far my favorite phone charger, and actually one that I use on my desk right now. If you are now working from home for the foreseeable future, this is worth picking up. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This has two USB-C PD ports and two USB-A ports, that can output 100W total. It can do 100W total on the USB-C port, so it is fast enough to charge a laptop. But if you have other devices plugged in at the same time, then the power will be distributed among the four ports. </p>
<p> It's a killer charger to have, as you can charge many different things at the same time and not worry about having enough outlets. </p>
<p> Best USB-C PD Car Charger </p>
<p> Spigen SteadiBoost </p>
<p> You likely know Spigen from the many cases that it makes for different smartphones. But they also make different smartphone accessories too. Like this car charger. </p>
<p> This is a 45W car charger that offers USB-C PD up to 27W and then a USB-A port. So you can get fast charging even while you are driving down the road, which is definitely a really cool thing to have. </p>
<p> The USB-A port uses Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 for speed too, so even if you aren't using the USB-C port, you are still getting some good speed here. </p>
<p> Best 25W phone charger </p>
<p> Samsung 25W PD Fast Power Adapter </p>
<p> This is the charger that Samsung includes in the box with the Galaxy S20, Note 20 series and the Z Fold 2. It's a 25W USB-C PD charger that can also be used with other devices, and since it's only $13, it's a really good option. </p>
<p> It uses USB-C PD and PPS, which is a newer technology designed to make faster charging even safer. So it's no surprise that Samsung is using it. But we will see more smartphones using it in the near future. Basically, if you own a Samsung smartphone and want to use the full 25W speed that it has, then this is the charger to get. And it can never hurt to have a second one laying around. </p>
<p> Best travel-friendly phone charger </p>
<p> AUKEY Swift 18W Fast Charger with Foldable Plug </p>
<p> AUKEY has made a really great charger to take when you travel. This charger here is a 18W USB-C PD charger that has a foldable plug. That is really awesome because it'll take up less room in your bag and also protect the plug from getting damaged from other things in your bag. </p>
<p> This is a pretty small charger in the first place, but still offers up some really good charging speeds. Which makes it a great option for taking on the go with you. That is, when we are able to travel once again. </p>
<p> Best portable charger </p>
<p> AUKEY USB C Power Bank </p>
<p> Not all chargers need to be ones that you plug into the wall. There are portable ones too, and this one from AUKEY is one of our favorites. </p>
<p> We love this one because it is super slim, and offers 10,000mAh of power. Which is enough to charge most smartphones at least once. And it's thin enough to fit in your pocket without any real issues. That is a killer feature. </p>
<p> There three USB-A ports available here, as well as a micro USB and a USB-C port that can be used for input (USB-C can do both output and input). </p>
<p> Best four-port phone charger </p>
<p> AmazonBasics 40W 4-Port Multi USB Wall Charger </p>
<p> This is one of the best four-port USB chargers on the market. Now this is not a USB-C charger, in fact, it's all USB-A. And it also does not offer fast charging. But even with those that do have fast charging, you won't really get "fast" charging when you use all four ports. As that speed is split up between all four. </p>
<p> And where this AmazonBasics model is just $20, it's definitely a good option. And you can charge your smartphone, smartwatch, tablet and more here. All with one outlet. </p>

<p> Best Cell Phone Plans In 2020 </p>
<p> These days, wireless carriers are doing as much as they can to confuse customers, when it comes to its plans. At least that's what it seems like. Offering unlimited data, but there are five different unlimited plans. It can be pretty confusing, and if you're looking to jump ship to a new carrier, how do you know which is the best carrier has the best phone plans for your new Android smartphone? </p>
<p> Well we have done the homework, and here's a breakdown of the plans offered by the major carriers (plus a couple of prepaid carriers for a well-rounded list), to help you make that decision. And find the best phone plans that fit your needs. </p>
<p> Below, you will find a table with the best phone plans from each carrier, so if you're just looking for the best value, you'll find it there. You can also check out all of the plans from each carrier further down. We've broken them down by individual and family plan pricing. The plans are mostly the same for individuals and families, with the only difference being price. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When it comes down to it, all of these carriers have the best phone plans, but there are a couple of things that you need to keep in mind when deciding which plan is right for you. How much data you use; which carrier has the best coverage where you live, work and play; and then which carrier has the price you want to pay. Google Fi and Xfinity Mobile are the cheapest here, but they may not have the amount of data you need. All important things to keep in mind here. </p>
<p> Best Phone Plans 2020 – By Carrier </p>
<p> Best Phone Plans Compared </p>
<p> In the table below, we have listed the best phone plans from each carrier. We came to the conclusion that each of these plans were the best based on a few factors. Like the price, and features that are included. Which is why you'll see that Sprint has the most expensive plan (tied with Verizon at $80 per month), because it is the best value of the plans it offers. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We explain all of these plans more in-depth in each carrier's category. So you can make a well-informed decision on which carrier you want to sign up with. Of course, once you have signed up with a particular carrier, it is actually pretty easy to switch plans. And many of these carriers will also prorate your plan, if you decide to switch in the middle of a billing cycle. Though, Google Fi and Xfinity Mobile won't change that plan until your next billing cycle. But it's still very easy to switch to a different plan on the same carrier, which is always a good thing. As your circumstances might have changed, or you might want to save some cash. And where carriers are always changing their offerings, the best phone plans may change. </p>
<p> AT&T </p>
<p> AT&T is one of the larger carriers in the US, it's currently second behind Verizon. It has some pretty decent coverage in the majority of the US and is working to roll out 5G now, which you can check it's 5G coverage here – to see if your area has it yet. </p>
<p> For individuals, AT&T has three plans for unlimited data, which starts at $65 per month. Taxes and fees are not included in that price, and depending on where you live, that could put the total over $80 per month. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the AT&T Unlimited Starter plan, which is $65 per month, you get unlimited talk, text and data in the US, Canada and Mexico. You also get standard streaming video – so no 4K video on this plan. As well as automatic fraud blocking and spam risk, finally there is unlimited texting from the US to 120+ countries. Now the AT&T Unlimited Extra is $75 per month, and it includes all of that plus 15GB of mobile hotspot per line, 5G Access and you won't be slowed until you hit 50GB of data. Then there is the AT&T Unlimited Elite package for $85. This one includes everything in the Unlimited Extra package, but it ups the data usage to 100GB, adds in HBO at no extra charge and it also includes the ability for Signature Program members to save $10/month per phone line. </p>
<p> These are the same plans it offers for families, but unlike Verizon, you can't mix and match. So everyone is on Unlimited Starter, or Unlimited Extra or Unlimited Elite. For two lines, the prices are $60, $65, and $75 per month/per line respectively. For three lines, the prices are $45, $50 and $60 per month, per line respectively. And finally for four lines, it drops to $35, $40, and $50 per month per line. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that these prices do not include your phone. So if you do opt to buy a phone from AT&T on its NEXT program – where you're paying monthly for it – that's going to add to your total here. And for a family of four, that could really boost your amount per month. </p>
<p> Google Fi </p>
<p> Google Fi is a wireless carrier from Google that runs on three different networks – Sprint, T-Mobile and US Cellular. It can automatically switch between the three when one has better coverage in a certain area. And it will also automatically switch to WiFi when available – using the Google VPN to keep your data safe. </p>
<p> Google Fi does have 5G, but it is only in places that T-Mobile has rolled out 5G. Considering T-Mobile claims it is a "nationwide" 5G network, it'll be available in most places throughout the US. You'll also need a 5G device like the new Galaxy S20 lineup from Samsung, to get 5G on Google Fi. Speaking of phones, not all of them work on Google Fi in the same way. Pixel devices are "made for Fi" meaning that they work the best. Some features will be missing if you bring a Galaxy S20 over to Fi. But talk, text and data will work the same – it won't auto-switch to different networks on its own though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Essentially, there are only two plans available with Google Fi. There is the Flexible plan and Unlimited. Flexible is better for those that use less than 6GB of data per month. It is as low as $20 per month, which is for the text and talk. Data is then $10 per GB. So if you use 1GB, it's $30, and so on. If you use more than 6GB, then "Bill Protection" kicks in and you won't be charged more than $80 (+ taxes and fees). You can use this data in other countries too – up to 120 countries – and it's 4G LTE, and priced at the same $10 per GB. </p>
<p> The other plan is the Unlimited plan. For $70 per month, you're getting unlimited data – though Google notes that if you use 22GB in a single month, your speeds may slow down. You still get unlimited talk and text, as well as the ability to use talk, text and data in 120 countries. On top of that, you get 100GB in Google One, for free. If you are one that usually uses more than 6GB per month, then this is the better plan to get, as its $10 cheaper and you get 100GB of Google One storage too. </p>
<p> For families, Google Fi is pretty awesome too. You can add up to six lines, and the more lines you add, the cheaper the bill will be per line. Two lines drops to $18 for the Flexible plan and $60 for the Unlimited plan, per line. Three lines is $17 and $50, per line, respectively. And four lines is $45 and $17 per line, respectively. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Fi also allows you to easily see who on your plan is using the most data, this is pretty useful if you are on a family Flexible plan. </p>
<p> Sprint </p>
<p> Sprint has three unlimited plans. Ranging from $60 to $80 per month. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's Unlimited Basic which offers 480p streaming, 500MB of LTE mobile hotspot (slowed to 2G after), and it comes with unlimited talk, text and 5GB of LTE data in Canada and Mexico. Sprint also tosses in Hulu for free – this is for the ad-supported Hulu, so it's a $6/month value. </p>
<p> The next option is Unlimited Plus which is $70 per month. It offers HD video streaming at 1080p, as well as 50GB of LTE mobile hotspot and it ups the data in Canada and Mexico to 10GB. You also get Hulu and TIDAL included here. </p>
<p> Finally, we have Unlimited Premium, this is the most expensive at $80 per month. It offers full HD video streaming, 100GB of LTE mobile hotspot, as well as unlimited talk, text and 4G LTE data in Canada and Mexico. It also gives you Hulu, TIDAL and Amazon Prime for free. Now that makes this the best deal actually, considering Amazon Prime is normally $12.99 per month. And it is something we can all appreciate. </p>
<p> These plans are also pretty cheap for families. Unlimited Basic is $50 per month/line at two lines and then $33 at three lines and $25 at four. Unlimited Plus is $60 per month/line at two lines, $43 at three lines and $35 at four lines. Finally, the Unlimited Premium plan is $70 per month/line at two lines, then $53 at three lines and $45 at four lines. </p>
<p> Sprint also offers unlimited plans for smartwatches and tablets. Unlimited for Watches is $10 per month. Unlimited for Tablets is $25 per month and offers unlimited data, texting on capable devices and standard definition streaming (480p). It also comes with 10GB of mobile hotspot data. </p>
<p> An important note here, Sprint has been in the middle of a merger with T-Mobile since 2018. The two companies have now received approval and the merger is set to finalize on April 1, 2020. T-Mobile – who is the one buying Sprint – hasn't said much about what will happen to Sprint customers once the merger is complete. But those customers will likely be moved over to T-Mobile's network fairly quickly. So if you're thinking about switching to Sprint, do keep that in mind. </p>
<p> T-Mobile </p>
<p> T-Mobile sometimes gets a bad wrap for having not-so-great coverage, but the thing is, it is has been working for years to improve its coverage and network and has done so pretty successfully. But it's still a good idea to check out its coverage in your area. It has also rolled out nationwide 5G, which you can check that coverage here. </p>
<p> Over at T-Mobile, there are basically three different plans to choose from. There are some add-ons you can add to your plan as well. But there are three basic plans. </p>
<p> There's T-Mobile Essentials for $60 per month or $30 per line for families. Then there is Magenta, which is $70 per month or $35 per line for families, and Magenta Plus, which is $85 per month or $43 per line for families. </p>
<p> Essentials only gives you, well the essentials. It is the only plan that does not include taxes and fees in the price, so you will need to do the math here, as it might not be cheaper than Magenta at $70, which includes taxes and fees in that price. Essentials offers unlimited talk, text and data. There is mobile hotspot but it's caped at 3G speeds. You do still get T-Mobile Tuesdays freebies though. </p>
<p> With Magenta, taxes and fees are included in that price. You get unlimited talk and text, as well as 3GB of 4G LTE mobile hotspot data (then its 3G), as well as T-mobile Tuesdays, unlimited texting and data in over 120 countries. In Canada and Mexico, you will get unlimited talk, text and data – with 5GB of that data being LTE. And finally, you get 1 hour of free in-flight WiFi and unlimited texting while flying. </p>
<p> Magenta Plus offers everything that Magenta has, but it ups mobile hotspot data to 20GB of 4G LTE and then unlimited 3G speeds after. You also get unlimited texting and WiFi, and video streaming is upped to HD streaming. This plan is really good for those that do a lot of flying, as Gogo in-flight internet can be pretty pricey, so getting it on all of your flights is definitely a good perk. </p>
<p> There are also plans available for smartwatches and tablets at T-Mobile, starting at just $10 per month. So if you want to have 4G LTE (and soon 5G) on your tablet when you're traveling, T-Mobile has you covered. Which can be very convenient actually, especially if you want to watch a movie you haven't downloaded, on the train. </p>
<p> There are some good phone plans here from T-Mobile, some might say the best. But that all depends on what you need from your carrier. </p>
<p> Verizon </p>
<p> Verizon is the largest wireless carrier in America, and it has the coverage to prove why it is. But, as is the case with any wireless carrier, you're going to want to check out its coverage in your area before you decide to choose it. </p>
<p> Verizon currently has five unlimited data plans available. Ranging from $70 to $90 per month for a single line. Though, what's nice here is that you are able to mix and match, so if you have a family of four with different needs, you can choose the plans that best fits each individuals needs. </p>
<p> All of Verizon's Unlimited plans come with a year of Disney+ on them. That's a $69 value. Verizon UP is also available with all of these plans, offering free things just for paying your bill! </p>
<p> The first one is Start Unlimited. This is $70 per month (though if you don't buy a new phone from Verizon when you switch, it's $80). This is the lowest-end unlimited plan. It offers 480p streaming and six months of Apple Music for free. While data is unlimited on this plan, you can be throttled at any time for network congestion. </p>
<p> Next up is Play More Unlimited at $80 per month. This offers up 25GB of "Premium Data", meaning you won't be throttled until you use that much data. You also get unlimited mobile hotspot, with 15GB of 4G LTE. Streaming is increased to 720p, and Apple Music is included – not just for six months, but for as long as you have this plan or higher, on Verizon. </p>
<p> Do More Unlimited is also priced at $80 per month. This plan makes some interesting changes from Play More Unlimited. It offers 50GB of Premium Data, unlimited mobile hotspot with 15GB of 4G LTE, but streaming is down to 480p. Apple Music is also only free for six months. And you get 500GB of Verizon Cloud Storage. </p>
<p> The most expensive plan is Get More Unlimited, for $90 per month. This offers 75GB of Premium Data, Unlimited Mobile Hotspot (30GB of 4G LTE), streaming is up to 720p quality, Apple Music Included and you get 500GB of Verizon Cloud Storage here. </p>
<p> Finally, Verizon has a plan for kids, called Just Kids. This plan can only be added an additional line to one that has one of the aforementioned unlimited plans. It offers 5GB of 4G LTE data, Safety Mode to Avoid Data Overages, 480p video streaming, Unlimited talk and text to 20 contacts and Verizon Smart Family Premium with Parental Controls. </p>
<p> There are some really good options here from Verizon, and which plans are best for you and your phone is going to depend on your usage. If you do a lot of traveling, Get More Unlimited will be the best option. If you work from home, Start Unlimited might be the best option for phone plans for Verizon. </p>
<p> Xfinity Mobile </p>
<p> For some, Xfinity Mobile might be the one with the best phone plans. As it offers some pretty simple options, that are also pretty inexpensive. The service has many similarities to Google Fi. In that it will automatically switch from WiFi to Mobile Data, even if it's not your own WiFi. Xfinity Mobile utilizes Comcast's own Xfinity WiFi hotspots, and where there are millions of customers using Comcast for Internet right now, there are a ton of hotspots available across the country. When Xfinity WiFi is not available, it goes back to Verizon's network. So you're going to get a really great network on Xfinity Mobile. </p>
<p> There are basically two plans with Xfinity Mobile. You can either Pay by the Gig or get Unlimited. </p>
<p> With Pay By The Gig, you are paying for $12 per month for the first Gig. 3GB is $30, 10GB is $60. So it's actually cheaper than Google Fi. </p>
<p> The other plan is Unlimited. For $45 per month, you get unlimited data. Xfinity Mobile does say that users may experience slower speeds once they hit 20GB of data in a single month. Which is a decent amount of data for just $45 per month. </p>
<p> Equipment, taxes and fees are not included in these prices. Both plans included unlimited talk and text. And the best feature of Xfinity Mobile is the fact that you are able to mix and match. You can have two lines sharing 10GB of data and then one unlimited line for $105 per month. You won't find another carrier that can get you three lines for $105 per month. </p>
<p> This is a great option if you don't need the latest and greatest smartphones, or the fastest network around. This is because not every phone works on Xfinity Mobile. Many do, but there are some that won't. So you may or may not be able to bring your own phone over to Xfinity Mobile and use it. </p>

<p> Effilex UV-C Mobile Phone Sterilizer </p>

<p> Zeiss Lens Wipes </p>
<p> The Zeiss Lens Wipes are really nice to pick up and use and are dirt cheap right now at Walmart. You can get a 50-count box of them for just $2.97. Talk about cheap. </p>
<p> These wipes are mostly geared towards camera lenses and glasses. But, they also work well for smartphones, and since they don't have the same chemicals as Lysol and Clorox wipes, they won't break and wipe off the oleophobic coating on your smartphone. Making it a really good choice for those that are looking to clean their smartphone. Whether you're looking to clean it amid this pandemic, or just clean it in general. </p>
<p> Zeiss Lens Wipes are individually wrapped, so you can toss a few in your bag and take them with you when you are traveling. Which can be very convenient actually.

As it's something you can use for other products, that you likely use every single day and need to be cleaned often too. </p>
<p> ONTROWA UV-C Phone Sanitizer </p>
<p> This is another UV-C phone sanitizer, that is also fairly inexpensive. This one comes in two colors: White and Pink. At the time of writing this, the pink one was out of stock. </p>
<p> The ONTROWA UV-C Phone Sanitizer is very easy to use, simply press the cleaner switch to start the sterilizer. There is an indicator light available that will let you know once it is done cleaning. It will automatically stop after eight minutes of cleaning. Which means that it does take longer than some of the other sterilizers on this list, but that's not a bad thing. </p>
<p> It does also support most smartphones, including some of the larger ones like the Galaxy S20 and Pixel 4 XL. Which is definitely a good thing to have here. </p>

<p> Finally, the ONTROWA UV-C Phone Sanitizer also works for cleaning other things. ONTROWA mentions underwear, socks, baby's toys, forks, knives, watches, eye-glasses, toothbrushes, jewelry, keys, Bluetooth earphones and other small objects. So it can definitely pull double duty here. </p>

<p> This Is The Best PS4 Game From 2020 Headed To The PS5 </p>
<p> The best PS4 game to release in 2020 is coming to the PS5, and it'll be playable on day one. I'm talking about Ghost Of Tsushima. The open-world epic set in 13th century Japan from Sucker Punch Productions. </p>
<p> If you have not yet played this game, you're missing out on this year's best title. And this is coming from a diehard fan of Final Fantasy VII. I was looking forward to the Remake for as long as I can remember. Ghost Of Tsushima however edges it out for me. </p>
<p> Both are excellent games, but Ghost Of Tsushima just hits different. It's the only game since The Order 1886 that I've cared to spend enough time on to get the platinum trophy. And now that I've done that, I'm going through the game again in Kurosawa mode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Which not only puts the game in a visuals in black and white, but it changes the language to Japanese with English subtitles, and it adds a special film grain aesthetic. This is meant to make the game look and feel like one of those old Samurai films from famed film director Akira Kurosawa. </p>
<p> Ghost Of Tsushima is easily the best PS4 game of 2020 headed to PS5 </p>
<p> My point of all this is that Ghost Of Tsushima is not just excellent. It's extraordinary. On so many levels. And it's easily (for me), 2020's best PS4 game, so I was more than excited to learn of its PS5 compatibility. </p>
<p> I'm confident that I am not alone in this thinking. So while this is my opinion and my opinion may be a bit biased here, that's the beauty of an opinion. Especially when there are no doubt going to be other people that agree with it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And whether you agree with it or not, one thing that's hard not to agree with is that Ghost Of Tsushima is a true masterpiece of video game creation. Even if it's not your favorite game of the year. </p>
<p> Once the game is available on PS5, it'll be even better too. You'll be able to play it on day one. Meaning you can install and play Ghost Of Tsushima on the PS5 on November 12 when the console launches. Provided you were able to secure a pre-order. </p>
<p> It'll also support up to 60fps. So the gameplay will be even smoother than it was on PS4 Pro. And, on top of all that, there will be much more content to dive into. Because Sucker Punch is releasing a new content update for Ghost Of Tsushima on October 16 (Friday). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This will add the New Game+ mode, the new Legends content which is the game's multiplayer mode, and more. If you can even resist playing that content right away, you can look forward to all of it looking more amazing next month. </p>
<p> You can transfer your PS4 game save to the PS5 </p>
<p> #GhostOfTsushima will be playable on PS5 on day one via backward compatibility, and you’ll be able to transfer your save from PS4 to pick up where you left off! </p>

<p> Rest assured that your game save is going to be transferrable over to the PS5. Sucker Punch has already confirmed this via a tweet back on October 9. </p>
<p> This means whether you've already finished the game and are working on your second playthrough, you're somewhere in the middle, or you've just started, you won't have to start over completely if you want to play on PS5. </p>
<p> You can simply move the save over and continue where you left off. Which is going to be important since New Game+ is going to be a thing now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That being said, Ghost Of Tsushima is good enough to start over from scratch. Even if you've already beat it. It's that good. And who knows it might even feel a little bit like a new game thanks to the better visuals the PS5 will support. </p>
<p> A beautifully crafted story set in an even more beautifully crafted world to explore </p>
<p> There's lots of things to love about Ghost Of Tsushima. Like petting the foxes. But, the two main things that make this game so memorable are the story and the world it's set in. </p>
<p> The story is wonderful, ugly, beautiful, and heartbreaking all the same. At times you can feel so connected to the characters and invested in their outcomes (good or bad) that you see yourself in their shoes. Wondering how you might handle the situations they're in. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's a beautifully crafted story. One that was a little painful to have end because you just want more of it. Then there's the world. Tsushima Island. It's broken up into three prefectures. Each one with its own slightly unique aesthetic. </p>
<p> Playing their part to help paint a picture of the beauty and destruction that work in tandem to create the overall experience. </p>
<p> All of this beauty is stretched out over a vast area to explore in-game. Believe me when I say you can explore for days before even making a dent in the game's main story. And once you get a taste of what the world of Tsushima has to offer, you'll want to keep exploring. </p>
<p> There's other incentives to do this of course. Not just for results that came from the painstaking effort to create what lies in front of you. But also for trophy completion, found items and other things in the game that can help you progress. </p>
<p> The photo mode is really going to shine on PS5 </p>
<p> As someone who went through this game from start to finish on an original launch day PS4, I can only imagine how good Ghost Of Tsushima looked on a PS4 Pro. </p>
<p> I mean technically I don't have to imagine as I've seen the photos. But seeing the screenshots people have taken is different from seeing things in person. The game's surprisingly full-featured photo mode is what made it possible to capture some of the best screenshots that have ever been captured from any game. </p>
<p> And the photo mode is really going to shine on the PS5. If you can't imagine it now, wait till you play the game a little bit on PS4 (and you should do this) and start capturing your own screenshots. You'll likely feel the same and be just as eager to play it on PS5. </p>
<p> The photo mode is so robust that it's almost like an entirely different game. Moving through the world finding the best possible places to capture a really good photo is almost like a story in itself. </p>
<p> I know I'm the only one that did this, but I found myself playing for hours doing nothing but trying to capture good-looking screenshots that I could share. Some I've kept for me and me alone as a sentimental look back to my time with the game. </p>
<p> Final Thoughts </p>
<p> Ghost Of Tsushima is an excellent game from the PS4 era and it landed at a pretty decent time. </p>
<p> It helped the PS4 go out with a bang and it was close enough to the PS5 release that it's still going to get plenty of attention. You should not however wait till the PS5 has launched to play it. Play it now. Enjoy everything it has to offer you and then once the PS5 comes out, enjoy it some more. </p>
<p> This is a game that commands and deserves multiple play throughs. And you'll probably love every single second of it. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best PS4 Games – September 2020 </p>
<p> When it comes to a list of PS4 games there are an insanely high number of options now that we're headed into the PS5 generation soon, but what are the best PS4 games out there right now? </p>
<p> If you're looking to dive head first into the PS4 and its endless list of game titles, these are the best PS4 games currently available that you may want to consider playing. Maybe you've never had a PS4 or you're just deciding to go through backlog of games you never got around to picking up. </p>
<p> And Since it'll still be at least a couple of months before we can expect the PS5 to launch, we figured it would be a good idea to list all the best games for the current generation PlayStation until the PS5 so you don't miss out on the experience. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The good news too is that Sony and Amazon are always having sales. So there is a good chance that you may snag a game you want off this list at a really good deal. That being said, though these are our picks for the best PS4 games, this list is also subjective. </p>
<p> Our picks may not be everyone's picks. But every game on this list is a good one and has been highly rated and regarded well by players and/or critics. So they're at least worth a look. </p>
<p> Also worth noting is that the list for excellent PS4 games that we consider must-play titles is massive. So this list will change monthly with some titles being swapped out to highlight other must-play titles. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Top 10 Best PS4 Games – summary </p>
<p> Below is a brief list of the games we've set as our top picks this month. If you're in a rush and just want to get to gaming as fast as possible, you can see all our picks below with buy links for both physical and digital copies. </p>
<p> If you're curious to know a little bit more about each pick, you can read below the summary table to check out each game individually, where there will be trailers for each game alongside a small description as well as buy links for both physical and digital copies. </p>
<p> Editor's Note in regards to prices: Most or all of the games on this list are on sale either from Amazon or Sony. Sony in particular is having a sale on PSN right now for digital copies, but many of those games are only on sale for a limited time. </p>
<p> Best PS4 game for super hero fans </p>
<p> Spider-Man </p>
<p> Spider-Man is quite possibly the most iconic Marvel super hero, and that led to an insanely popular release with Marvel's Spider-Man from Insomniac Games. </p>
<p> It features a pretty vast and openly explorable New York City, with a unique Spider-Man storyline. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The gameplay is filled with scaling large buildings and traversing the cityscape high above ground level using Spider-Man's web slinging skills. It also has excellent graphics, great combat, and a massive list of iconic Spider-Man suits to unlock through gameplay. </p>
<p> Definitely don't miss this one. </p>
<p> Best PS4 game for JRPG fans </p>
<p> Final Fantasy VII Remake </p>
<p> It's not easy to find a JRPG game more iconic than Final Fantasy VII. The original defined a generation and is one of the most popular JRPGs of all time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Final Fantasy VII Remake takes the things loved about the original and brings them forward into a new generation with plenty of new stuff. It has completely new gameplay, and entirely different play style, and gorgeous graphics with a slightly more fleshed out story. </p>
<p> Enter into a new experience with Final Fantasy VII that you've never had before. Or if you're a newcomer to this entry in the main franchise, enjoy the wonder and adventure that you're about to embark on. </p>
<p> Play with a completely new battle system based on real-time action combat, or flop over to a reimagined version of the combat system from the original title where you can take more time with your attacks. This is also an episodic game which will have multiple parts, with the first part offering close to 40 hours of gameplay or more if you do all side quests. No to mention chase down all trophies which will take multiple play throughs. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Best PS4 game for hack and slash action combat </p>
<p> God Of War </p>
<p> God Of War is another iconic series for PlayStation and has been an exclusive franchise to the platform. </p>
<p> Taking the series into a new thematic direction that centers on Norse mythology, God OF War features the same, high-energy hack and slash combat from the previous entries. But with more flare, better graphics, and new weapons and attack abilities (as well as a secret or two for long-time fans). </p>
<p> You can explore much of the terrain around you while also enjoying cinematic-style combat (in some encounters), a pretty robust character progression system, and tons of lore and collectibles. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course the best part about the game is the combat. Which is epic to say the least. </p>
<p> Best PS4 game for extremely punishing yet rewarding gameplay </p>
<p> Bloodborne </p>
<p> Souls-borne games are known far and wide for their extremely punishing and unforgiving gameplay. And Bloodborne is no different. </p>
<p> While it eventually becomes a little bit easier, it takes quite a bit of practice for newcomers to this genre (I hated myself the first time I picked up a souls-borne game, questioning why I would do this to myself). There will be lots of death for you here. Battles are unrelenting. Enemies take no quarter and constantly seek to do you harm. </p>
<p> But, there is a great story to be told alongside the difficult fights. There are loads of different weapons. Expanded gameplay through DLC expansions. And, some of the most insane bosses you'll see in any game. </p>
<p> In the end Bloodborne is also all about the combat. Punishing as it may be, it's rewarding in a way that is almost incomparable. Bloodborne is not for the weak. It will challenge you. But you'll love it once you get the hang of things. </p>
<p> Best PS4 game for a more casual, relaxing experience </p>
<p> Journey </p>
<p> With Bloodborne out of the way, Journey is way on the other side of the spectrum. It's a very casual and relaxing adventure game that has some really nice art and just overall zen-like gameplay. </p>
<p> It's best played with headphones if you have them, but still enjoyable if you don't. </p>
<p> Journey is the kind of game you play when you simply want to kick back and have fun playing a game that doesn't ask too much of you. It's free of high-energy combat, vocal dialogue, and is completely focused on the story and adventure. </p>
<p> It's also the cheapest game on this list which makes it a steal because it's one of the best games PS4 has to offer. </p>
<p> Best PS4 game for MMO fans </p>
<p> Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers </p>
<p> Another one for Final Fantasy fans, but vastly different from the aforementioned FF VII: Remake. As this is an MMO and an ongoing game that has multiple expansions (with more to come in the future), a vast story to follow, hundreds if not thousands of quests, raids, dungeons, extremely vast character progression across tons of classes and more. </p>
<p> When it comes to games, no game type offers more to do than an MMO. And Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers, the game's latest expansion, is one of the best. </p>
<p> Dive into the world of Norvrandt (and Eorzea before it) and check out two new classes as well as all the old favorites. The game's A Realm Reborn content which is the first portion of this game, has also been recently overhauled to make things more streamlined so you can get to new content faster. </p>
<p> Best PS4 game for stealth gameplay </p>
<p> Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain </p>
<p> This is the last game in the long-running and iconic Metal Gear franchise, which has been around for decades. </p>
<p> It features a huge open-world with probably the best stealth combat of any game out there, and a fantastic story to follow with engaging characters and some zany additions that could only be expected of Hideo Kojima. </p>
<p> Build up your motherbase, recruit allies and soldiers, take on missions and even engage in multiplayer content with the MP mode. If you're a fan of Metal Gear, make sure you play this title. If you've never played a Metal Gear game before, make sure you play this title. </p>
<p> Best PS4 game for racing </p>
<p> Need For Speed </p>
<p> A grand return to form from day's past, 2015's Need For Speed is one of the most fun racing games you'll ever play from the PS4 generation. And Probably the best Need For Speed game since Need For Speed Underground 2 on the PS2 console. </p>
<p> It has loads of cars from tons of top brands, and a massive customizer that lets you tweak paint jobs, add decals, create decals, change out wheels and more. Hundreds upon hundreds of missions will keep you occupied while you race around the city, building up your rep and your garage of different cars. </p>
<p> The graphics also feature a pretty cool cinematic style that hadn't been seen much in other racing games. Plus it's got a pretty cool photo mode you can use to show off your ride, and there's an online mode to race against other players. </p>
<p> Best PS4 zombie game </p>
<p> The Last Of Us Remastered </p>
<p> The Last Of Us Remastered is one of PS4's best games since the console's for numerous reasons, but mainly because it offers up an emotional roller coaster of a story that is easy to empathize with. </p>
<p> It grabs hold of you and never lets go as you come to terms with the zombie apocalypse that's unfolding around you, causing a societal collapse and ushering in a "new normal" for the game's characters. </p>
<p> With The Last Of Us Part II having just released earlier this year, definitely pick this up and play it first. You won't regret it. </p>
<p> Best open-world PS4 game with excellent storytelling </p>
<p> Ghost Of Tsushima </p>
<p> Where to start with Ghost Of Tsushima. The first game from Sucker Punch since Infamous First Light, Ghost Of Tsushima follows the story of Jin Sakai, a samurai on Tsushima island in the late 13th century. </p>
<p> You face the onslaught of the Mongol invasion attempting to make its way to the main island of Japan. And as one of the last surviving samurai on the Japan's smaller Tsushima island, it's up to you to rally everyone and help save your people and beat back the invaders. </p>
<p> The story alone is one of the great things about this game. Ghost Of Tsushima excellent story telling, but it also features so much more to love. </p>
<p> Excellent graphics, for one/ There's also an insanely fun battle system where you can choose to fight more from the shadows with ninja-like abilities such as assassinations and poison-filled charms, or you can choose to fight more with honor like the samurai you are and face your enemies head on. </p>
<p> There are multiple different sword stances to help you adjust to different combat encounters and different enemies too. The world of the game also has tons of things to find and collect from across the island, including story-based items, and vanity items like new armor, hats, and sword kits. </p>
<p> There's also a pretty cool character progression system. But perhaps the best part about this game is the beautiful world that Sucker Punch has created. Filled with wonders and things to discover, and a photo mode that is so packed with features that it has spawned some of the most gorgeous game screenshots ever. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Robot Vacuums – October 2020 </p>
<p> Robot vacuums have come a long way in the past few years. No longer do you have to take out your regular vacuum to clean up what it left behind. But we also have robot vacuums at all sorts of price points. From under $100 to over $1,000. So it's hard to gauge which of these robot vacuums are the best. Well, we have tested and reviewed a good number of robot vacuums, so we are here to help you decide on the best one you can currently buy. </p>
<p> There are generally three tiers of robot vacuums. The lower tier is really basic, it doesn't even have WiFi and uses it's own remote. The middle tier has WiFi and a compatible app, along with Google Assistant/Amazon Alexa compatibility and most likely a way to map out your home. Then there's the higher-end tier that uses cameras to see obstacles and might even have a way to empty its own dustbin. This list of the best robot vacuums have entries from all of these tiers and ones that meet different needs. </p>
<p> So without further ado, here is our list of the best Robot Vacuums available right now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Robot Vacuums </p>
<p> Robot vacuums can be pretty fun. As you can watch it zoom around the house picking up everything, and even put your cats on them for a ride too. Not to mention the fact that it means you no longer need to vacuum your floors. </p>
<p> But, not all robot vacuums are created equally. And not all of them are good. So here are the best robot vacuums. </p>
<p> Best overall robot vacuum </p>
<p> Roborock S6 Maxv </p>
<p> The Roborock S6 Maxv is hands-down the best robot vacuum on the market today, and it's not even the most expensive. </p>
<p> With the Roborock S6 Maxv, there are a few features that really make it stand out from the crowd. First up is the stereo camera on the front. This camera is used to help the S6 Maxv avoid obstacles like cords, shoes, scales and even dog poop. It also works with the LiDAR setup on the S6 Maxv to better map out your home. </p>
<p> It also sports some pretty powerful suction. We're looking at 2500Pa, which is about 25% more than its predecessor and the rest of the market. So that it is not going to leave any dirt, dust or other debris on the floor. </p>
<p> Best for low-clearance furniture </p>
<p> eufy Boost IQ RoboVac 11S (Slim) </p>
<p> This robot vacuum is from Anker (eufy is a sub-brand of Anker), so you already know what to expect with this one. It's a relatively inexpensive robot vacuum, that does pretty well. Now unlike the iRobot and Roborock vacuums already listed, this one does not map out your home, or go in a specific pattern. It goes in a random pattern. Which might sound like a bad idea, but it does still do a good job at getting every inch of your home – it may just take a bit longer. </p>
<p> The name of this one is the RoboVac 11S, and the "S" is for slim. That is because this robot vacuum is not quite as tall as the others out there, allowing it to go under your furniture without hitting it. That might sound like a small thing, but it's actually a big deal. As some others can't get under your couch to clean, normally. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> eufy says that the RoboVac 11S will run for about 120 minutes before it needs to head back to its dock. If it hasn't finished cleaning before the battery starts dying, it'll start up again once the battery is fully charged. </p>
<p> Best robot vacuum for corner cleaning </p>
<p> Neato Robotics D7 Connected </p>
<p> The Neato D7 Connected has been a fan-favorite here at Android Headlines for quite some time. We've been really impressed with the way the D7 Connected is able to navigate around the home. And this is thanks to it using lasers. Now it's not the only one that uses lasers – most iRobot and Roborock vacuums do too. But this one does a better job, actually. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the D shape, the D7 Connected is able to edge clean much better and get into all of those corners in your home. That's actually a bigger deal than it might sound like. </p>
<p> This robot vacuum is perfect for those that have pets. Thanks to the extra suction here, the D7 Connected is going to be able to get all of the pet hair up and out of the carpet in your home, which is also a big deal. Especially if you are allergic to those pets, but still love them. </p>
<p> Neato made sure that with a robot vacuum that has "connected" in the name, that it is going to be well connected. It is of course connected through the Neato Robotics app, so you can control this robot vacuum with your phone. But it is also connected to Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can control it all with your voice as well. </p>
<p> Best self-emptying robot vacuum </p>
<p> iRobot Roomba i3+ </p>
<p> Robot vacuums that can empty their own dust bins, is one of the newer features that we are starting to see on robot vacuums these days. It's a really cool feature, because you don't need to worry about forgetting to empty it, or spilling it on the ground after it has cleaned up. iRobot was first to do this, and now it's bringing it to even cheaper models. </p>
<p> With the new Roomba i3+, you get the ability to self-empty the dustbin. But you also get improved cleaning with the longer brushes and better suction. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Even though there is no LiDAR module on the top of the i3+, there is still connected mapping, as well as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant available. </p>
<p> Best value self-emptying robot vacuum </p>
<p> Shark IQ R101AE </p>
<p> Shark isn't a name you're probably familiar with for robot vacuums, but they have been making vacuums for decades. And the IQ R101AE is a really good option if you want a self-emptying robot vacuum, without spending $600. </p>
<p> The R101AE actually backs up onto the base to empty itself. And it does it really well. It still offers up some incredible suction, and won't miss any of the dirt, dust and other debries. It also can be controlled via your smartphone and use Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to control it. </p>
<p> Best for hands-free cleaning </p>
<p> iRobot Roomba i7+ </p>
<p> The Roomba i7+ is also a self-emptying robot vacuum, but the reason it is on this list in addition to the i3+, is its better cleaning power. </p>
<p> The i7+ is able to clean better than the i3+, thanks to having more suction and better power. So if you mean business and possibly have pets, then this is the one to get. </p>
<p> With the i7+, you still get the ability to map out your home, as well as do a deep cleaning. There is also the ability to use the Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa to start cleaning. </p>
<p> Best for pet owners </p>
<p> Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo T8 AIVI </p>
<p> The Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo T8 AIVI is a really great option for those with pets. You see, like the Roborock S6 Maxv, this one also has a camera in the front. Which can watch out for things like shoes, scales, pet poop and such. But it also boasts some really incredible suction power. So it can pick up all of the dirt, dust, debris and pet hair that might be on your floors. Even those you can't see. </p>
<p> It is also great for its mopping ability. The Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo T8 AIVI has a mopping module you can purchase separately that will actually scrub your floors. And it does an incredible job. I was amazed when I saw how well it cleaned my floors, during my review. </p>
<p> Best value robot vacuum </p>
<p> Roborock S4 </p>
<p> Most people want to spend as little as possible on something like a vacuum, but also want it to work well. And the Roborock S4 fits that bill. It's under $300 right now, but still offers a really great experience. </p>
<p> It uses LiDAR to map out your home still, so it can clean everywhere without missing any spots. It offers some pretty powerful suction at 2000Pa, that's strong enough to pick up AA batteries. </p>
<p> Roborock also includes the ability to do selective cleaning, so you can choose to clean a specific area, and not the entire house. Or set no-go zones. </p>
<p> With the Roborock S4, you're going to get about two and a half hours of cleaning time. Before you need to recharge it. Which is pretty nice. Finally, it is compatible with the Roborock app, for automated cleaning and ability to use Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Best Mop </p>
<p> iRobot Braava Jet M6 </p>
<p> Technically, this is not a robot vacuum. But we'd thought we would include it since a lot of the mopping on these robot vacuums is just not that great. </p>
<p> The Braava Jet M6 on the other hand, is pretty incredible. It has a precision jet spray, which is good for getting up tough grease and other dirt off the floor. It still uses the smart mapping that other iRobot Roomba's use, so it can run back and forth until it has cleaned the entire house. </p>
<p> Finally, this is really great for open spaces. Obviously, it is not something that a lot of people are going to buy, unless the majority of their house is not carpeted. If just your kitchen and bathroom are not carpet, then it's not really worth it to buy this. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Accessories </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is finally here, and you're going to want some great accessories to deck it out, of course you're going to want the best of the best. Where the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra can already do so much, but with these accessories, it can do so much more. </p>
<p> If you're looking for some cases for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, you can check those out here. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Accessories </p>
<p> The accessories on this list include screen protectors, PopSockets, wireless headphones, extra USB-C cables and much more. So there's something for everyone, and at every price point. It's also going to help you make the most out of your purchase of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. </p>
<p> Best truly wireless headphones </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Buds Live </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live are the latest pair of truly wireless headphones from Samsung. Typically we wouldn't say these are the best (we are currently knee-deep in our review of the Buds Live). But on a Samsung smartphone, the experience is really great. </p>
<p> This is because of all of the added features that you get with using these on a Samsung phone. The app is already installed, which makes setup super simple. Just pop open the case and they will start pairing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Buds Live also come with ANC, though it's not that great, because these are open-back headphones. But they are pretty comfortable to wear, and that's nice to see. Battery life is pitted at about six hours of continuous listening. Which is pretty decent for a pair of truly wireless headphones. </p>
<p> Best PopSocket </p>
<p> PopSockets: PopGrip </p>
<p> The PopGrip from PopSockets is a really good accessory for really any phone. And the reason why this is the best PopSocket you can buy right now is because it does allow you to swap out the top. So if you want to change the color, you can do so. </p>
<p> PopGrip is really great because it allows you to hold onto your phone much easier, especially these larger phones like the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. But it also doubles as a sort of kickstand for your smartphone. Allowing you to use it on long flights to watch a movie or two, without having to hold your phone the whole time. It's a really genius invention, and it's something that everyone should have. </p>
<p> You can attach the PopGrip to your case, so that it doesn't ruin your phone too. </p>
<p> Best Battery Pack </p>
<p> Samsung 25W Portable Battery </p>
<p> Normally on these lists, we would list an Anker, AUKEY or even a RAVPower battery pack, as those are really great options and usually much cheaper. But for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, we opted to list the Samsung 25W Portable Battery because of one big reason, and it's in the name. It is a 25W portable battery pack. And since Samsung is using USB-C PD and another technology that most battery packs aren't using yet, this seemed like the best option. </p>
<p> At 25W, it is going to charge your Galaxy Note 20 Ultra just as fast as the wall charger that comes in the box. And with 10,000mAh capacity, you'll get one, maybe two charges out of it. This depends on how depleted the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is when you charge it. Remember the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has a 4000mAh capacity battery (4500mAh on the S20+ and 5000mAh on the S20 Ultra). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's also fairly thin, so it can fit in your pocket without any real issues. At this time, we don't have a price for the Samsung 25W Portable Battery, as it has not yet been made available for purchase. So keep that in mind. </p>
<p> Best Micro SD Card </p>
<p> SanDisk Extreme 512GB </p>
<p> With the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra still offering a micro SD card slot, you're definitely going to want to get one. Now there is 128GB of storage available internally, but with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra being able to shoot 8K video on all three models, a micro SD card is a must. </p>
<p> We chose this particular micro SD card because of the speed. It's fast enough to be able to write 8K footage to the card in almost real-time. That way you aren't needing to wait to record some more footage. That can be an issue with slower micro SD cards. </p>
<p> Also, you're getting 512GB of storage with this micro SD card. Which is going to be plenty of space for storing plenty of 8K videos, and even 4K video as well as pictures. You can also store your music library offline on this micro SD card, if needed. </p>
<p> Best Smartwatch </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 comes in two colors, the Mystic Bronze and Mystic Black to match the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. It is also Samsung's latest and greatest smartwatch. Which makes it perfect to pair with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Watch 3 is a really great option for a lot of people, because it packs a pretty big display onto your wrist, but doesn't push a lot of apps to your wrist. Instead, it focuses on notifications and fitness tracking. Notifications is more important, because it allows you to keep up with what's happening without pulling out your phone. And much easier to use than having to scroll through Twitter on your wrist. </p>
<p> It also has some pretty good sleep tracking and multi-day battery life. It comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes, starting at $399. </p>
<p> Best Wireless Charger </p>
<p> Samsung Wireless Charger Stand 15W </p>
<p> Also on our list of the best Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra accessories, is this fast wireless charging stand. This model is able to output 15W, for wireless charging. That's still much slower than wired charging, especially on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but still plenty fast. </p>
<p> At 15W, you should be able to quickly set down your Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and have it quickly charge or top off your smartphone. It's a charging stand, so you can also use it next to your bed on a bedside table without any issues. Which makes for a really great experience. </p>
<p> Samsung is selling this Wireless Charger Stand in two colors: black and white. So depending on the color of the table you have and want to put it on, you can get one to match. </p>
<p> Best screen protector </p>
<p> ESR Tempered-Glass Screen Protector </p>
<p> Picking up a screen protector for your new Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is definitely important. You really don't want to mess up that big and beautiful display on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. And this two-pack of tempered glass screen protectors from ESR is a really good option. </p>
<p> They are cheap and also offer up a great experience. Now, the only downside is that the under-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor will not work with this screen protector applied. So make sure you think about whether you want to no longer be able to use it, before buying this screen protector. If you remove the screen protector, you can still use it though. </p>
<p> Best battery pack </p>
<p> RAVPower Portable Charger 20000mAh PD 3.0 Power Bank </p>
<p> The RAVPower Portable Charger 20000mAh PD 3.0 Power Bank is a really great option for a battery pack for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. This is because it offers USB-C PD 3.0 charging speeds, and will be able to charge your phone pretty quickly. </p>
<p> It also uses two USB-A ports with fast charging, so you can charge other devices at the same time. RAVPower also includes two more USB-C ports for input, which is really nice, when you need to charge this battery up pretty quickly. </p>
<p> Best USB-C Cables </p>
<p> Anker Powerline II USB-C to USB-C </p>
<p> It's always a good idea to get another USB-C cable or two, to have around your home. While you probably don't need one at your office right now, since the majority of us are not actually going to work. It is good to have one in the car and other places around your home. </p>
<p> This is a USB-C to USB-C cable that is capable of USB-C PD speeds, so it can charge your phone pretty quickly too. That's important in this day and age of fast charging. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Cases </p>
<p> The best cases for the brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra need to be able to protect the phone, while also making it look rather stylish. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is one of the most expensive (non-foldable) phones on the market today, with a price tag of $1299. And getting a case that only costs $20 is definitely worth it, to protect it from any damage. We have rounded up the very best Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra cases, and listed them below. </p>
<p> This list includes clear cases, fabric cases, thin cases and much more. So that there is something for everyone. </p>
<p> Best fabric case </p>
<p> Samsung Kvadrat Cover </p>
<p> Samsung has been making cases for its phones for a few years now, and they've gotten really good. They've gotten so good that about half of the cases on this best list for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, are made by Samsung. Including the Kvadrat Cover. </p>
<p> The Samsung Kvadrat Cover is a really sleek looking case for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. It comes in this red color seen above, as well as gray. </p>
<p> It's not a clear case, so it doesn't show off the mystic bronze color of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but it is fabric that does give you some nice grip to hold onto the phone. Which one might argue is even more important. </p>
<p> Best Leather Case </p>
<p> Samsung Leather Cover </p>
<p> The Samsung Leather Cover is a really great option for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, because it makes the phone look classy, and adds some grip to the phone too. Allowing you to hold onto it, and never worry about dropping it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung offers this leather case in three colors: black, brown and green. The green one looks really good, if we're being perfectly honest. </p>
<p> Once this Leather Cover starts to age a bit, you'll really see how great this case looks on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. </p>
<p> Best clear case </p>
<p> Ringke Fusion </p>
<p> The Ringke Fusion case is the best clear case available for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. </p>
<p> This is because it does a few things well. It has reinforced sides and corners which will keep your phone from shattering when it hits the ground. Because we all know it is going to get dropped at some point. It also is completely clear and allows you to show off the look of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. This is particularly important if you bought the Mystic Bronze. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additionally, the Ringke Fusion is only $11, which makes it one of the cheaper options on this list. </p>
<p> Best wallet case </p>
<p> Spigen Slim Armor CS </p>
<p> The Spigen Slim Armor CS is our favorite case for those that want a wallet case. It is able to hide a few cards in its backside, which you can easily slide out. And since most of your cards are supported by Samsung Pay, you won't need to keep many in there. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is also a really good case to protect your phone. Since it does have a rather thick bumper around it, that is going to protect it from falls and such. It also has a soft-touch backside that is going to make it easier to hold onto. All of which are great reasons to get this, never mind the fact that it is a great wallet case too. </p>
<p> Best looking case </p>
<p> Caseology Parallax </p>
<p> The Caseology Parallax has long been one of our favorite cases for any smartphone. This is due to its relatively unique looking design, which does look really great too. It has a triangle pattern on the back, that is 3D. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Not only does that pattern look cool, but it works really well with grip. Making it easier to hold onto the phone. </p>
<p> Caseology Parallax is a dual-layer case too. With the soft part going against the phone and then a hard bumper that goes around that. This is to help protect it when it falls out of your hands, so that you won't need to worry about it shattering. That's always a good thing. </p>
<p> Best Silicon Case </p>
<p> Samsung Silicon Cover </p>
<p> The Samsung Silicon Cover is the best silicon case out there right now. And it's also super minimal. </p>
<p> Samsung offers the Silicon Cover in all three colors that the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is available in: black, brown and white. The brown color is meant to match the "Mystic Bronze" color. </p>
<p> It's a really good looking case, but be careful. If you get the black one, it is going to attract fingerprints, dust, dirt and everything else. The lighter colors usually aren't as bad. </p>
<p> This is a good case to pick up if you want something that is going to give you some grip, but also offer up some class for your Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. </p>
<p> Best kickstand case </p>
<p> ESR Metal Kickstand Case </p>
<p> The ESR Metal Kickstand Case fits two different categories here, in our best cases list for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. It's a great looking clear case, and it is also a great kickstand case. </p>
<p> Since that display on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is so good, you're going to want to get yourself a case with a kickstand. So you can enjoy watching YouTube, and other videos on it, without holding it for long periods of time. And the ESR Metal Kickstand Case is great at doing just that. </p>
<p> It doesn't look as great with the kickstand there, but it is very useful to have. </p>
<p> Best dual-layer case </p>
<p> OtterBox Symmetry Series Case </p>
<p> For those that need some extra protection, but don't quite need a rugged case, this is a really good option for you. </p>
<p> It's a dual-layer case, so it has plenty of protection, if you do end up dropping your phone. Now, that does also mean that it is going to be a lot thicker and heavier. Which is going to suck a bit, since the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is already such a large smartphone. But it's better than shattering your $1300 smartphone. </p>
<p> OtterBox does offer the OtterBox Symmetry Series Case in a few different colors. So there's this Cake Pop Pink, as well as Earl Grey and Black. </p>
<p> Best rugged case </p>
<p> Samsung Rugged Drop Protection Cover </p>
<p> The Samsung Rugged Drop Protection Cover is the best rugged case you can buy. I mean just look at it. It screams rugged. This is a really good case for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, especially those that are prone to dropping their phones a lot. Of course, one of the bigger reasons to get this case, is that it will make that camera bump flat! </p>
<p> It has grips on the side, as well as a rugged back. Which likely makes this pretty drop proof. </p>
<p> The Rugged Protective Cover has been drop-tested to provide outstanding protection. </p>
<p> It also has a kickstand on the back, so you can watch content on your amazing display that the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Accessories – March 2020 </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S20 series is bound to be the most popular line of smartphones in 2020, and while they are already pretty powerful, there are a few accessories you'll want to buy to get the most out of it. Whether that's a new smartwatch, battery pack, car mount or even a screen protector. We have it all here for you. These will all make your Samsung Galaxy S20 experience even better. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Accessories – February 2020 </p>
<p> The accessories on this list will work for all three Samsung Galaxy S20 smartphones (Galaxy S20, S20+ and S20 Ultra). So no matter which version you decide to pick up, you're going to be covered. We won't be listing cases in this top 10, since we already have a separate post on that. </p>
<p> This list includes some generic products like battery packs, smartwatches, PopSockets and such, so they can also be used with other smartphones, if you wish to do so. And that includes the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. </p>
<p> Best Screen Protector </p>
<p> Starred Screen Protector </p>
<p> This screen protector for the Galaxy S20 is available for all three models, and also comes in a three pack. So once it starts to get a bit disgusting, you can remove it and apply a new one to your smartphone. </p>
<p> It's a TPU screen protector, so it's made of plastic. And definitely not a tempered glass screen protector. Which would also cost a whole lot more. It does have a hole in the screen protector for using the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that is built into the display. Which is unfortunate, as it does make it a bit ugly, but at least you can still use it. </p>
<p> Best PopSocket </p>
<p> PopSockets: PopGrip </p>
<p> The PopGrip from PopSockets is a really good accessory for really any phone. And the reason why this is the best PopSocket you can buy right now is because it does allow you to swap out the top. So if you want to change the color, you can do so. </p>
<p> PopGrip is really great because it allows you to hold onto your phone much easier, especially these larger phones like the Galaxy S20 Ultra. But it also doubles as a sort of kickstand for your smartphone. Allowing you to use it on long flights to watch a movie or two, without having to hold your phone the whole time. It's a really genius invention, and it's something that everyone should have. </p>
<p> You can attach the PopGrip to your case, so that it doesn't ruin your phone too. </p>
<p> Best Battery Pack </p>
<p> Samsung 25W Portable Battery </p>
<p> Normally on these lists, we would list an Anker, AUKEY or even a RAVPower battery pack, as those are really great options and usually much cheaper. But for the Galaxy S20, we opted to list the Samsung 25W Portable Battery because of one big reason, and it's in the name. It is a 25W portable battery pack. And since Samsung is using USB-C PD and another technology that most battery packs aren't using yet, this seemed like the best option. </p>
<p> At 25W, it is going to charge your Galaxy S20 just as fast as the wall charger that comes in the box. And with 10,000mAh capacity, you'll get one, maybe two charges out of it. This depends on how depleted the Galaxy S20 is when you charge it. Remember the Galaxy S20 has a 4000mAh capacity battery (4500mAh on the S20+ and 5000mAh on the S20 Ultra). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's also fairly thin, so it can fit in your pocket without any real issues. At this time, we don't have a price for the Samsung 25W Portable Battery, as it has not yet been made available for purchase. So keep that in mind. </p>
<p> Best Fast Wall Charger </p>
<p> Samsung 45W USB-C Fast Charging Wall Charger </p>
<p> This accessory is more for the Galaxy S20 Ultra, as the other two Galaxy S20 models cannot charge at 45W, and instead are limited to 25W. So keep that in mind here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But this 45W USB-C wall charger is perfect for those that want to charge their Galaxy S20 Ultra in a hurry. You'll be able to fully charge that 5,000mAh capacity battery in just under an hour (58 minutes to be exact), and thats from zero to 100%. That is pretty impressive, and if you're one that is always in a hurry, this charger is going to be a really good option. </p>
<p> Now if you're not, the 25W charger that comes in the box with the Galaxy S20 Ultra is still going to be perfectly fine for charging pretty quickly. It'll still charge completely in under two hours. Which is plenty fast for most people. </p>
<p> Best Smartwatch </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the best smartwatch to go with your shiny new Galaxy S20. For one, it's also made by Samsung, so you know you're going to get the best experience on a Samsung smartphone. And two, it's the best Android-compatible smartwatch on the market today. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Watch Active 2 comes with multi-day battery life. It's also pretty thin and lightweight, so it doesn't look chonky on your wrist. On top of that, it runs on Tizen, so you are able to use some of your favorite apps, but most of all, it runs smoothly. </p>
<p> There aren't a ton of apps available for the Galaxy Watch Active 2, but the ones you need, are available. Like Uber, Samsung Health and many more. This smartwatch is more about tracking your health and fitness, instead of allowing you to use your smartwatch like you would your smartphone. Though there are still notifications on your wrist. </p>
<p> Best Micro SD Card </p>
<p> SanDisk Extreme 512GB </p>
<p> With the Galaxy S20 still offering a micro SD card slot on all three models, you're definitely going to want to get one. Now there is 128GB of storage available internally, but with the Galaxy S20 being able to shoot 8K video on all three models, a micro SD card is a must. </p>
<p> We chose this particular micro SD card because of the speed. It's fast enough to be able to write 8K footage to the card in almost real-time. That way you aren't needing to wait to record some more footage. That can be an issue with slower micro SD cards. </p>
<p> Also, you're getting 512GB of storage with this micro SD card. Which is going to be plenty of space for storing plenty of 8K videos, and even 4K video as well as pictures. You can also store your music library offline on this micro SD card, if needed. </p>
<p> Best Car Mount </p>
<p> iOttie Easy One Touch 4 Dash & Windshield </p>
<p> Don't be fooled by the fact that this car mount has an iPhone in the picture. It still made our Best Galaxy S20 Accessories list for a good reason. And one of those reasons is because it works with any smartphone. But it also doesn't use magnets to hold your phone in place. And for something like the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra that is fairly heavy, that's a really good thing. </p>
<p> The iOttie Easy One Touch 4 car mount uses adjustable arms to keep your phone in place. It also attaches to either the dashboard or the windshield, so you can use it for navigation and for streaming music. You can turn it so that it is in landscape as well. </p>
<p> The arm is also adjustable, so you can adjust how long it is and how close to the dashboard it is. Which is also pretty important. </p>
<p> Best Car Charger </p>
<p> Samsung 45W Dual Port Car Charger </p>
<p> This car charger is the only one you should buy for the Galaxy S20 series, especially if you are buying the Galaxy S20 Ultra. And that's because it can charge your phone at the full 45W that the Galaxy S20 Ultra can handle. Meaning that on a short trip home from work, your Galaxy S20 Ultra is going to be almost completely charged. </p>
<p> Now, if you have a Galaxy S20 or S20+ that doesn't do the full 45W, don't worry. This is backwards compatible and can do 25W too. It can also do slower with the USB-A port which does 15W. If you happen to have another, older device you want to charge in the car. </p>
<p> This is a really great car charger to pick up, since it is also a dual-port car charger. </p>
<p> Best Wireless Headphones </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Buds+ </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are a really great pair of wireless headphones and these are now truly wireless. Samsung took the original Galaxy Buds and improved on them in key areas, including battery life. So now you are getting 11 hours of continuous playback on the Galaxy Buds+, and there is another 11 hours in the included carrying case. </p>
<p> On top of that, it improved ambient sound and they now have noise isolation. It's not quite noise cancellation, but fairly close. And you can still hear people talking to you, or trying to get your attention, when wearing the Galaxy Buds+, which is definitely important. </p>
<p> These come in three colors: white, cosmic black, and cloud blue. </p>
<p> Best Wireless Charger </p>
<p> Samsung Wireless Charger Stand 15W </p>
<p> Rounding out our list of the best Galaxy S20 accessories, is this fast wireless charging stand. This model is able to output 15W, for wireless charging. That's still much slower than wired charging, especially on the Galaxy S20 Ultra, but still plenty fast. </p>
<p> At 15W, you should be able to quickly set down your Galaxy S20 and have it quickly charge or top off your smartphone. It's a charging stand, so you can also use it next to your bed on a bedside table without any issues. Which makes for a really great experience. </p>
<p> Samsung is selling this Wireless Charger Stand in two colors: black and white. So depending on the color of the table you have and want to put it on, you can get one to match. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Cases – September 2020 </p>
<p> The Galaxy S20 is a fragile and expensive phone. Starting at $999 and being essentially a glass sandwich. Which means that you're going to need some protection for this new smartphone. There are a ton of cases available for the Galaxy S20 already, with more coming in the next few weeks. We've rounded up the cases that are the absolute best for the Galaxy S20 right now. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Cases </p>
<p> From flip cases, to leather folios, to TPU cases, we've got everything you might need for your Galaxy S20 right here. </p>
<p> It's important to mention that this list only has Galaxy S20 cases, not Galaxy S20+ or Galaxy S20 Ultra cases. Those will have separate lists. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the Galaxy S20 pre-orders have not opened just yet, now is still a good time to grab a case or two. So that your case(s) will be in your hands before your Galaxy S20 is. Allowing you to take your Galaxy S20 out of the box and put it in a case. That way there's less of a chance that it gets dropped or damaged. </p>
<p> Best Design </p>
<p> Caseology Parallax </p>
<p> The Caseology Parallax has been one of our favorite cases for a number years now, and it still remains one of our favorites in 2020 for the Galaxy S20. It made our best Galaxy S20 cases list for a number of reasons. For one, it's still somewhat cheap at just $14. But it also has a really cool design. </p>
<p> Caseology has been using a 3D pattern on the back of the Parallax, which not only looks cool, but it also gives it some grip. Making it easier to hold onto your Galaxy S20 smartphone. That's definitely a good feature to have. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the Parallax is still a bit on the thicker side, it does a good job at protecting your Galaxy S20, and let's face it, that's why you bought this case. </p>
<p> Best Rugged Case </p>
<p> Otterbox Commuter Series </p>
<p> The Otterbox Commuter series is a really great case for those that are clumsy, and aren't great at holding onto their phone. Or just want to make sure that their $1,000 phone stays in good shape. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As expected, the Otterbox Commuter is a fairly thick case. But this offers a ton of protection for the Galaxy S20, which is good to see. There is a lip over the display, so that if it is dropped and the display hits the ground, it should be pretty well protected. </p>
<p> Now while the case is fairly thick, it doesn't block the camera. Specifically the ultrawide camera. This is because the camera module is beveled, so the case stays out of the way. So it won't affect how you use your Galaxy S20 at all. And that's an important thing to a lot of people. This isn't a cheap smartphone case, but it is definitely worth the investment if you have trouble keeping your phone in decent shape. Having a shattered screen is no fun. </p>
<p> Best ultra thin case </p>
<p> Totallee Thin Case </p>
<p> Some people hate cases, but know that they are needed to make it easier to hold onto their phone and keep it in good shape. That's where a thin case like this one comes in. The Totallee Thin Case is so thin that you'll forget that it is even there. And that's a great thing. </p>
<p> It's super thin, and kind of ironic that it comes on this list after the Otterbox Commuter Series case. It comes in a froster color, black and clear. So you can choose to still show off the color of your Galaxy S20, or to hide it and just go with black. And where the colors aren't that spectacular this year, clear cases aren't as big of a deal for the Galaxy S20. </p>
<p> Totallee has continuously put out some of the best clear and thin cases on the market, and it's no different this time around with the Galaxy S20. </p>
<p> Best case with PopSocket built-in </p>
<p> Otter + Pop Symmetry Series Case </p>
<p> This is another pretty rugged case for the Galaxy S20. It's a bit thinner than the Commuter Series case from Otterbox. But it has a PopSocket built-in. Where the majority of us will install a PopSocket on the Galaxy S20 anyways, it's a good idea to get a case with one built-in. Then you don't have to worry about it falling off and whatnot. </p>
<p> The Symmetry case is still fairly thick, so it is going to do a really good job at keeping your phone nice and safe. Especially if you do end up dropping it. There's still a lip over the screen to keep it safe. And seeing as that is the most expensive part of the phone to replace, that's a really good thing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This case is one of the more expensive models on this list, but at $60, it is definitely worth it. Since you are getting a rugged case and a PopSocket all in one. </p>
<p> Best thin but grippy case </p>
<p> Spigen Liquid Air </p>
<p> Spigen once again graces our Best Galaxy S20 cases list, as it has on many other devices. The Spigen Liquid Air is a really good choice for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is still pretty thin. But it also looks good and adds some grip, so you don't have to worry about it possibly slipping out of your hands. That is very important. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Spigen uses a triangle pattern on the back of the Liquid Air, so it gives you some grip. Much better than just having glass, which can be very slippery. </p>
<p> It's still very thin, not quite as thin as the Totallee case that is also on this list, but pretty close. And in black, it'll look good on all of the different colors of the Galaxy S20 smartphone. So there's that. </p>
<p> Best thin & durable case </p>
<p> Ringke Fusion X Case </p>
<p> The Ringke Fusion X case is also a durable case for the Galaxy S20. On the scale of durability though, it's probably about a 6, compared to the Otterbox Commuter series case. But it is also about a fifth of the price, coming in at just $8. So if you need a semi durable case, at a cheap price, the Ringke Fusion X case is a really good idea for a case for your Galaxy S20. </p>
<p> As you can see in the picture above, the Ringke Fusion X case has reinforced edges and corners. This is important because most of the time when your phone falls out of your hand, it hits the side or the corner of the device. So reinforcing that side means that the case will take the damage instead of your smartphone. And that's very important. </p>
<p> It's also a clear case, to an extent. Allowing you to still see what the phone looks like, even with the case on the Galaxy S20. </p>
<p> Best Everyday Case </p>
<p> Spigen Rugged Armor </p>
<p> The Spigen Rugged Armor is a tried and true case. It's one that has shown up on our best cases lists for years, and it's no surprise that it is here on the Galaxy S20 as well. </p>
<p> This case is a bit thicker than the Liquid Air case from Spigen, but it feels really good in the hand. It uses carbon fiber at the top and bottom, giving it a rather unique look. While the rest of the case is in all black. So you don't have to worry about whether it will go with the color Galaxy S20 you picked up. </p>
<p> It adds some weight and some grip to the Galaxy S20 too. It has a slight lip over the screen to protect the screen from getting damaged, if you do drop the phone by any chance. </p>
<p> Best Silicon Case </p>
<p> Samsung Silicon Cover </p>
<p> This is the Silicon Cover that Samsung puts out for the Galaxy S and Note smartphones every year. It's a somewhat flexible case for the Galaxy S20 that is going to make it easier to keep your phone protected, while also keeping it looking great. </p>
<p> Samsung does offer the Silicon Cover in many different colors. Including black, blue, navy, pink, white and gray. To match just about every color of the Galaxy S20 possible, which is nice to see. </p>
<p> This does have a slight lip over the display, though it's not as big as some of the Otterbox cases that are on this list. It will do some protection, but not quite as much as the rugged cases on this list. </p>
<p> Best Wallet Folio Case </p>
<p> AMZLIFE PU Leather Wallet Case </p>
<p> For those that prefer leather wallet folio cases, this is the one to get for the Galaxy S20. It's a PU Leather case, so it's not real leather. Which also explains its price tag of just $12. </p>
<p> The AMZLIFE PU Leather Wallet Case is a pretty good looking case actually. It's black and brown. And it has plenty of space for you to go ahead and put in your credit and debit cards, and even your ID. So you don't have to worry about carrying around a real ID anymore. </p>
<p> And at just $12, this is definitely a good leather wallet folio case to pick up. </p>
<p> Best matte black case </p>
<p> Caseology Vault </p>
<p> The Caseology Vault is a really good option for those that just want a matte black case. Which, is likely most of the fellas out there. It doesn't really have any sort of pattern on the back, but it does have a texture that makes it easier to hold onto the Galaxy S20, which is of course pretty important. </p>
<p> This is a somewhat thick case, though it's not as thick as some of the others on this list – we're looking at you Otterbox. It does add some protection to your Galaxy S20, so you won't need to worry about it falling and breaking. That's always important. </p>
<p> This is a really good option for those that just want a plain case, but one that does make it easier to hold onto your smartphone. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy S20+ Cases – March 2020 </p>
<p> The Galaxy S20+ is likely going to be the most popular of the three Galaxy S20 smartphones Samsung has released. But it is still a very fragile and slippery smartphone. So a wise person would pick up a case (or two) to put on their Galaxy S20+. </p>
<p> Welp, we've rounded up the best cases for the Galaxy S20+ that are currently available. These range from inexpensive to pretty expensive (for a case). So there's something for everyone. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy S20+ Cases – March 2020 </p>
<p> This list of the best cases for the Galaxy S20+ includes cases from clear cases to TPU cases to wallet cases and everything in between. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These only fit the Galaxy S20+, so if you are looking to get a case for the Galaxy S20 or Galaxy S20 Ultra, you'll want to check out their respective top 10s. </p>
<p> Best Design </p>
<p> Samsung Leather Cover </p>
<p> The Samsung Leather Case is by far the best designed case for the Galaxy S20+, and it is at the top of our best cases list for a reason. It is a pretty plain looking case, so it's not flashy and won't grab a lot of attention. Samsung kept it simple here. But with a leather case, Samsung also added some thickness to the Galaxy S20+, making it protect it better when it gets dropped. </p>
<p> Also with leather, it's going to look really nice when it weathers, which is going to be cool. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung does offer this case in a number of colors, so you can get one to match the color of your Galaxy S20+, or a different color – like this red one. </p>
<p> Best Inexpensive Case </p>
<p> KuGi Anit-Slip TPU </p>
<p> The Kugi Anti-Slip TPU is a pretty impressive case, especially seeing as it is just $6. This is a TPU case, that is rigid on the back and on the sides, adding more grip to the Galaxy S20+. That's going to make it much easier to hold onto the device, so that it is less likely to slip out of your hands, which is definitely important. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This case does have a slight lip over the display, so that it will protect the display if it does get dropped. But thanks to the pretty steep curves on the Galaxy S20+, it doesn't interfere with using the device, which is definitely nice. </p>
<p> Finally, the Kugi Anti-Slip TPU is available in three colors: blue, black and red. </p>
<p> Best eco-friendly case </p>
<p> Samsung Kvadrat Cover </p>
<p> The Samsung Kvadrat Cover is a slightly newer case that Samsung is making for its smartphones this year, and it's aimed at being eco-friendly. </p>
<p> That is because the Kvadrat Cover is made completely from recycled material, that is also 100% compostable. So those that are worried about the environment, this Kvadrat Cover is definitely the one to get. </p>
<p> It is a somewhat fabric based cover that provides a good amount of grip to the phone too. Not to mention the fact that it also offers up a rather unique look. Samsung offers this one in a few different colors. Including Green, Red and Gray. </p>
<p> Best Durable Case </p>
<p> OtterBox Commuter Series </p>
<p> The OtterBox Commuter Series case is a really good option for those that are drop prone. As the last thing you want to do with your $1200 smartphone, is drop it and shatter the display. Luckily, the OtterBox Commuter Series is good at protecting it. With a really bit lip over the display, and also a really thick backside and sides. This allows you to drop your phone without it being destroyed. </p>
<p> Now the downside to a case that is this rugged, is the fact that it is going to be very thick. And since the Galaxy S20+ is already a pretty big phone, that makes this an even larger phone. So that's something to keep in mind before buying it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Like the other cases on this list, the OtterBox Commuter Series also comes in a few other colors. So you don't have to stick with that mint color that is shown above. </p>
<p> Best Clear Case </p>
<p> Spigen Liquid Crystal </p>
<p> The Galaxy S20+ has a pretty cool design, and there are a couple of cool colors available – like the navy blue that Best buy has. So you might want to get a clear case so you can appreciate and show off the design of the Galaxy S20+. With the Spigen Liquid Crystal case, you can do just that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is a clear case, and it does also have a nice lip over the display, allowing you to protect the display if it slides out of your hand. Which is very likely to happen. The sides and corners have also been reinforced, so that the Spigen Liquid Crystal is going to take on all of the impact instead of your phone. </p>
<p> The Spigen Liquid Crystal is one of the cheaper cases on this list, and definitely worth picking up. </p>
<p> Best Flip Case </p>
<p> Samsung S-View Flip Cover </p>
<p> The Samsung S-View Flip Cover is more than just another flip case for your Galaxy S20+. It also has a window on the front, that will give you an always-on display. This will show you the time, battery, and your notifications. So you can see at a quick glance whether you need to deal with the notifications you have received. </p>
<p> With the Samsung S-View Flip Cover, you also have the ability to reject calls straight from the cover, without even needing to open your phone. Which is a really convenient feature, to be honest. </p>
<p> Samsung offers the S-View Flip Cover in a few different colors including black, blue, pink, gray and white. Essentially, all of the colors that the Galaxy S20+ is available in. So you can get one to match your Galaxy S20+. </p>
<p> Best wallet case </p>
<p> Snakehive Genuine Leather Wallet Case </p>
<p> Looking for a good leather wallet case for your Galaxy S20+? Snakehive has something for you. This is a stunning looking leather wallet case, and unlike most other wallet cases out there, this is real leather. Which is going to make it easier to hold onto your new phone. But with it being a wallet case, you can keep your Driver's License and other cards with you. Preferably those that are not supported by Samsung Pay yet. </p>
<p> It is still a somewhat thick case for the Galaxy S20+, but that's pretty much expected for a leather wallet case. Snakehive offers this case in a ton of colors, including blue and green, which are odd colors for leather cases. </p>
<p> Best grippy case </p>
<p> Caseology Parallax </p>
<p> Price: $14 </p>
<p> Buy: Amazon </p>
<p> The Caseology Parallax Case is a pretty awesome one to pick up. It offers a pretty unique design on the back, which is a 3D and textured backing. This makes it much easier to hold onto the Galaxy S20+, and that's part of the reason for getting a case. </p>
<p> This case is also available in a ton of different colors, so you can get the one that fits your taste the best. And considering this is under $15, you'd be a fool not to grab this one. </p>
<p> Best Silicon Case </p>
<p> Samsung Silicon Cover </p>
<p> The Samsung Silicon Cover is much like the Leather Cover at the top of this list. It's a pretty plain case and for a lot of people, that's pretty important. </p>
<p> Though, this is made of silicon, so a darker color is going to attract grease and fingerprints a lot more than a lighter color. So getting a lighter color might be a better idea here. The Samsung Silicon Cover does come in a number of colors too. These include, black, blue, navy, pink, gray and white. Basically, all of the colors that the Galaxy S20+ is available in. </p>
<p> Best Durable Case </p>
<p> Spigen Tough Armor </p>
<p> Rounding out our list of the best cases for the Galaxy S20+ is the Spigen Tough Armor. The Spigen Tough Armor is a pretty durable case from Spigen, for the Galaxy S20+. This is a dual-layer case that offers some really good protection, without making the phone insanely larger like the OtterBox cases tend to do. </p>
<p> Spigen Tough Armor is pretty thick, with a soft layer against the phone and a hard cover on the outside to absorb any impact from dropping the phone and so forth. </p>
<p> Now what really makes this case stand out, is the fact that it has an integrated kickstand. This is going to allow you to prop it up and use it when you're traveling and such to watch Netflix, without having to worry about holding the phone the entire time. Which, and trust me here, is not a fun experience. </p>

<p> Android Buyers Guide / Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra Cases – September 2020 </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra Cases – September 2020 </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra is a big and heavy phone, not to mention its made of glass, so you're going to want a case for it. As the last thing you'll want to do after spending $1399 (plus tax) on the Galaxy S20 Ultra, is for it to fall out of your hands and shatter. </p>
<p> And that's where cases come into play. You can think of cases as an insurance plan for your Galaxy S20 Ultra, and one that you don't have to pay for every month. Some of these are heavy duty, while others are thinner and really just add in some grip so that it's harder for them to fall out of your hands. </p>
<p> Either way, these are the best Galaxy S20 Ultra cases on the market today. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra Cases </p>
<p> This list has the best Galaxy S20 Ultra cases that are available today. This list will continuously be updated as more cases come out – which is bound to happen after the phone is actually available. </p>
<p> We have wallet folios, TPU cases, rugged cases and everything in between. So no matter your style of case, there's something for everyone here. </p>
<p> Best Leather Case </p>
<p> Samsung Leather Case </p>
<p> This is one of the best first-party cases for the Galaxy S20 Ultra, and its a leather one. Which is going to look amazing on the Galaxy S20 Ultra, and also feel really great. Especially once the leather weathers a bit. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Because this is a leather case, it is a bit on the thicker side, but it does also add some grip. So you won't need to worry about the Galaxy S20 Ultra slipping out of your hand which is a great thing. The case is still thinner than the camera bump – it's a serious camera bump – which means that it won't be in the way of the ultrawide camera on the Galaxy S20 Ultra. </p>
<p> Samsung offers the leather case in a few different colors: black, blue, brown, red, silver and gray. Currently, there is no price available, since the case is not yet available. But it should be once the pre-orders for the Galaxy S20 series start on Friday. </p>
<p> Best clear case </p>
<p> ESR Air Armor </p>
<p> The ESR Air Armor is the best clear case that you can buy right now, and it is a really great looking one. It's going to allow you to still show off that beautiful design of the Galaxy S20 will also protecting it. </p>
<p> As you can see in the image above, the sides are a bit thicker. And that's because the sides and corners have been reinforced, and will be able to absorb the shock when the phone is dropped. And seeing as when phones hit the ground, they usually land on the side or the corners (more often the corners), this is a good idea. </p>
<p> There is a slight lip here, going over the screen, which is going to protect that screen if it is dropped as well. Given how big this screen is, it's going to be an expensive one to get replaced. </p>
<p> Best thin case </p>
<p> Totallee Thin Case </p>
<p> The Totallee Thin Case is by far the best thin case that you can pick up for the Galaxy S20 Ultra. It's super thin, and really doesn't feel like you even have a case on your phone. But you can feel that it is there, because it gives you some grip. </p>
<p> So, Totallee offers their case in two colors. There's a transparent, clear case like the ESR one above. And then there's a matte case like the one pictured here. The matte case looks really good, and honestly it's the one we'd prefer. Seeing as it will do better at hiding fingerprints and give you a bit better grip on your Galaxy S20 Ultra. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can pick either one, and both are available for all three Galaxy S20 smartphones too. </p>
<p> Best inexpensive premium case </p>
<p> Samsung Silicon Cover </p>
<p> The Samsung Silicon Cover is a really good option for those that want a premium looking and feeling case, but don't want to spend a fortune on it. Because let's face it, that Leather case is not a cheap one. And well, this Silicon Case isn't very cheap either, but it is worth the money. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This case has a very soft touch to it, which also gives it more grip. So it's going to be much better than not having a case on your phone at all. Which is very important here, seeing as the glass on the Galaxy S20 Ultra is very slippery. </p>
<p> Samsung's Silicon Cover does a good job at protecting the entire device, including the display. And it also comes in a number of different colors. This includes blue, black, navy, pink, silver and gray. </p>
<p> Best Wallet Case </p>
<p> Samsung Wallet Cover </p>
<p> If you're looking for a case that can also replace your wallet, well Samsung has something for you there as well. This is a wallet cover that you can use to put a few cards in – maybe the cards that don't support Samsung Pay yet – and keep your phone safe. </p>
<p> By having a cover case, you are able to keep that display more protected too, which is also important for most people. It's a bit on the thicker side, unfortunately, but hey that means that your phone has more protection. And considering the Galaxy S20 Ultra is going to cost you $1400, that's not a bad thing. </p>
<p> Best Heavy Duty Case </p>
<p> Ringke Fusion X </p>
<p> The Ringke Fusion X is a great case for those that are worried about dropping the phone, and damaging it. The Ringke Fusion X has reinforced sides and corners, that will protect the Galaxy S20 Ultra if it does hit the ground. It also has a nice lip over the display that will protect it, without hindering how you use the phone. </p>
<p> This is a clear case too, so you are able to show off that you have a Galaxy S20 Ultra still, which might be important for some users. And we can't forget, that the rubber sides and corners also add some grip. Making it tougher for it to fall out of your hands. </p>
<p> Best looking case </p>
<p> Caseology Parallax </p>
<p> The Caseology Parallax is one of our favorites because of its look and feel. It's a really great looking case, with a diamond pattern on the back. Which not only looks good, but it also makes it easier to hold onto the Galaxy S20 Ultra. </p>
<p> This is a dual-layer case. So there's the soft shell that goes against your phone to protect it. And then there is a hard bumper that goes around the outside. This reinforces the sides and corners so that you won't need to worry about your Galaxy S20 Ultra incurring damage when it is dropped. And you get all of this for $14. </p>
<p> Best kickstand case </p>
<p> Spigen Tough Armor </p>
<p> Spigen is a pretty popular name when it comes to smartphone cases, and it has a number of cases available for the Galaxy S20 lineup. But our favorite for the Galaxy S20 Ultra is the Tough Armor. This is another somewhat rugged case for the Galaxy S20 Ultra, but it also has a kickstand. </p>
<p> The kickstand really comes in handy for the Galaxy S20 Ultra, since it has that amazing looking Quad HD+ display, giving you a really great entertainment experience. And with the kickstand built-in, you won't need to hold the phone the whole time. </p>
<p> It only comes in black, which is perfectly fine anyways. And it does add some nice protection, making it a really good case to grab. </p>
<p> Best Hard Case </p>
<p> Nillkin Frosted Case </p>
<p> This is a polycarbonate or a hard case from Nillkin. It does look pretty nice on the Galaxy S20 Ultra though. But with it being a hard case, it does add more protection to your smartphone. And for a lot of people, that's exactly what they want. </p>
<p> It does come in a number of different colors, including black, blue, red and many more. The black option is likely going to be the most popular. </p>
<p> with this being a polycarbonate case, you are sacrificing some grip, for some added protection. So do keep that in mind before you make your purchase. </p>
<p> Best rugged case </p>
<p> Otterbox Commuter Series </p>
<p> The Otterbox Commuter Series is the perfect case for the clumsy person, or someone that drops their phone a lot. It's a fairly thick case, that offers a ton of protection for your phone. So that when it is dropped, you don't have to worry about it breaking. </p>
<p> This is also a dual-layer case, with a soft shell going against the Galaxy S20 Ultra, and then a harder shell on the outside that can absorb the shock when the phone is dropped – by mistake of course. It does come in a few different colors, in case you don't like this mint one here. </p>

<p> The Best (and Worst) Smartphone Ads Of 2018 </p>
<p> Whether you buy this smartphone or that one doesn't always come down to the actual smartphone. At least, not completely as the companies who manage to hit the right notes with marketing can attract new customers in spite of the product being not quite as good it should be. At the very least, strong marketing messages provide the opportunity for companies to build brand awareness so that although you didn't buy their product this time, when next year's version rolls around you'll be more familiar with the brand and may even decide to pay their newest product closer attention. The opposite is just as true, as companies can sometimes be very off with their marketing messages and this can result in the opposite effect where it deters not just potential buyers, buy also existing ones as well. So finding the right balance while having a clear message is a lot harder to do than most people might think. </p>
<p> Good or bad aside, marketing messages can often tell consumers much more than just what the company is trying to say. After all, in most cases marketing messages are usually tailored towards a certain buyer or purpose. That buyer is often what's considered the current market for a product, while in some cases it might be a new type of customer the company hopes to attract. Therefore, when you take a closer look at some of the marketing materials for companies, you often not only see the message they want to portray, but also aspects that either highlight who they think their current clientele is, or who they want it to be in the future, and in some very specific cases, the problems the companies are facing at a particular time. All of this is what we're taking a closer look at by highlighting some of the promotional videos the biggest names in the smartphone business have released in 2018. In truth, the list of videos below is only a fraction of what was released by these companies this year, but they are the ones we felt best represented each company's goals and ambitions, or for better or worse – their situation in 2018. </p>
<p> Samsung – feeling the pressure </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung is unarguably the go-to smartphone-brand for Android and that means its marketing message and game needs to be strong. In 2018, however, it wasn't quite as strong as it could have been and in many ways that’s symbolic of the company this year with sales that are good, but not necessarily Samsung-worthy. One of the reasons for its lack of smartphone sales in 2018 was the stiffer competition the company faced and that proved evident in terms of marketing with Samsung opting to focus its promotional efforts more on select features and presumably as a way to highlight what makes its phones better than the rest. This year also seemed to be a far more targeted affair with Samsung actively highlighting exactly the type of consumers it is now aiming its Galaxy S and Note lines at. </p>
<p> When it comes to the Galaxy S9, much of the best marketing videos came in the form of camera-focused content. Although this in itself fed back into a wider ‘make it yours’ message the company was trying to convey. Of the camera-focused videos released by Samsung our favorite was “Jet Lag” as without explicitly saying it the video did a good job of highlighting specific camera benefits of the Galaxy S line. For example, although the message said lack of sleep and jet lag, the actual message was low-light photography. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Note9 was marketed entirely different to the Galaxy S9 line which is understandable considering Samsung probably did not want to distract target buyers of one line with the other. So instead, Samsung had to look for another angle (beyond the now-known Note9 multitasking and stylus benefits, as well as minimally infringing on the camera features promoting the Galaxy S line) and it seems the company settled on gaming. So not only was Samsung keen to highlight the gaming benefits related to the performance of the Note9, as well as the display resolution and size, but also the Fortnite exclusivity the Galaxy Note9 temporarily had. This particular marketing message subconsciously goes beyond the overt gaming message and looks to tap into the youth market in general. </p>

<p> Of course, it wouldn't be Samsung if there was also not the obligatory anti-Apple ad as well </p>
<p> https://youtu.be/3qhW1sDPHYI </p>

<p> Google Pixel – still chasing the sales </p>
<p> One of the biggest hurdles Google faces, and one of the criticisms most often leveled at the company's Pixel phone line is sales. Although the company rightly deserves much of that criticism as it continues to offer few ways for consumers to purchase its phones due to what seems to be a never-ending Verizon-favored partnership. Either way, the sales and ‘switching’ issue facing Google has not been lost on the marketing department. As in spite of Google initially launching various videos to highlight the various camera features on offer with the Pixel 3, the company recently embarked on an “Unswitchables” campaign which looks to help those who might be struggling with making the switch away from their current phone. These marketing videos are a bit much and verge on being as cheesy as the various makeover/dating shows you can find on TV any day of the week. Google's message might have been more effectively delivered if it had taken more of a humorous or parody approach to this style of ‘make the change’ marketing, instead of going down the serious route it has while focusing on those who are either too busy, too much in love, too chilled (whatever that means), or simply too anxious to try switching to the company’s Pixel 3 line. If you like drawn out, over-the-top, complete with delayed reveal moments (even though you know they are all going to switch), then these videos are for you. For everyone else, move along as there's nothing to see here. </p>
<p> HTC – last to leave please turn off the lights </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Erm, much like HTC’s smartphone ambitions in general, we are not quite sure what to make of HTC’s marketing message. It’s either largely absent at the video level or it is so next-level that we haven’t quite figured it out yer. Of course, if the former is true, then it is unlikely to be that surprising as HTC has been on somewhat of a cost-cutting exercise lately, and by the looks of it, the marketing department was at the front of that chopping block. You will find some videos if you look hard enough and they do adopt some marketing tactics, but not much to really comment on as successful marketing. In fairness, however, there's also not much (beyond the lack of trying) to really call HTC out on. The video below for example is the launch video for the HTC U12+ and while it adopts what might be best thought of as a more Modernism slant, it doesn't really say much. It just is what it is. See for yourself. </p>
<p> Sony – buy or don't buy, Sony's too cool to care </p>
<p> Sony is another interesting company as it seems to do well enough in other areas to not really care so much that’s not doing as well as it could in the smartphone market. A message that comes through quite loudly in its marketing as unlike its PlayStation ads which immerse the user in the experience, the mobile marketing message for Sony is far more muted. Pretty much all of the company’s promo videos in 2018 were basic with Sony simply saying “here’s our new phone, this is what it can do.” Surprisingly, this was even the case for the videos released in Japan where you might expect the company to do more considering its greater smartphone presence in that market. But that was not the case. Production-wise they were fine, but take that away and you are not left with much beyond the specs and features of the phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the occasions where it did try to push the boat a little, the marketing message was all wrong. For example, in the summer Sony tried to capitalize on World Cup 2018 fever with a promotional video focused on football (soccer) skills. The video itself never showed the phone and instead was designed to highlight all the footage in the video was captured using an Xperia XZ2. The only problem was, the football skills took the focus off the quality of the captured images and video. To the point where it was more of an advert for football than anything else. </p>
<p> Moto – sit back, relax, life's just a party </p>
<p> Motorola or more simply, moto has always has a fairly clear marketing message. Well, at least very clear marketing traits, as the modern version of the company likes to use color a lot (which correlates with the varied color options it offers with its smartphones), as well as also people in the collective sense. The two together are best articulated as moto ads often having a ‘party’ feel about them. This was also true in 2018 with our pick of the best moto video going to one for the moto G6 plus. With this video, the clear party element is in attendance, as is a high use of color and people. However, what sets this ad apart is the emphasis on the G6 phone being central to the party. In fact, the phone is the only element that’s alive in the video with everything else, although colorful, appearing flat and lifeless – a very good example of juxtaposition. This theme, along with the banging soundtrack really helps to draw attention to the smartphone, and by association the very selling points moto wants to get across. This is only one of a few of the same videos released by the company this year, but the one we thought got the marketing messages across the best. </p>

<p> OnePlus – saving the environment with its continued recycling efforts </p>
<p> OnePlus is often accused of recycling ideas after releasing a number of smartphones that not only draw inspiration from Apple’s iPhone line, but also devices released by OPPO during the same year. It would seem when it comes to marketing, the notion of recycling is also fairly prevalent as for the OnePlus 6 the company released a marketing video aimed at students which seemed to directly take inspiration from an almost identical video released the year before for the OnePlus 5. What’s more, with both of these videos being a year apart and both targeted specifically at students, it does highlight that OnePlus is somewhat clear on where one of its main demographics resides, and this makes sense from an outside perspective. As the OnePlus line is designed to offer a comparable experience to other flagships but at a more affordable price – so thinking of OnePlus phones as ‘student phones’ is probably fairly apt. It's just strange for the company to be so blatant about it in its advertising. </p>
<p> Recycled from 2017 </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> BlackBerry – still fighting the past </p>
<p> BlackBerry Mobile's marketing message is far clearer and fundamental compared to some of the others, and in some ironic ways represents the strength of its marketing message from yesteryear. As the BlackBerry name is so iconic that everyone already sort of knows what a BlackBerry is, does, offers. The issue with this greater brand awareness is that the same people also now know the BlackBerry of old is no longer relevant with the latest Android and iOS devices having become the go-to for many buyers. Therefore, the marketing message that was in abundance with the launch materials for the company’s 2018 KEY2 smartphone was not only that BlackBerry is still alive, but it now runs on Android. So you can still have the BlackBerry you used to love but also have access to the Android apps you now love. In short, BlackBerry Mobile smartphones are for 2018 as much as they were for 2008. </p>
<p> Huawei – marketing better than its relations with the US </p>
<p> Huawei has had a very strange year in 2018. On the one hand it has seen its route to the US market become much longer and thinner than ever before through pressures exerted on the company by US agencies. A problem that seems to have gotten all the worse since its CFO was arrested in Canada and now faces extradition to the US. On the other hand, and in spite of US sales channels drying up even more than before, the company has managed to sell a lot of phones elsewhere. Enough to propel the company to the dizzy heights of the smartphone sales hierarchy, second only to Samsung. So while it’s been somewhat of a confusing year for Huawei on paper, its marketing messages have been a lot cleaner, clearer, and at times downright inspiring. For one thing, Huawei has focused heavily on the performance areas of its phones and very clearly articulates a “higher” message for its Mate 20 line. This message not only directly comes through in its “a higher intelligence” tagline, but also in visual form with the use of height playing a central role in some of the commercials used for its phones. Representing an excellent level of consistency between the actual product, the message said, and the message seen. </p>
<p> Huawei has also played on the innovation theme, and this is in addition to, and arguably a little at odds with some of the accusations that have been leveled at the company lately, a considerably focus on the importance of being responsible. That’s not just at the maker level, but also at the user level, and this was best seen this year with its “GnuGnu” video which serves as a good reminder that there are more important things in life than the 15 minutes of fame often found on Instagram, Twitter, and the rest. Unlike some of the other marketing materials, the company's GnuGnu video wasn’t released everywhere, but it’s worth everyone seeing – here's the version that was released in Germany to promote the company's P smart+ smartphone. </p>
<p> LG – it may as well be the end of the world for LG mobile </p>
<p> When it comes to 2018 smartphone marketing and advertising, LG hands-down takes the title for our favorite video. Like many of the other companies on this list, LG has released a number of different marketing videos (almost as many as the number of phones LG has released in 2018) but where LG went above and beyond was with its LG V40 “zombie” ad. This represented the perfect blend of advertising traits by being topically on point (not only did it come out during The Walking Dead’s latest season, but during Rick’s last season), utilizing the same themes often employed by many in advertising (family, friends, love), adopting a novel way that grabs the viewer’s attention, and LG did all this while still managing to keep the main selling point (the cameras) of the device in focus. Of course, the use of You Sexy Thing by Hot Chocolate just further adds to the playful nature of the promo, making it all that more appealing. All-in-all, this is a great ad and executed to near perfection, although whether it actually helps LG to sell any phones remains to be seen. The irony of this promotional video is also worth attention, considering this is a brand whose smartphone sales have largely flatlined and has drawn on the undead to help resurrect its mobile business. Intentional or not, levels. </p>

<p> Wrap up </p>
<p> Marketing matters and whether companies mean to say what they do at times, the choice of marketing often speaks volumes about a company. On the one hand you have the likes of HTC and Sony who seem to care very little about driving home their messages while at the same time expecting you to buy their smartphones. Then you have the likes of OnePlus who is trying to sell consumers the same message(s) the company sold last year – bit like its phones in general, or Google who is trying hard not to offend anyone and include everyone when it needs to be targeting buyers. Elsewhere you have Samsung who seems to be attempting to take a higher road and not focus in on its competition other than Apple, even though Apple is no longer its main competitor. This is a big misstep by Samsung as it will find itself falling harder and quicker if it does not take a more realistic approach to its marketing by realizing it's no longer the only Android name that matters – that Apple buyers are no longer the buyers it needs to win over. Then there's Huawei, LG and Moto who while all experiencing their own and unique issues at the moment are doing the best when it comes to marketing. Which neatly highlights the need for marketing as it would seem the companies who need change are investing more thought and creativity in their marketing efforts while those who don't think they have to (Samsung and OnePlus) or don't want to (HTC and Sony) opt for mediocrity. While it remains unclear whether the increased marketing efforts will help Huawei, LG and Moto overcome their obstacles, it's clear the lack of, or reduced marketing efforts from the others won't help. With 2019 set to be a different year to previous ones due to aspects like the emergence of 5G, it will be interesting to see how these companies approach advertising and marketing over the next 12 months. </p>

<p> Top 9 Best Smart TVs – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> Now is a great time to buy a new smart TV. But there are many, many to choose from. With many of us spending a lot more time at home, this is going to be a really good investment. And right now, there are a lot of TVs that are heavily discounted. Particularly because they were announced in January and are now half-way through their life cycle of being the latest and greatest. </p>
<p> This list has the best smart TVs that are currently available in 2020. Hitting every segment of the market, including some cheaper options for those that do have a budget. </p>
<p> Top 9 Best Smart TV 2020 </p>
<p> With CES 2020 having just ended, we are in a bit of a weird place with smart TVs. We just saw a ton of new smart TVs shown off in Las Vegas earlier this month at CES, but the majority of those are not yet available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This list includes TVs from Samsung, LG, Hisense, Toshiba and others, and they are all TVs that are available to buy right now. Many of them were actually released in 2019, because of that requirement. </p>
<p> Best overall Smart TV </p>
<p> Samsung Q80R </p>
<p> The Samsung Q80R is the best smart TV you can buy right now for a few reasons. But the biggest one is the picture quality. It's going to give you the best looking picture, thanks to it being a QLED TV. That's going to give you some very bright and vivid colors, and with HDR included, it's going to look stunning. </p>
<p> This is partly thanks to the Quantum processor that is inside the Q80R, processing the picture to give you the best picture yet. Viewing angles on the Q80R are also pretty insane. Meaning that you can sit anywhere in your living room and still get a really great looking picture when watching the big game. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung uses its own Tizen operating system for its smart TVs. It doesn't quite have as many apps as Amazon Fire TV, Roku or Android TV, but all of the big name apps are available. Including Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video and much more. Samsung also has support for Apple's AirPlay 2, iTunes and even Homekit. </p>
<p> Best Android Smart TV </p>
<p> Sony A9G </p>
<p> The Sony A9G is a BRAVIA OLED TV, and it's the latest model from the company. With this being an OLED TV, you're going to get a really great picture. With the blacks actually being black, and colors are just going to be more true to life, compared to an LCD or LED TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sony also worked with a number of movie producers to fine-tune the display on the A9G, so that it delivers the best picture quality possible. With X-Reality PRO, you are getting images upscaled to 4K clarity, even if it is being streamed in 1080p or less. Sony has support for Dolby Vision as well as IMAX Enhanced, which is going to give you a total cinematic experience. </p>
<p> There is Android TV built into this TV, so you are going to have access to thousands of great Android apps. This includes Netflix, Google Play Movies & TV, Hulu, YouTube, Sling TV, Amazon Prime Video and much more. The Google Assistant is on-board and there is also support for Amazon Alexa. </p>
<p> What makes this the best Android TV available is the fact that it has the best picture quality available, and Sony also gave Android TV enough power to run smoothly in this TV. Instead of slow and buggy like it is in other TVs on the market, that have Android TV built-in. </p>
<p> Best Amazon Fire Smart TV </p>
<p> Toshiba U20 </p>
<p> There aren't many high-end Amazon Fire TV models out there right now, which made our choice for the best Smart TVs (2020) in this category pretty easy. The Toshiba U20. It only comes in a 50-inch size, which is a good size for most people, but it also keeps the price down. </p>
<p> One of the reasons why the U20 made it to this spot is because it's one of the few Fire TVs with 4K HDR, and Dolby Vision. Which is going to give you a really good looking picture. Dolby Vision takes HDR up to the next level, providing pretty accurate and true-to-life colors. When you watch Dolby Vision content on the Toshiba U20, you'll really see what we mean. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course, the Toshiba U20 is running on the Amazon Fire TV platform. Which has many of the top apps available. Including YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, AT&T TV NOW, Sling TV, and much more. There is also Amazon Alexa support included, which makes it easy to find something to watch, control your smart home products and much more. </p>
<p> Best Roku Smart TV </p>
<p> TCL 8-Series QLED </p>
<p> This is by far the best Roku TV on the market today. It's a 4K QLED TV and part of TCL's 8-series. Only available in two sizes: 65 and 75-inch, and that right there should show you that this is a very high-end TV from TCL. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's a QLED TV, which is going to provide some really impressive picture quality. QLED has a lot of the advantages that OLED also have. Including some truly blacks, and crisp colors. There is support here for HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision, which is going to make those colors more true-to-life. This QLED technology has over 1.07 billion colors. </p>
<p> Obviously, the TCL 8-Series QLED TV runs on Roku. Which is perhaps the most robust operating system for smart TVs on the market right now. It sports more apps than Android TV and Amazon Fire TV. These apps include HBO NOW, Pandora, CBS All Access, YouTube TV, Netflix, Hulu, Google Play Movies & TV, Amazon Prime Video, ESPN+, Disney+ and much more. There is also support for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. Both of which can be used to control your smart home products, find something to watch on TV, and get answers to questions like: How's the weather? </p>
<p> Best OLED TV </p>
<p> LG CX OLED </p>
<p> The LG CX OLED is arguably one of the best smart TVs on the market right now, and definitely the best OLED TV. It is also cheaper than its predecessor was. Largely because it is now offered a smaller 48-inch size. As well as the usual 55 and 65-inch models. </p>
<p> This TV performs really well in both dark and light situations. And thanks to it being OLED, the blacks look really black (and not gray, like they would on an LCD). The colors are generally more vibrant here. </p>
<p> Dolby Vision IQ and Dolby Atmos are also include on the LG CX OLED, making the sound and display experience even better on this TV. This is a smart TV and runs webOS. Which has support for most of your favorite apps. Like Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV, Hulu and much more. </p>
<p> Best QLED TV </p>
<p> VIZIO P-Series Quantum X </p>
<p> The VIZIO P-Series Quantum X is the best QLED TV you can buy, because it offers a stunning picture, at a decent price. And somehow, VIZIO was able to calibrate this display even better than Samsung was able to, which is impressive. VIZIO claims that this is their most colorful TV yet, and that's not hard to believe. Just look at it. The colors are simply amazing. And since it is a QLED TV, you're going to get some deep blacks here, thanks to there being over 384 dimming zones included here. </p>
<p> Not only is the color on this TV incredible, it's also super bright. This means that if you're watching a dark TV show or movie, and you're in a room with some sunlight, you're still going to be able to see the TV, and not worry about it being tough to see. It will also upscale 720p and 1080p content to 4K. Which looks pretty impressive, to be honest. </p>
<p> VIZIO has its SmartCast 3.0 platform running on this TV. Which is going to offer up the ability to Cast your favorite content from your smartphone or laptop, to the TV. It also has support for Apple's AirPlay 2, for doing much the same as you can do with Cast. With VIZIO's WatchFree service, you also get free and unlimited TV, eliminating the need for using an OTA antenna. This all makes the VIZIO P-Series Quantum X one of the best Smart TVs available in 2020. </p>
<p> Best Value TV </p>
<p> Hisense H9F Series </p>
<p> The Hisense H9F Series is a really good entry for the Best Smart TVs of 2020, as it's an inexpensive Android TV that is actually really good. So it uses its own proprietary ULED technology, and you'll notice it's the only one on this list that uses ULED. But it works similarly to QLED and OLED. Where you're getting a brighter picture, with better colors, but it doesn't have the disadvantage of OLED and screen burn-in. </p>
<p> Hisense also uses artificial intelligence to improve the picture quality coming out of this TV. So it is also going to improve over time. There is also support for Dolby Vision and HDR10. This is going to improve ULED even more, giving you a picture with more dynamic range. You will really notice the difference if you watch a TV show or movie that is shot in Dolby Vision – Amazon Prime Video and Netflix have quite a few that are. </p>
<p> The H9F Series is also an Android TV model, which means that it does have support for Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa built-in. This is going to allow you to control your smart TV, find something to watch and ask other questions too. This is a feature that is also found on a few other this Best Smart TVs 2020 list too. Android TV also has thousands of apps like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV and much more. </p>
<p> Best TV For Gaming </p>
<p> Samsung RU8000 </p>
<p> The Samsung RU8000 Series is great for those that are looking to get some gaming done as well, thanks to the Real Game Enhancer. This feature is going to help prevent tearing and stuttering, giving you smooth, lifelike visuals along with cinematic sound. It's going to be better for console gaming – great for the new PlayStation 5 and the new Xbox when they release later this year – more than it would be for PC Gaming. Though, it does support FreeSync for PC Gamers, just not on the 49-inch and smaller TVs. So if you want FreeSync, you're going to need a larger model, like the 55-inch version. </p>
<p> Samsung also has Dynamic Crystal Color on the RU8000. This is going to use even more colors than normal, offering a really incredible looking picture on this TV. Giving you a brighter and more lifelike experience that a regular TV wouldn't be able to offer you. HDR standards like HDR10 and HLG are supported, though no Dolby Vision unfortunately. </p>
<p> As far as smart assistants go, Samsung does have Bixby included here. And since it's available on its appliances and its smartphones, you'll be able to control it all from your TV. That includes seeing your text messages and incoming calls on the TV. </p>
<p> Best 8K Smart TV </p>
<p> Samsung Q900R 8K QLED TV </p>
<p> This is the "early adopter TV". As 8K content is still not really available, but Samsung (as well as LG) are making 8K TVs that you can actually buy right now. The Samsung Q900R does come in plenty of sizes, from 55 inches all the way up to 98 inches. And the smallest one is actually about the same price as some OLED TVs that are in 4K still. So that's somewhat impressive for Samsung. </p>
<p> This is a QLED 8K TV, so you are going to get those deep blacks and true-to-life colors that you'd expect from a QLED TV. But now, in 8K. </p>
<p> So with this being an 8K TV, upscaling is a big deal. This has 16X the resolution of full HD, and with the Quantum Processor 8K, it does a really good job at upscaling images and video for this 8K resolution. This is because Samsung uses artificial intelligence, and if you put a 1080p video on this TV and let it upscale it, you may not even realize that it's not an 8K video. </p>
<p> Like other Samsung TVs on this list, the Samsung Q900R also runs on Tizen. Which means that you aren't going to get all of the same apps as you would on an Amazon Fire TV, Android TV or Roku TV. But the majority of them are here. That includes Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and more. So there is still plenty of content to watch. </p>

This app will essentially make sure that the vast majority of important info that you have on your phone doesn't get lost along the way. You can even schedule automatic backups so that you don't have to think about it. </p>
<p> The 'Boost Phone' option is also included in the app, and that is something you'd usually find in a cache cleaner app. The UI of this application is extremely simplistic, and we don't really have an objection to that. All focus is on the backup / restore options that the app provides, as it should be. </p>

<p> The Best Sonos Deals & Sales – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> Sonos is hands down the best option for multi-room audio streaming, but setting up a Sonos multi-room system can be pretty expensive. That is, unless you take advantage of some of these best Sonos deals. </p>
<p> Sonos speakers do routinely go on sale, so it's not hard to grab a nice discount on one of these speakers. But the sales don't last long, as most people jump on them to add more speakers to their home setup. So you've gotta be quick. </p>
<p> We have rounded up the best Sonos deals that are currently available, and will continue to update this post as new deals arise. </p>
<p> The best Sonos deals of October 2020 </p>
<p> In the table above, you'll find the prices for all of Sonos' products. Including their all-time lowest prices, to help you decide whether now is the right time to buy that particular speaker. Here, you'll find the best deals among all of Sonos' products, as of September. </p>
<p> A refurbished Sonos PLAYBAR will cost you just $499 at Best Buy right now. The regular price for a brand new PLAYBAR is around $799. So definitely a good price here. And Sonos speakers aren't generally on sale, even as refurbished units. </p>
<p> Instead of buying just one Sonos One, you can get two. The two-room set is on sale for $379. That's a savings of $19 off of its regular price. And allows you to get started in setting up a multi-room system with Sonos' speakers. </p>
<p> Similar to the Sonos One two-room set above, the Sonos Five two-room set is also discounted. It's now $949, for a savings of $49 off of the set. Considering the Sonos Five was announced just a couple months ago, this is a really good deal – and the cheapest price the Sonos Five has ever been. </p>
<p> What is Sonos? </p>
<p> Sonos is the maker of speakers and home theater speakers. It's renowned for its quality speakers with high-tech capabilities. Sonos really became popular for its PLAY:1, PLAY:3 and PLAY:5 speakers, but it has many more products than that these days. </p>
<p> Sonos has standalone speakers, Bluetooth speakers, smart speakers and even some sound bars. These can all be used to create a rather epic surround sound system in your home. Sonos uses its proprietary software to offer multi-room audio, without relying on Bluetooth. Which allows Sonos speakers to stay in sync, without one or two being behind, and showing a noticeable lag. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is possible by using WiFi over Bluetooth. WiFi has more bandwidth, and allows Sonos to not only keep its speakers in sync, but produce better sounding audio. As music isn't compressed to play over these speakers, like they would be if they used Bluetooth. So when people say that the sound on Sonos speakers sounds so good, that's part of the reason as to why. </p>
<p> The company has one sound bar that has Dolby Atmos support, which is the new Sonos Arc. While the Sonos One, Beam and Arc all have Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant support. Making them the best smart speakers on the market. However for those that use iOS devices, they also support AirPlay. In other words, it's great for everyone, no matter what mobile platform you use. </p>

<p> Top 9 Best Stadia Accessories – July 2020 Summary </p>
<p> Below you'll find a short summary on the list of top 9 best Stadia accessories we've picked for July of 2020. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's an accessory or two that fits each device you can play Stadia games on. So everyone should be able to find something. The summary includes the cost of each accessory, and where to buy if you're short on time. </p>
<p> Below the summary you'll find a slightly longer description of each item along with the where to buy links. </p>
<p> Top 9 Best Stadia Accessories – July 2020 List </p>
<p> If you want to know a little bit more about each accessory and why you'd want it for your Stadia experience, check out the list below. </p>
<p> Stadia Controller </p>
<p> We'll kick things off with the Stadia controller because it's one of the more versatile accessories on here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It works when you play on your TV with the Chromecast Ultra, it works with the PC, and it works with your phone. And, better still, it now works wirelessly with all three as Google just added wireless support for Android phones on June 30. </p>
<p> As controllers go, it's a pretty standard setup and it comes with all the buttons you'd want a normal controller to have. It has a good weight to it and it's built well. </p>
<p> All in all, it's a great controller for your Stadia gaming needs. It might seem a bit pricey, but in contrast to some of the other options out there it's actually not too bad when it comes to cost. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Astro A50 Wireless Headphones </p>
<p> Astro makes a high-quality headset and it tends to come with a high quality price. But, high prices are the price you pay when you want one of the best accessories you can get for gaming, even when it's gaming on Stadia. </p>
<p> The Astro A50 Wireless will work with Stadia on both PC, and when you're playing through the Chromecast. Thanks to the receiver that plugs into the TV or the PC that the headphones connect to. </p>
<p> You're also getting some top-tier audio out of these headphones, plus, they're wireless which is really the best part, and they feature a mic so you can use the in-game voice chat. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As an added bonus, these work for PS4 too. So if you have one and want to game on it for a while, you can. </p>
<p> The base station receiver also works as a stand for the headphones when they're not in use. So you can put them on display in a nice clean setup. You could use any pair of wireless headphones that would connect to the TV or the PC. But these are designed specifically for gaming and feature less latency, which is what you'll want when playing games. </p>
<p> Glorious Modular Mechanical Gaming Keyboard </p>
<p> If you're playing games on PC, even through Stadia, then you want a good gaming keyboard for the games that will benefit from playing with keyboard and mouse over a controller. </p>
<p> The Modular Mechanical Gaming Keyboard from Glorious is a fantastic option in this category. The best thing about the GMMK is its customization. </p>
<p> You can swap out the switches under the keycaps with relative ease. So much in fact that it's the easiest I've ever personally seen it. It also comes in three different sizes with the full, tenkeyless, and compact options. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It has a very minimalist design so it's not too garish, though it does have RGB lighting for the keys so there is some brightness to it. Aside from the lights though the design is very simple. Which is excellent. </p>
<p> This is a wired keyboard, so while you don't get the freedom of a wireless option, you're less likely to have any interference or disconnection issues with it being plugged in all the time. </p>
<p> Also, the switches are hot swappable so not only can you pop them out without having to solder anything, you can swap them while the keyboard is on and in use. You can even mix and match the switches so you have certain ones under certain key caps for the perfect feel. </p>
<p> Razer Kishi Mobile Controller </p>
<p> Razer's Kishi is one of the best accessories for Stadia because technically it was built for Stadia. </p>
<p> Really it was built for all cloud gaming options. Since Stadia is one of these though it is a wonderful controller to use when playing Stadia games on your phone. You can see our full thoughts on it here in our review. </p>
<p> Don't get us wrong. The Stadia controller works perfectly fine for playing Stadia games on the phone. Especially with the CLAW attachment and now that the controller supports wireless play for Android devices. </p>
<p> The thing is, even then the controller feels a little top heavy. The Kishi eliminates that problem because the phone sits in between the two sides of the controller. It's also technically a wired setup because the Kishi does plug into your phone's USB-C port, which translates to a nearly latency-free gaming experience. </p>
<p> It does have one downside. It can only be used with phones that have the USB-C port in the middle. If it's off to the side like on the ROG Phone II, it won't work. </p>
<p> Other than that, this is a great controller with every button you need for Stadia. Plus, it features pass-through charging so you can charge the phone while playing. When you're all done playing, collapse it down to its unused state and it's nice and compact. </p>
<p> Razer Raiju Mobile Controller </p>
<p> Keeping things on the Razer train for a moment here (and why not because it makes some excellent gaming accessories), the Raiju Mobile is a fantastic controller for Stadia too. </p>
<p> It even comes with its own built-in claw attachment that flips up to hold your phone during use. </p>
<p> The Raiju Mobile is Bluetooth, so it connects to your phone wirelessly, and it's a full-size controller. While not as compact as the Kishi for storage, the full-size build is likely going to be a tad more comfortable to hold while playing games. </p>
<p> You can adjust the phone mount for different viewing angles, and Razer designed it with a "hair trigger mode" which it says can give you a competitive edge. </p>
<p> For the most part this is very similar in shape and size to an Xbox One controller. If that's your preferred console controller, then you'll love this for Stadia when playing on your phone. </p>
<p> Power Support CLAW Attachment for Stadia Controller </p>
<p> If you have the Stadia controller and you plan to play on your phone ever, you want this attachment. </p>
<p> It grabs onto your controller with a nice, snug fit and holds your phone in place so it's closer to your face while playing. It also has rubber grips so it doesn't move around too much while on the controller. In fact it really doesn't move at all unless you force it to. </p>
<p> It's a simple accessory, but a must-have if you play Stadia on your Android device with the Stadia controller. </p>
<p> Xbox Elite Series 2 Wireless Controller </p>
<p> If you take your gaming extremely seriously and you want something that will let you customize the feel of your controller and give you a competitive edge, this is probably it. </p>
<p> The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller from Microsoft is considered by many as the pinnacle of controllers. It has tons of little configurations you can adjust for the perfect feel and fit in your hands. </p>
<p> Since it's an Xbox wireless controller it also works with PC, and Android phones. Which means you can use it for Stadia games in the Chrome browser and in the Stadia app. </p>
<p> This is a bit much for a controller if you're not going to game a whole lot. But, if you play games often and you want something top-tier, you can't go wrong with the Elite Series 2. </p>
<p> Especially considering you can use it for Stadia games, Xbox games, and PC games. </p>
<p> Razer Hammerhead True Wireless Earbuds </p>
<p> Playing Stadia games on your phone is best with headphones. At least if you want to fully immerse yourself in the game. </p>
<p> And if you plan to do that, you want something that isn't going to have audio lag. The Razer Hammerhead True Wireless Earbuds have provided that experience better than anything else I've used. They don't have the best battery life if you want long gaming sessions. But they are super compact, easy to use, and you can keep them safe in the portable charging case that they come in. </p>
<p> You can also just use them for music if you want. Many phones these days don't offer wired headset ports. Which means you need a wireless option unless you want to use a dongle attachment. Forget all of that. Wireless earbuds and headphones are a better solution. Especially when they're this good. </p>
<p> Razer Viper Ultimate Gaming Mouse </p>
<p> You can't have a proper PC gaming setup, or a proper Stadia on PC gaming setup without a good gaming mouse. We chose the Glorious Modular Mechanical Gaming Keyboard for the keyboard, and the Razer Viper Ultimate is our selection for the mouse counterpart. </p>
<p> The Viper Ultimate is great because it's wireless so there are less cords sitting around while you game. Razer says it's a "no compromise" wireless gaming mouse option. </p>
<p> What that means for you is that you shouldn't have issues with disconnection, and you'll get a fast mouse with a good sensor among many other things. Razer designed this for Esports, so it will work for you just fine. It's ambidextrous as well, and whether you're right handed or left handed, this mouse does the job. </p>
<p> It comes with eight programmable buttons, and it's pretty lightweight so it should move around the mouse pad pretty easily. If you prefer your Stadia games with a keyboard and mouse combo, this is an excellent mouse pick. </p>

Whether it's an Android TV device, Amazon Fire TV, Roku or something else. We've used all of these devices in our own home, and know why they are good, or why they aren't so good. </p>
<p> With many of us staying at home due to the Coronavirus or COVID-19, streaming devices are super important. To help keep us sane. These devices all support mostly the same core of apps. Like Disney+, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube TV, Sling TV and STARZ. Which is going to give you plenty of content to watch during this time of uncertainty where we have to stay home with our kids during this pandemic. </p>

<p> Best Streaming Device overall </p>
<p> Roku Premiere </p>
<p> The Roku Premiere is at the top of our best streaming devices list for one big reason – it supports everything. This includes Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Chromecast, 4K, HDR and much more. So it really does just about everything that you'd need it to do. And you can choose which personal assistant you want to use, which is convenient. </p>
<p> It can stream in 4K HDR quality, giving you a really good looking picture on your TV. Of course, to really take full advantage of this, you'll need a TV that supports both 4K and HDR. </p>
<p> Now, as far as apps go, Roku supports a number of the big names like Hulu, Netflix, STARZ, ABC News Live, YouTube TV, Sling TV, Disney+, ESPN+ and much more. Roku does usually give out credits to different apps and services. This changes based on when you buy it, so it could be a free month of Starz, some credit towards Sling TV, or something else. </p>
<p> Best streaming device to keep it simple </p>
<p> Google Chromecast Ultra </p>
<p> If you want something simple, then you can't go wrong with the Chromecast Ultra. This one also supports 4K and HDR, and allows you to Cast just about anything from your smartphone to the TV. Most apps support Chromecast these days, so there's no need to wonder if it supports your favorite apps. </p>

<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On top of that, the Chromecast Ultra also supports Stadia. So you can play Stadia games right there on your TV. </p>
<p> Best Amazon Fire TV Device </p>
<p> Amazon Fire TV Cube </p>
<p> The Amazon Fire TV Cube is a really impressive streaming device, to be honest. It is essentially a Fire TV and an Echo built-in one. You see the Fire TV Cube actually has always-listening Alexa. This means that Alexa can completely control your TV. This includes being able to turn it on and off. As well as adjusting the volume, finding something to watch and so forth. </p>

<p> Best Android TV streaming device </p>
<p> Xiaomi Mi TV Stick </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Mi TV Stick is the best Android TV streaming device on the market right now. Though there aren't many competitors to choose from. It doesn't do 4K though, so if you want 4K, check out the NVIDIA SHIELD TV listed below. </p>
<p> This stick from Xiaomi does the absolute bare minimum for Android TV, and that's not a bad thing. It's keeping things simple. As mentioned, it does 1080p only, it has a gigabyte of RAM and 8GB of storage as well. Which should keep it decently speedy. </p>
<p> With Android TV running on the Xiaomi Mi TV Stick, you're going to be able to watch all of your favorite movies and TV shows here. From apps like YouTube, Sling TV, Fubo TV, Disney+, Hulu, Netflix and much more. </p>
<p> Best streaming device for gamers </p>
<p> NVIDIA SHIELD TV Pro </p>
<p> The NVIDIA SHIELD TV Pro is the best streaming device for gamers, because it is also a gaming console and works with GeForce Now. So you can play your favorite PC games on the big screen. </p>
<p> This runs on Android TV, as you might have expected, and that allows it to run a bunch of great apps. Like Fubo TV, Netflix, YouTube TV, Hulu, Disney+, HBO MAX and much more. There are hundreds of thousands of games available on the NVIDIA SHIELD TV Pro. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course, with it running on Android TV, you also get the Google Assistant here. So you can control your smart home products from your TV, find something to watch and much more. </p>
<p> Best Roku streaming device </p>
<p> Roku Ultra </p>
<p> The Roku Ultra is the best Roku streaming devices without being the overall best. It offers some really cool features, but it's more of a set-top box, instead of a streaming stick. It does do 4K HDR, and even HDR10. Giving you some really great looking content on your 4K HDR TV. </p>
<p> It does also include a number of great apps, like Hulu, SHOWTIME ANYWHERE, STARZ, Philo, ESPN+, Disney+, Netflix, YouTube TV and much more. There are over half a million TV shows and movies available on the Roku platform. There's also the Roku Channel, that allows you to watch all sorts of movies and TV shows which are ad-supported. </p>
<p> There is also support for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. So you can use whichever one you want with the Roku Ultra. On top of that, it also has Google Cast, allowing you to Cast your favorite content to your TV with ease. Which is a really popular feature. </p>
<p> Best budget Amazon Fire TV device </p>
<p> Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite </p>
<p> The Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite is not only the cheapest Fire TV device on this list, but the cheapest streamer period. It comes in at just $29.99 and does all of the basics. So don't expect anything crazy from this one, like 4K HDR. </p>
<p> But it does support 1080p HDR, with support for HDR, HDR 10, HDR10+, HLG. It also has Dolby Audio via HDMI pass-through. It's a good streamer to use in a pinch, especially if you're looking for something that can get the job done without spending a fortune. </p>

<p> NFL Ticketholder is not the best-optimized app in the Play Store, that's for sure. This app is currently holding a 3.4-star rating in the Play Store, as many people are having issues with it.

<p> Top 9 Best TikTok App Alternatives For Android – 2020 </p>
<p> As most of you know by now, TikTok has been in hot waters with the US government as of late. At this point in time, the app is still available in the Google Play Store and App Store, but it may go away in the near future, if things don't get resolved. This is actually quite a long story, but the point is, you should be ready if the app ends up being removed, or in case you'd like to try out something new. </p>
<p> For that reason, we've put together a list of our favorite TikTok alternatives that are available in the Play Store. Full disclosure, one of them is not in the Play Store, but we'll talk more about that later on. In any case, there are 9 TikTok app alternatives listed below. You'll find all sorts of different apps included here, as each of them has something special to offer. </p>
<p> These apps are not listed in a specific order, or anything like that. Each of them is good in its own way. Some of them you've heard of, for sure, while others are not that popular. Still, that doesn't mean they're not worth looking into. Check out the list if you're interested, you'll find quite a bit of information down below. </p>

<p> Top 9 Best TikTok App Alternatives For Android 2020 Downloads </p>
<p> Below is a little more information on each app, a suggestion for the type of user the app is best suited to, and a direct link for easy downloading. </p>
<p> All download links go to the app's Google Play Store listing. Users are always recommended to download apps from Google Play or an authorized app store. </p>

<p> Best TikTok Android App Alternative For Most Users </p>
<p> Instagram Reels </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Instagram Reels is probably the best TikTok Android app alternative for most of you. This is actually a feature within the Instagram app, not a separate application… and that's a good thing. Instagram already has a gigantic user base, and that gives you a lot of audience if you want to create short video clips. It also gives you plenty of content to look at, as many people are sharing content over Instagram Reels. </p>
<p> This feature allows you to create 15-second clips, and you can adjust the audio speed if you want. You can also add music to your short clips, and all that in combination allows you to create some very creative content. Instagram has been the most popular image-sharing platform for quite some time now, and it's doing quite well in the short video department as well. </p>
<p> Best upcoming TikTok Android app alternative </p>
<p> YouTube (Shorts) </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Why do we say "upcoming"? Well, YouTube Shorts are brand new, and they're only available in India, at the moment. In fact, this app is still in beta, so it's not even stable yet… so… it's more upcoming than current. In any case, Google is also trying to offer its alternative to TikTok by using its most popular video sharing platform, YouTube. Well, it's using the YouTube name more than anything else. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> YouTube Shorts allow you to create short 15-second videos, just like Instagram Reels. YouTube Shorts allow you to string multiple videos together, to create a single video of up to 15 seconds. You can also put some music on top of your videos, while you can also control the speed of the video as well, the same as with Instagram Reels. There is also a tool that allows you to add a timer and countdown, if you'd like to record hands-free. Unfortunately, an APK for this app is still not available. </p>
<p> Alternatively to YouTube Shorts, you can always use YouTube as your platform for short-video content. People upload longer type videos on YouTube, usually, but the app does not limit you in that way. You can upload short-form clips if you want, and even earn cash via the app at some point. </p>
<p> Best TikTok Android app for lip-syncing </p>
<p> Dumbsmash </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 5.0+ </p>
<p> If you like selecting audio content, and then recording video on top of it, to match that audio, this is the app for you. Dumbsmash's main appeal is the lip-syncing part, that's for sure. This app has been around for quite some time, and yet it never became as popular as TikTok. Well, maybe now's the time for Dumbsmash, it'll hardly get a better chance than this. Lip-syncing is its main appeal, but not the only feature it offers. </p>
<p> The app's design is really nice, and the app allows you to make use of stickers, filters, text, and various effects. You can create some truly unique videos using this application. Once you post a video, you can get likes, and comments, like with TikTok as well. This app may not be as well-known as TikTok, but it is somewhat popular as it is. It has over 100 million downloads, and it did start to grow quite a bit since TikTok's issues began. </p>
<p> Best TikTok Android alternative in form of a reborn Vine app </p>
<p> byte </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 5.1+ </p>
<p> byte is… well, a reborn Vine. You know, the original platform for creating short-form videos. Vine has been quite popular for a while, and then it went away. Well, byte brings it back, in a way. The app does feature some of former Vine stars, such as Lance Stewart, for example. This application allows you to record and upload 16-second videos. Well, they can be shorter, but 16 seconds is the very maximum you'll get. </p>
<p> This makes it more similar to Dumbsmash and some other platforms than TikTok, in a way, as TikTok allows you to upload videos of up to 1 minute. The vast majority of TikTok videos are much shorter than that, though, so… there you have it. Do note that byte seems to have some issues with app stability, at least based on more recent comments in the Play Store, so its rating is not that high up. </p>
<p> Best TikTok Android app alternative with YouTube-like appeal </p>
<p> Likee </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: 4.1+ </p>
<p> Likee is actually quite a popular application. This app has over half a billion downloads in the Play Store, and people actually seem to love using it. You can think of this app as a hybrid between TikTok and services like YouTube. This app does not limit you to short video clips only, not at all. If you'd like to go live, and stream for a longer period of time, Likee won't prevent you from doing that. </p>
<p> In fact, the company behind this app encourages any video length, it's up to you. The app also offers some additional tools to make your videos fun. A good example is a hair color changer, which can change your hair color for the duration of the video. The app also allows you to swap your face with celebrities, while various cool special effects are available. Such as Face Cut, Face Morph, Astral Travel, and so on. </p>
<p> Best TikTok Android app alternative for short-form videos </p>
<p> Triller </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Triller is one of the newer direct TikTok alternatives based in the US. This app is not exactly brand new, but it hasn't exactly been around for long. It is based in Los Angeles, and it managed to rack up quite a few downloads already. The app has been downloaded over 100 million times, for Android alone. Do note that the app does have some issues, though, which is why its rating in the Play Store is not the best. </p>
<p> This app also aims to provide you a platform for short-form videos. Various celebrities have already used the app, including Justin Bieber, Rita Ora, Kevin Hart, and so on. There are over 100 filters for you to use in this app, and you can access the top trending tracks or use your own music for your videos. The UI is trying to stay out of the way as much as possible here, as the focus is on creation. There's plenty of content to go through in this app. </p>
<p> Best TikTok Android app alternative for various video content </p>
<p> Facebook </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Facebook may not be the first app you think of when thinking of TikTok alternatives, but it sure is one of those. Facebook videos are extremely popular, and are getting tons of hits. The company's video platform is gigantic, and even though it's not limited to short-form videos, nobody is preventing you from creating such videos. There is a whole dedicated section for video content in the Facebook app. </p>
<p> You can easily manage your content via that section, or you can browse for content to watch, it's up to you. Once Facebook learns what you like, you'll be getting more quality content without even looking for it. This platform also allows you to do longer stuff, if you want. You can even stream some content if that's what you're into, it's not a problem. </p>
<p> Best TikTok Android app alternative for high-quality video content </p>
<p> Firework </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: 5.0+ </p>
<p> Firework is somewhat similar to TikTok. This app puts more focus on creating high-quality video content than it does on getting tons of followers. The app has all the regular video-editing tools that you may need. Tools such as crop, trim, and so on. You can even add music on top of your videos if you want. The best of all, it's possible to compete for cash prizes via this app. </p>
<p> If you are a creator, and you do create quality content, you'll get a chance, for sure. The app will also offer you curated content. That content will be based on your interests, and the type of content you've been checking out on the app. The app's UI is also nicely done, and even though this app is not as popular as some others we've mentioned, it's definitely worth a look. </p>
<p> Best TikTok Android app alternative for disappearing videos </p>
<p> Snapchat </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: 4.4+ </p>
<p> Snapchat has been utilizing the short-form video formula for a long time. The main difference between this app and most others out there, is that Snapchat videos disappear after a short period of time. Snapchat managed to become extremely popular due to such format, even before TikTok did. So, if you don't mind sending disappearing videos, and plan on checking out the app's content often, Snapchat sure is a great option. </p>
<p> The app had its issues in the past, but it's much better now. The company fine-tuned it, and its UI as well. The app is packed with various stickers and effects that you can use, and they're amongst the best in the business. You can chat with your friends via this app as well, and that goes for video chat as well. You'll also get a curated feed of content on your device constantly, the more you use the app, the better that feed will be, as it will be curated to your preferences. </p>

<p> Top 7 Best Truly Wireless Earbuds – September 2020 </p>
<p> Finding the best truly wireless earbuds can be pretty tricky, especially since there are so many out there. With many of them being clear knockoffs of the Apple AirPods. </p>
<p> When it comes to truly wireless headphones, a lot of them are very similar, though some brands do have some new features that make them stand out. Particularly from Google, Sony and Jabra. So we're going to detail the very best truly wireless headphones that are available. </p>
<p> Top 7 Best Truly Wireless Earbuds – June 2020 </p>
<p> Some of the truly wireless earbuds in this list are noise cancelling, but the majority are not. To get noise cancellation, you normally need a full-on pair of headphones, and not just earbuds. But these do also offer up some really good audio quality – depending on the pair. As well as some decent audio quality. Those are two of the pillars that we used to determine which pair of truly wireless earbuds were the best. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These range in price from around $20 up to over $200. So you can really spend a fortune on truly wireless earbuds, depending on which features you really want/need. </p>
<p> Best truly wireless earbuds </p>
<p> Sony WF-1000XM3 </p>
<p> The Sony WF-1000XM3 are the best truly wireless earbuds you can buy today, for a number of reasons. Firstly, because of its price. There are plenty of truly wireless earbuds at this price point, but none that offer the same sound quality, and features. </p>
<p> Sony WF-1000XM3 offer up noise cancellation, which is one of the few models on this list with that. Sony also includes Ambient Sound on the WF-1000XM3, allowing you to let in some background sound. Which is great if you are wearing these and walking down the street. So you can hear cars coming. </p>
<p> Battery life is also pretty decent here, we're looking at six hours of playback on a single charge. With the included carrying case, you'll get around 24 hours of playback. </p>
<p> Best Google Assistant-enabled earbuds </p>
<p> Google Pixel Buds </p>
<p> If you're looking for the best pair of truly wireless earbuds with the Google Assistant built-in, the Pixel Buds are the best choice. </p>
<p> The Pixel Buds are made by Google, so of course the Assistant works really well here. You can tap on the earbud to access the Assistant. Have it read your notifications, answer your questions and so much more. Pixel Buds also have on-ear detection, so once you take them out of your ears, the audio will stop playing which is nice. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Audio quality on the Pixel Buds are actually pretty good. Not quite as good as the Sony WF-1000XM3 though, but similar. Battery life is also similar, around six hours of continuous playback. Which is pretty decent for a pair of truly wireless earbuds. </p>
<p> Best battery life truly wireless earbuds </p>
<p> Jabra Elite 75t </p>
<p> Battery life isn't really a strong suit for truly wireless earbuds, and that's because they have to pack so much into such a tiny package. Usually battery life is sacrificed for sound quality. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But with the Jabra Elite 75t, the battery life is still pretty good. We're looking at 7.5 hours of playback on a single charge. That tops all of the others on this list. Which is rather impressive. </p>
<p> On top of that, the audio quality here is still really good. We're looking at some strong bass, as well as some crystal clear mids and highs. And you can adjust the sound through the Jabra Sound+ app that is available on both iOS and Android. That's a really great feature to have, to be honest. </p>
<p> Best for Samsung users </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Buds Live </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live are the best pair of truly wireless earbuds that Samsung currently offers. They do look a bit like beans, but that's okay. </p>
<p> The different shape of the Galaxy Buds Live allows them to fit in your ears a bit better, so they aren't falling out. They also offer up active noise cancellation, of course it's not the best, due to the open-backed design of the Galaxy Buds Live. But they do sound really good. </p>
<p> Galaxy Buds Live come in three colors: Mystic Black, Mystic Bronze and Mystic White. </p>
<p> Best Value Truly Wireless Headphones </p>
<p> Anker Soundcore Life P2 </p>
<p> The Anker Soundcore Life P2 may look like a knock-off of the Apple Airpods, but they are better than that. These offer up some really great sounding audio, especially for their price. There's also noise reduction here, for some better noise cancellation. Though it's not true noise cancellation. </p>
<p> The battery life on these is pretty impressive too actually. We're talking about seven hours of continuous playback. And you can still get 40 hours of playback with the included carrying case. That's going to be good for a week's worth of work! </p>
<p> Best audiophile sound </p>
<p> Master & Dynamic MW07 Plus </p>
<p> The Master & Dynamic MW07 Plus are going to be the best truly wireless earbuds for audiophiles. Master & Dynamic are pretty well-known for audiophile quality audio anyways. So this isn't a big surprise. </p>
<p> The Master & Dynamic MW07 Plus are not super great looking, like some of the others that are on this list. They are also much larger, and part of that is due to the better audio quality that these have. </p>
<p> Surprisingly, these also offer some pretty decent battery life. We're looking at 10 hours on a single charge. But the larger earbuds is likely why they are much better in terms of battery life. The included carrying case offers three more charges for a total of 40 hours. </p>
<p> Best Sub-$100 Truly Wireless Earbuds </p>
<p> Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 </p>
<p> The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 are probably the best sub-$100 truly wireless earbuds that you can buy. And yes, they do look a lot like an AirPods clone. But that doesn't make these a bad pair of headphones. </p>
<p> These earbuds are lightweight and do also offer some decent battery life. The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 offer up around seven hours of continuous playback. With the included carrying case, we're looking at around 28 hours of total listening time. So that's about three full recharges. Which isn't bad for such a small carrying case. </p>
<p> Audio quality, however, is not that great on the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2. Typically with Anker headphones, the bass is pretty weak. So expect that on these as well. But if you're okay with that, then these are a really great pair to pick up. </p>

<p> Top 9 Best Uber & Lyft App Alternatives For Android – 2020 </p>
<p> Many people would say that Uber and Lyft are the best request-a-ride services. They certainly are the most popular ones, globally. That being said, there are a ton of alternatives out there. Some of those alternatives are available in some regions only, others are also global, like Uber and Lyft. </p>
<p> Down below, you'll see a list of our favorite alternatives to Uber and Lyft. In that list, you'll find all sorts of request-a-ride applications. Some of them are focusing on carpool services, others are direct replacements for Uber and Lyft. We tried to avoid listing services that are not available in the US, though you may find one or two down there. Ola, in particular, was too significant not to mention, for example. </p>
<p> Many of these apps and services are quite great, actually. Some of them offer more affordable fares than Uber and Lyft, and don't have any major drawbacks. Just because something is popular doesn't mean there aren't equally good alternatives out there, or even better ones. That being said, check out the list down below if you're interested. </p>

<p> Top 9 best Uber & Lyft app alternatives for Android 2020 downloads </p>
<p> Below is a little more information on each app, a suggestion for the type of user the app is best suited to, and a direct link for easy downloading. </p>
<p> All download links go to the app's Google Play Store listing. Users are always recommended to download apps from Google Play or an authorized app store. </p>

<p> Best Uber & Lyft Android app alternative for carpooling </p>
<p> BlaBlaCar </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 4.4+ </p>
<p> BlaBlaCar is one of the most popular services for carpooling in the world, though it's not available in the US. This app has a really high rating in the Play Store, and for a good reason. The app works great. I've personally used it on a number of occasions, and never had any issues with it. That actually goes for people I shared a car with as well. </p>
<p> How does it work? Well, you can use this app from a driver's or from a passenger's perspective. If you're going somewhere, you can find people to keep you company on the way, and also help cover the gas bill. The same goes for if you're a passenger, you can find someone who is going in your direction, avoid using a bus / train, and save money that way. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All you have to do if you're searching for a drive is type in where you're going, and that's it. The app will show you drivers that are going in the same direction, their rating, and so on. You get quite a bit of info on drivers, so that you can pick the best one for you. If you're a driver, you'll need to keep a good rating in the app in order to attract other people. The app is free to use, by the way. </p>
<p> Best Uber & Lyft Android app alternative for most people </p>
<p> Bolt </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Bolt is more of a direct replacement for Uber and Lyft, and it's actually quite great. The app works great, and the whole system that's in place works really well. The app is immensely easy to use, similar to Uber and Bolt, but not identical. You can see the price for your ride before your order it, just to be sure. </p>
<p> You can share the details of your journey within the app, and you can also pay inside the app if you want. Simply fire up the app, set your destination, request a driver, and that's it. You'll be able to see the driver's location on the real-time map, within the application. After you're done, leave a rating and pay. That's it. </p>
<p> Bolt is currently available in over 30 countries, and over 150 cities all around the world. If the name doesn't sound all that familiar, there's a reason for that. This is a rather new name for this app, as it was renamed from 'Taxify' back in March 2019. It has been about a year and a half since then, but some people still remember it as 'Taxify'. </p>
<p> Best Uber & Lyft Android app alternative if you want to book rides in advance </p>
<p> Wingz </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 5.0+ </p>
<p> Wingz is an alternative to Uber and Lyft that is available only in the US, and it's a bit different. In fact, it's not available everywhere, only in parts of California, Florida, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. That being said, this app offers one rather interesting feature, it allows you to request the same driver you've used before. </p>
<p> You can actually compile a list of your favorite drivers, and request any one of them, if available. That will give some people peace of mind, that's for sure. The app also allows you to book a private ride ahead of time, so that you don't have to do it at the last minute. This is actually the main focus of this app, booking rides in advance. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Wingz app is really simple in its design, and it's not cumbersome to use by any means. Truth be said, it could use a bit of flair here and there. The app is free to download, and use. It seems like people do have some issues with the app, though, at least based on the Play Store comments. I haven't experienced any, but your mileage may vary. </p>
<p> Best Uber & Lyft Android app alternative for design simplicity </p>
<p> Flywheel </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 4.1+ </p>
<p> Flywheel is one of the least popular apps on the list, and one of those with the worst rating. This app is also quite limited in terms where it is available. It can be used in the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Sacramento, and San Diego only. You cannot use it in other parts of the US, nor outside of the States. </p>
<p> That being said, Flywheel's app is really simple to use. It's not exactly the prettiest around, though it's not ugly either. It's a good balance between the two, and the overall simplicity is something that will appeal to many people. You can request a cab using this app, and pay automatically with your phone. </p>
<p> You can see your cab arriving on a real-time map, and know exactly when will it pick you up. There is also an option to call your driver directly through the app, if that is something that you need. Flywheel uses licensed cabs, and they all use standard fares. </p>
<p> Best Uber & Lyft Android app alternative for users in NYC, Washington & Chicago </p>
<p> Via </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 5.0+ </p>
<p> Via is yet another low-cost ride-sharing application. Do note that this app is also quite limited in terms of availability. It will be of use to you only if you live in specific parts of the US, including NYC, Washington or Chicago. If you're from wherever else, you won't be able to use this app, at least not at the time of writing this article. </p>
<p> How does this work? Well, as you'd expect. You book a ride via the app, get picked up, share your ride with others, and save cash while doing it. This is more of a carpool service, than your regular taxi-hailing service. The whole goal is to save money and reduce carbon emissions. The thing is, once you book a ride, the app will direct you to a nearby corner to meet the driver. </p>
<p> The app does this so that the Via driver and its passengers never have to go out of their way. This also saves time, money, and reduces carbon emissions. Via also promises low-fares for everyone, and good customer service. People seem to be mostly happy with the service, although there are some complaints about that in the Play Store, and complaints about the app as well. </p>

<p> Top 9 Best Video Call Android Apps – 2020 </p>
<p> Video call is the best way to stay in contact with your loved ones if you're unable to do so in person. Video calling is especially useful in these times, when we're unable to spend time with people in person due to the outbreak which forced us to distance ourselves from our friends and family. </p>
<p> Having said that, there are quite a few video call apps for Android, and we've selected the best ones. Do note that the apps we've picked don't have to be your preferred choices, of course. There are quite a few apps in the Google Play Store that offer video call option, and these are only some of them. </p>
<p> Do note that ZOOM is not on the list due to quite a long list of issues that it's having at the moment. The company is working hard to fix all those issues, but for the time being, we'll keep it off the list. There are quite a few other video call apps for Android that are great, and here are the best ones, in our opinion. Read on. </p>

<p> Best video call Android app for most users </p>
<p> Google Duo </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Google Duo is an app especially made for video calls. This is Google's very own app, as its name says, and it's really good. Many people still don't know what Google Duo is, but it's one of the best apps for video calling, no doubt. The quality of video calls is great, and the app's UI is a joy to use. The whole focus is on the video content here, and that's exactly what a video call app should offer. </p>
<p> This application is completely free to use, all you need is a Google account. There are no ads included here or anything of the sort, and the same goes for in-app purchases. The web client is also available, in case you'd like to use it instead of the app. Group calling is possible via Google Duo, as the app supports up to 12 people in a single group video call. That will be more than enough for the vast majority of you. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Duo also allows you to leave a personalized video message, in case the person you're calling cannot pick up. If you prefer voice calling over video calling, that option is also available via Google Duo. The app is constantly getting new features, and it's getting better and better by the day. It's really simple to use, and thus we believe it's probably the best option for most people. </p>
<p> Best video call Android app for playing games </p>
<p> Houseparty </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Houseparty is probably the best video call app for playing games, but we'll get to that. This app managed to become really popular lately, and the recent outbreak probably helped with that. Many people are trying to spend time with their friends and family online, considering they can't do it in person. Houseparty even allows you to play games with your friends, and more of them at once. </p>
<p> This is a nicely-designed video call app and it works well on Android, as soon as bugs are staying away. Some people seem to be having issues with buggy performance of Houseparty, at least based on the comments. We haven't experienced any significant issues, other than the fact battery drain notification popped up once or twice. There is a reason this app is called 'Houseparty' as well, it's due to a specific feature. </p>
<p> The app can send you a notification when your friend(s) is at this home, and ready for a video call. Group chats are enabled in Houseparty, which was to be expected, considering its name. As far as games are concerned, you can play Chips, Guac, Heads-Up, and some other games with your friends. We have no doubt that more games will become available in the near future. </p>
<p> Best video call Android app for live transcription </p>
<p> Skype </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Skype is the go-to video call app for many people. This is, without a doubt, one of the best-known applications for video-calling, and one of the first ones on the market. Skype got a lot better over the years, and is now definitely a complete package. The app offers a really simple, nice-looking, and easy-to-use UI, while video-calling via this app is high quality, as with every other app on the list. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>

Skype also allows for group calls, up to 24 people can talk at the same time, in HD. You can also use regular text messages to communicate with people via Skype, though that's not its primary usage scenario, of course. If you prefer voice calls over video calls, no problem, Skype offers that as well. </p>
<p> You can even reply to your SMS messages via Skype, if you want to. You can do that from your phone, PC, or Mac, it's up to you. Emoticons are supported in Skype, and so are GIFs, as far as text messages are concerned. The is completely free to use, while there are no app purchases here. Ads are present, though. </p>

<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Microsoft Teams is Microsoft's very own video-calling app. This app is more oriented towards businesses, though. The company refers to this service as a "hub for teamwork in Office 365". Microsoft Teams keeps all your team conversations, files, meetings, and apps in a single shared workspace. That way, everything you need is really easy to access, no matter what platform you're using at the time. </p>
<p> You can manage your team's projects via this app, with built-in file editing and sharing on the go. Video calls are a big part of Microsoft Teams, and HD audio and video are supported here, Group video calls are also supported, by the way. If you prefer text messages over video calls, that is supported here. You can either chat privately, or chat in groups. You can actually create various dedicated channels for different projects. </p>
<p> You can tag your team members here, one-by-one, or simply tag a whole channel. A search function for chats is also supported in Microsoft Teams. This application also offers a really nice-looking UI. It's quite simple, and yet really functional, which is the best combination, of course. </p>
<p> Best video call Android app for group chats </p>
<p> Viber </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Viber, as many of you know, is mainly a messaging platform. It is one of the most popular instant messaging platforms in the world. Well, Viber does many things, sending messaging is not its only function, far from it. This app offers the video call option, as does regular calls over the Internet. It actually does a great job with that. Even when it comes to group chats, the app works great. </p>
<p> Viber is available via the web as well. The app also allows you to make low-cost calls to landlines with Viber Out, if that's something you really want to do. Now, in terms of group chats, Viber allows for group chats of up to 250 people. That should be enough for pretty much everyone, right? We hope it is. This app also offers end-to-end encryption, while the app also offers self-destruct secret chats. </p>
<p> Stickers and GIFs are both supported by Viber. The company also offers various Chat Extensions, if that's something you're into. There are extensions for Yelp, YouTube, Booking, Spotify, and much more. Viber is free to use, though you may stumble upon some ads while doing so. The bottom line is, this is a great instant messaging app, with a really functional video call feature. </p>
<p> Best video call Android app for large groups of people </p>
<p> WhatsApp </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 4.0.3 </p>
<p> WhatsApp is actually a direct competitor to Viber. These two apps have plenty in common. They're both instant messaging apps that offer both call and video call options. They actually do a great job at that. WhatsApp is also great for group video calls, and the same goes for its instant messaging feature. This app, much like Viber, works in correlation with your smartphone number, which you'll need in order to activate it. </p>
<p> WhatsApp is also free to use, and it allows you to send photos, videos, documents, and voice messages. The app also allows you to share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers, set custom notification sounds, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and much more. Stickers and GIFs are supported by the app, as are with many other instant messaging apps. </p>
<p> This is one of the most popular instant messaging services in the world, and many of its users use the video call option. WhatsApp's video calls are buttery smooth, at least in our experience. The works great in that regard, no matter if you're talking to one person, or a bunch of them. </p>
<p> Best video call Android app for Facebook users </p>
<p> Facebook Messenger </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Android version: Varies with device </p>
<p> Facebook Messenger is, much like WhatsApp, a service by Facebook. Unlike WhatsApp, though, Messenger hasn't been acquired, but developed by Facebook. It is tightly integrated with the company's brand and everything else. Messenger had its issues at first, but it managed to grow into one of the most popular instant messaging services. If you're a Facebook user, this is probably the best option for you. </p>
<p> Messenger, in addition to many of its other features, also offers the video call option. That feature also had its fair share of issues in the past, but Facebook managed to iron everything out. It actually works really, really well now. We've used it while talking with one and several people, and things were really smooth. It is right up there with the rest of them in that regard. It also offers various live filters and stickers you can use while talking to people, many of them are interactive. </p>
<p> The app offers dark mode, as many other apps on the list, and it also allows you to send photos, videos, and voice messages to your contacts. Messenger offers a slightly different design than the ones Android users are used to, but it's just as functional. Facebook actually cleaned up the design of this app quite a bit a while back. All in all, Messenger is a great choice. </p>
<p> Best video call Android app for gamers </p>
<p> Discord </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 5.0+ </p>
<p> If you're a gamer, chances are you've heard of Discord. Discord is basically an instant messaging app packed with features. This app is mainly used by gamers, though many other people seem to be using it, as it's just that good. Discord is a bit different than your regular instant messaging app, though. This app allows you to organize channels in which you can share videos, coordinate gaming meetups, and so on. </p>
<p> Those channels are essentially chat groups with a number of features available. You can open voice channels for talking while you're gaming, while video calls are also supported by Discord. You can watch your friends stream their games, or gather up for a screen-sharing session at any point. This app also allows you to share photos, videos, links, and so much more. </p>
<p> You can even assign roles to members if you'd like to give them moderation powers over a channel. You can even create VIP channels for admins, superfans, and so on. As you'll probably able to tell already, this app is heavily focused on gaming. If you're a gamer, and plan to use video calls in the aspect of gaming, Discord is the way to go. </p>
<p> Best video call Android app for privacy </p>
<p> Signal </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 4.4+ </p>
<p> Signal is an instant messaging service with great focus on privacy and security. Signal is the go-to service for many people who are looking to keep their communication private. That goes for text messages, voice calls, and video calls. This app offers "state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption", which is powered by the open source Signal Protocol. In other words, it's a great choice if you're worried about privacy. </p>
<p> Now, other than that, this app works like any other instant messaging service. It's very reliable when it comes to text messages, voice calls, and video calls. All three of those features work really great in Signal, as the app is really well optimized. There are some additional features included here, as you have some customization options to play around with. </p>
<p> Signal even comes with a built-in image editing features. So, you can use this app to sketch, crop, and flip your outgoing photos, which not something many messaging services offer. Signal is completely free to use, while it does not come with ads nor in-app purchases, in case you were wondering. </p>

<p> Android Buyers Guide / Top 7 Best Wireless Chargers For OnePlus 8 Pro – April 2020 </p>
<p> Top 7 Best Wireless Chargers For OnePlus 8 Pro – April 2020 </p>
<p> OnePlus finally did the thing. The OnePlus 8 Pro has wireless charging, so now it's time to find the best wireless chargers for the company's newest flagship smartphone. </p>
<p> But you search Amazon looking for a wireless charger, only to see that there are thousands of them available. Some that support 5W, others that do 7.5W and even some that do 10W. Which one(s) are the best for your shiny new OnePlus 8 Pro? Well, we've rounded all of them up and have them listed down below. </p>
<p> Top 7 Best Wireless Chargers For OnePlus 8 Pro – April 2020 </p>
<p> These wireless chargers for the OnePlus 8 Pro range from just a few bucks, all the way up to over $70. So there's something here for everyone, thankfully. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now there is one thing that we do need to mention here. Only the OnePlus wireless chargers will fully charge the 8 Pro at its max speed of 30W. Due to some trickery that OnePlus had to pull off to get to that speed, other wireless chargers won't charge at that speed. But since it does still use Qi, you can use any Qi charger and get some wireless charging going. It'll just be a bit slower. It can charge at 10W, which isn't exactly 30W, but it's better than 5W wireless charging. </p>
<p> Best wireless charger for OnePlus 8 Pro </p>
<p> OnePlus Warp Charge 30W Wireless Charger </p>
<p> This is by far the best of the wireless chargers available for the OnePlus 8 Pro. For one, it is developed by OnePlus, so it is made specifically for the OnePlus 8 Pro. But it is also one of only two chargers that support 30W fast wireless charging on the OnePlus 8 Pro. Which is very important. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus Warp Charge 30W Wireless Charger is a charging stand, that actually has a fan built-in, which will get rid of the heat that the charger is going to generate. At 30W, it is able to wirelessly charge your OnePlus 8 Pro completely in just over an hour – we're talking about 62 minutes from our usage. That is pretty insane, for a 4510mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> It doesn't come cheap, but if you want fast wireless charging, this is the one to get. </p>
<p> Best convertible wireless charger </p>
<p> Spigen SteadiBoost Flex Convertible Fast Wireless Charger </p>
<p> If you are looking for a slightly cheaper wireless charging stand, then the Spigen SteadiBoost Flex Convertible Fast Wireless Charger is a really good choice. Though it can also be converted into a charging pad, which is really nice too. So you can use it as a stand or a pad. Which explains why it is still $35. But that is half the price of the OnePlus charger. </p>
<p> This wireless charger is able to charge at up to 15W. But you will likely only be able to max out at 10W on the OnePlus 8 Pro. Because of the way the phone is designed. Still, that's better than the 5W that most chargers will give you. So that's pretty good. </p>
<p> Best wireless charging pad </p>
<p> Anker PowerWave Pad 10W </p>
<p> The Anker PowerWave Pad 10W is a pretty simple wireless charger. Which is why it makes the list for the best wireless chargers for the OnePlus 8 Pro. It's not a flashy charger, and it is priced pretty efficiently at just $12. Now it's important to note that at this price, it does not come with a wall charger. So you'll want to make sure that you have a wall charger that is USB-A and is at least at Quick Charge 3.0 speeds, to get the full 10W here. </p>
<p> As mentioned in the name, the Anker PowerWave Pad 10W is capable of up to 10W. And you should be able to get 10W speed on the OnePlus 8 Pro with this wireless charger too. Just put your phone down and you'll be good to go. That's what makes this a really great charger to put on a bedside table. </p>
<p> Best looking wireless charging stand </p>
<p> Nulaxy Adjustable Aluminum Wireless Charging Stand </p>
<p> Now this wireless charging stand from Nulaxy is actually a really cool looking one. You can adjust the angle of this one too. It's going to look really good on a desk, as you can still see your notifications. Even if your phone is still charging. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, the Nulaxy Adjustable Aluminum Wireless Charging Stand only does up to 7.5W (the fastest speed that iPhones can handle), which means that for the OnePlus 8 Pro. You're going to be stuck with 5W. That is really slow, and may not be worth it to some people. But if you are just charging your phone at night, then it's going to be slow enough that it doesn't overcharge and keeps your battery from aging too quickly. And also make sure it is fully charged when you wake up. </p>
<p> Best wireless charging battery pack </p>
<p> AUKEY Wireless Power Bank with 18W PD </p>
<p> You might be wondering why there is a battery pack on this list. Well, that's because this battery pack has wireless charging. Meaning that you can place your OnePlus 8 Pro onto this battery pack and it'll start charging. However, one of the downsides to battery pack wireless charging is the fact that it is going to be slow, and use up a lot of juice from the battery pack. </p>
<p> So the second reason why this is on the list, is because it does USB-C PD. This is a safer version of fast charging, than what OnePlus offers with Warp Charge. And it's available on this battery pack. We're looking at 18W, which isn't quite as fast as the 30W on Warp Charge, but still pretty nice to have when you're out and about – once we are able to leave our homes again. </p>
<p> Best wireless charging car dock </p>
<p> iOttie Easy One Touch Wireless Qi Fast Charge Car Mount Kit </p>
<p> Something you probably didn't think existed, does indeed exist. This is a wireless charging car dock that you can pick up for the OnePlus 8 Pro. Now, yes, the picture does show an iPhone. But forget about that part. The iOttie Easy One Touch Wireless Qi Fast Charge Car Mount Kit supports Qi Wireless charging. So you're going to get up to 5W of wireless charging here. Unfortunately it only does up to 7.5W, so you won't be getting 10W out of this one. </p>
<p> This one can be mounted onto your windshield and then plugged into your car outlet. Because it uses your car for energy, getting anything more than 5W is going to be next to impossible anyways. So this isn't too bad of a trade off. And you can charge your phone while it is being used for navigation too. Which is definitely neat. </p>
<p> Best fast wireless charging pad </p>
<p> iOttie iON Wireless Plus v2 Charging Pad </p>
<p> The iOttie iON Wireless Plus v2 Charging Pad is one of our personal favorites actually. This is a wireless charging pad that does support fast wireless charging. At 5W, 7.5W and 10W. And with the OnePlus 8 Pro, you should be able to get at 10W of speed out of this one. So it's right on par with just about every other charger on this list. </p>
<p> And on top of that, it is definitely a looker, in this gray fabric. I definitely wouldn't mind having one of these sitting on my desk for charging my phone from time to time. </p>
<p> Then there is also the fact that the iOttie iON Wireless Plus v2 Charging Pad uses a USB-C cable for power. Meaning that this can pull double duty. And offer up a way to wirelessly charge your OnePlus 8 Pro and charge it wired. And at $35, it's worth picking this one up. </p>

<p> We've also tried to include a range of games from a variety of different genres so there's a little something for everyone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Xbox Games Summary </p>
<p> Below you'll find a summary table of the best Xbox games that we've picked. If you're short on time or just want to get straight to playing some awesome new titles, the table below has everything listed. </p>
<p> It'll also includes current prices and buy links as well as where to get each game. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Xbox Games List </p>
<p> Below you'll find each game listed in the table above, with a short description about each title along with trailers, current prices, where you can pick up the game and buy links to grab it. </p>
<p> Best Third-Person Shooter Game On Xbox </p>
<p> Gears 5 </p>
<p> Long-time Xbox fans are well aware of the Gears franchise and Gears 5 is the latest mainline game in the series. We won't be counting Gears Tactics here. Although that is a great game. </p>
<p> With Gears 5, you get a plethora of gameplay modes to keep you occupied from the story campaign to the ever popular horde mode where you have to withstand 50 waves of enemies. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The graphics of course are great, and there's a pretty decent narrative to follow that both fans and newcomers will enjoy. Making this one of the best games on Xbox today. </p>
<p> This like some of the games on here, is available via Xbox Game Pass as well. So if you don't want to own a physical copy of it, you can download the game that way. Or just play it through the Game Pass Ultimate cloud gaming option. </p>
<p> Best Racing Game On Xbox </p>
<p> Forza Horizon 4 </p>
<p> Microsoft's Forza franchise is another game with a long and storied history as it's been around since the early days. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With Forza Horizon 4, gamers are treated to some of the best visuals in games that you'll ever see. Especially if you have the hardware (for the Windows version) To crank things up to 8K. </p>
<p> In this game the big draw is the shared open world with changing seasons. There's also over 450 cars to collect, solo and cooperative play, plus many more features. </p>
<p> The Forza franchise is the racing crown jewel of Xbox. And it has pretty much everything you might want in a racing game. Which is a large roster of cars and graphics that make things feel real enough as though you're actually behind the wheel of the car. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Best Exclusive First-Person Shooter Game On Xbox </p>
<p> Halo Reach (via The Master Chief Collection) </p>
<p> Halo is probably the definitive first-person shooter franchise when it comes an experience that offers both single-player and multiplayer modes. </p>
<p> Though it does certainly fall behind the next game on our list in terms the definitive first-person shooter experience in general. </p>
<p> With Halo, specifically Halo Reach which is part of The Master Chief Collection, this is the best exclusive FPS game on Xbox. While Halo 3: ODST was also a very good game in the series, Reach is unparalleled. Telling the story of the fall of Reach and introducing new playable guardians. It's also the prequel game, as chronologically it starts before Halo in terms of story. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The best part is that you can obtain the remastered version of Reach through The Master Chief Collection. Which comes with all the other mainline Halo games. Save for Halo 5: Guardians. </p>
<p> Best Non-Exclusive First-Person Shooter Game On Xbox </p>
<p> DOOM Eternal </p>
<p> DOOM Eternal is probably the best first-person shooter on any platform this year. Not just Xbox. But it is available on Xbox so we had to include it. </p>
<p> The main base game content was good on its own, but it's even better now because the new expansion DLC, The Ancient Gods Part One is available and it expands the game's campaign mode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you've never played DOOM Eternal, you're in for a treat. Rip and tear your way through hell on earth and destroy demons like never before. </p>
<p> Equip an arsenal of weapons to take out enemies. Utilize special skills to get the edge in overwhelmingly difficult situations. Find out more about DOOM Guy. DOOM Eternal is a wild ride that you don't want to miss if you love FPS games. Aside from the normal gameplay there's other stuff to chase too. Like challenges, collectibles, and all manner of other unlocks. </p>
<p> Just be prepared to die a lot should you play on any of the difficulty levels that are even mildly challenging. That being said, you can lower the difficulty and still have a challenge that is more focused on the story and core of the action. </p>
<p> Best Adventure Platformer Game On Xbox </p>
<p> Ori And The Will Of The Wisps </p>
<p> This is the second game in this franchise and it's even better than the first. The visuals are even more gorgeous, and there's some amazingly striking worlds that have been created in the individual stages. </p>
<p> Since this is a platformer, expect plenty of puzzles and discovery through the worlds that have been created. You'll also encounter challenging bosses, and learn more about the characters in the story. </p>
<p> If you've never played the first game in the series, Ori And The Blind Forest, you don't need to necessarily start there, but you'll definitely want to play it at some point. Both games are great though. </p>
<p> Best Action-Adventure Game On Xbox </p>
<p> Sea Of Thieves </p>
<p> Where to begin with Sea Of Thieves. It's an action-adventure game, but it's so much more than that. You get to play a scurvy pirate sailing the high seas. </p>
<p> Party up with friends (or foes that you don't quite trust) and create a crew. Sail the high seas and raid ships. Take everything they have and shoot them or cut them down. Hell, you can even make them walk the plank. </p>
<p> Explore a vast world of wonder, encounter large enemies like the kraken, meet tons of new and interesting characters, and complete quests in a time when treasure was the god that everyone worshipped. </p>
<p> Turn yourself into a pirate legend and build up your ship. Collect all kinds of gear and create some amazing pirate outfits. There's really no shortage of things to do in this game. </p>
<p> Sea Of Thieves is also still getting content updates with more DLC and gameplay activities. So if you want something to play that's not out of date and offers a somewhat live service experience, this is an option. And a great one at that. </p>
<p> Plus, who has never dreamed of being a pirate at some point in their life? This is the best pirate game on the planet. Don't miss out on this one. </p>
<p> Best Run And Gun Game On Xbox </p>
<p> Cuphead </p>
<p> Classic run and gun games have been around since the days of arcade cabinets and SNES. Think SNK's Metal Slug. </p>
<p> Cuphead is a run and gun game that is designed in the classic style in terms of gameplay, but utilizes visuals that are modeled after classic animated cartoons. </p>
<p> The game is extremely challenging. So if hard games aren't your thing, then you may want to skip this one. But you may regret it as this is one of the best games on Xbox. Even if it's a hard game to beat. </p>
<p> Also worth noting is that this is a digital download game. So if you buy it what you're buying is a code to be used so the game can be downloaded to your Xbox console or Windows 10 PC. </p>
<p> Best Free-To-Play MMO On Xbox </p>
<p> Bless Unleashed </p>
<p> Bless Unleashed is a slightly newer MMO that released for Xbox and Windows earlier this year. Compared to other free-to-play MMOs it's pretty new. </p>
<p> It's published by Bandai Namco, and offers five classes. Each class has its own unique play style in terms of abilities and combat. This includes a unique combo system that allows you to attack enemies in a different way than other classes. </p>
<p> Try them all out and see which one you like best! To add to that, combat in general throughout the game is very combo driven. So making the most of your attacks will require you to string together as many combos as you can. Or just the best ones. </p>
<p> Bless Unleashed also features some pretty awesome graphics. And it's definitely one of the best-looking MMOs on the market right now. Since this is an MMO there is also a ton of stuff to do and you should expect all the familiar MMO activities. </p>
<p> Such as loads and loads of quests, dungeons, raids, crafting, PvP and more. This is also available on Windows and Xbox One. So you can play on console or PC. Whatever suits you more. </p>
<p> Best Action Sci-Fi Game On Xbox </p>
<p> Quantum Break </p>
<p> Probably one of the most interesting games on this list. Quantum Break is an action shooter that lets you more or less control time. </p>
<p> It's filled with a heavy Sci-Fi themes and has a cast of a-list actors. Not to mention more than a few unique abilities that are at your disposal to help you through more difficult parts of the game. </p>
<p> You play as Jack Joyce, who is able to manipulate time in a way that causes everything else to freeze around you. This gives you an advantage in many situations. Though don't expect the game to be a complete pushover. </p>
<p> It still has the capability to kick your ass if you aren't careful. There's a variety of different enemy types and obstacles you'll face throughout the story, and all of them will have some way to overcome your powers. </p>
<p> As a third-person shooter, Quantum Break has plenty of guns and other weaponry outside of your powers. So use everything you can to blast through the opposition. It's definitely one of the best games on Xbox. And one you should absolutely play. </p>
<p> Best Fighting Game On Xbox </p>
<p> Killer Instinct: Definitive Edition </p>
<p> Killer Instinct was never an Xbox exclusive initially. It originally released back in the 90s for the Super Nintendo. But in modern times Microsoft acquired the franchise and remade the game for the Xbox One. </p>
<p> This is definitely one of the best fighting games out there and certainly worthy of being considered one of the best fighting games on Xbox. If not the best one. </p>
<p> It has unique characters, each with versatile enough play styles and attacks that can make any battle interesting. No matter who you're up against. </p>
<p> The graphics are also really good, and there are numerous ways to counter or rethink your approach to attacking your opponent. It's a very smartly designed fighting game. And one that rewards you for thinking outside the box a little bit. </p>
<p> The Definitive Edition of course, is the best version of this game. If fighting games are your jam, try killer Instinct out. You won't regret doing so. </p>

<p> BlackBerry / BlackBerry CEO Worried About Hacked Self-Driving Cars Killing People </p>
<p> BlackBerry CEO Worried About Hacked Self-Driving Cars Killing People </p>
<p> In short: BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer John Chen is worried about autonomous vehicle security, having voiced his concerns about hackers turning self-driving cars into "fully loaded weapons" in a recent interview with the Financial Post. The industry veteran pointed to the complexity of contemporary driverless navigation systems as the main vulnerability of such solutions given how hackers have countless lines of code they could potentially exploit within the thereof. Mr. Chen doesn't see a universal fix for the issue, save for frequent security checkups and updates. </p>
<p> Background: The issue of driverless vehicle safety has been the topic of some heated stateside debates in recent months, especially after one of Uber's autonomous Volvo XC90 SUVs hit and killed a Tempe, Arizona woman this spring, making no attempts at stopping despite detecting her six seconds before impact. Not even the industry leader Waymo believes to be anywhere close to commercializing self-driving solutions outside of entirely controlled scenarios, with today's autonomous cars hence being dangerous enough on their own, not even accounting for the possibility of malicious individuals or entities taking over their controls. Coupled with the fear of the unknown, the American public is presently highly skeptical of self-driving vehicles and the level of safety they offer, according to a number of recent studies. </p>
<p> Impact: Mr. Chen's comments are unlikely to have any immediate effect on the industry and while security is not an afterthought in the industry, it's hardly a priority given how existing solutions are still years away from being commercialized on any significant scale. Besides the technological challenges to their widespread adoption, self-driving cars also remain at the mercy of legislators who have so far been slow to codify the framework meant to regulate the emerging field, all of which are issues that will have to be addressed simultaneously with any cybersecurity concerns experts and lawmakers have about autonomous transportation technologies. </p>

<p> BlackBerry Evolve & EvolveX Are Official With Dual Cameras </p>
<p> BlackBerry has been teasing its Evolve and EvolveX smartphone recently, and both handsets are now official. As expected, both of these smartphones were introduced in India, and we still do not know if they will reach other markets. These two handsets have been released by Optiemus in India, and they look the same, though there are some differences under the hood that are worth mentioning. </p>
<p> Let’s kick things off with the design, both phones sport rather thin bezels for mid-range handsets, though those bezels are still there and quite visible, especially the ones above and below the display. BlackBerry’s logo is included both on the front and back sides, while a dual camera setup is included on these two handsets. A fingerprint scanner sits below the dual camera setup, and a dual-LED, dual-tone flash is placed right next to those two cameras. All the physical keys are placed on the right-hand side of the Evolve and EvolveX, while a SIM card tray is accessible from the left. The display on the Evolve and EvolveX sports rounded corners, and it seems like BlackBerry once again opted for a grippy, soft-touch back panel. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry Evolve features a 5.99-inch fullHD+ (2160 x 1080) display with a 2.5D curved glass on top of it, and Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5 protection. The device is fueled by the Snapdragon 450 64-bit octa-core processor, while it comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. Android 8.1 Oreo comes pre-installed on the device, along with BlackBerry’s launcher, while the device offers two SIM card slots (2x nano SIM, hybrid setup). Two 13-megapixel cameras sit on the back of the phone, while a single 16-megapixel camera is included on its front side. A 3.5mm headphone jack is a part of the package, as is FM Radio. A 4,000mAh battery sits on the inside of this phone, and it supports Quick Charge 3.0, while Bluetooth 5 LE is also included in the package. </p>

<p> The BlackBerry EvolveX has the same display as the Evolve, while the two phones share a number of other internals as well, but the EvolveX comes with a more powerful SoC, more RAM, more capable cameras, and Dolby Atmos support. The device is fueled by the Snapdragon 660 64-bit octa-core processor, and it includes 6GB of RAM on the inside. 12 and 13-megapixel cameras sit on the back of this phone, and the device supports wireless charging, which is also a feature that is not available on the regular Evolve model. These two smartphones are priced at Rs. 24,990 ($365) and Rs. 34,990 ($511) in India, and will be available exclusively via Amazon India. The BlackBerry EvolveX will go on sale from the end of this month, while the Evolve will become available in mid-September. </p>

<p> BlackBerry Ghost Said To Be Equipped With 4,000 mAh Battery </p>
<p> BlackBerry Mobile's currently unannounced "Ghost" smartphone is said to come powered by a 4,000 mAh capacity battery, according to a new tweet from prominent industry insider Evan Blass. This is the first new rumor to have surfaced about the handset since Blass' previous tweet which indicated that a summer launch is expected for the Optiemus Infracom-produced smartphone. If the new information is accurate, then it is likely the BlackBerry Ghost will be positioned in the higher side of the flagship tier when it comes to battery capacity, specifically. </p>
<p> As for the rest of the known information on this BlackBerry Mobile top-tier smartphone, it is expected to run Android OS and will likely feature the latest iteration of Oreo. In addition, Ghost will most likely be covered and underpinned by BlackBerry's own solutions for mobile hardware and software security systems and its own near-stock iteration of Android itself. Optical zoom and low-light enhancements are rumored to be included to support the smartphone's dual rear camera array. Unlike other BlackBerry models, no physical keyboard is expected with the BlackBerry Ghost, making it an all-screen Android phone. </p>
<p> Although the Canada-based Optiemus Infracom is one of the official OEMs for BlackBerry Mobile-branded devices, it hasn't been generating very many smartphones under that brand over the past year. That has mostly been left to TLC, who has manufactured devices such as the new successor to the company's BlackBerry KEYone, the BlackBerry KEY2. What's more, the brand hasn't been released in a "top-tier" category in the US for quite some time, suggesting the Ghost is unlikely to get a US release either. Optiemus Infracom has a long-standing contract for licensing the brand in markets such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal. So there's a high likeliness that the new BlackBerry Ghost will appear in those markets, as well as in Europe and Asia. The above-mentioned KEY2 is a well-made mid-range handset but is not cutting edge. So there's a good chance an exception won't be made for the BlackBerry Ghost. </p>

<p> One more Ghost tidbit: it's got a 4,000mAh battery, which would be one of the largest in a flagship-class device. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Appears In Renders With A Clean Black Frame </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 has popped up in purportedly official renders yet again, following a reported leak of the same device from yesterday. This time around, however, the device is shown in a stunning black coloration. While the back of the device in previous renders was also black, those portrayed the handset in a silver frame. That same metallic tone was used in the keyboard surround and along the bezels, as well. In the new render, that's been replaced with a sleek black metal. Although the change is relatively slight, it has the effect of making the entire device appear more understated. Interestingly enough, even the BlackBerry logo is shown in black in the new render – whereas it was shown in silver in prior renders. </p>
<p> The device itself has already passed through several regulatory agencies and has even been spotted on Geekbench in no fewer than two listings and configurations. The smartphone is expected to ship with a Snapdragon 660 SoC powering 8.1 Oreo and featuring two variants. One of those is expected to house 4GB of RAM while the other may arrive with 6GB of RAM. There's no word yet on how much storage might be included but it isn't unreasonable to expect that if it does ship in two variations, one will have more than the other. Similarly, there's been no indication as to how large the included battery pack will be but the images that have been leaking all point to a USB Type-C charging port and rapid charging will almost certainly be supported. Moreover, the front-facing physical keyboard is all but guaranteed as a hallmark trait of the "KEY" series devices. Lastly, there is a dual rear camera setup shown in the renders, backed by an LED flash, but there's no way to tell what those consist of just yet. </p>
<p> As for a launch date, the BlackBerry KEY2 will reportedly be unveiled at a New York-based event on June 7. That could mean that all of the finer details associated with a TCL-made Android device will be available this week. Pricing will likely be similar to the previous handset, the BlackBerry KEYone but it's not possible to know sure until the company announces it officially. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 'Guided Tour' Video Appears On YouTube </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 is arguably one of the more interesting smartphones that got released this year, and the company has just released its official ‘Guided Tour & Device Walkthrough’ video. That video appeared on the company’s official YouTube page, and it has a duration of about five minutes. If you’re interested in purchasing the BlackBerry KEY2, or you’d just like to know more about the phone, this video may be worth a watch. </p>
<p> In the video itself, BlackBerry emphasizes the phone’s design, features, and security / privacy. The BlackBerry KEY2 comes with a frame made out of a series 7 aluminum, which essentially means it’s quite sturdy, while some sort of a rubbery material is applied on its back, so that it does not slip out of your hand easily. The device sports a 4.5-inch display, while the phone’s main feature is its QWERTY keyboard, which is now considerably larger, compared to the KEYone’s keyboard. This keyboard also comes with a new key which allows you to set up over 50 shortcuts on that keyboard, needless to say, that offers users plenty of customizability, and also productivity at the same time. A 3,500mAh battery is included in this phone, and you can recharge it using Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging, which is also something that BlackBerry emphasizes in this video. </p>
<p> The company also mentions the KEY2’s camera modes, such as 2x lossless zoom, and ‘Portrait Mode’, though the KEY2 is not primarily a camera phone, of course. BlackBerry’s well-known convenience key is included on the side, while a fingerprint scanner is embedded into the space bar on the phone. BlackBerry claims that the KEY2 is the most secure Android smartphone in its new video, while the company also mentions the DTEK device monitoring application which is included on the device, and which allows you to access granular settings, and plenty more. BlackBerry Hub is also mentioned in the provided video, along with plenty more KEY2 details. If you’re interested, check out the embedded video, and if you’d like to dive in deeper, feel free to check out our full review of the BlackBerry KEY2. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Has Dedicated Button For Unknown Feature </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 has a dedicated button for an unknown feature on the keyboard. At the moment it's not clear what the button will do but it's likely to be a highlighted feature of the device once it launches and a significant one at that, as BlackBerry Mobile's latest teaser for the unreleased phone places great emphasis on this one button which is definitely not present on the company's KEYone device that was launched back in 2017. The teaser comes in the form of a short video on the BlackBerry Mobile YouTube channel, and can be viewed below for those interested. </p>
<p> In addition to this new, mysterious button that BlackBerry Mobile is highlighting the teaser also shows off the dual rear-facing camera system that can be found on the phone, further confirming it will come with two cameras on the back for some sort of enhanced photo experience, which is likely to be for depth of field-type images as this seems to be the way most manufacturers are utilizing the second camera sensor. The teaser also shows off the textured pattern design on the back of the phone, which was mentioned in an earlier report about the device where BlackBerry Mobile confirmed the date for the KEY2's upcoming announcement event happening on June 7. On the BlackBerry KEY2 invite the same textured pattern design was used as the backdrop. </p>
<p> There isn't much else in the way of details that can be picked up from the teaser video but it does show that the phone will come with another dedicated button of some sort, this one being on the side along with what is likely the power button and the volume buttons. BlackBerry Mobile is also continuing to highlight the slogan for its upcoming phone – 'An Icon Reborn,' which still doesn't elude too much, though it won't be long before BlackBerry Mobile opens up about what it means with this claim. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Leaks In Additional Press Renders </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 has leaked in additional press renders earlier this morning showing off the phone from a few different angles, providing a better look at the upcoming device and showing off specific features. Though none of the internals or specifications, or the actual features for that matter, are talked about in this leak, some aspects of the device are clear. The BlackBerry KEY2 will come with USB Type-C for charging and data transfer, and it looks like it may have dual speakers, one on either side of the charging port located on the bottom of the phone, however it's also possible that only one of these is a speaker and the other is simply there to match the design and keep things aesthetically uniform. </p>
<p> All three images give a better look at the display of the BlackBerry KEY2 along with some perspective to how big it might be, with the keyboard looking a little shorter than the keyboard on the KEYone. Speaking of the keyboard, the button that BlackBerry Mobile highlighted in its teaser from back in late May is in clearer view as well. It's still not known what exactly this button will do but because it was highlighted in the teaser clip it would appear to have some significance and based on the location of the button as well as its design, this is probably just the new look of the BlackBerry button that can be found on every other BlackBerry device with a physical keyboard. </p>
<p> The KEY2 will come with dual cameras on the back of the phone along with an LED flash, one camera on the front for selfies and video chat, a SIM slot on the left edge of the frame, and the volume keys, a power button, and a third button, on the right side of the frame which might be designed to be used for any number of things from Google Assistant to a dedicated camera key. For now it seems the KEY2 will come in just one color, but the KEYone was eventually released in a second color option so there is always the chance the KEY2 will get the same treatment down the line. </p>

<p> You Can Now Get The BlackBerry KEY2 LE In Atomic, Champagne Colors </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 LE is now available in the US in new Atomic and Champagne colors. Those preferring the Atomic model with its eye-catching red can pick one up exclusively from Best Buy, while Champagne and its luxurious gold flavor can be picked up either from Best Buy or Amazon. In terms of pricing, both new colors are being sold through Best Buy at $499.99, although Amazon is currently offering the Champagne version for just $449.99 (Amazon). In either case, you are paying more for the new colors as the original model in Slate launched in the US at $399.99. The BlackBerry KEY2 LE is sold as unlocked device and will work on any GSM network including AT&T and T-Mobile. </p>
<p> Originally shown off at IFA earlier in the year, the KEY2 LE is meant to be an affordable version of the BlackBerry KEY2. There are a few differences to take note of, including a lighter polycarbonate frame and a soft textured back. Although the biggest changes come in terms of internal hardware with the KEY2 LE coming equipped with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a Snapdragon 636 SoC, and a 3,000 mAh capacity battery. Another major change is in the camera department as while both the standard KEY2 and LE models come with a dual camera setup, the LE features 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel sensors. These changes allowed the device to remain inexpensive and easily accessible without compromising too much on the design of the original KEY2. Otherwise, buyers can expect the rest of the specs, as well as the experience in general to remain unchanged, including the same display and the physical keyboard. </p>
<p> The inclusion of a physical keyboard is a unique feature that you will not see on any other smartphone today and one that is fairly symbolic of the BlackBerry Mobile brand in general. Although as these newer BlackBerry Mobile-branded phones coming running on Android, they now offer the use of a physical keyboard along with access to the wealth of apps and games available from the Google Play Store. This availability coupled with the additional security and quick updates associated with BlackBerry Mobile, makes the brand's smartphones a fairly unique proposition with the LE model the most affordable entry point. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 LE Coming Soon As More Affordable KEY2 Model </p>
<p> TCL Communication is planning to follow up on its recently released BlackBerry KEY2 with the KEY2 LE, another Android-powered smartphone that's likely to be a more affordable variant of the KEYone successor. A device identified by the model number BBE100-5 has been certified by the United States Federal Communications Commission earlier this week, with its product label shot clearly revealing the "BlackBerry KEY2 LE" moniker. The handset in question has been in development for over half a year and is code-named "Luna," according to a number of previous reports. </p>
<p> Known industry insider Evan Blass shared one real-life image of what's assumed to be the same device earlier this month, albeit its official name remained unreported until now. The smartphone is said to be using the same form factor as the original KEY2 and should hence feature a 4.5-inch screen with an unconventional 3:2 aspect ratio. It's also expected to debut in blue, red, and copper variants, with a black model possibly also being on the cards. A device with a seemingly related model number BBG100-1 has been spotted in the database of phone benchmarking service Geekbench in May, having been listed as featuring Qualcomm's Snapdragon 625 system-on-chip and 4GB of RAM. That particular spec combination is found inside the 2017 BlackBerry KEYone, whereas the newer KEY2 uses the Snapdragon 660 and 6GB of RAM. </p>
<p> Android 8.1 Oreo is also likely to be part of the KEY2 LE package, together with a physical QWERTY/QWERTZ keyboard, as is the case with the KEY2. While most contemporary BlackBerry handsets are manufactured by TCL, the Canadian technology company is still the one that's largely in charge of their software, so the KEY2 LE is still expected to place a major focus on mobile security and enterprise-oriented features. The BlackBerry mobile brand is presently enjoying a global presence and while it isn't setting any sales records yet, several TCL officials recently said the Chinese firm is satisfied with the commercial performance of its Android handsets. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 LE Is Finally Available For Purchase In The US </p>
<p> In short: The BlackBerry KEY2 LE is finally available for purchasing, after being announced about a month and a half ago at IFA in Berlin. The BlackBerry KEY2 LE is technically a KEY2 Lite, even though TCL and BlackBerry Mobile aren't referring to it as such. It's a cheaper BlackBerry smartphone, and the cheapest that it has sold a BlackBerry for since it switched to Android. The BlackBerry KEY2 LE is priced at $449.99, which is a full $200 cheaper than the regular KEY2. So what are you missing out on with the KEY2 LE versus the KEY2? Well the biggest thing is the keyboard shortcuts and using the keyboard as a trackpad. On the KEY2 LE, the keyboard essentially only functions as a keyboard, and nothing else. So if you liked using the keyboard as a trackpad for scrolling through apps and webpages, well that is not available here. The other major difference is in the build quality. Instead of having an aluminum frame, the KEY2 LE sports a plastic one, but this allows BlackBerry to put out some pretty interesting colors on the KEY2 LE, like the red. There is still a fingerprint sensor here, which might surprise some people. It is still located in the spacebar, as it is on the KEY2, which is a nice place to put it, as it's easier to unlock your phone without picking it up. </p>
<p> The other differences here are in the specs. It does sport the same 4.5-inch 1080×2160 resolution display, but where it skimps out is on the processor. The KEY2 LE sports a Snapdragon 636 instead of the Snapdragon 660 that is in the KEY2. That isn't a huge difference, if we're being honest. The 600-series processors are all pretty similar in performance, and BlackBerry Mobile is using the Snapdragon 600 platform because it is really good with battery life, without sacrificing performance. Something that BlackBerries were known for, before it moved to Android. The KEY2 LE also comes with 4GB of RAM versus the 6GB on the KEY2. The last difference here is in the battery capacity. There's a 3000mAh capacity battery here, which is significantly smaller than the 3500mAh capacity in the KEY2. But this should still last you all day, seeing as the Snapdragon 636 isn't as fast as the Snapdragon 660 and will use less power. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Background: Last year, BlackBerry really made its comeback to Android, by launching the KEYone. This was the first true physical keyboard-touting BlackBerry smartphone running on Android. Sure there was the BlackBerry PRIV before that, but it was a slider smartphone, so not quite the same thing. It was also one of the first smartphones that was also made by TCL, under the BlackBerry Mobile brand. There were a handful of DTEK smartphones made in 2016, from TCL, but that was just taking already-made smartphones and slapping BlackBerry software and logos on it. The KEYone sported an actual BlackBerry keyboard, since it was able to utilize BlackBerry's patents to really make the keyboard work like the old school BlackBerries. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEYone was pretty popular, but many were waiting on the KEY2, and it improved in all of the necessary areas. Which was mostly the camera and some performance issues. The KEY2 also raised the price, while doubling RAM and storage to 6GB and 64GB respectively. But even at $649, many believed that the KEY2 was too expensive, merging into that "high-end" space, even though many believed that because it had a Snapdragon 660 inside, that it was not a flagship device. BlackBerry Mobile also heard the calls for making a cheaper KEY2 smartphone, and brought out the KEY2 LE. For many, the KEY2 LE does cut a few corners, but not too many corners. It keeps everything that really makes this a BlackBerry, as well as keeping the specs as high as possible, with the Snapdragon 636 and 4GB of RAM here. And at $449, this is a really good option for those that want a physical keyboard on their smartphone in 2018. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Impact: The BlackBerry KEY2 LE is a great smartphone to pick up for a number of reasons. Firstly, because it is a well-made smartphone that won't lag (and does get updates pretty quickly), without costing a grand. In fact, it's a less than half of that. BlackBerry is pretty good with updates these days, though BlackBerry does focus more on security updates than on actual software updates. So you're more likely to get the latest security patch than to get the next version of Android in a relatively short amount of time. But then again, that is also what made BlackBerry famous, for how secure their devices were. And BlackBerry Mobile is still touting these smartphones as great for businesses and its enterprise consumers, as it is able to control these devices through a centralized system and keep them all protected with the DTEK app on the device. This is important, with all of the unsecured smartphones out there, and how many exploits also exist right now. For those companies that give out smartphones to their employees to use for work, it's really scary to have those devices unsecured, as they could be lost, and that would be a very big deal for many. </p>
<p> Amazon has the BlackBerry KEY2 LE available right now. Unfortunately, it looks like it is severely backordered right now. It is currently showing that it will ship within one to three months. That time frame will likely decrease drastically over the next couple of days, seeing as the phone just became available today – after being available for pre-order for a few weeks. The good thing here is that you can still order the KEY2 LE and Amazon will ship it as soon as possible. It also appears that only the "Slate" color is currently available. The other colors are coming to the US, and were listed on Amazon before, but those appear to be out of stock for now. So if you were looking to get the red one, or gold, you may want to wait a bit before you order yours. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 LE Likely To Be Revealed August 30 </p>
<p> A new 'save the date' invite from TCL suggests a big BlackBerry Mobile announcement is coming ahead of IFA 2018, leading to speculation that the announcement is likely to be for the long-rumored BlackBerry KEY2 LE. The handset in question was recently spotted in purported real-world images just a few days ago, following benchmark test results thought to be associated with the device. Given the general lack of other leaks or rumors about a TCL-made smartphone bearing the branding, the timing here does make some sense. However, the image itself is relatively vague, only pointing to something happening with the BlackBerry brand on August 30 – one of the media days ahead of the main IFA 2018 event which is scheduled to take place from August 31 through September 5. </p>
<p> If the speculation about a budget-friendly version of BlackBerry's KEY2 $650 handset bears out, the device will be slightly smaller than its more powerful sibling. The 4.5-inch screen size and QWERTY keyboard would remain exactly the same, including its spacebar-based fingerprint scanner, but the BlackBerry KEY2 LE would measure 150.25 x 71.8 x 8.35 mm and weigh 156 grams. That would make it around a millimeter shorter and almost imperceptibly slimmer, with a weight difference of around 12 grams. However, that's effectively where the similarities end since the BlackBerry KEY2 LE is expected to offer just 4GB RAM and either 32GB or 64GB storage, compared to the 6GB and 64GB of the original KEY2. It would also bring the battery capacity down to 3,000 mAh and include a 13-megapixel primary camera sensor alongside a 5-megapixel sensor for the main camera. By contrast, the BlackBerry KEY2 features a dual 12-megapixel shooter and a battery rated at 3,500 mAh. A weaker Snapdragon 636 SoC will likely power the device instead of the Snapdragon 660 used in the previously released handset. </p>
<p> No rumors or leaks seem to have surfaced yet with regard to what price range the BlackBerry KEY2 LE might be available in, although it has been suggested that the Android-powered smartphone could ship in two color variations. One of those has been rumored to feature a red frame, which could be an accent against the more traditional matte black color scheme of the original BlackBerry KEY2. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 LE Pre-Orders Open On Amazon, Shipping October 12 </p>
<p> In short: The BlackBerry KEY2 LE that was announced IFA in August, is now available for pre-order on Amazon in the US. It is priced at $449, just as it was announced to cost a little over a month ago. Not all of the colors are available at this time, though that should change before October 12 comes around. The BlackBerry KEY2 LE is a "cheaper" version of the KEY2, and it is missing a few features like the many keyboard shortcuts, and it being made with a plastic frame instead of a metal frame. </p>
<p> Background: TCL and BlackBerry Mobile announced the KEY2 LE at IFA in Berlin in late August, as a cheaper alternative to the $699 KEY2 that it had announced over the summer. To do this it did need to cut a few corners, but it did keep the iconic QWERTY Keyboard from BlackBerry, as well as the same display. So the only real differences here is the materials used to build the KEY2 LE, as well as the keyboard, which the only difference there is the fact that you can't use it as a trackpad and the shortcuts are gone. But you can still type on it like you would a KEY2 or KEYone. There is also the Snapdragon 636 chipset under-the-hood, with 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage available. BlackBerry has stuck with the Snapdragon 600-series of chipsets because these are more battery efficient without sacrificing performance – not to mention they are also a bit cheaper. </p>
<p> Impact: The BlackBerry KEY2 LE will be available in about a week and a half, just in time for the holiday season. And at $449, it's actually a really good smartphone for those that don't want an all-screen device, or want something with a physical keyboard. The BlackBerry KEY2 LE serves both of those purposes, without costing an arm a leg like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and the Apple iPhone XS. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Lite Leaked Image Surfaces, Likely Launching Soon </p>
<p> Industry insider, Evan Blass recently released an image of the rear panel of the currently unannounced BlackBerry KEY2 Lite. The KEY2 Lite will sport a plastic build, and Blass further claimed that the handset will have a similar form-factor to the BlackBerry KEY2. In addition, and like the BlackBerry KEY2, the rear panel contains the dual rear camera setup in the upper left-hand side of the smartphone, while the LED flash is placed directly to the right of the two shooters. The device will reportedly be available in at least three color variants: copper, red, and blue. Lastly, it's likely BlackBerry Mobile will launch the smartphone either in late August or early September. </p>
<p> There are very little details available regarding the specifications of the KEY2 Lite, although a Geekbench benchmark result that appeared last May shows a BlackBerry smartphone with the model number BBG100-1 that is powered by the Snapdragon 625 chipset from the semiconductor firm, Qualcomm. This SoC also powers the KEY2's predecessor, the BlackBerry KEYone, and it is comprised of an octa-core ARM Cortex A53 64-bit CPU and the Adreno 506 GPU. Moreover, the benchmark result also states the device will likely include 4GB of RAM. In comparison, the BlackBerry KEY2 is equipped with the more powerful Snapdragon 660 chipset and it comes with 6GB of RAM. The KEY2 Lite will reportedly ship with Android 8.1 (Oreo), although users should expect that the device manufacturer's security applications will come pre-installed with the handset. </p>
<p> Given that the smartphone will likely have a similar form-factor to the more expensive KEY2, it remains to be seen how many design changes will be in effect, besides the greater use of plastic with this model. For example, the image shows that aside from the power button and the volume rocker, the right side of the device will also contain the convenience key, which is a customizable hardware button that allows users to assign up to three specific shortcuts to commonly used applications or system actions. There is no clear information available regarding the pricing of the KEY2 Lite, although it is likely the smartphone will ship at a lower price tag, compared to the BlackBerry KEY2. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Gets Fresh Coat Of Red Paint – MWC 2019 </p>
<p> TCL has announced that it is giving the BlackBerry KEY2 a fresh coat of paint. This time, it's going to be available in red. It's actually being called the BlackBerry KEY2 Red Edition. </p>
<p> The shade of red on this BlackBerry KEY2 seems to be a bit of a darker red then what is available on the KEY2 LE. It also covers the front of the device, instead of just being the frame. The keyboard is still black, but the space between the keys is red, and it looks really slick. </p>
<p> This is the same BlackBerry KEY2 that the company announced last Spring, with just a couple of differences besides the color. There is also 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the original KEY2 had an option for 128GB of storage, but that was only in a few regions. Otherwise, it is still made of Series 7 Aluminum, making it a pretty sturdy smartphone. It also has that soft-touch material on the back, which makes it much easier to hold onto, versus other smartphones on the market today. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The KEY2 still sports a 4.5-inch 1620×1080 resolution display, powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset. There is also a 3500mAh capacity battery inside, that is going to keep the KEY2 running all-day long and then some. It runs a stock version of Android Oreo and will get updated to Android Pie in the very near future. This means that there is support for things like Google Assistant and Google Lens. </p>
<p> BlackBerry's iconic physical QWERTY keyboard is on the KEY2, which makes it much easier to type out emails and replies to messages, versus a software keyboard. The KEY2 also uses each of these keys as a shortcut, which the user is able to customize to their liking. Making it simpler to open apps like Facebook and Twitter. Finally, the KEY2 also has the Convenience Key on the side, which can be mapped to any app. Allowing you to quickly open the camera, or your email app, or really anything else you might want to open up. </p>
<p> TCL and BlackBerry Mobile do routinely release new colors for its flagship smartphones, likely in an effort to sell a few more devices before the new flagship comes out. If TCL holds up to its schedule from the past two years, the KEY3 should be released in a couple of months time. Though, there haven't been many leaks for it just yet, so it may be a bit further down the road. But don't be surprised if the KEY3 does come out shortly after this Red Edition of the BlackBerry KEY2 comes out. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As far as pricing and availability goes, TCL says that the BlackBerry KEY2 Red Edition is going to be available in select markets in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle Ease. With prices of $749/£699/€779 respectively. TCL also notes that those that buy this new Red Edition of the KEY2 will also get a special edition set of red BlackBerry-branded earbuds. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 Red Edition is available for pre-order across Europe through the BlackBerry Mobile website. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Review – Your Personal Fort Knox </p>
<p> 2018’s Most Unique Smartphone, and the Gold Standard in Privacy </p>
<p> While most manufacturers have been relying on shrinking bezels and adding in notches, TCL is trying something completely different with the Blackberry KEY2. Easily the most readily identifiable smartphone in 2018, the Blackberry KEY2 is designed for folks who need all the information at their fingertips, ones that are constantly communicating with others, and power users who want as much customization as possible. Does it sacrifice too much to be considered a premium flagship smartphone in 2018? Let’s take a look. </p>
<p> Video Review </p>
<p> Specs and Box Contents </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Retailing for $650 and selling unlocked on Amazon.com, at Bestbuy stores and Bestbuy.com, the Blackberry KEY2 ships in two main colors: Black, and our review color, Silver. While the size of the Blackberry KEY2 is similar to most modern smartphones, the overall design is very much different. A 4.5-inch 1620 x 1080 resolution (434 PPI) IPS LCD display sits up front, sporting a unique 3:2 aspect ratio. Below it are a trio of capacitive touch navigation keys, and below that is a dedicated 35 key hardware keyboard, which is 20% larger than the one on the Blackberry KEYOne. </p>
<p> A front-facing fingerprint scanner is found on the spacebar. Inside is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 SoC with Adreno 512 GPU, 6GB of RAM, and a choice of 64GB or 128GB of internal storage. MicroSD cards are supported for up to 256GB of hot-swappable expandable storage, and a large 3,500mAh battery powers the experience. Android 8.1 Oreo is the OS version at launch, and a USB Type-C port with USB 3.1 speeds and Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0 is at the bottom. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the front you’ll find a single 8-megapixel fixed focus camera, while two cameras lie on the back of the device. The main rear camera is a 12-megapixel sensor with 1.28-micron size pixels and Dual Phase Detection Autofocus (Dual PDAF), behind an f/1.8 lens with 79.3-degree FoV. The secondary rear camera is a 12-megapixel sensor with 1.0-micron pixels and regular PDAF, behind an f/2.6 lens with 50-degree FoV (2x optical zoom). The aluminum chassis measures in at 151.4mm high, 71.8mm wide, and 8.5mm thin, with a rather nice weight of 168 grams. </p>
<p> Inside the box you’ll find the usual quick start guide and warranty pamphlets, as well as a SIM tray removal tool. Underneath is a QuickCharge 3.0-rated power brick (5v/3a, 9v/2a, 12v/1.5a), as well as a USB Type-A to Type-C cable. BlackBerry has also packed in a pair of black earbuds with 3.5mm jack on the end. </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Two main display trends have been converging over the past year or so: tiny bezels, and super tall screens. While the bezels around the screen aren’t huge by any means on the BlackBerry KEY2, the dedicated keyboard along the bottom completely changes the look and feel of the display, including the aspect ratio. Utilizing a 4.5-inch IPS LCD with a 3:2 aspect ratio, the display is substantially shorter and slightly more squat than the average 2018 smartphone. Given that Android is able to scale with various resolutions and aspect ratios with little problem, and you’ll find all apps and games work just fine on the BlackBerry KEY2. The issue has more to do with the look and feel of apps and games at this aspect ratio, especially if you’re used to a taller 18:9 aspect ratio. </p>
<p> Apps like social media, email and other forms of communication aren’t negatively impacted by this aspect ratio at all. Videos are certainly less enjoyable on the KEY2 than a phone with a larger/wider display. Because the aspect ratio is 3:2, you’ll find all widescreen content is letterboxed on top and bottom. It’s also slightly awkward to watch widescreen content because of the off-centered nature of the screen, which is aligned ¾ of the way to whatever side the phone is being held. This also makes it a little difficult to play games that are held in landscape orientation, as the keyboard takes up about ¼ of one side of the phone. Some portrait mode games are letterboxed on the left and right sides too, since the aspect ratio is uncommon on smartphone screens, and it can make such things slightly awkward looking at times. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The quality of the IPS LCD on the KEY2 is passable enough, but it won’t be earning any awards. Typically you’ll find an IPS LCD on a phone that’s either trying to stay in budget or is working to be ultra bright, and while this isn’t a budget-tier display, it’s not quite super bright either. Sunlight readability is decent, at best, and I struggled to see stuff on the screen at times in bright lighting conditions like these. As a whole I felt the display was a bit dim most of the time, and there’s a fair bit of light bleed from both the top and bottom of the display. Color accuracy and white balance are extremely nice, with friendly colors that look deep and contrasty, but not overly cartoony or dull, and accurate white balance as well. There’s an ever-so-slight bit of motion trailing on the display, but it’s only noticeable when looking for it, and won’t tread on most content. </p>
<p> Hardware and Build </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Just about every part of the BlackBerry KEY2 eschews 2018 design trends, and in almost every case this is a very good thing. There’s no secret that design has become a bit plain in the industry, with some decisions clearly having little foresight to potential issues that crop up in daily use, and some that are deliberately anti-consumer. Everything about the KEY2 looks and feels luxurious, smart, and even sexy at times. This is a phone that looks all business and doesn’t apologize for a minute of it. The silver color we have for review is certainly a looker, but the black model is especially gorgeous, and really looks like a mean machine that’ll catch the eye of anyone in a room. During the review period I had a number of people that immediately recognized that this was a BlackBerry phone, and all of them wanted to try it out. It’s rare anymore to have such a response from people in everyday life, but this phone certainly achieved that goal. </p>

<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS 27 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS 28 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS 29 </p>
<p> Aside from being striking, the KEY2 is an incredibly well build phone that’s easy to hold and easy to use. Along the back you’ll find a rubberized grip that’s very slip resistant, with squared off metal sides that help grip even more. This back is mostly flat, but has a slight curve to the left and right edges, tapering up to the flat sides. There’s no IP rating for water or dust resistance, so be sure to keep the phone from getting wet, because it probably won’t end up well. The phone has an average size to it when comparing to other modern smartphones, and actually comes in a little lighter than many other 2018 flagships as well. A 3.5mm audio jack is on top, while a USB Type-C port is in the usual place on the bottom, right a single speaker to the side, despite the faux speaker grill being to its left. All buttons are metal and are located on the right side, with a volume rocker near the top of the right side, textured powered button below that, and convenience key below that. </p>
<p> Keyboard </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Apart from having a design that’s very un-2018-like, the KEY2 very prominently displays something no other phone in 2018 has launched with thus far: a back-lit physical keyboard. While phones with physical keyboards have become unicorns, without a doubt, there are still plenty of people who would prefer such a thing over a virtual keyboard. BlackBerry isn’t just content with slapping a physical keyboard on and calling it a day though, they’ve further improved the design from last year’s KEYone, including a 20% larger design, 20% higher keys, and a new Speed Key that’s never been on a BlackBerry phone before. It’s been quite a few years since I’ve spent any significant amount of time with a phone that has a physical keyboard, having previously reviewed the BlackBerry Priv back at the end of 2015, and my thumbs are clearly not used to having to apply force while typing. </p>

<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS 11 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS 34 keyboard use </p>
<p> The basic typing experience is similar to a virtual keyboard in that words will be automatically corrected, and can be un-corrected with a quick press of the backspace button. The keyboard functions almost like a touchscreen in a few ways though, and a flick up will automatically choose the predicted text in the software prediction bar at the bottom of the screen. Likewise, flicking to the left anywhere on the keyboard will delete single words at a time, and double-tapping anywhere on the keyboard will bring up a row of software arrow keys, allowing quick and easy movement of the cursor between letters. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The keyboard will even act like a touchscreen when in any app that scrolls vertically, such as a web page, keeping the screen from getting all smudgy. Main keys functions are colored in white text, while the smaller light-grey font characters are activated by pressing the alt button. Additional symbols are located in a separate virtual keyboard panel, brought up by pressing the symbol key at the bottom right. Pressing this key will cycle through two pages of symbols, and a third press will put the panel away. </p>
<p> A brand new feature to the KEY2 is the Speed key, located in the bottom right, represented by a grid of 9 dots. This key, when pressed in conjunction with any letter key on the keyboard will quickly launch any assigned shortcut at any time on the phone. Short and long-pressing keys are two different actions too, meaning you can assign a whopping 52 total shortcuts. Google's idea of double-swiping up in Android P to bring up the app drawer certainly makes accessing every app quicker than what's available on phones without a physical keyboard, but BlackBerry has everyone beat with speed and ease of launching apps and tasks quickly, and the beauty is that any action can be assigned to these keys as well. For instance, you might want to open your email inbox with a short-press on the letter i, while you can compose a new message immediately by long-pressing the letter i instead. The possibilities are near endless, and since it's totally customizable, you can change it up for what works best in your life. </p>
<p> Security and Performance </p>
<p> BlackBerry is marketing the KEY2 as the most secure Android phone on the market, and it's any reason given the amount of customization they've added to Android in terms of security and privacy features. Permissions have been part of Android for some time now, giving users the ability to allow or deny any system-specific permission for apps on a single permission basis. It's likely that most users normally hit allow when asked for these permissions without having a real understanding of what they do or how the app accesses their information. BlackBerry's DTEK software runs in the background at all times and helps users understand why apps are asking for information, and even prompts users before the app can even ask for permission, warning them that something is about to do so. </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots dtek 3 </p>
<p> In addition to this, BlackBerry's DTEK app presents an easy-to-understand hub of information that not only details important security settings like data encryption, developer options, and operating system integrity, to name a few but also includes ultra-detailed app permission tracking. This is something no other manufacturer on the market does, and it includes super granular tracking of what permissions each app has asked for, how many times it has requested permission, the information the app accessed, including specifics as to how many contacts were read or what location it picked you up at, as well as a detailed timeline of every single time the app accessed said info. It's dizzying, to say the least, and offers more information than ever, allowing users to track where their information has gone and what app accessed it. </p>
<p> DTEK will also alert users of apps trying to access permissions in the background, especially when it's something sensitive like listening in on the microphone or using the camera without your specific interaction. Aside from tracking what's happening on the phone, BlackBerry gives users a way to more proactively protect their privacy and personal data too. Private locker is a place where users can go to grant an extra layer of protection to individual files and folders, such as photos or notes. Private photos can be taken directly from the camera's viewfinder by pressing on the fingerprint scanner instead of the shutter button, and the photo is automatically sent to the private locker instead of the built-in gallery. Likewise, you'll find Firefox Focus is preinstalled and accessible from this hub, with an always-on private browsing mode that also blocks ads and tracking cookies. </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots redactor </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots notifications 1 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots notifications 2 </p>
<p> Private locker can be easily accessed via the notification shade, found in the quick toggles panel on top, instantly accessed via specific fingerprint straight from the lock screen, and can even be hidden in the app drawer too for extra security. Any app can also be included within private locker as well, for instance, your favorite messaging app can be put into app locker so that it always requires your fingerprint to be scanned before the app is launched. BlackBerry also allows users to change the icon and name of any app installed, so you can easily hide apps you'd rather not have others see, as well as protect the contents of that app in case anyone so happens to open it. Since this is only biometrically locked and not PIN locked, there's little worry of it ever being accessed by someone who simply has your phone and your PIN or password. </p>
<p> In addition to these incredible privacy settings, BlackBerry also provides ways to protect information that's directly on screen in two meaningful ways. Privacy Screen is a way to protect sensitive information on screen from prying eyes nearby, blacking out all but 15-20% of the screen. Privacy screen can be accessed through the notification shade's quick settings panel, or by swiping three fingers down at any time. This visible bar can be resized and moved around the screen at will, and the blacked out part can be made partially transparent, if you so choose. </p>
<p> BlackBerry also offers a way of quickly marking out private sections of on-screen information before sharing a screenshot, also accessed via the notification shade. This brings up an easy-to-use interface where users can draw a black box with their finger to black out any sensitive information, including an easy sharing button at the bottom when everything is good to go for sending out to the world. There's even a pre-installed BlackBerry Password Keeper tool that's a system-level app, helping users keep track of passwords and provide automatic entry, all while remaining a secure system app that can't be easily modified. This will even back up passwords to Google Drive, using a secure encryption key, so that your passwords are safely and securely backed up for future use. </p>
<p> Wireless Connectivity, Sound and Battery Life </p>
<p> As an unlocked phone, the BlackBerry KEY2 works on almost all GSM networks worldwide, including AT&T and T-Mobile in the US. In our testing, the KEY2 had better signal strength than the average smartphone, and calls were able to be made and easily heard even in locations where other phones had trouble keeping the audio clear. VoLTE is supported by the phone but has to be enabled carrier-side, and at the time of review was not enabled on T-Mobile US. There appears to be no support for WiFi Calling, which is a missed opportunity, to say the least. </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots battery 3 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots battery 1 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots battery 2 </p>
<p> BlackBerry has outfitted the KEY2 with everything it needs to output quality sound, no matter your audio device preference. A 3.5mm audio jack up top is available for existing wired audio peripherals, and the USB Type-C port on the bottom works great for all-digital wired audio. Bluetooth 5.0 includes better range and bandwidth than previous versions of the Bluetooth spec, and Android Oreo standardized the availability of all high-quality Bluetooth codecs such as aptX, aptX HD, and LDAC, so you can have ultra high-quality sound even using wireless speakers or headphones. The speaker on the bottom is fairly average, with sound quality typical of a single bottom-firing speaker, but it's quite loud at the least and is able to be heard even in a noisy room. </p>
<p> Battery life of the phone is nothing short of stellar, and we never had an issue getting through a full day on a single charge. The Snapdragon 660 SoC is a lower power SoC when compared to the Snapdragon 845 that can be found in most 2018 flagships, and combined with the large 3,500mAh battery and smaller 4.5-inch screen, you're all but guaranteed to get at least a full day out of the phone, no matter how long you use it. Some folks will likely find that 2-day battery life is more than achievable, as I had a number of days where the phone ended the day at greater than 60% battery, even with moderate daily use. </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots battery 6 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots battery 7 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots battery 4 </p>
<p> QuickCharge 3.0 is supported for fast top-ups, using any Qualcomm-approved charger or the one that comes with the phone. Something quite unique is a feature Boost Mode, which is selectable just after plugging the phone in and shuts off various services in order to help the phone get a quicker charge. The Power Center app helps manage battery and memory usage of every app installed on the phone, as well as provide a neat and easy checklist of things to do in order to keep battery life at its best. </p>
<p> Software </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 is easily one of the most highly customizable phones out there, not only allowing users to change the look and feel of the launcher but customize almost every aspect of its daily organization and functions. Aside from the privacy functions that were discussed above, which will certainly change how many people access information on their screens on a daily basis, as well as the keyboard and its numerous convenience shortcuts, BlackBerry also includes three main areas of convenience for users to get things done: BlackBerry Hub, a slide-out sidebar, and the new Convenience Key. </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots convenience 1 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots convenience 2 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots convenience home </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots convenience meeting </p>
<p> New to the KEY2 is the convenience Key, which brings up 3 user-specific shortcuts when pressed. Any three apps, shortcuts, or system actions can be assigned to this key, and up to three additional profiles can be added for specific situations: while at home, while in the car, and while in a meeting. These situations are determined by a specific WiFi connection for home, specific Bluetooth connection for the car, and any meeting entry in the calendar for the meeting preset. While these specific situations will probably a bit niche in their use, having three immediate actions, in addition to the shortcuts provided by the keyboard, once again highlight BlackBerry's desire to let users to completely customize their phones use and function to their liking. </p>

<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots gestures 1 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots hub </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots launcher 1 </p>
<p> The swipe-out sidebar isn't anything new, but it's well worth noting since this is a BlackBerry-specific function. Within this slide-out menu, accessible anywhere on the phone by swiping inward on the tab on the side of the screen, you'll find a quick way to check your calendar, read messages propagated through the BlackBerry Hub, check to-dos, communicate with contacts, and see any custom widgets setup as if it were a home screen. The more BlackBerry hub is set up and functioning with all your communication needs, the better this section will be. Hub has been around for quite some time and presents a single way to manage all your points of contact, including text messaging, emails, any chat app on the phone, social media accounts, and plenty more. Having the ability to not only read all of these in one location but also to post straight from here, is simply brilliant. </p>
<p> BlackBerry's excellent launcher still functions the same as before too, with a unique way of accessing widgets that other launchers don't provide. Many people keep direct shortcuts on their homescreen instead of utilizing the app drawer or placing widgets on here like a desktop, so BlackBerry has found a way to please both sets of parties without taking away functionality. Swiping up on the icon of any app that has a widget will bring that widget up in a floating box, allowing for quick one-swipe access to more information without needing to open the app. Apps with more than one widget will ask for a default upon first swipe, and these apps with widgets are represented with three dots underneath the icon, meaning you won't be needlessly swiping on icons that don't have increased functionality. </p>
<p> Camera Software </p>
<p> BlackBerry's camera design, as a whole, is quite excellent and is both easy to use and powerful at the same time. Along the bottom, you'll find a typical row of icons, including a dedicated shutter button and button to toggle between the front and rear-facing cameras, as well as a button to switch between modes. Clicking this mode switching brings up a small row of 6 icons, giving quick one-thumb access to all modes without causing annoyance the way any camera interfaces with swipeable modes often do. While this icon's function isn't immediately obvious, it's simple enough to figure out what it does on the first click, and its readily-accessible place makes it a generally good UX choice. </p>
<p> While the camera software launches very quickly, switching between common modes like photo and video takes a bit too long. This isn't because of a performance issue, rather the fact that all modes are found in this mode drawer, and there's no quick way to move between simple photo and video modes without having to open the tray and click the icon for the desired mode. On the positive, this grid of icons is always the same, no matter the mode, and you'll always know where to find the video, photo, portrait, slow-mo, panorama, or scanner modes, as the icons' positions never change, meaning muscle memory will eventually kick in, making mode switching faster over time. Still, a dedicated shutter and record button would alleviate this need for the two most commonly used modes. </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots camera 1 </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots camera manual </p>
<p> Blackberry KEY2 AH NS Screenshots camera modes </p>
<p> Manual mode is a bit more hidden than is probably necessary, but once enabled, provides an excellent way to control every aspect of the photo-taking experience. Within settings is the option to switch between auto and manual control modes, adding a left-oriented vertical row of icons for each manual setting. The labels for each setting are extremely clean and clear, leaving no room for misinterpretation, and provide a quick one-touch way of controlling all manual photo settings without having to go into a separate manual mode. Anyone who prefers manually adjusting any of these attributes, even if only once in a blue moon, should definitely keep these controls on screen, as they provide the easiest way to quickly adjust important settings at a moment's notice. </p>
<p> Something special to BlackBerry's camera design is Private Capture, which goes hand-in-hand with the Private Locker functionality described in the security section of this review. Private Capture's functionality isn't terribly obvious at first, but once you figure it out, becomes an easy way to take photos that might be considered private for any reason, without having to switch modes or open another app. Pressing the standard white circular shutter button on the viewfinder takes a normal photo, which is stored in the phone's normal photo gallery app (Google Photos by default), but a private photo can be taken by simply touching the space bar's fingerprint scanner instead. This places the photo within the Private Locker on the phone, which is inaccessible to anyone or any app that's not placed in the Private Locker, and keeps prying eyes away from sensitive photos. </p>
<p> Camera Performance and Results </p>
<p> While the BlackBerry KEY2's raises the bar for quality on BlackBerry phones as a whole, the overall quality doesn't quite match up to what other phones in the same price range can provide. As BlackBerry's first dual-camera setup, this is a step in the right direction for quality hardware, and even the software design itself is quite good. Utilizing a dual-pixel phase detection autofocus method, the KEY2 instantly focuses on any subject, and can switch between subjects at a moment's notice. In fact accurate focusing is just as important as fast focusing, and it's in these two key areas where the BlackBerry KEY2 shines. </p>
<p> It's just a shame the rest of the package doesn't shine quite this much, as you'll find pretty average dynamic range as a whole, decent overall color accuracy, and details which are a bit softer than what we're used to seeing on most phones. Zooming in during good lighting conditions shows processing that's a bit heavy on noise removal, and tends to muddy details a bit. This tends to be most apparent on objects further away than a few feet, but macro shots and other close-up photos turn out just fine in this regard. </p>
<p> The secondary lens is a 50mm 2x zoom lens, which allows for optical zooming when pressing the 1x/2x button on the viewfinder, but needs to be done in the viewfinder to take advantage of this feature. Surprisingly the advantage of zooming in ahead of time isn't quite as pronounced on the KEY2 as it is on many other phones that feature a secondary sensor with a zoom lens, and while there's certainly a difference between cropping a standard shot after taking the picture versus one taken using the 2x zoom in the software viewfinder, it's not particularly noticeable unless you look very closely. The quality of the overall photo stays about the same no matter the lighting conditions, although this secondary sensor has smaller pixels, and as a result, has slightly less dynamic range than the standard sensor. </p>
<p> Dynamic range, as said before, is a bit lacking, and you'll find the more contrasty the scene, the darker things tend to be. As a whole the phone tends to underexpose quite often, resulting in very few blown out highlights, but lots of missing shadow detail as a result. This is also a problem in lower lighting conditions, where the sensor clearly struggles to pull in enough light to keep a scene bright without introducing too much noise. As a whole, the camera prefers higher ISO over long shutter speeds, which is a positive note for keeping moving objects sharp as well as reducing hand jitter, but the heavy noise reduction process further muddies up the details in these kinds of shots. </p>
<p> Low light performance in general leaves quite a bit to be desired, as a result, often ending up in dark, very soft photos with obvious traces of heavy noise removal throughout. In our testing, there were very few lower light shots that came out looking decent and relatively few that could be considered good looking when compared to other flagships on the market. There were a few times when the software would pause after pressing the shutter button in semi-low light, resulting in a blurry image because I had moved my hand thinking it already took the shot. This wasn't super common, but it did happen a handful of times. </p>
<p> The new dual-camera setup unlocks portrait mode, and this second camera utilizes a 50mm FoV, meaning an effective 2x optical zoom. Portrait mode is generally quite nice looking, although the phone has to be brought back a fair bit since that second lens is a "zoom" lens. Edge detection is generally good, although there were a few times where it didn't get the edges quite right, resulting in a hazy effect around the hair or other finer details. </p>
<p> While the front-facing camera has the potential to take some rather good photos, some major focusing issues kept it from bring truly useful most of the time. Many shots focused on the background rather than the foreground; a curious software decision when shots from a front-facing camera are typically for selfies. HDR is supported on this sensor, and does a good job of balancing shots as a whole, making these focusing issues all the more a shame. As a result, front-facing shots look quite good in thumbnail form, but fall apart immediately upon enlarging. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2's main rear-camera lens is wider than most; something that becomes readily apparent when comparing directly next to another flagship smartphone in 2018. As a result you'll find more visual information is fit into the frame, and at 4K/30FPS, there's plenty of detail to go around. There's higher 60FPS recording support at 1080p and 720p, and standard 120FPS slow-motion recording at 720p. Overall dynamic range of videos is good, and colors pop nicely with excellent contrast. The sensors are only optically stabilized at 4K, meaning you'll definitely notice motion like walking in the form of bumps and shakes. A combination EIS/OIS is available at 1080p or 720p if more stable recording is a necessity, and looks considerably smoother than 4K video, even if it's missing the extra detail. </p>
<p> The Good </p>
<p> Unique look and feel </p>
<p> High quality build with uncommon materials in 2018 </p>
<p> Display aspect ratio doesn't work best with media consumption </p>
<p> Camera quality overall doesn't hold up with other flagships </p>
<p> No ARCore support </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> In a sea of nearly identical black slabs, TCL has crafted 2018’s most unique smartphone. It’s unapologetically Blackberry, and that’s the true beauty of this device. Blackberry says it best themselves; this phone is built for productivity, for folks who type all the time, people who want to keep track of everything going on, but aren’t focused on mobile gaming or watching HDR content on a giant screen. This phone is for the doers, the posters, the social media buffs, and anyone who’s just looking to keep their information safe in a world that’s constantly compromised. Blackberry’s new masterpiece is here, and it’s easily one of 2018’s most fantastic phones in every way it tries to be. </p>

<p> Android News / BlackBerry KEY2 With Dual Rear Cameras & Keyboard Announced: Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> BlackBerry KEY2 With Dual Rear Cameras & Keyboard Announced: Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 pairs the brand's first dual-camera setup with a premium physical keyboard. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 smartphone is now official after having been announced today at an event in New York. The KEY2 represents a continuation from the company's KEYone smartphone, although TCL has made it clear the KEY2 is vastly different from the KEYone – due to the number of “firsts” that have been included this time around. Of course, one element that remains unchanged from the KEYone, and likely the most iconic and identifiable trait of a BlackBerry phone (Android or otherwise) is the inclusion of a physical keyboard. Something which inevitably shapes other aspects of the phone, such as the display, its functionality, and overall design. </p>
<p> Besides the keyboard and its knock-on effects, other areas where the KEY2 hopes to excel in is the camera department and security. The latter of which is another common aspect when it comes to BlackBerry-branded smartphones with security now positioned as one of the key selling points for the brand. As a result, you can expect many of the usual security-focused features, along with a few BlackBerry-specific ones as well. In addition to confirming the specs, design, and unique functionalities, TCL has also confirmed availability and pricing for its latest keyboard-centric smartphone, the BlackBerry KEY2. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Specs </p>
<p> Like its predecessor, the BlackBerry KEY2 is a mid-range smartphone fueled by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 64-bit octa-core processor (clocked at 2.2 GHz). The device sports a Corning Gorilla Glass 3-protected 4.5-inch 1620 x 1080 IPS LCD display, resulting in a 3:2 display aspect ratio, and a 434 PPI. The phone’s physical QWERTY keyboard is backlit, and features an integrated fingerprint scanner. On the back of the phone, you will find two 12-megapixel cameras, and a quad-tone LED flash. The phone’s main camera setup is capable of recording 4K video at 30fps, while the main sensor has 1.28um pixels, and comes with an f/1.8 aperture lens. The secondary lens offers 1.0um pixels, and a f/2.6 aperture lens. An 8-megapixel camera sits on the front, and comes with a selfie flash, and is capable of recording full HD video at 30fps. </p>
<p> Android 8.1 (Oreo) comes pre-installed on the BlackBerry KEY2, while the device is powered by a non-removable 3,500 mAh capacity battery. In addition, the KEY2 supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging technology. A 3.5mm headphone jack is also included in the package, as is 6GB of RAM and 64GB / 128GB of storage (expandable up to 256GB via a microSD card). Both single and dual SIM version of the phone have been announced, and the KEY2 supports a wide array of 4G LTE bands with listed support for India, China, Canada, Europe, and the US. This handset comes with HD Audio for improved audio playback, and a USB Type-C port for charging. In terms of the physical properties, the BlackBerry KEY2 measures 151.4 x 71.8 x 8.5 mm, although its weight is still unknown. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Hardware & Design </p>
<p> BlackBerry is easily an iconic name in the smartphone industry and just as much as the name BlackBerry is iconic, the design of the BlackBerry KEY2 is being touted as an iconic design, one that is recognizable and indicative of a device carrying the name. It also looks similar to the BlackBerry KEYone, which is no doubt part of the design choices made by the team who created the look for the new phone. BlackBerry Mobile says the KEY2 is “deliberately designed for today’s modern smartphone user,” and although the design is being hailed as iconic, it’s also being represented as a forward advancement in the series, one that is in a sense, evolutionary – which also suggests that there may be future KEY devices following the KEY2. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As this is a KEY device, the most prominent design focuses are going to revolve around the keys, and by association the keyboard. BlackBerry Mobile has updated the keyboard to make typing on the go easier, more fluid, and just feel overall better compared to the previous version. This includes raising the height of the keys on the keyboard by 20-percent which is said to help typing feel more comfortable. There’s also a new key to interact with which will help users access shortcuts more quickly. This is called the Speed Key, and as the name suggests it’s entirely for the purpose of making it faster to launch apps and other actions on the device. Speed is not just about going fast, but also about efficiency, and for BlackBerry users, efficiency is likely to be a key factor in why they choose this device. That’s what the Speed Key aims to present the user with. </p>
<p> Just like last year’s KEYone, the BlackBerry KEY2 will come in a matte black finish in addition to the silver model, meaning consumers will have more than one option for personalization. The device is also built with materials that give it a somewhat durable yet sleek look. The frame, for example, is built with series 7 aluminum, and the back is made from a soft touch material for added grip, while the diamond pattern on it adds a bit of style to the overall design of the phone. Rounding out the materials used, the KEY2 has a scratch-resistant display made with 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass, and providing users with a screen that is mostly edge-to-edge. Between the use of the series 7 aluminum and the soft touch back, display, and even the dual rear-facing camera (which is a first for BlackBerry devices in general), BlackBerry says the KEY2 has a cleaner look and feel without having to sacrifice on durability. </p>
<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Cameras </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The KEY2 is the first-ever BlackBerry device to be equipped with a dual-camera setup, featuring two 12-megapixel sensors which promise faster autofocusing, improved white balance, more effective stabilization, and better versatility compared to the KEYone. The main sensor has a pixel size of 1.28 microns and sits behind an f/1.8 lens capable of capturing a 79.3-degree field of view. The supporting module comes with a standard pixel size of 1 micron, featuring an f/2.8 lens with a 50-degree FOV mounted on top of it. The setup supports HDR and 4K video recording at 30 frames per second, utilizes a dual-LED (dual-tone) flash unit, and is generally the best imaging system TCL delivered ever since taking over the BlackBerry smartphone brand early last year. The front camera of the KEY2 uses an 8-megapixel sensor, supports LCD flash, and can record 1080p videos at 30fps, thus being on par with most other selfie modules in the mid-range price bracket. </p>
<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Battery </p>
<p> Batteries are likely the least evolved component for smartphones, at least in the sense that they still use the same exact battery types that they did years ago. However they do come with new features from time to time and the BlackBerry KEY2 is giving users a taste of that. One of the big focuses with smartphones these days is intelligence, and the KEY2 is offering users a more intelligent battery to assist them in making sure the device is always charged up and ready to use when they need it the most. This new intelligent battery feature works in such a way that it learns from the charging habits of the device owner, so that down the line it can eventually recommend the best times to charge up the battery. While there’s nothing wrong with plugging the device in even if it doesn’t really need much of a charge, that may still be a waste of ten to twenty minutes for some people. Now with the KEY2, users can be alerted to an opportune time for charging and potentially avoid using up a time during the day. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is of course helped by the inclusion of battery that has a large capacity in the first place as the KEY2 comes with a 3,500 mAh capacity battery. So in addition to the user knowing the best times to plug the device in, they’ll also have a lot of battery life to begin with. Quick Charge 3.0 support is also present which is going to ensure that the battery charges up quickly. Speaking of long battery life, BlackBerry Mobile and TCL boast the KEY2 should be able to sustain owners for around two days. This, in and of itself, is nothing revolutionary as many devices from tons of brands have claimed to offer two-day battery life to users, but all the same this is still a noteworthy trait for anyone who decides the KEY2 is the device for them as the suggestion here is battery life is not one of the main concerns KEY2 owners will have to contend with. In addition, the KEY2 also uses USB Type-C for charging and data transfer, and while this isn’t directly a battery trait, it ties into the battery as USB Type-C is yet another element that will help with faster charge times. Whether or not there is anything revolutionary with the battery, it’s clear that the KEY2 was designed to be for the user who values battery life as one of the most important parts of the device. </p>
<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Security </p>
<p> BlackBerry Mobile has gone all out with security on the KEY2, which is to be expected, given that is what made the BlackBerry brand popular. The KEY2 includes the DTEK app which has a suite of security and privacy features available to keep users safe. This is an application that BlackBerry developed with the sole purpose of making it easier for users to secure their smartphone. DTEK shows users at a glance how secure their device is, and what they can do to make it even more secure, with a score. With DTEK you can do things like viewing which apps are accessing your information and manage app permissions. New with the KEY2, the DTEK app also includes a new Proactive Health check, this allows the user to scan the device for potential vulnerabilities and keep the device safe. BlackBerry has also improved Locker this time around. Locker allows users to keep certain photos and documents secured behind a password. So if you have work-related documents on your phone, you can keep them safe on the KEY2. The Locker app can only be accessed with a fingerprint or a passcode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 is also in the Android Enterprise Recommended program. This allows business owners to buy the KEY2 for employees and not have to worry about any security issues, as the KEY2 is one of the most secure Android smartphones on the market. Being part of this program means that BlackBerry is pushing out timely security updates, at least one major operating system update, and it has business-ready hardware features. BlackBerry is also announcing that the KEY2 supports Android’s zero-touch enrollment, that makes it easier for large organizations to manage corporate-owned mobile devices. This is important for larger corporations that have hundreds of corporate-owned smartphones on its network, as the IT department is able to push out updates, new apps, and such, much easier. Those that are worried about being tracked while browsing the web, BlackBerry has included the Mozilla Firefox Focus web browser, which is a private web browser that doesn’t track users. BlackBerry has not included facial recognition here, and that is likely because it is not that secure – and that’s what BlackBerry is going for. But there is a fingerprint sensor, and it is still in the space bar like it was on the predecessor to the KEY2. This means you can use your fingerprint to secure your device, which is going to be much more intuitive and easier than using a passcode or password. </p>
<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Variants </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 comes in two different variants, though both of them ship with 6GB of RAM. The more affordable KEY2 variant features 64GB of storage, while the more expensive model will get you 128GB of storage. In addition to offering different storage setups, BlackBerry also announced that both single SIM and dual SIM BlackBerry KEY2 models will be available, and their availability will be market-dependent. Aside from these differentials, and different regional 4G LTE band support, consumers can expect to see the same design and specs on all BlackBerry KEY2 options. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> BlackBerry KEY2 Availability </p>
<p> TCL will begin shipping the BlackBerry KEY2 this month, globally. With the price set for $649 in the US, $829 in Canada, €649 in Europe, and £579 in the UK. Other markets were not mentioned. For the US, carriers were also not mentioned, so the BlackBerry KEY2 is likely going to be available as an unlocked smartphone, and not a carrier smartphone. So far there has been no word on pre-orders, though it is expected they will open soon enough. </p>

<p> BlackBerry KEYone Getting Android Oreo, Canada First In Line </p>
<p> TCL has started rolling out Android 8.0 Oreo update to the BlackBerry KEYone, and it seems like Canada is first in line to get it. The update had already started rolling out to Canadian KEYone devices, according to the info provided to MobileSyrup, and it is rolling to both unlocked and carrier-locked devices, in case you were wondering, at least when it comes to Canada. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEYone will notify you once the update is available on your device, but you can always head to settings and check manually, if you’d like. That being said, this update will probably hit other countries in the near future, but for the time being, it’s exclusive to Canada. The BlackBerry KEYone was originally announced back in February last year, and it launched with Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box, with BlackBerry’s launcher on top of it. Well, the Android 8.0 Oreo update will bring a number of new features and changes to the device, including the Picture-in-Picture mode, some rather subtle design changes, new battery optimizations, and so on, basically all the changes that are rolling out with stock Android 8.0 Oreo will be available on the BlackBerry KEYone, excluding those Pixel-exclusive ones, of course. Some BlackBerry apps and services will be a part of the offering still, though, as expected, such as the BlackBerry Hub, for example. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEYone is a predecessor to the BlackBerry KEY2 which got introduced earlier this year. The KEYone comes with a full QWERTY keyboard, while it sports that rubberized back in order not to slip around in-hand. The phone features a 4.5-inch 1620 x 1080 display, 3GB / 4GB of RAM and 32GB / 64GB of storage. The Snapdragon 625 64-bit octa-core SoC fuels the device, while a 3,500mAh battery is included in the package as well. If you’d like to know more about the phone, check out our full review. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / BlackBerry Launcher Updated With New Gesture Functionality </p>
<p> BlackBerry Launcher Updated With New Gesture Functionality </p>
<p> BlackBerry Launcher for Android has received a new update which allows users to swipe down from any black spot on the display in order to see their notifications. Similar functionality has been available on a ton of other launchers for years now, though on most launchers you don’t even need to swipe down from a blank spot, swiping down from wherever on the home screen brings down the notifications tray… which is obviously not the case here, for some reason. </p>
<p> That being said, this seems to be the only new feature that the company pushed out to the BlackBerry Launcher, along with general optimizations and bug fixes, of course. For those of you who do not know, BlackBerry Launcher is available on the Play Store for pretty much any modern Android device (Android 5.0+), and you can use it for 30 days without ads. After that period is done, ads will start popping up in the launcher, though you can pay 99 cents a month for the BlackBerry Hub+ subscription, which will remove ads from the BlackBerry Launcher. This, of course, does not apply to BlackBerry’s Android device, as all they need is the BlackBerry Hub+ app, and they’re good to go. </p>
<p> BlackBerry Launcher has been around for quite some time, and BlackBerry made it available to all Android devices a while back. Since then, this launcher has seen a number of updates, and aside from the BlackBerry Hub integration, which some people seem to love, this launcher offers some additional features that may interest you. For example, It allows you to call upon a widget for a specific app by swiping across that app on the home screen. This new version of the BlackBerry Launcher comes in for of a 1.1.11.9704 update, and the update is probably available to everyone as we speak, if it is not, it will be in the near future, as this is a staged rollout, of course. </p>

<p> BlackBerry Licensee Working On Two Crypto Wallet Handsets </p>
<p> Recent rumors claim that a BlackBerry licensee is working on two BlackBerry-branded smartphones that feature secure crypto wallets. These handsets will likely be known as the BlackBerry Evolve and the BlackBerry Evolve X, and Optiemus, a BlackBerry licensee based in India, will manufacture these smartphones. Evan Blass mentions that these devices will only be available as limited edition handsets. However, aside from the name of the device and the responsible BlackBerry licensee, Blass did not share additional information about the specification and the design of the upcoming handsets. </p>
<p> The idea of incorporating crypto wallets into smartphones is not new, and two handsets already sport this feature. One of them is Sirin Finney Blockchain smartphone. This device features a cold storage crypto wallet which can securely store BitCoin, Dogecoin, and other popular cryptocurrencies by keeping a reserve of these cryptocurrencies offline in the phone. HTC is also developing a blockchain smartphone known as the HTC Exodus. The Taiwanese handset maker stated that it will take advantage of the TrustZone technology from the British chip designer ARM. This technology prevents individuals from accessing the digital wallet unless the use the API developed by the tech company itself. Aside from incorporating crypto wallets, both devices also feature support for payment protocols and a secure storage for personal information, although it is not clear if the Evolve and the Evolve X will also include these features. </p>
<p> Aside from licensing its brand to several third-party manufacturers, BlackBerry is known for its development of security software for a wide variety of devices, including Android devices, wearables, medical devices, point-of-sale terminals, and appliances. In the licensing deals that BlackBerry makes with device makers, the Canadian software firm cooperates with the manufacturer for the development of software that is compatible with the hardware of their partner's handset. BlackBerry utilizes security keys to ensure that the hardware and software of the devices have not been tampered with, and the company also encrypts the internal storage of the devices to keep the data safe just in case the device is stolen. BlackBerry will likely use these methods to prevent malicious individuals from accessing the cryptocurrencies stored in the digital wallet. </p>

<p> Android News / BlackBerry Is Not Dead – New Devices Coming In 2021 With 5G & Physical Keyboards </p>
<p> BlackBerry Is Not Dead – New Devices Coming In 2021 With 5G & Physical Keyboards </p>
<p> Earlier this year, when BlackBerry announced that its partnership with TCL was over, many thought that they'd never see another BlackBerry smartphone. </p>
<p> Well, that's not the case. As Onward Mobility has struck a deal with a Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile, to develop a BlackBerry 5G smartphone. And it's coming in 2021. </p>
<p> Whoever thought they'd see a BlackBerry 5G smartphone? </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Onward Mobility's CEO, Peter Franklin said "our devices will be focused on security and productivity, and with all the attributes and functions of today's most sophisticated smartphones – and then some – at a competitive price point." </p>
<p> Details on the next BlackBerry smartphone are pretty scarce right now </p>
<p> Today's announcement was mostly about the partnership with FIH Mobile, and not so much about a specific phone. </p>
<p> But, Onward Mobility did give us a few details on the upcoming phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We know it is going to be a 5G-enabled device, which if it is launching in 2021, then it has to be. And it will also have a keyboard. Onward Mobility is also going to be attempting to target enterprise workers. Those are ones that value productivity and security more than everyday consumers. </p>
<p> That actually might make this device more successful than anything that TCL put out under the BlackBerry name. As TCL was mostly looking to get consumers to buy these devices. </p>
<p> In February, TCL's license to make BlackBerry smartphones and use the name, ran out and they opted not to renew the license. Effectively making BlackBerry smartphones dead. But they have risen once again, as only BlackBerry seemingly can. TCL made a handful of pretty interesting BlackBerry smartphones, but most people were not looking for a physical keyboard in 2017, when the KeyOne was announced. So the KeyOne and Key2 lines did not do very well, for TCL. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, with a similar deal to what HMD Global had with Nokia, Onward Mobility and FIH Mobile could revive the BlackBerry brand. And it's pretty smart for them to go ahead and target enterprise users. Seeing as that was BlackBerry's core audience, back in the day when it was one of the largest smartphone makers. HMD Global has made Nokia relevant again, maybe Onward Mobility can do the same for BlackBerry. </p>
<p> This is the fourth time that BlackBerry has been revived, and if Onward Mobility can't make it work, well BlackBerry might be dead for good after this run. We'll see when its first smartphone comes out next year. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/05/blackberrys-ceo-emphasizes-the-importance-of-privacy.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485129" filename="blackberrys-ceo-emphasizes-the-importance-of-privacy.html">
<p> BlackBerry's CEO Emphasizes The Importance Of Privacy </p>
<p> Data breaches and online privacy infractions have become a major problem in this data-driven society, prompting BlackBerry’s executive chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Chen, to address the matter point-blank, encouraging companies to step up their game in securing consumer data. At BlackBerry, Chen says the company treats security and privacy “not only a priority but a core element and value proposition.” That being said, the chief executive emphasizes its mission is to protect consumer data, and not to exploit it. </p>
<p> In a company blog post, Chen lobbies for every person’s data to be dealt with absolute ownership and further says data protection and security should be paramount, as privacy should be etched by design in the creation of products and services. Chen makes particular mention of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will finally be enforced on Friday under the European Union law, as an exemplary measure considering it would allow individuals to easily withdraw their consent from companies to use their data. In fact, he has high hopes that the GDPR will become the new standard as it is expected to benefit everyone, not just users in EU countries. He is urging companies to stick to strong data protection principles and by conforming to regulatory enforcement mechanisms. Likewise, it is also calling for national governments to strengthen its regulations over data privacy. For BlackBerry’s chairman, there’s no perfect time other than now, to hash out the details of the problem at hand between policymakers and the technology sector in order “to protect privacy and to spur innovation and competition.” Chen ends his call with a vow to continue treating privacy “a core value” of BlackBerry. Now, the ball is in the court of other companies. </p>
<p> Although data breaches take place year after year, internet users and industry regulators have been most critical of social network Facebook after it was dragged into the Cambridge Analytica scandal for compromising up to 87 million user accounts. It has taken a toll on everyone concerned and it was this time that the gravity of data breaches have shed light on consumers, governments, and regulators. </p>

<p> BlackBerry's DTEK App Gets New Visuals & Scan Features </p>
<p> BlackBerry has updated its DTEK by BlackBerry application with a complete overhaul on the U.I. side and new features for vulnerability point scanning with notifications. For those who may not aware, the security-forward software provides users of the company's Android-powered handsets with an easy-to-read oversight of their device's security. It measures that by gauging password usage, apps and permissions settings, and more. All of that is compiled into a single app interface to help users exert informed control over their smartphone in a bid to uphold BlackBerry's reputation for privacy and security. With the latest update to version 1.1.10.510, the most noticeable change is going to be the brand new homepage. Previously, information was displayed in a pre-configured order for various metrics. After the update, the most important information will be displayed first, with subsequent items displayed by order of importance based on urgency in terms of keeping a device private and secure. </p>
<p> Changes to the app's notifications have been made as well. For example, the app will now show notifications when an application is accessing sensitive permissions despite not being actively used by the device owner. That will allow users to see which apps are accessing what and when just a bit more quickly. The app also now classifies access permissions pertaining to Camera, Mic, and Phone as being sensitive. Alongside those alterations to the app, users now have the ability to set an automatic scan on a weekly basis or to run a manual scan from directly inside the app. That means they can more readily check for previously overlooked issues at any time, with a more proactive scan happening on a regular basis. </p>
<p> This marks just the latest in a long run of updates and new partnerships formed by BlackBerry in the attempt to spread its security-focused solutions. Among those, the company has announced several new licensing deals to incorporate BlackBerry security into other technologies. However, in this case, the application is only available to BlackBerry handsets running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or later. At very least, this should help those who own BlackBerry Android devices keep their personal information and smartphone quite a bit more secure than it would otherwise be.

<p> BlackBerry Secure Coming To Smartphones Of Bullitt Group </p>
<p> BlackBerry announced that it has signed a licensing deal with the United Kingdom-based smartphone manufacturer Bullitt Group that will allow the device maker to incorporate the BlackBerry Secure software suite into its handsets. Bullitt Group manufactures smartphones under the CAT and Land Rover brands, and its rugged devices are sold in around 100 countries worldwide. By licensing the BlackBerry Secure software platform, buyers of CAT and Land Rover smartphones will soon see BlackBerry-developed security software on their devices. This software platform, the Canadian tech firm mentions, should guard users against attackers that may take advantage of vulnerabilities found in the operating system of the mobile devices. </p>
<p> It has been reported last year that the Canadian tech company has been speaking with a number of device manufacturers for the licensing of its BlackBerry Secure platform. Aside from Bullitt Group, BlackBerry has already licensed its software to the Switzerland-based consumer electronics firm Punkt Tronics. Previous reports already mentioned that under these licensing deals, the Canadian software company will work with the OEM to develop software that is compatible with the hardware of their partner's handset. These licensing deals benefit the device manufacturers by allowing the companies to release more secure smartphones without having to deal with the costs associated with software development. BlackBerry states on its website that it employs a variety of methods to protect smartphone users from attacks. For example, security keys are used to ensure that both the hardware and the software of the devices have not been tampered, while the internal storage of the devices are fully encrypted so that the data stored in the devices are protected just in case the handsets are stolen. </p>
<p> These licensing deals are a part of the tech firm's recent efforts to generate profits by capitalizing on its expertise on the development of security software and other enterprise-focused software solutions. The company already shut down its hardware operations back in 2016 due to lackluster performance. Aside from mobile device security, the company is also developing software solutions for other industries like healthcare and autonomous vehicles. For example, BlackBerry has partnered with companies like Delphi and Baidu for the development of self-driving technologies. </p>

<p> BlackBerry Handset Revenue Was $0, Marking the End Of An Era </p>
<p> BlackBerry reported its quarterly earnings earlier this week, in which it actually beat analysts expectations by a fair margin. Which means that BlackBerry's CEO, John Chen has been making the rounds, interviewing with the media in Canada this week. An important part of the earnings that was released earlier this week, was the fact that handset revenue for BlackBerry reached zero. Not the profit, but actual revenue from handsets hit zero. That may not be a surprise to most people, seeing as BlackBerry hasn't made an actual phone in a few years (since the Priv), and has sold the naming rights to TCL and formed "BlackBerry Mobile" with TCL. But older BlackBerry devices were still fairly popular in emerging markets, particularly in Africa. But it looks like that is now changing. </p>
<p> Chen stated that there was "one quarter in the last three that was low – like $5 million or something of that sort… This is the quarter where we had zero." What's important to note is that the revenue has not dried up for BlackBerry. Chen has simply redirected that revenue into other parts of the business. Primarily its licensing categories, which includes the aforementioned TCL and BlackBerry Mobile. This is due to the fact that BlackBerry has been focusing more on its software, and selling that to other phone makers. Chen wanted to make sure that everyone knew "BlackBerry will still have handsets, but we're going to get the handset revenue through royalties because we have licensed some of our technologies, our operating systems, as well as our brand to a number of OEMs out there." Continuing by saying that "they will be building BlackBerry phones and they will be responsible for addressing the market that way." BlackBerry is expecting to continue in the phone business, but not by making phones, by collecting royalties. This is similar to what Microsoft is doing. While it has essentially killed Windows Phone (or Windows Mobile for the older crowd), it is still collecting royalties on every single Android smartphone sold, because of some patents it holds and Android uses. In fact, it makes around $6 billion per year from Android smartphone sales. BlackBerry obviously won't be making that kind of money from royalties, seeing as it is getting royalties from every single Android smartphone sold around the world. </p>
<p> BlackBerry Has Shifted From Making Smartphones To Licensing </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Licensing is a very lucrative way for companies to bring in some extra cash. Many tech giants license out things like software, patents and even their brand like BlackBerry is doing now. For instance, Qualcomm makes about half of its revenue from licensing – which is actually billed as a separate company at Qualcomm, "Qualcomm Technology Licensing". Of course, Qualcomm makes a whole lot more because of the many CDMA patents it holds, even when it comes to non-Android smartphones. </p>
<p> A couple of years ago, BlackBerry announced that it would stop making smartphones. It had announced it sold the naming rights for the "BlackBerry" brand over to TCL. This meant that TCL could build "BlackBerry" smartphones and sell them under that name. But it also meant that TCL would be able to use a number of BlackBerry's patents. Which it did in the BlackBerry KEYone and KEY2, those are the two smartphones that sport the physical QWERTY keyboard that BlackBerry did so well. And it sports all of BlackBerry's patents so it feels like an old-school BlackBerry Bold, but with Android on-board. This was a smart choice for BlackBerry, as it was quite clear that it was not going to be able to compete with the likes of Samsung, LG, Motorola, and Apple, by using its own BlackBerry OS. And it gave TCL another brand it could build for, alongside Alcatel – not to mention the nostalgia factor. </p>
<p> Focus On Connected Cars </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Since BlackBerry stopped focusing on making smartphones, it turned its attention to connected and autonomous vehicles. It's a bet that is starting to pay off for the Canada-based company. Chen noted this week that sales from its connected cars business grew 23-percent compared to the same period a year ago. Showing some pretty significant growth for the company. BlackBerry has been working on a self-driving car technology, as well as infotainment software, through the QNX unit that it acquired in 2010 from Harman International for around $200 million. BlackBerry has already struck deals with some major car makers, including Ford and Hyundai. As well as working with some auto suppliers like Aptive and Denso. </p>
<p> Connected and Autonomous vehicles was a good bet for BlackBerry, and it's good to see that the QNX division is finally being put to good use. With both connected and autonomous vehicles being the big talking points now – and for the immediate future – it's not a surprise that the division is growing pretty substantially now. Though BlackBerry has a lot of competition in that space, this is something that it had talked about before. Which was licensing its technologies, operating systems and its brand name to other companies. Much like how it has licensed the term "BlackBerry" to TCL, it is also licensing these technologies developed by the QNX division, over to major companies in the auto industry. </p>
<p> BlackBerry Isn't The Same BlackBerry (RIM) From A Few Years Ago </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> BlackBerry, formerly called RIM (Research In Motion), was a much different company just a few years ago. It was struggling to become a major player in the smartphone market again, after (arguably) helping to kickstart the market. RIM went through a name change to BlackBerry, it went through many smartphones that just weren't big sellers, or smartphones that people were interested in. It also dropped BlackBerry OS and went to Android before finally deciding to get out of the handset business. Now BlackBerry got out of the handset business almost two years ago – announced in March 2017 it was getting out of making handsets. The company is now working on technologies for other industries, like cars. So when you see an infotainment system in your car with the BlackBerry name attached, you might be scratching your head thinking "I thought BlackBerry made smartphones". </p>

<p> BlackBerry Software Drives Strong Q1 For Fiscal Year 2019 </p>
<p> BlackBerry software has driven the positive results for a strong Q1 of the fiscal year 2019 for the company, as it posts notable increases in both non-GAAP total software and services revenue and GAAP total software and services revenue, which were reported at an amount of $193 Million and $189 Million respectively, which are increases of 14-percent and 18-percent year-over-year. These big jumps showcase that although BlackBerry no longer officially makes hardware in-house like it used to, its software continues to be a factor in helping it move forward and serve up continual growth. </p>
<p> Those above numbers are $217 Million for total company non-GAAP and $213 Million for total company GAAP services revenues which are also growth points for BlackBerry compared to last year's numbers during the same period. Following these numbers BlackBerry is expecting the remainder of the fiscal year to be just as strong and it predicts that its total company software and services billing growth will move into double-digits by the end of the fiscal year. The company's free cash flow is expected to continue being strong for the rest of the fiscal year as well, pointing to a very positive outlook for BlackBerry Limited in the future. </p>
<p> BlackBerry CEO John Chen attributes part of the strength of its software and services revenues specifically to the company's BlackBerry QNX software for vehicles, which he mentions is already available in over 120 million vehicles globally. With such big success in this particular area Chen also states that BlackBerry is excited for the future services it plans to deliver for the automobile and EoT industries. BlackBerry's revenue gains were strongest in North America at a reported $139 Million of the reported $213 Million, while Europe, the Middle East, and Africa attributed a reported $52 Million, with other regions rounding out the remaining $22 Million. While software and services was the largest segment of the revenue other areas saw increases as well. BlackBerry Technology Solutions increased to $47 Million from $36 Million at the same time last year, while "licensing, IP, and Other" increased to $63 Million from $32 Million. </p>

<p> BlackBerry Suing Twitter Over Messaging Patents </p>
<p> BlackBerry has decided to sue Twitter for allegedly cribbing technologies it created. The former smartphone maker has accused the microblogging website of infringing on six of its patents, which relate to mobile messaging technologies such as push notifications and muting notifications for a message thread as well as mobile advertising techniques. The complaint has been filed with the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. </p>
<p> The former mobile maker claims that it pioneered mobile messaging and the relatively late entrant Twitter tried to make up for its delayed entry in the mobile messaging domain by co-opting Blackberry’s inventions for its services such as its main app and its ads platform. BlackBerry alleges that by misappropriating its innovations and user interface, the social networking website has eaten away at its market share by luring customer towards its products and services. The company says that these inventions are what made BlackBerry successful in the first place and by copying them, Twitter has managed to steal its customers in one fell swoop. </p>
<p> By diverting Blackberry’s clientele to its platform, Twitter has also wrongfully deprived the company of the revenue that would have otherwise come to it. The company is now demanding compensation for the lost revenue as well as unspecified enhanced damages. Twitter has declined to comment on the matter. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In March 2018, BlackBerry sued Facebook on similar grounds, alleging that the social media giant violated its patents related to user interface, security, power-efficient status updates, and notification silencing for Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Later on, in September 2018, Facebook responded by countersuing Blackberry for infringing on five of its patients. Both these lawsuits are still in court. </p>
<p> Years ago, BlackBerry was known as one of the largest smartphone makers in the world. In its heydays, the company was known for providing secure messaging services, including the BlackBerry Messenger (BBM). However, it started losing ground with the entry of new players, including Apple and Android device manufacturers. The advantage it had over rivals because of BBM began eroding away with the arrival of messaging services with similar features, such as WhatsApp. Ultimately, it got so bad that BlackBerry formally exited the smartphone market in 2016. </p>
<p> The company now provides software solutions for managing mobile devices and self-driving vehicles. The Chinese electronics manufacturer TCL has bought the rights to its name to sell mobile devices and so its name lives on in the market. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> BlackBerry was apparently vying for an out of court settlement with Twitter at first but when those efforts failed, it headed to the court. The 98-page complaint is available online and explains in details why the company deserves compensation for the use of its intellectual property. In addition to filing a lawsuit against Facebook, the company had pressed similar charges against Snapchat in April 2018. Since the cases were said to be related, they were both assigned to U.S. District Judge George Wu. According to Reuters, the new case might also be assigned to him by federal courts because of its similarity to the previous lawsuits. </p>

<p> BlackBerry's Wireless Charger Shown In Official Promo Video </p>
<p> BlackBerry Mobile’s official India YouTube page has just released a new promo video, this time around the company is teasing an unreleased product via this video, its very first wireless charger. A couple of months ago, Evan Blass hinted that the company may release a wireless charger in the near future by releasing some sketches containing that wireless charger, but that has not happened just yet, though based on the provided promo video, it may soon. </p>
<p> Renders of BlackBerry’s wireless charger shown in the provided promo video are actually identical to sketches that Mr. Blass released a while back, at least they seem to be. This wireless charger is actually not round, nor a rectangle, it actually has a shape of BlackBerry’s Secure shield, and it comes with two blue indicator lights on the side. It is not entirely clear where is the Type-C USB port, though, sketches suggested that it is on the top side of the charger, but we didn’t really get a chance to see it in BlackBerry’s video. This wireless charger comes with rubber padding on the bottom, just to keep it firmly attached to a table or some other surface, and we all know how important that is, as nobody wants to see a wireless charger sliding off the table with a smartphone that it is charging at the time. </p>
<p> Interestingly enough, BlackBerry did not announce this wireless charger just yet, though the company did release an ad for it, which is a bit confusing, but it surely means that the charger is coming in the near future. For those of you who do not know, BlackBerry actually announced the Evolve and EvolveX smartphones in India quite recently, even though they’re not available yet, so it’s possible that the BlackBerry Wireless Charger will launch once those two devices become available. The BlackBerry Wireless Charger will probably launch with the EvolveX, which supports wireless charging, which means it may arrive before the end of August, and it remains to be seen if it will become available in other markets as well. </p>

<p> BlackBerry Teases Two New "Evolve" Android Smartphones </p>
<p> BlackBerry Mobile is gearing up for a new launch event taking place tomorrow, August 2, when the Indian branch of the company will be unveiling two new smartphones identified by the Evolve moniker. The OEM has shared a few teasers on social platforms including YouTube and Instagram ahead of tomorrow's presentation, hinting that at least one of these two upcoming devices should be equipped with a physical keyboard. Actual hardware details are missing as of this writing, but the bits of promotional material portraying its rear camera configuration suggest that this keyboard-equipped model is not the BlackBerry KEY2 but a new entry in the company’s smartphone portfolio. </p>
<p> The so-called BlackBerry Evolve and Evolve X will be unveiled tomorrow and until then, the only information to go by lies in the teaser material at hand, which suggests that although the two phones are seemingly part of the same series, the Evolve and Evolve X could be fairly different from each other, at least in terms of their exterior. While one of the teased devices closely resembles the BlackBerry KEY2, complete with a textured back panel, this particular model’s main camera configuration is different, having an LED flash on the opposite side of the camera housing compared to the KEY2, or indeed the rumored KEY2 Lite. On the other hand, it’s unclear whether the second Evolve model will have a full-screen design or a physical keyboard in tow. Either way, the back panel accommodates a dual-camera setup positioned in the center, along with a rear-fitted fingerprint scanner, and these combined characteristics have yet to be seen on a BlackBerry smartphone model released prior to these teasers. </p>
<p> As for the internal hardware, so far the only smartphone launched by the company this year is the BlackBerry KEY2 manufactured by TCL, which houses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset coupled with 6GB of RAM, while flaunting a 4.5-inch display with a 3:2 image format and a pixel count of 1,080 by 1,620. </p>

<p> You Can Save As Much As 56% On A New Amazon Blink Outdoor Cam </p>
<p> Amazon has added a new deal in conjunction with its ongoing Prime Day deals, offering as much as 56-percent off on its Blink Outdoor security camera kits. </p>
<p> The Blink Outdoor is an award-winning camera designed to survive the elements. And it provides all of the benefits of a modern smart security camera. But it also packs a two-year battery life, making Blink Outdoor one of the most high-value offerings around. </p>
<p> Now, some of the deals on this particular camera aren't necessarily Prime-only. But Amazon is sweetening the deal for Amazon Prime members — including those with free 30-day trial memberships. deals are solely intended for Amazon Prime members. In three of the available kits, the company is including a discounted $10 Amazon Echo Show display-enabled smart home hub. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In particular, Amazon is offering 56-percent off its two-camera kit. Including the $10 5.5-inch Echo Show. That brings the price for Prime members down to just $119.99. Typically, buyers can expect to pay $269.98 at full price for all of the included items. Additionally, Amazon discounts the two-camera kit without a Prime membership by 39-percent to just $109.99. That's from the cost of the cameras alone at $179.99. </p>
<p> The company has discounted its single-camera Blink Outdoor kit too. By as much as 35-percent, taking the price from $99 to $64.99. </p>
<p> Amazon has also put three- and five-camera kits on sale. But Amazon doesn't note the price decrease. And it's impossible to determine where the discounts have been made. Especially since the Prime-only deal is more expensive than the kits without the Echo Show. So, without the $10 Echo Show included non-prime members will pay $249.99 and $379.99, respectively. There's still a $10 Prime-only kit with the other gadget included. Those sell for $339.98 or $469.98. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Finally, the company discounted its add-on standalone cameras now as well. But there's no discount for Prime Day on the Amazon Echo Show with regard to the Blink Outdoor add-on camera. This deal is for everybody and puts the cost down 33-percent to $59.99 from $89.99. </p>

<p> Top 10 Reasons To Buy A Roborock Vacuum </p>
<p> Roborock has grown from a company that was making robot vacuums for Xiaomi, to making its own robot vacuums (and even a cordless stick vacuum) with many different price points in mind. </p>
<p> It also makes some of the best robot vacuums in the industry, these days, and here’s why. </p>
<p> Today, we’re focusing on three vacuums from Roborock’s lineup: the S6 MaxV, S5 Max and the H6 cordless stick vacuum. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Here’s why you should buy the Roborock S6 MaxV </p>
<p> The Roborock S6 MaxV earned our “Editor’s Choice” award when we reviewed it earlier this year. But there are a couple of features of this robot vacuum that really make it stand out. </p>
<p> Avoids any and every obstacle </p>
<p> Firstly, the S6 MaxV boasts an advanced avoidance and recognition system, that allows it to easily avoid things that might be on the floor. It can recognize objects like cords, shoes, scales, and even dog poop. </p>
<p> It is able to recognize these objects from a combination of three things. The stereo camera on the front of the S6 MaxV, the Qualcomm APQ8053 processor and artificial intelligence. These all work together to make the S6 MaxV smarter, and avoid things that it could get tangled up in. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> From our experience with the S6 MaxV and the very many other robot vacuums on the market today, this is a game-changing feature. Robot vacuums are always getting stuck on something, yet the S6 MaxV rarely ever gets stuck or tangled in a nest of cables. </p>
<p> Powerful suction – 2500Pa </p>
<p> On top of the advanced avoidance and recognition system that the S6 MaxV has, it also has increased suction. It is rated for 2500Pa, and that’s a big bump over its earlier robot vacuums that were rated for 2000Pa. </p>
<p> With this better suction, the S6 MaxV is able to pick up more dirt, dust, pet hair and allergens, than other robot vacuums. Providing you with a deeper clean around your home. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Maps multiple levels of your home </p>
<p> The S6 MaxV is also able to map multiple levels of your home, making this the perfect robot vacuum for those that have more than one floor in their home. </p>
<p> Once you start the S6 MaxV, it will turn around and locate itself. This helps it know not only what floor it is on, but also where on that floor it is. Think of it as the S6 MaxV flipping through maps to find the right one, like many of us did before Google Maps existed. </p>
<p> The Roborock S6 MaxV is able to remember four different floor plans, and 10 no-go zones, no-go lines and no-mop zones per level. The only thing it can’t do is move to each level. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Precision water control takes robotic mopping to the next level </p>
<p> Finally, the Roborock S6 MaxV also offers precision water control in its mopping When its mopping module is attached, it will automatically avoid your no-mop zones.. That way it is not mopping your carpeted rooms, and making an absolute mess. It also turns off the water flow when it is heading back to the dock. Keeping your floors clean, and only mopping when you want it to. </p>
<p> The user also has complete control over the water flow. Allowing you to choose to have it mop with more water in the kitchen, and less in the living room. Particularly helpful if your kitchen is an absolute mess, or if you want the living room floor to dry very quickly. </p>
<p> The Roborock S6 MaxV will be just $599 during Prime Day (that's October 13 and 14), good for $150 off of its regular price! </p>
<p> Roborock’s S5 Max is also a good option </p>
<p> The S5 Max isn’t quite as fancy as the S6 MaxV, but it does have some stand out features that make this a really good option for cleaning your home. </p>
<p> A seamless mopping experience </p>
<p> The S5 Max has an integrated mop, like the majority of Roborock’s robot vacuums. But it stands out because of the high-capacity water tank. It has a 290ml tank, which holds enough water to clean up to 2600 square-feet, in one cycle. Meaning that you won’t need to worry about the S5 Max needing to be refilled, mid-mopping. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There is also a spring-loaded mop on the S5 Max, which is going to help scrub the floor and make sure it is nice and clean. It presses down 300g of weight from start to finish, to get up all of the messes that might be on your floors. </p>
<p> Powerful suction & carpet boost for a well cleaned floor </p>
<p> The S5 Max offers some pretty powerful suction, rated at 2000Pa. Which is technically strong enough to pick up a AA battery. Meaning, it can get the most stubborn dirt and dust off of your floors. Even the dirt that is ground into the carpet. </p>
<p> This is because it also has carpet boost, which allows the S5 Max to boost the suction on carpet. Since you don’t really need the full 2000Pa on hardwood or laminate floors, but you do on carpet. This is a feature that makes loads of sense. </p>

<p> It’s going to give you a nice deep clean, every single time. </p>
<p> Intelligent LiDAR navigation </p>
<p> Roborock has been using LiDAR on its robot vacuums for years, and it keeps getting better and better. With the S5 Max, it has a high-precision laser navigation system on top of the robot vacuum. This is used to navigate your home, and map out your floor plan. </p>
<p> Mapping out your home is important, as it means the S5 Max won’t miss a spot, and it also knows when it is done cleaning your home. This is also needed for selective room cleaning, which is another feature of the S5 Max. </p>
<p> With Selective Room Cleaning, you are able to tell the Roborock S5 Max to clean a specific room, and once it’s done, it’ll head back to the dock. </p>
<p> Roborock has also outfitted the S5 Max with no go zones and virtual barriers. Allowing the user to keep the S5 Max from entering specific rooms and areas of your home. </p>
<p> Of course, none of this would be possible without the LiDAR system on the S5 Max. Which makes the laser navigation all the more important. </p>
<p> Control the Roborock S5 Max with your phone (or voice) </p>
<p> You are able to control the Roborock S5 Max with the Roborock app (available on iOS and Android). With the app, you can see your floor plan, which allows you to also see the route that the S5 Max has taken to clean your home. </p>
<p> The app has many other features available too, like scheduling when the S5 Max will start vacuuming. As well as adjusting the cleaning and mopping modes on the S5 Max. </p>
<p> One of the more useful, but somewhat underrated, features of the app, is the maintenance section. This will tell you when you need to clean the sensors, replace the filter and the brushes. So you can keep the S5 Max running in tip-top shape. </p>
<p> Finally, the app also has support for Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. This means that you can tell Google to have your Roborock start cleaning your home. </p>
<p> The Roborock S5 Max will be 20% off during Prime Day, allowing you to pick it up for $439. </p>
<p> Buying the Roborock H6 Adapt is a no-brainer </p>
<p> The Roborock H6 Adapt is a really good complement to your robot vacuum. Even though these robot vacuums are very capable, sometimes it’s just easier to pick up the H6 Adapt and clean up a mess that your kids made. </p>
<p> The Roborock H6 Adapt is unbelievably lightweight </p>
<p> For a cordless stick vacuum, the H6 Adapt is very lightweight. It weighs in at only three pounds (or 1.4kg). </p>
<p> The first time I picked it up to vacuum, I was shocked at how lightweight it truly was. Making it a lot easier to use to clean the cobwebs off of the wall and dust from around the air vents that are above my head. </p>
<p> What’s even more unbelievable is how lightweight the H6 Adapt is, while still being very powerful. It’s driven by a 420W brushless motor, so it won’t scratch up your linoleum floors, and it has a maximum suction strength of 150AW. </p>
<p> A battery that never stops </p>
<p> With the H6 Adapt, Roborock had to put in a big enough battery that it could last for a long time, but not so big that it made the cordless stick vacuum heavy. This is thanks to a lithium-polymer battery, which is the same battery system found on drones. That’s how Roborock was able to offer a long-lasting battery on the H6 Adapt without making it a heavy stick vacuum. </p>
<p> The battery in the Roborock H6 Adapt is rated for around 90 minutes in Eco mode, or about 10 minutes in Max mode. </p>
<p> Obviously, the H6 Adapt was not meant to clean your entire home in Max mode. It was meant to pick up messes that your kids made, quickly and efficiently. </p>
<p> However, 90 minutes in Eco mode means that you can clean your whole house with this cordless stick vacuum, if you really wanted too. </p>
<p> There is also a small screen on the handle, which will let you know how much time is left, before the H6 Adapt runs out of juice. Which is a really genius feature to put on a vacuum like this. When you switch into Max mode, it also adjusts for the shorter runtime in that mode versus Eco mode. </p>
<p> Roborock has a vacuum for everyone. Whether it’s a robot vacuum, or a cordless stick vacuum to clean up your home. There’s something for everyone. </p>

<p> Here's When You Can Buy The Galaxy Tab S7 </p>
<p> Samsung has offered up more information about its upcoming Galaxy Tab S7 Android tablet, specifically when you can buy one for yourself. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 is the latest and greatest from Samsung. The company officially announced the tablet back on August 5, during its first Unpacked event. The tablet packs some decent features so the price won't be exceedingly low. It's also not going to be insanely high, at least not for the base model. </p>
<p> So if you're in the market for a tablet that runs on Android, this is the one. It also won't be long before Samsung makes it available. Because you'll be able to buy the Galaxy Tab S7 in the very near future. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 on September </p>
<p> Wondering when you can purchase your very own Samsung Galaxy Tab S7? Soon. Very soon, in fact, as the tablet launches this month. </p>
<p> Today Samsung confirmed that the Galaxy Tab S7 would go on sale on September 18. It'll be available on Samsung's own website, as well as through various retail partners like Amazon, Best Buy, and more. Carriers are also likely to sell at least the 5G model. So keep that in mind. </p>
<p> As for the cost, it starts at $650. That's for the 11-inch model of the Galaxy Tab S7. You can also bump up to the 12.4-inch Galaxy Tab S7+ model for $850. Samsung will also be selling both versions of the tablet in WiFi and 5G variants. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Depending on your configurations, the price is going to go up. As you can modify the storage amount. </p>
<p> Choose from 128GB, 256GB, 0r 512GB of internal storage </p>
<p> If you don't need a lot of internal storage then you're much better off sticking with the 128GB model of the device. </p>
<p> Whether you go with the Galaxy Tab S7 or Galaxy Tab S7+, you're looking at $650 or $850 respectively. If you bump up to the 256GB model though, those prices increase to $730 or $930. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And if you go for the 512GB models, then the prices jump to $830 and $1,030. And these are just the Wi-Fi-only models. The tablet will also be sold in Mystic Bronze, Mystic Black, Mystic Silver, and you can get either color in any of the configurations mentioned. </p>
<p> So really there's not a lot of limitation in what your choices are. Samsung has pretty much given consumers free reign here. Once you settle on which options you really need or want. </p>

<p> CES 2019 Daily Recap: Smart Displays, Verizon Gets A BlackBerry & More </p>
<p> Today marks the official start of CES 2019, after a few days of companies frantically announcing everything, they are now showing them off to the press and to the public. </p>
<p> In spite of the past two days serving as media days for all of the announcements, there were still plenty of announcements saved for the opening of the show today. Although today's theme was mostly Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Google released a number of announcements today regarding the Assistant, including the fact that it is now in beta on Sonos' smart speakers, and that it can now be an interpreter for you. This could be especially useful if you do not speak the language in the country you are currently in. Google Assistant is also coming, everywhere, literally. It has arrived on Google Maps, and it is also going to be on your bedside table, thanks to the latest smart display that Lenovo made. This display is also a smart clock, which means its much smaller (about four inches, measured diagonally), and there's no camera. So you don't need to worry about Google watching you sleep. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon Alexa also got a couple of new smart displays. One coming from ARCHOS which is more of a budget smart display. And then Lenovo debuted two tablets that can be docked and turn into smart displays with Amazon Alexa on-board. If you ever thought that you needed a smart mirror in your life, well that debuted today as well. Capstone has a new smart mirror that has the Google Assistant included, but there's no word on pricing or availability yet. </p>
<p> Smart home and the Internet of Things also remained big topics today, as you might expect from a tech-centric trade-show in 2019. </p>
<p> Here's everything that was announced at CES 2019 today: </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2020/10/chrome-87-beta-update-pdf-viewer.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483607" filename="chrome-87-beta-update-pdf-viewer.html">
<p> Chrome 87 Beta Update Improves PDFs, Cookies & Connected Cameras </p>
<p> Chrome 87 is still more than a month away for desktop and a week longer still for Chromebooks but a Beta Channel update may have just revealed some of the biggest incoming features. That's based on a recent report from Android Police, detailing at least two big changes. </p>
<p> The first big change will be the most noticeable for end users. That's because it's a complete redesign of the Chrome browser's PDF Viewer, even stepping away from other recently reported beta designs. Now, this may or may not release in Chrome 87 Stable when that rolls out. As of this writing, it's still tucked behind an experimental '#pdf-viewer-update' flag at the "chrome://flags" URL. But it should make the PDF Viewer much better if and when it arrives. </p>
<p> Prior to the incoming update, the PDF viewer has been a straightforward but not necessarily intuitive or feature-rich tool in Chrome. There are zoom-in and -out icons in the lower-right-hand-side of the UI. And along the top Google places print and download icons among others. Now, the tools for interacting with zoom and page view fall more in-line with a standalone reader. And those are all placed in an easy-to-see arrangement at the top. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google has also added a left-hand panel with different page views and navigation options tucked behind a three-bar icon. </p>
<p> What's the second big Chrome 87 Beta update? </p>
<p> The second big change is in the way Chrome will handle cookies. Namely, the company is rolling out a new Cookie Store API. That gives websites a JSON-formatted list of browser-stored cookies. And it'ss asynchronous too. That means that the rest of the code can continue operating while cookies are looked up. In addition to them being easier for the website to find, to begin with. </p>
<p> Moreover, the Cookie Store API gives cookie access to background processes. So service workers, and websites, should be able to add a lot more functionality for end-users with the change in place. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When does this arrive? </p>
<p> Now, there are a few other changes happening with this version 87 beta update for Google Chrome too. But the only big one for end-users is the addition of a new API that lets Chrome do more with connected cameras. Mainly, to tilt and pan connected cameras. </p>
<p> As to when the changes will arrive, that's far less certain. As hinted above, all or none of the changes could arrive with Chrome 87 stable. That's slated to arrive on or around November 17. For Chromebook users, that'll arrive on or around December 1. </p>

<p> Android News / Android TV / Chromecast Built-In Beta Allows Android TVs In Speaker Groups </p>
<p> Chromecast Built-In Beta Allows Android TVs In Speaker Groups </p>
<p> A new update for Google's Chromecast built-in app — installed on select televisions– now allows Android TVs in Google Home speaker groups. The update only appears in the beta channel so it won't be arriving yet for every user. And it isn't necessarily going to be available for all TVs with Chromecast capabilities. For now, this appears to primarily work with Android TV sets. </p>
<p> One notable exception to the change is reportedly the Shield TV. More specifically, even the beta channel change doesn't appear to allow speaker group additions for the NVIDIA-branded accessory. That means it may be hit-and-miss with regard to exactly which TVs see the update — hinting at a relatively narrow testing band. </p>
<p> What does this mean for speaker groups and Android TVs with Chromecast built-in? </p>
<p> Anybody utilizing a smart home environment built around Google Home and Nest devices will be familiar with speaker groups. The feature is among the best included with the ecosystem. Summarily, Google lets users assign speakers to a group or groups. That's by accessing their individual settings for a given device in the Google Home app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Those speakers, when asked to, will then play music or other media together simultaneously. Google Home syncs the media, allowing it to effectively fill the whole home seamlessly in most cases. </p>
<p> Android-based TVs and those with Chromecast built-in cannot, as of this writing, be added to those groups. Except that now they can, as long as users have the beta. The change basically just adds another component to the experience. </p>
<p> For those with audio systems hooked up to their televisions, or with TVs that have exceptional sound out-of-the-box, the impact will just be more listening devices chiming in when speaker groups are used. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This was added once already and taken away </p>
<p> Now, the Android TV variant of the OS has received speaker groups support before. And, as with this case, that arrived via Chromecast built-in. At least for some users. As with this update, that allowed the TVs to be used primarily for background audio. But the feature was removed shortly after going live. And it's not immediately clear why Google made that decision. </p>
<p> Google may simply have decided the feature wasn't ready. Or it may have been pushed out by mistake, to begin with. Since the company didn't offer up any clarification, it's not out of the question it could happen again. And it may not arrive in the stable channel for some time still, depending on how testing goes. So this news may be best taken with a healthy dose of skepticism. </p>
<p> Those who do have Chromecast built-in televisions will need to update that app via beta in order to gain access to the feature, regardless. Beta sign-ups are pushed via the Google Play Store near the bottom of the apps page. Otherwise, users will need to wait until this update is pushed to the stable channel and their Android TVs automatically update. </p>

<p> Chromecast With Google TV: Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> Google announced its fourth-generation Chromecast (with Google TV) on September 30. </p>
<p> Chromecast with Google TV is a big change in terms of features, looks, price and more for the Chromecast, compared to the first three models. It is now a proper dongle, and comes with a remote and Android TV built-in. It also sports Google's new "Google TV" interface that will be coming to Android TV devices in the future. </p>
<p> Here's everything you need to know about the new Chromecast with Google TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What is Chromecast with Google TV? </p>
<p> Chromecast with Google TV is the fourth-generation Chromecast, which turned out to be a massive hit for Google when it was announced back in 2013. It was originally a $35 dongle that you plugged into your TV and instantly able to stream all sorts of content to your TV with ease. </p>
<p> Now, seven years later, it was time for Google to improve the Chromecast. So here comes Chromecast with Google TV. It now includes a physical remote control, and has an actual interface. Chromecast, never had an actual interface. Instead, you would hit the Cast button on your phone in a specific app, and that was it. Chromecast with Google TV has Android TV baked in, so it's not an entirely new operating system, but the Google TV launcher on top is brand new. </p>
<p> The Chromecast with Google TV is made completely from recycled materials. So by purchasing the new Chromecast, you're actually helping the environment. This is likely also why some of the parts of the Chromecast – the remote and batteries – have an interesting texture. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What is Google TV? </p>
<p> Google TV is the new launcher that is on top of Android TV on Chromecast with Google TV. This might all sound very confusing, especially if you remember the fact that Google had Google TV up until it killed it off in 2014 in favor of Android TV. </p>
<p> But now Google TV is back, sort of. It's a new launcher on Android TV, that aims to make it easier to find content to watch on your big screen. There are a few new tabs at the top, that highlight different content. So the "Live" tab will highlight what is currently on TV, if you are a YouTube TV subscriber. Movies and Shows highlight movies and TV shows you can watch from a variety of different apps that are installed – as well as Google Play. Then there is the Apps library, where you can launch your apps, like you normally would. </p>
<p> Google TV will come to other Android TV devices starting in 2021. Though, Google hasn't said much about what devices will be first, or when in 2021 this new interface will be available. But it won't be exclusive to the new Chromecast forever. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What streaming apps work with Google TV? </p>
<p> Anything that has an Android TV app, or works with Chromecast will work with Chromecast on Google TV. But for the new Movies and Shows tabs, Google TV only integrates certain apps. Here's the list of the apps that are currently compatible with Google TV. Google says it'll be adding more in the future. </p>
<p> As you'll see there are a couple of larger streaming services missing here like Peacock. Which might be surprising, but it does still work on Google TV, it just doesn't integrate into the movies and shows tabs on Google TV. You can still open the app and watch content the old fashioned way on the Chromecast with Google TV. </p>
<p> Which Live TV services work with Google TV? </p>
<p> For the Live tab in Google TV, only YouTube TV is supported for now. Similar to the movies and shows tabs, Google says it is planning to add support for other streaming Live TV services in the Live tab in the near future. But for now, only YouTube TV works. And there's no way around that yet. It is unclear when exactly Google will add other services like Sling TV, FuboTV and AT&T TV NOW to this live tab. But it likely won't be until 2021. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For a limited time, Google is giving new YouTube TV subscribers a free Chromecast with Google TV. So if you sign up for YouTube TV for a month, you can get a Chromecast for free. A month of YouTube TV does cost you $65, so you're basically paying for a Chromecast and then $15 for the first month of YouTube TV. It's a great way to check out YouTube TV and get a Chromecast for free. </p>
<p> What HDR specs does it support? </p>
<p> The Chromecast with Google TV does support 4K HDR content. But just like with anything else, there are different forms of HDR available. </p>
<p> Currently, it only supports HDR10 and HDR10+. Which should cover most people and most content. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Outside of HDR, it does also support both Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, for great sound and picture quality. </p>
<p> Can you use it wired, instead of wireless? </p>
<p> While the Chromecast is used wirelessly, and connects to 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, you can use it wired. Via an ethernet cable. But, that will cost you extra. </p>
<p> Google does have plans to offer an Ethernet adapter for the Chromecast, but it is not yet available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How does Google decide what content to list "For You"? </p>
<p> Google TV is able to access things you have watched already, as well as what you have put on your wishlist in the Play Movies & TV app – before it was rebranded to Google TV. </p>
<p> The recommendations "For You" are not that great in the very beginning, especially if you did not create a wishlist. But the more content you watch, the better it'll get over time. </p>
<p> You can still add stuff to your wishlist (now called "watchlist") on Google TV. Just search for a movie or show, and then add it to your watchlist. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What buttons are on the new Chromecast remote? </p>
<p> Google kept the remote on the Chromecast pretty simple. It has the necessary buttons like a directional pad, home, back, volume controls, and Google Assistant. There is also a power button and inputs. But Google also added two other buttons for popular streaming services. </p>
<p> There is a YouTube button and a Netflix button. As you'd expect, pressing either one takes you directly into those apps. This is not anything new, Android TV manufacturers, Roku and Fire TV all do something similar – though they do it based on who is paying. So depending on when you buy your Roku, you may have different buttons on your remote. </p>
<p> Can they be customized? </p>
<p> The YouTube and Netflix buttons on the Chromecast with Google TV remote cannot be customized, at least not yet. Google has hinted at the fact that it may add the ability to customize them in the future. </p>
<p> Though, considering the fact that they have YouTube and Netflix logos on them, there's not a whole lot of customizing you can actually do here. </p>
<p> Can the remote control my TV too? </p>
<p> Yes. The Chromecast with Google TV remote can control your TV as well. </p>
<p> It supports HDMI-CEC, which is a protocol that allows HDMI devices to talk to each other, allowing for multiple devices to be controlled by a single remote. </p>
<p> The remote is able to turn on/off the TV, switch inputs (to the Chromecast input, only), adjust volume and mute. </p>
<p> During the setup, Chromecast will walk you through controlling your TV and soundbar if you have one. It works with most brands of TVs and sound bars, including Sonos. </p>
<p> This way you won't need to use another remote to control your TV or your soundbar. </p>
<p> Can you play games on Chromecast with Google TV? </p>
<p> Chromecast with Google TV does support Stadia. But not officially until 2021. Surprisingly, you cannot play Stadia on Chromecast with Google TV, out of the box. Which is a clear oversight by Google, obviously. </p>
<p> However, many users have reported being able to sideload the Stadia app and play on the new Chromecast now. So there doesn't seem to be anything stopping users from playing Stadia now – other than it not being officially available in the Play Store to download to that device. </p>
<p> You can still download games onto the Chromecast with Google TV, like you would on any Android TV device. But keep in mind the limited storage space on the Chromecast. Because there is so little space available, you won't be able to download a lot of games, like Asphalt. As there's just not enough space. </p>
<p> How much storage is available on Chromecast? And can you expand it? </p>
<p> Speaking of storage, the Chromecast with Google TV comes with only 8GB of storage. You'll have around 5GB of space available out of the box. After installing all of your apps, you'll likely be down to around 4GB of space. </p>
<p> You can technically expand the storage on Chromecast. As it does plug in via USB-C, and as we've seen already, USB-C hubs do work on the Chromecast. So you could theoretically get a USB-C hub and plug it into the Chromecast, and plug in a hard drive that way. But installing apps likely won't be possible, because they can only be installed on internal storage. But that storage is good for running something like a Plex server on your Chromecast. Or something else that plays local files. </p>
<p> Can I use headphones with Chromecast? </p>
<p> Yes, you are able to use a pair of Bluetooth headphones to listen to movies and shows from Chromecast. </p>
<p> This is a feature that Roku has made pretty popular, and it's good to see other devices sporting it as well. </p>
<p> To set this up, head to the settings menu, and pair a new device. You can pair another Bluetooth device to your Chromecast, whether that is a Bluetooth remote, game controller or a pair of headphones. Unfortunately, Bluetooth is the only option for using headphones here. As there is no headphone jack on the Chromecast. </p>
<p> This means that you're going to be able to watch the game without waking up your kids or significant other, as long as you don't scream at the TV when your team turns over the ball. </p>
<p> How much is Chromecast with Google TV? </p>
<p> Chromecast with Google TV is on sale now for $49.99. </p>
<p> It's likely that it will be discounted during the holiday season, possibly down to $35-$40. </p>
<p> It's right in-line with the competition from Roku and Amazon Fire TV. Their 4K models are also around $40-$50. Making it a lot more competitive than something like the NVIDIA SHIELD TV, which is almost as expensive as the Apple TV 4K. </p>
<p> Google offers the Chromecast with Google TV in three colors: snow, sand and sky. Which are basically white, kind of orange and light blue. There is no black Chromecast this year, due to the fact that Google made the Chromecast entirely out of recycled plastics. It would have been nice to have one that blended in with the back of your TV, but a 100% recycled Chromecast is definitely a better aspect. </p>
<p> Where can I buy the Chromecast? </p>
<p> You can buy the Chromecast with Google TV from the Google Store, Best Buy, B&H Photo, The Home Depot, Target and Walmart. </p>
<p> Other retailers will likely start selling the Chromecast with Google TV in the near future. </p>
<p> What comes in the box? </p>
<p> The packaging for the Chromecast with Google TV is pretty simple. It comes with the Chromecast, as well as the USB-A to USB-C cable and wall charger for charging. There is also the remote and two AAA batteries included. It's quite surprising to see batteries included in the box, normally those are sold separately. </p>
<p> Google also went as far as to color-code the batteries that come with the Chromecast with Google TV. So the Snow model has white batteries, sky has blue batteries and so forth. It's that attention to detail that makes Google, Google. </p>

<p> The Chromecast With Google TV Replaces The Chromecast Ultra </p>
<p> With the new Chromecast having been announced this morning there are now three versions of the Chromecast you can buy, which are the $30 Chromecast, the $70 Chromecast Ultra, and the new $50 Chromecast with Google TV. </p>
<p> Except the new Chromecast with Google TV basically replaces the Chromecast Ultra. According to a new report from 9To5Google, the Chromecast Ultra will no longer be sold. At least not in the same capacity as it used to be. </p>
<p> Google will instead focus on selling the $30 and $50 models. Both of which will stay available from Google and Google's retail partners. So what's happening with the Chromecast Ultra? It's only available with a very specific purchase. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Chromecast with Google TV is the new standard while the Ultra only comes with Stadia </p>
<p> Those who have purchased the Stadia Premiere Edition or Founders Edition bundles will know that they come with a Chromecast Ultra inside the box. </p>
<p> This is so you can connect Stadia up to your TV and play games in a console-like fashion. Going forward, buying the Stadia Premiere Edition bundle is the only way you'll be able to get a hold of the Chromecast Ultra officially. </p>
<p> Google's retail partners, like Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Amazon, and others, will no longer sell the device. It's even out of stock as a standalone item already. So the only way to get one without purchasing the Stadia bundle is through third-party resellers. Assuming there are any. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's just no reason to buy the Chromecast Ultra anymore </p>
<p> Google has a good reason for not selling the Chromecast Ultra as a standalone product anymore. </p>
<p> The new Chromecast with Google TV is just that much better. And it's cheaper. So there's really no reason to go for the Ultra. The new Chromecast not only supports 4K content, but it comes with a bunch of stuff the Ultra doesn't. </p>
<p> First there's the remote. This is the first Chromecast out of every model that's been released that comes with one. And it adds a lot to the experience via new ways to find and navigate content. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It also comes in multiple colors, and it features Google TV. Not to mention that less expensive price point. So, the only people who really benefit from the Chromecast Ultra are Stadia users. </p>
<p> Eventually, Stadia will come to the new Chromecast with Google TV. Sometime in 2021. And around that time is when Google will likely look to officially discontinue the Ultra. Until then, it'll be available for Stadia Premiere Edition buys only. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Clip Studio Paint Is Coming To Galaxy Tab S7, S7+ On Android First </p>
<p> Clip Studio Paint Is Coming To Galaxy Tab S7, S7+ On Android First </p>
<p> Clip Studio Paint is finally coming to Android and will be arriving on the new Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+ first. More concisely, it's arriving there first as a timed-exclusive, according to recent reports stemming from Samsung's announcement. That means that, at least for a time following the new tablets' launch, it won't be available anywhere else. </p>
<p> Samsung hasn't provided in-depth information about the exclusivity period. But at least some clues might be found in the details about associated deals. Specifically, Samsung indicates that it's going to be offering a free trial for the app's subscription service for buyers. That's a 6-month Clip Studio Paint EX subscription at no cost with the Galaxy Tab S7 and S7+. The app will also be pre-installed on the new tablets. </p>
<p> So the exclusivity period could also run as long as 6-months before Clip Studio Paint is available on other devices. </p>

<p> What is Clip Studio Paint on the Galaxy Tab S7 series? </p>
<p> Now, Samsung's new Galaxy Tab S7 and S7+ are undeniably going to be the best devices to experience Clip Studio Paint or the subscription. That's down to the 11-inch and 12.4-inch displays having a 120Hz refresh rate. But also because the new S-Pen is redesigned to look and feel like a real pen. The company has even reduced input latency from over 40ms to around 9ms. </p>
<p> The fully-featured graphics and art software from Japanese company Celsys. It's meant for use to design and draw comics, general illustration, and 2D animations. And there are two subscription levels that pack in more features. First, the company offers a "Pro" variant that's made for character art, concept art, and illustrations. The mobile-friendly EX subscription is billed as being better for "manga & comics, animations" according to the company's site. </p>
<p> But in either case, this is a very popular art app with over seven million users as of 2015. And it should integrate nicely with the new S Pen on both Samsung tablets better than anywhere else on Android. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How much is this deal worth for users? </p>
<p> The subscription detailed above, on iOS devices, typically costs around $8.99 per month for a single device across all available platforms. Or around $2.49 per month for a single iPhone. Now, for use across multiple devices simultaneously, the cost of the subscription license is higher. It can rise as high as $14.99 per month for four devices to have access. And it isn't immediately clear which subscription Samsung is providing. </p>
<p> While pricing on Android won't necessarily be the same as iOS, that potentially puts the deal's value at between $14.94 and $89.94. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Cyberpunk 2077 On Stadia Confirmed To Launch On November 19 </p>
<p> Cyberpunk 2077 On Stadia Confirmed To Launch On November 19 </p>
<p> Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the games coming to Stadia that is highly anticipated and has been since it was revealed for the platform. </p>
<p> Today, the game's publisher CD Projekt Red officially confirmed that it will launch on November 19. For Stadia this is a day and date launch with all other platforms where Cyberpunk 2077 is being released. That includes PS4, Xbox One, and PC. </p>
<p> This is not the first game to get a simultaneous release on Stadia either. DOOM Eternal launched back on March 20 of this year. And it released on PC, PS4, and Xbox One on the same day. Assassin's Creed Valhalla will be releasing day and date on Stadia as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All of these are big-budget games coming from AAA studios. And although Cyberpunk 2077 has been speculated to launch for Google's cloud gaming platform at the same time as other platforms, it was never officially confirmed before today. This is big for Stadia and its user base. </p>
<p> Cyberpunk 2077 is already available for pre-order on Stadia </p>
<p> If you like to get a jump on things, you can pre-order the game on Stadia right this second. Or any time before the game launches on November 19. As with other platforms, the Stadia version retails for $59.99 in the US. </p>
<p> Pre-orders on Stadia weren't always a thing. Google added the capability earlier this Fall though. And now it seems to be releasing pre-order availability for other big games. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can also pre-order Hitman 3, Immortals: Fenyx Rising, and Destiny 2's Beyond Light expansion. Chances are you may be able to pre-order Assassin's Creed Valhalla before long too. </p>
<p> The game should be available to play at 1AM </p>
<p> According to the Stadia pre-order page, players should be able to dive into the game at 1AM. This is presumably Pacific Standard Time but the listing doesn't specify. So it could just as easily be Eastern. </p>
<p> That timing makes things a tad bit interesting. Because the game releases on November 19, that means it should be available for anyone on consoles at midnight if they preload the game. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Many people who plan to pick this up on PC, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One will no doubt make the attempt to preload it. Should they succeed to have it preloaded before the launch, they'll be playing as soon as it goes live. </p>
<p> Which means they can technically play an hour before users on the Stadia platform. This is only a difference of an hour so it's not likely to be a very big deal for many Stadia players. It's simply an interesting decision. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Cyberpunk 2077 is coming to @GoogleStadia on November 19th! </p>
<p> This means you will be able to explore Night City across your favorite devices instantly right when the game becomes available. Pre-order now at: https://t.co/UOqkinGRHB pic.twitter.com/ZwNav1d5fJ </p>

<p> DoorCam 2 Review: Next Generation Over-The-Door Smart Camera </p>
<p> DoorCam2 is the new updated version of the over-the-door smart security camera from remo+. </p>
<p> Occasionally fuzzy video for the first second or two </p>
<p> Lack of ability to pause notifications </p>
<p> remo+ provided Android Headlines with a review unit of the DoorCam2. This review was written after using the device for more than 7 days. </p>
<p> DoorCam2 is the new version of the over-the-door smart security camera from remo+. Back in 2018 AH reviewed their initial plug and play camera called DoorCam. </p>
<p> We are all shopping a lot online these days in the COVID-19 era. At the same time, we see lots of interesting and terrible things happen with our purchases. These range from downright theft to mishandling by the delivery drivers. The rise in online shopping, coupled with the issues related to the delivery of goods has led to a sudden bump in the popularity of door security devices. </p>
<p> Remo+ is trying to carve out a niche for themselves in the door security device arena. The DoorCam2 has a lot of upgrades over the first generation DoorCam. Most of the upgrades improve the overall functionality and versatility of this smart security camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In this review, we will look at all the new upgrades in the new DoorCam2. But before that let's do the unboxing first. </p>
<p> Unboxing the DoorCam2 </p>
<p> Probably the most impressive part of the unboxing experience is the packaging design. Some very creative engineering went into creating the cardboard insert to house all the components in a compact form while protecting them during shipping. But I digress, so let's see what's actually inside the box. </p>
<p> Inside the box you will find the DoorCam 2, a Quick Start Manual, a Protected by Remo+ sticker, three D-Cell batteries, 2 types of screws and a hex wrench. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> DoorCam2 Specs </p>
<p> DoorCam2 consists of a 1/2.8-inch Color CMOS sensor with a 160-degree viewing angle. The camera supports Full HD (1920 x 1080), HD (1280 x 720), and VGA (640 x 480) resolutions with 30 fps maximum. Additionally, the remo+ DoorCam2 has a built-in mic and speaker for two-way audio and IR Night Vision with visibility of up to 3 meters. The app supports Android version 5 and above with support for phone and tablet. For those wanting this to use on Apple devices, the app also supports iPhone and iPad running iOS 11 and above. </p>
<p> The dimensions have changed slightly this time around. DoorCam2 body measures 5.2-inches by 1.7-inches by 5.3-inches, while the camera portion measures in at 6.4-inches by 2.6-inches by 2.5-inches. The weight is 1.2 lbs and is IPX4 with an operating temperature range of 0°F to 122°F. </p>
<p> Hardware & Design </p>
<p> DoorCam2 just like the previous version will surprise you with its size. Keep in mind that the smaller module housing the camera and sensors will be on the outside. The rear half of the camera housing the batteries, Wi-Fi antenna, and control module will be on the inside. Since the antenna is inside the home it helps with increased Wi-Fi connectivity, specifically with metal doors. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It is still an easy-to-install, easy-to-use smart door camera. The first-generation device was only for push-to-enter doors. DoorCam2 can be used with either push or pull to enter doors and even swing doors. The antenna is now outside of the device providing a stronger signal and better connectivity. Another improvement is in the camera resolution area which has been bumped up from 720p to 1080p (Full HD) with improved night vision. Motion detection gets improved with faster detection speeds and video sensing. DoorCam2 has two Passive Infrared (PIR) detectors in place of one in the first generation. Weatherproof rating has been bumped up from IPX2 to IPX4. </p>
<p> Improvements also include the ability to power the device via battery or USB and a stronger signal Wi-Fi chipset. To round out the list of improvements is free 3-day rolling cloud backup. </p>
<p> Overall the construction quality is quite robust and ergonomic. No sharp corners or edges, no creaks or squeaks, and the surface is a non-slippery matte finish. Best of all the price of the DoorCam2 remains unchanged at $199 per unit compared to DoorCam along with the host of improvements listed above. </p>

<p> DoorCam2 Installation </p>
<p> Getting the DoorCam2 setup and installed is fairly easy and quick. Just slide the bracket over your door, that's it. </p>
<p> The quick start guide shows compatibility with various door types so double-check clearances before installation. There might be a possibility of mounting the unit off-center depending on the type of your door. No wires of any kind anywhere give it a clean look. This is presuming that you want to run the unit on battery power alone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now since this camera is an over-the-door type, it needs to be borne in mind that all video is captured from an elevated position. So unlike a peephole camera, you will not be seeing the subject at eye-level. This is not a deal-breaker since most doorbell cameras look at the subject from waist height so in the overall scheme of this I think this issue is a wash. But overall installation is far easier than a doorbell camera or a peephole camera. One thing to remember prior to installing this camera is that if you have a screen door it may not close completely and it will block the view of the camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As you can see from the pictures, I placed the camera on my metal front door. Installation was easy. First, I put the DoorCam 2 over the door and adjusted the bracket for the door’s thickness. Then I proceeded to install it per the manufacturer's instruction with the included screws. I also used tape over the bracket to prevent any scratches on the door frame. Since I have a solid door without any glass opening, I decided to keep the camera in the middle of the door. </p>
<p> DoorCam2 remained in place and did not move despite the door being slammed shut repeatedly throughout the day. Ah, the joys of young kids banging doors shut. Again, your particular situation may be slightly different than my experience with the installation and setup. </p>
<p> Setting up the remo+ App </p>
<p> Setup process is a breeze and takes a few minutes without running into any major hiccups. As soon as the unit has power (battery or USB) the Wi-Fi signal starts broadcasting. Open the Wi-Fi settings on your smartphone or tablet, download the appropriate version of the app (Android or iOS) and then use the app to connect the DoorCam2 to your Wi-Fi network. As soon as the DoorCam2 is connected to your Wi-Fi signal it is good to go. In my particular case, from start to finish this took less than 5 minutes on my Pixel 4XL. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The following steps happened in sequential order – downloading the app, creating an account, linking the unit to my home Wi-Fi network, and patching the device with the latest firmware. Definitely a very fast and painless process indeed. One thing to note is that when setting up the device the first time, make sure to select DoorCam2 in the app. If by mistake you select the older version DoorCam, you will get an error. </p>
<p> DoorCam2 allows 5 viewers per account and also you can have 5 devices activated per account. So if you have more than 5 camera units or more than 5 family members wanting to view the activity then this might be a problem. </p>
<p> DoorCam2 day-to-day performance is excellent </p>
<p> I was curious about its performance as the setup was probably one of the easiest things ever. Here are my observations after having used this home security device for over a week. As soon as the camera detects someone it starts recording a short clip. The video quality along with the audio quality is extremely good. </p>
<p> My front door faces the street and there were no issues with the reliability of the motion detection from cars driving by or neighbors out for a walk. I did not encounter any false motion detection notifications. </p>
<p> Notifications on the app are pretty much instantaneous. However, if you open and close the door multiple times in a short time interval, notifications will stack up quickly. </p>
<p> Once you see the notification pop up on your phone you can tap it to launch the Live View with the talk options. Tap the TALK (green button) icon and you can activate the two-way audio feature to speak to the person on the other side of the door. I tested this feature on Wi-Fi and cellular data while chatting with the person at the door without issues. The audio quality was surprisingly quite reasonable as far as communicating with the delivery person. </p>
<p> The remo+ app is basic but works very well. It doesn't require too many steps to figure out the inner workings of the DoorCam2 operation. Once you are set up your account and are signed into the app it is quite easy to control the device. As soon as you tap a notification – live or at a later time – it brings you to the main page which shows a listing of all motion detections along with the respective video clip. With the newer DoorCam2, remo+ has included free 3-day cloud storage for accessing older video clips. It would be nice if remo+ would allow you to access your account via a desktop browser. </p>
<p> Tapping the top left corner brings up the menu. This includes links to devices, user account, as well as details on who has access to the camera. The app can connect to the various devices from remo+ and there are dedicated app pages for each device. Clicking on the Devices tab brings me to my DoorCam2 page. That tab shows battery life, as well as settings for video quality, notifications, night mode, speaker volume, and motion sensor. Unlike the previous generation, this version of the app has a Start Live View button in the settings and on the main page of the app. </p>
<p> The app now has a separate setting for each motion sensor. In my use case, I left them both on the medium setting. If you get a lot of false motion detection notifications you can adjust these individually till you get satisfactory results. </p>
<p> One thing I did wish for was a feature to pause notifications for a fixed period of time. In cases when you know that there are going to be repeated motion detections, such as loading the car for a trip or unloading the car after a Costco outing, the notifications can get annoying. There is, however, the ability to regulate the frequency of push notifications. You can also turn them off completely but then you need to remember to run them back on. </p>
<p> Slamming the door causes the first second of the video to be a bit fuzzy. Other than that I did not encounter any issues. Daylight screengrabs show a reasonable amount of detail and clarity, the audio quality in the video is great as well. </p>
<p> Nighttime video is black and white but still provides decent clarity. See the picture below for a neighborhood cat roaming our front yard at 3 AM. </p>
<p> One word would describe the installation and day-to-day use of this device – simple. But that does not mean that the app doesn't provide enough granular level control for the device. In summary, remo+ DoorCam2 is an excellent smart security camera. </p>
<p> Should you consider DoorCam2 from remo+ for your home? </p>
<p> DoorCam2 is an excellent plug and play security camera. Whether you are a renter or a homeowner this is an easy-to-install product. Best of all there are no wires to mess with. The setup and operation are easily done in less than 15 minutes from start to finish. </p>
<p> Overall performance is great in terms of notifications, video, and audio quality. False motion detections are a non-issue with this newer DoorCam2. Build quality is quite robust and the device has IPX4 weatherproof rating. </p>
<p> There are a couple of minor issues such as the elevated mounting position and occasional fuzzy video for the first second. Other than that this is a very reliable over-the-frame door security camera. </p>
<p> Aside from these minor quirks, the remo+ DoorCam2 is a door security camera that should be on your shortlist. </p>

<p> Dragon Touch Max 10 Review – Perplexingly Good, Definitely Not Great </p>
<p> Dragon Touch Max 10 has its highlights as a budget contender but highlights the severe gap between affordable and premium tiers of the Android tablet space. </p>
<p> $149.99 </p>
<p> Rating </p>
<p> Pros </p>
<p> Audio volume is so bad it's almost impossible to discern quality </p>
<p> Poor speaker placement for their volume </p>
<p> The camera is barely serviceable </p>
<p> Battery doesn't last long and takes a long time to charge </p>
<p> Android Headlines recently received a Dragon Touch Max 10 tablet for review. And the results of the thorough test really showcase why users are flocking to high-end hardware instead of budget devices. Although there are plenty of things to love about this tablet, especially at its $149.99 price tag, there's a lot not to love too. </p>
<p> At this bracket of the market, not only are users typically more likely to see white-label devices. They also are going to see a lot of trade-offs. That's not just with Dragon Touch either. That's with just about every OEM. Whether on battery life, screen technology, cameras, build quality, or audio, tablets in this segment just haven't matured as well as Android phones. </p>
<p> Conversely, these devices do serve as a great entry point for those who might be curious about Android itself. Or for those who need a tablet that will be well-suited for their children or as a secondary device. It's also no slouch when it comes to overall performance. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While imperfect, there are plenty of redeeming factors that have saved this gadget from receiving a lower rating. The decision to ultimately award the Dragon Touch Max 10 tablet with 2-stars instead of three comes down to the fact that there are many users who this tablet simply won't work for. The gaps between what it can and cannot do are wide enough that the Dragon Touch Max 10 tablet really is deserving of a deeper review. </p>
<p> The hardware here doesn't stand out a lot compared to others in its segment </p>
<p> Two words can summarize the build of just about any Android tablet in the sub $300 segment. Those are, of course, 'plastic' and 'glass'. Here, the former material is used effectively everywhere except the screen. And that brings both negative and positive characteristics with it. </p>
<p> Starting with positive aspects, the Dragon Touch Max 10 was a comfortable tablet to use under review. A rounded curve at each corner and along each edge helps offset the weight of its 10-inch design. The plastics are smooth and decidedly not a soft-touch material. The only accents are the ports and buttons as well as the textured lip along the top and bottom. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To the left of the camera, part of that can be peeled away to reveal a microSD card slot, for adding up to 128GB of storage. That's sturdy and well held in place. The 3.5mm and USB-C ports and buttons are too. Each has a satisfying click and almost no wiggle. </p>
<p> But not everything here is perfect and those who want to give this tablet to younger users will want to be aware that it isn't the most solid build on the market. Not only did I notice a gap begin to appear between the front and rear panels and the edge after just a week of daily use. That's represented in the gallery above along the button-less edge. </p>
<p> I also heard quite a lot of creaking from this gadget during use. Such as when picking the tablet up or pressing the screen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All of that dilutes the level of confidence it's possible to have in the overall build or the longevity of this tablet. </p>
<p> The display could be brighter but it doesn't disappoint </p>
<p> Carrying forward to the 'glass' side of this tablet is the 10.1-inch FullHD+ display panel. And that's going to be a highlight for this device with one major caveat. Namely, this tablet really isn't well-suited for outdoor use. In fact, brightness couldn't be turned down by much, even indoors, if I wanted to maintain an enjoyable experience. But where it is bright enough for use, the screen is more than good enough for a tablet in its price bracket. </p>
<p> To begin with, the screen was responsive and smooth. Despite having a screen protector installed out-of-the-box, I didn't notice any latency in touch interactions at all. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The colors are also vivid across each of the 1200 x 1920 pixels with only minimal light-bleed to speak of. Instead, what it offered was an enjoyable experience whether I was playing Doom Eternal via Google Stadia or watching a movie. </p>
<p> Of course, this tablet's display doesn't have the best refresh rate either but, at under $150, that's not unexpected. It seems to run fairly close on that front to a display running 60Hz. Or at least the experience is similar. The company's listings for this tablet don't betray the details. So I couldn't know for sure. </p>
<p> Regardless, this display makes for a great indoor experience, even if it can't be used properly outdoors on a particularly sunny day. And that's aided in part by the fact that the bezel is wide enough for comfortable holding. And by the fact that the ratio is such that any letterboxing is kept to a bare minimum. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Performance from Dragon Touch Max 10 is much better than expected </p>
<p> Now, the Dragon Touch Max 10 review unit sent to me was the 3GB RAM, 32GB storage variant. It can also be purchased with just 2GB RAM and 16GB storage. And I can't attest to the viability of that other variant. This tablet already skirts the lower reaches of what's really acceptable in a modern tablet or phone running Android. </p>
<p> With that said, its 64-bit octa-core processor in this version proved more than capable of handling day-to-day use. From web-browsing to email and video calls, there wasn't any latency or lag except under the most strenuous multi-tasking circumstances. Even gaming apps such as Call of Duty didn't cause too many glitches or hang-ups unless the in-game settings were adjusted from the optimized default. </p>
<p> Lighter multitasking also goes off without a hitch with the Dragon Touch Max 10. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One area where I did notice big slow-downs was in video editing and photo editing apps. That's hardly surprising since some tasks in those types of apps are enough to slow down even flagships. But it is worth being aware of. Those are absolutely not going to be brilliant experiences with this gadget. </p>
<p> Battery life with Dragon Touch Max 10 is not great </p>
<p> Battery life is, without exception, subjective. What I saw during my battery test, putting the Dragon Touch Max 10 tablet through a review, is not going to be 'typical'. But testing does provide some insight into how long a device will last. And how long it will take to charge. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, battery life is likely the second-most-obnoxious aspect of this tablet too. Just behind the audio experience and the camera. And that became immediately apparent after it took over three hours to charge up from dead. Despite utilizing USB-C, in fact, it took 3-hours and 15-minutes to go from zero-percent to full. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the draining side of things, I wasn't actually able to conduct as intensive a test as I would ordinarily either. That's because the total screen-on time only rang in at 3-hours and 23-minutes. For the battery test segment of my review, I set the screen brightness at its maximum and turned off all battery-saving features. So it may be possible to get a bit more than that. </p>
<p> But it's also worth noting that within the 2-hours and 36-minutes I first spent streaming music and then a video with the screen on, the battery fell from 100-percent to just 36-percent. I then spent some time with the device on standby, at 13-hours and 10-minutes, to be exact. 6-hours of screen-off time drained the battery by 3-percent. And just 47-minutes of gaming killed the battery entirely. </p>
<p> Put simply, Dragon Touch Max 10 absolutely requires headphones </p>
<p> The audio experience from this Dragon Touch Max 10 review can best and most simply be summed up as quiet. Now, audio from the mics and via the headphone jack is as expected. That is to say, the performance there is on par with just about any budget- or mid-range smartphone. The same holds true for Bluetooth audio. But the experience from the speakers is outright terrible. </p>
<p> Not only could I not turn down the volume from its maximum during my test. It was still almost inaudible even when just held at arm's length. The tablet was still very clearly making sounds and, for some frequencies, it was still easy enough to discern. But the overwhelming majority of sounds didn't come through clearly. </p>
<p> Making matters worse is the placement of the speakers. The Dragon Touch Max 10 houses larger-than-average-looking speaker grilles. The company placed two of them along the bottom edge. But both are both quiet and placed in such a way that it's difficult to cup the speaker ports to amplify the sound better. They're arranged along the bottom edge. </p>
<p> So the tablet would need to be held with both hands along the bottom edge to become clearly audible. And the results were just not great. Anybody buying this tablet will absolutely need headphones, whether Bluetooth or wired. </p>
<p> In fact, the audio is so bad in terms of volume that it's difficult to even ascertain how bad it is on quality. </p>
<p> Software is clean and admirably minimal </p>
<p> On the software front, Dragon Touch Max 10 offers a clean experience in a way that's wholly unlike almost any other device I've had to review. And that's a decidedly positive thing, given the low storage capacity and other factors. </p>
<p> Summarily, this tablet only comes with a total of 23 apps installed. Those are, as shown above, almost exclusively Google apps. Even Google's RCS chat-enhanced Messages is making an appearance. There are a couple of utilities too. Such as a Calculator, FM Radio, Sound Recorder, and Screen Capture Tool. But everything else about this tablet is pure stock. </p>
<p> That's down to the Settings app and the underlying capabilities too. </p>
<p> The sole caveat to that stock-experience goodness that everybody knows and loves, is in its execution. More specifically, this is an Android 9 stock experience instead of an Android 10 experience. And, unlike some high-end tablets, the Dragon Touch Max 10 isn't guaranteed, necessarily, to get any updates. Or at least not firmware updates. </p>
<p> There will be security updates, as a matter of course. That's required as part of Google Play Services, which are very prominently included here. But there's almost no way to know whether this will ever see Android 10, let alone the upcoming Android 11 update. So users who absolutely want to look elsewhere if they need that. </p>
<p> With that said, the low-maintenance and easy-to-use stock Android that is included, definitely earns Dragon Touch Max 10 some bonus points. </p>
<p> Connections are strong enough for a lag-free Stadia experience </p>
<p> Now, we've discussed performance with this tablet and you may have noticed that an image showcasing Google Stadia was used for that segment. That's not a mistake. While a streaming service like Stadia doesn't necessarily depend on internal processors, it is fairly intensive in another way. Namely, on the connectivity front. And I actually played a fair amount of games on the platform during my review of the Dragon Touch Max 10. </p>
<p> It's also worth pointing out that while this tablet includes dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, it's not the latest iteration of either of those. So this won't offer the very best experience on that front. Similarly, the screen brightness issue and audio problems do reduce the enjoyment, at least out-of-the box. </p>
<p> With that said, stacking in accessories and getting online indoors changes things. The connections here across both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi were stronger than expected. And that will, at the very least, make those kinds of use-cases viable. Specifically, the Dragon Touch Max 10 supports 802.11 a/b/g/n. And on the Bluetooth front, it's Bluetooth 4.2. So the latter offers solid audio quality, if not the latest audio features. </p>
<p> USB-C is also supported, just in case an accessory (or charger) needs to be plugged in. </p>
<p> Don't buy any Android tablet for its camera, at least not yet </p>
<p> If there's a single thing that can be proven by Dragon Touch Max 10 in this review, at least as far as the cameras, it's that there's still no 'great' tablet for cameras. With this tablet, they're downright "abysmal," as shown in our sample gallery via Flickr. </p>
<p> While that's not unusual for an Android tablet at any cost, not even exceptionally expensive tablets such as the Samsung Galaxy A-series, those gadgets do perform noticeably better than this one. That's across the board too, from clarity and color accuracy to versatility. In fact, this is the sole aspect of the Dragon Touch Max 10 that feels utterly pointless in practice. </p>
<p> Now, that statement likely comes across as harsh. But the truth is that even budget Android smartphones offer genuinely decent camera experiences. But the photos snapped with this tablet are either washed out or too dark. Or, in some cases, both. And that didn't necessarily improve when I went indoors. </p>
<p> The company includes a dual-array snapper in this device. But, even with some serious digging across the official website and retail listings, the megapixel-rating remained elusive. Amazon lists the primary rear snapper at 8-megapixels. </p>
<p> It's also not immediately clear why the cameras are so bad. There's a chance it's a simple software optimization problem since HDR mode does actually start to fix — though not nearly enough — the problems. It's equally possible the problem is with the hardware itself. </p>
<p> Should you buy this Dragon Touch tablet? </p>
<p> The short answer here is going to be a firm 'no', based on the battery life and the build quality alone. The problems with the camera are primarily down to the fact that cameras in Android tablets simply aren't great. But that assessment is going to come with some caveats of its own. </p>
<p> If all that's needed is a tablet that can last a few hours and provide a bit of entertainment, the Dragon Touch Max 10 could be perfect. Especially for younger users who don't necessarily need something that lasts all day long. On the performance front, the Dragon Touch Max 10 didn't disappoint at all during my review. And its screen, despite being surrounded by heavy bezels and comparatively dim, is more than serviceable. </p>
<p> And it does those things well for under $150, after all. </p>
<p> So, whether or not the tablet is ultimately worth the purchase price will be entirely dependent on whether or not it fits a buyer's needs. For at least some, that's going to be a firm "yes." </p>

<p> Echo & Tile Devices Are Compatible With Amazon Sidewalk </p>
<p> Amazon has confirmed that Echo and Tile devices will be compatible with its new neighborhood WiFi system Amazon Sidewalk. As reported by Engadget, Amazon sidewalk will launch "later this year" and now has more functionality by its ability to work with Echo and Tile devices. </p>
<p> This makes for a busy few weeks for Amazon with lots going on in the company. First, the company rebranded its software aimed at children by naming it Amazon Kids and Kids+. This move aims to make the software and products more appealing as well as accessible. </p>
<p> The company also sent out invites to its exclusive fall hardware event in the middle of September. No one knows exactly what will be featured here but it is still exciting news nonetheless. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon Sidewalk will be compatible with most devices </p>
<p> The idea behind Amazon Sidewalk is to provide IoT devices with a connection even if they are far away from your WiFi router. Sidewalk should be able to use 900 MHz spectrum with LoRa to extend WiFi networks. This then allows them to reach devices normally out of range. </p>
<p> For example products such as lights at the end of your driveway and or speakers at the end of gardens would get coverage. The aim is for WiFi to pass through what will be known as 'Sidewalk bridges' to reach these products. This would take the form of Ring Spotlight Cams and Echo products, for example. </p>
<p> The end result would allow these devices to connect to nearby networks through those Bridge devices. Then, in turn, allow neighborhoods to join together create a community network powered by WiFi routers. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Details still thin on the ground for Amazon Sidewalk </p>
<p> Although there is much we do know about Amazon Sidewalk, many crucial details still remain a mystery. For example, there has been no indication of when it will release. The only indication we have got is that it will be "later this year". </p>
<p> Ring Floodlight and Spotlight Cams will receive a notification to provide more information on participating and setting their control preferences. This same should get given to Echo customers as well. </p>
<p> Customers who have 'Sidewalk bridge devices' can opt-out of the scheme. This will not affect the functionality of anyone's device, according to Amazon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company has also made assurances that this system will be secure. It claims the platform uses three layers of encryption to keep everyone's data safe. However, such a sharing scheme will worry some customers, hence, why the option to opt-out is there and may be taken up by quite a few customers. </p>

<p> eero 6 & eero Pro 6 Announced With Support For WiFi 6 </p>
<p> In Amazon's big fall hardware event today, the company took the wraps off of a pair of new eero mesh WiFi systems. The eero 6 and eero Pro 6. These both support WiFi 6, as well as a number of other new features. </p>
<p> The eero 6 and eero Pro 6 are both Mesh WiFi Routers that support WiFi 6 and Zigbee. Making it an all-in-one hub to control your smart home products, through your router. Instead of needing another base in your home. </p>
<p> In addition to WiFi 6, both eeros also support WiFi 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Making it future-proof at least for a little while. Like other mesh WiFi routers, it will still be able to move devices from band to band, to keep your WiFi network running smoothly. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The eero 6 series come with a slightly new design. It appears to have a slightly more bulbous design this time. But it should still fit where the old eero is. Or whever you place your current router. </p>
<p> eero 6 maintains dual gigabit ethernet ports </p>
<p> For the power users, the eero 6 does maintain the dual gigabit ethernet ports on each model. So you are able to still plug directly into your router and get the fastest speeds possible. </p>
<p> This is great if you have a slower network, or have a lot of devices on your network. As you can plug your laptop into the eero and get as much bandwidth as possible. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additionally, eero can handle more than 75 devices simultaneously. That should be plenty, even for those with loads of smart home products in their home and connected to their network. And because it is a mesh network, it's going to be able to handle all of these devices easier without slowing down your network. </p>
<p> eero 6 is designed to fit homes up to 1,500 square-feet per eero, and can do internet connections of up to 500Mbps. While the eero Pro 6 can do up to 2,000 square-feet per eero. And is a true tri-band router. </p>
<p> How much is the new eero? </p>
<p> The eero 6 is going to start at $129, and the eero Pro 6 will start at $229. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pre-orders for both models open up today. And as was the case with the previous eeros, you'll be able to add onto your network and expand it, if you need more space. You can purchase the eero 6 with two extenders for $279. Or get a single extender for $89. Allowing you to easily expand your network if one just isn't enough for your home. And you are finding you still have some deadspots. </p>

<p> EISA Awards 2020-2021: Samsung, OnePlus, Oppo, Huawei & Sony, All Win </p>
<p> The Expert Imaging and Sound Association (EISA) have just announced their 2020-2021 awards for best mobile devices of the year. Here are the winners: </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 Pro has grabbed the Best Smartphone award. The latest OnePlus flagship "raises the bar for high-end smartphones," EISA notes. The judges were particularly impressed with the device's 120Hz display that offers QHD+ resolution, IP68 dust and water resistance rating, and its "soft-touch finish." </p>
<p> The company's Warp Charge 30 Wireless technology, which can charge up to 50 percent of the 4,510mAh battery in just 30 minutes, was also a factor in deciding the winner. "This device puts the ‘smart’ into smartphone," the judges note. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> EISA is a group comprising 61 of the world’s most respected consumer electronics magazines from 29 countries around the world. </p>
<p> EISA Awards 2020-2021 winners </p>
<p> The OPPO Find X2 Pro picked up the Best Advanced Smartphone award at EISA Awards 2020-2021. Once again, its 6.7-inch AMOLED HDR 120Hz display left the judges very impressed. Capacious 512 GB internal storage, triple camera system, and 65W fast charging make the Find X2 Pro "OPPO’s best smartphone yet." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Best Smartphone Camera award went to Huawei's P40 Pro. The device features a 50-megapixel primary camera with phase detection auto-focus and optical image stabilization (OIS). There's also a 12-megapixel periscope telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom, a 40-megapixel ultra-wide "Cine Camera," and a ToF 3D depth sensor on the back of the Huawei P40 Pro. This phone "snaps stunning daily photos and night shots of unmatched quality without unwanted noise or aberrations." </p>
<p> Next up is the Best Foldable Smartphone award which was picked up by the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. There literally aren't many devices competing in this category and the Z Flip is certainly a deserving winner. The "old-school" clamshell concept means it becomes half the size when folded. The Galaxy Z Flip is "an inventive, impressive and practical smartphone." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There was one more category for smartphones at EISA Awards 2020-2021. The Sony Xperia 1 II was the pick for the Best Multimedia Smartphone. The judges say this device is "a multimedia powerhouse tailor-made for photo, film, and music enthusiasts." </p>
<p> Sony's advanced Alpha cameras and its Photography Pro and Cinematography Pro features impressed the judges. They also praised the device's 6.5-inch 4K HDR OLED display. Dolby Atmos sound with support for the immersive 360 Reality Audio music format makes this phone ideal for media consumption. With the PlayStation4 DUALSHOCK4 controller, gamers can enjoy console-like gameplay on this device. </p>

<p> How To Enable Dark Mode On The OnePlus 8 </p>
<p> Dark Mode isn't new to the OnePlus 8 series, but in case you've forgotten how to enable it on OnePlus' newest devices, here's how you can do just that. </p>
<p> With dark mode, you're going to be able to save some battery life, as well as reduce eye strain, particularly if you are using it at night. Since the OnePlus 8 series uses OLED displays, it is also able to save battery life with a darker theme. As OLED displays light up pixels individually. So the more black pixels on the screen, the less pixels are lit up and thus conserving battery life. </p>
<p> So even if you prefer the light or colorful mode, this might be a good idea to enable. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to enable dark mode on OnePlus 8 Series </p>
<p> To get started, you're going to want to jump into the Settings app. </p>
<p> Now scroll down to 'Customization'. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Then tap on 'Tone'. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is going to be the first tile on the right side, in the "System Configuration" section. </p>
<p> Here, you can choose from three different tones. These are Colorful, Light and Dark. Colorful isn't as customizable and is, well colorful. Light is your typical theme with lots of white space. Then there is Dark, which does put the OnePlus 8 into dark mode. Using black and different grays. </p>
<p> Once you've selected 'Dark', hit the check mark in the upper-right hand corner to save it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now you'll have Dark Mode on your OnePlus 8 smartphone. </p>
<p> What about Dark Mode 2.0? </p>
<p> OnePlus announced dark mode 2.0 with the 8 series this month. Which essentially allows OnePlus to push more apps into a dark mode. Or rather force them. These would be apps that don't use dark mode already. </p>
<p> You can find this setting by going into the Settings app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Then tapping on 'Utilities'. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now tap on 'OnePlus Laboratory'. </p>
<p> At the bottom, tap on 'Enable dark tone in more apps'. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now just flip the toggle and it'll work in the other apps on your phone that don't use dark mode. </p>
<p> Dark Mode 2.0 works really well actually, for forcing some apps into dark mode. Like with Hangouts for example, it does make the background black with the messages in gray. So they are actually readable. This isn't the first time that there have been options in the software to force dark mode in apps, but it is perhaps the best one out there right now. </p>
<p> But that's how you can enable dark mode on your OnePlus 8 series smartphone. </p>

<p> Get Security With End-To-End Encryption & More Control From Ring </p>
<p> Amazon's Ring has now announced plans to deliver end-to-end encryption for its security product lines. And it's bringing better user controls along for the ride, via Control Center updates meant to enhance both security and privacy. </p>
<p> Of course, there will be one big caveat to the encryption feature too. Users will need to turn on end-to-end encryption for each individual device they want it enabled for. And it won't be available for all devices. The company hasn't detailed exactly which of its devices will be compatible with end-to-end encryption just yet. But it has outlined how that will work. </p>
<p> Once the feature arrives, users will be able to log into the Control Center and enable the feature as described above. Then, Ring will encrypt the directly on the Ring camera in question. And the key to that encryption will be stored only on the user's signed-in mobile device at the same time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That will ensure that only devices allowed by the user can decrypt and view stored recordings. </p>
<p> Here's how Ring user controls are improving security and privacy too </p>
<p> As noted above, the Ring Control Center is getting some significant updates too. And those are arriving today. With the update in place, users can visit a new "Video Encryption" page in the Control Center. That page will walk users through details pertaining to how videos are being protected. </p>
<p> Additionally, Ring users will be able to disable the Neighbors feed. That's the social network-like feature that provides real-time crime and safety alerts. Ring pulls the alerts themselves, as the branding implies, from a user's local area and directly from the police. Now, users will be able to turn that off. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For users that are subscribed to a Ring Protect recording plan, users will also be able to adjust how long the videos stay in the cloud. Videos will be deleted once they hit that user-defined limit. The Amazon-owned company hasn't given any indication as to whether those limits will be completely user-controlled or chosen from Ring-defined options, as of this writing. </p>
<p> When will these features finally arrive? </p>
<p> For the time being, Ring hasn't provided a clear date for users to expect end-to-end encryption to arrive. But the additional security features — stacking on those released in earlier updates and just in time for other, related announcements — should be going live now. End-to-end encryption itself will arrive, at least according to Ring's announcement, "later this year." </p>

<p> Facebook Messenger Gets Revamped With New Logo & Fresh Design </p>
<p> Facebook has been continuously attempting to unify its Instagram app with the Messenger app. And now, the company has pushed a new update that brings new chat themes, custom reactions, and a more colorful logo for Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> Over time, Messenger has received some new features like virtual chat rooms, Watch Together feature, and more. With all these refreshments, the company aims at providing a universal way of connecting with your loved ones. </p>
<p> The official blog post includes a video that highlights the new features that Facebook Messenger has garnered over the years. Moreover, the company aims at shifting to the future of messaging. </p>

<p> In fact, the company is planning to bring support for third-party AR effects to the Messenger app starting next year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Besides, the support for the latest Chat Bubbles has also been added. Note that this feature is a default in the Android 11 OS. So, keeping in mind the current trend the company has included this feature as well. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Facebook Now Suing BlackBerry Over Voice-Messaging Tech Theft </p>
<p> Facebook Now Suing BlackBerry Over Voice-Messaging Tech Theft </p>
<p> Facebook has now seemingly gone on the offensive in an ongoing patent dispute between the social media giant and BlackBerry, filing its own legal suit alleging that as many as six of its patents were stolen by the smartphone company. Among those, Facebook has claimed that a voice messaging technology invented by the company has been used by BlackBerry without permission as well as a method for improving delivery of audio, video, and imagery on mobile devices. The social media company accuses BlackBerry of stealing tech that centers around both the tracking and analysis of GPS data. At present, Facebook hasn't committed to a specific amount of damages it expects to be awarded if its suit turns out to be successful. The case is currently filed with the U.S. District Court Northern District of California under docket number 3:18-cv-05434. </p>
<p> This case actually follows another ongoing dispute between the two companies, filed with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in March under docket number 2:18-cv-01844. In that particular case, BlackBerry accused Facebook and its subsidiaries of infringing on its patents associated with mobile messaging. Those patents included messaging-related features such as in-message timestamps and notification badges. Facebook, for its part, responded initially by accusing the company of patent trolling as a way to compensate for a lack of internal innovation. Meanwhile, at least one of BlackBerry's patents tied to its own case against Facebook has since been invalidated. In particular, the company's messaging timestamp patent was directly challenged by Google recently and dismissed after the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) ruled the UI element in question was unpatentable. </p>
<p> For the time being, none of those previous filings from BlackBerry are expected to go to court until at least 2020 and the remaining patents surrounding the earlier case have not been addressed. The same can also be said of yet another patent case filed by BlackBerry against Nokia which alleges that the company utilized networking technologies that were also patented by BlackBerry. So a similar time-frame for Facebook's newly docketed complaint against the company can probably be expected. </p>

<p> Android News / Facebook VP Says The Company Is "Better Prepared" For U.S. Election </p>
<p> Facebook VP Says The Company Is "Better Prepared" For U.S. Election </p>
<p> Nick Clegg, Facebook vice president in charge of public affairs and communications has praised the company's preparedness for the U.S election. As reported by Le JDD, Clegg cites the 'trama' off the 2016 election as a reason why the company was so motivated to not go through the same thing again. </p>
<p> This all comes as Facebook has taken a number of significant actions against advertisers and users in recent months. Reports firstly suggested that advertising has been limited by the company. Facebook also began removing more users' posts that had connections to Covid-19 and the election. </p>
<p> On top of this, the company stumped up its efforts to encourage users to vote. Facebook created a voting hub which provided information for users. This included accurate information about how to register as well as facts about mail-in voting systems. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Nick Clegg, as reported by The Guardian, has claimed that Facebook removed 2.2 million advertisements seeking to obstruct the election. He cites this as evidence proving Facebook has prepared much better for global events such as this. </p>
<p> Clegg claims Facebook 'better prepared' for U.S. election </p>
<p> Clegg also points out that Facebook has added warnings on over 150 million posts by users concerning misinformation. He points out that Facebook has 35,000 employees taking care of security as of now. </p>
<p> Clegg also points to "established partnerships with 70 specialised media, including five in France, on the verification of information". One of which is AFP. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Facebook has been using Artificial Intelligence to aid its efforts in this area. Clegg says this has "made it possible to delete billions of posts and fake accounts, even before they are reported by users". </p>
<p> The company has also begun storing all advertisements and information on their funding and provenance for seven years. Clegg says this is "to ensure transparency", which is something Facebook has come into criticism for in the past. </p>
<p> This all comes amongst backlash from the Republican party after Facebook blocked blocking links to a New York Post. This article supposedly exposed corrupt dealings by election rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, there were significant questions over the accuracy of this report hence the reason for blocking the link. It does though bring up questions about censorship and free speech which Facebook had wished to champion in the past </p>
<p> Now it looks like the company will air on the side of caution following an advertising walkout back in the summer. This pressure likely requires the company to take more action on any potential spread of misinformation. </p>

<p> Ferrari-Branded Phone May Become A Reality, Courtesy Of Lenovo </p>
<p> It seems like Lenovo is planning to partner up with Ferrari in order to release a Ferrari-branded smartphone. The partnership hasn’t been officially confirmed just yet, but the Vice President of Lenovo Group, Chang Cheng, did share an image of a device with a Ferrari logo via his official Weibo (Chinese social network) account. </p>
<p> Those of you with a keen eye will notice that this is the Lenovo Z6 Pro we’re looking at here, the company’s flagship which was announced quite recently. If we put two and two together, we’ll come to a conclusion that a special edition Lenovo Z6 Pro handset is coming, and it will bear Ferrari’s colors and branding. </p>
<p> It seems like the overall design of the phone will not change, but the back side of the phone will be red-colored, various shades of red, it seems. Both Lenovo’s and Ferrari’s branding will be included on the back. Lenovo’s branding is located in the lower-left portion of the display, while Ferrari’s branding sits in the upper portion of the phone’s back, and it is centered. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You will notice four cameras here, along with some additional sensors. Considering that the Lenovo Z6 Pro got announced last month, we know exactly what to expect here. You’re looking at 48, 16, 8, and 2-megapixel cameras here, plus a ToF (Time-of-Flight) camera. A single 32-megapixel unit will be located on the front side of this phone. </p>
<p> The device will feature a 6.39-inch fullHD+ AMOLED display, presuming that Lenovo doesn’t change some specs here, of course. The phone will be fueled by the Snapdragon 855 64-bit octa-core processor, and it will ship with Android 9 Pie, with ZUI 11 skin on top of it. </p>
<p> A 4,000mAh battery will be included inside of this phone, and it will support 27W fast charging. Dolby Atmos support will be on board, along with a 3.5mm headphone jack, while the phone will include two SIM card slots. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The regular Lenovo Z6 Pro comes in 6GB, 8GB, and 12GB RAM variants, and it’s safe to assume that this special edition model will not be available in all those options. The Ferrari Edition of the Lenovo Z6 Pro will probably ship with 12GB RAM, and that will be the only option that Lenovo will offer. We’re only guessing here, just to be clear. </p>
<p> Presuming that Lenovo is teasing this phone via Weibo, it’s safe to say that it will launch in China first, and it remains to be seen if it will reach any other markets. Ferrari is a well-known brand around the world, so Lenovo will probably want to push this phone to other markets. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Z6 Pro’s international availability has not yet been announced by the company either, so we’re waiting on that info as well. In any case, we’ve already seen several smartphones that carried famous luxury car brandings, like the OnePlus 6T, for example, as it was released in a McLaren edition. It seems like Ferrari wants to get on board as well, though we’re basing all of this on a teaser, even though it’s an official one. Lenovo will probably opt to announce this phone soon, so stay tuned for that. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Files by Google Gets Media Player Volume & Brightness Gesture Controls </p>
<p> Files by Google Gets Media Player Volume & Brightness Gesture Controls </p>
<p> It seems like Google is not done rolling out new features for the Files by Google app. Because, as per a new report, Files by Google is getting media player volume and brightness gesture controls. </p>
<p> Notably, this file manager app was previously called the Files Go, which was available on Android Go devices. However, later in 2017, Google announced Files by Google app as a dedicated file manager app. </p>
<p> Just recently, the File by Google app picked up the safe folder, PDF handler, and video playback speed controls. The video playback speed controls let you swipe on each side of the screen to seek through the video. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And now, some more video playback controls like volume and brightness controls are now pushed for the File by Google app. Well, this is neat as a simple swipe on the screen would dim the brightness and increase/decrease the volume. </p>
<p> This negates the need to press the volume button or pause the video to tweak the brightness from the in-phone brightness control. Interestingly, these same gestures are available on Android's in-built video player. </p>
<p> Besides, third-party apps like VLC, MX Player, etc. had these features, well, since their inception. Which is also one of the reasons people used to download them straight away to consume video content. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Thanks to the latest update, Files by Google brings this feature to the table. And now, users can watch the video right with the in-built video player and swipe to control the media. </p>
<p> The volume controls are on the right and brightness control is on the left side </p>
<p> These new Files by Google media player controls have their specified places for swiping. Notably, the volume can be increased/decreased by swiping on the right side. </p>
<p> While the brightness can be controlled from the left side. Basically, it is the same as that of MX Player. So, if you are familiar with swiping controls for the MX Player, then you know what we are talking about. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Good thing is that the Files by Google media controls works without any hiccups, whether you are watching content in portrait on landscape mode. </p>
<p> Meaning that you can watch the content as it has been actually shot. And use the media controls to tweak the in-content brightness or volume by swiping. </p>
<p> These new File by Google media controls have been spotted on the app version 1.0.332273520. Moreover, this app version was pushed towards the end of September. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So, if you have already updated the app then, try playing some video and see if the feature works. If you have not grabbed the update, you can press the below button to download the app from Google Play Store. </p>

<p> First Huawei Smartphone With HarmonyOS Coming Next Year </p>
<p> Official information from the CEO of Huawei’s consumer business, Richard Yu confirms that Huawei is all set to release a HarmonyOS powered phone in 2021. </p>
<p> Notably, the US government with its latest regulations is tightening the screws around Huawei even more. This is the reason the company is trying its very best to get out of the clutches of Google's AndroidOS. </p>
<p> Earlier it was revealed that Huawei is not planning on releasing a HarmonyOS powered phone this year. Note that Huawei has the mate 40 series lined-up for release. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The trade war between the US and Huawei does not look to end anytime soon. Instead, new regulations have put Huawei is a situation to look desperately to new chip makers for its devices. </p>
<p> However, Huawei has already released HarmonyOS powered TVs in China. And the company is pretty adamant in making an eco-system similar to that of Apple in the near future. </p>
<p> Moreover, the company is all set to release a new version of the HarmonyOS in the upcoming 2020 HDC Developers Conference on September 10. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei will bring smartwatches powered by HarmonyOS this year </p>
<p> According to Myfixguide, a lot of devices powered by HarmonyOS is set to release soon. The new HarmonyOS version will be known as HarmonyOS 2.0 and it will be better enhanced to work with Huawei PCs, watches/bands, and car products. </p>
<p> Especially, smartwatches with HarmonyOS are soon going to be released by Huawei this year. The company aims to make the upcoming version, i.e. the HarmonyOS 2.0 an alternative to Android. </p>
<p> The company is also working in enhancing its HMS Core (Huawei Mobile Services) which is an alternative to Google Mobile Services. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Richard Yu highlighted that there are currently 700 million monthly active users of the HMS core. Besides, the number of Huawei global registered developers is standing at 1.6 million. </p>
<p> On top of that, the number of applications connected to HMS Core has exceeded 81,000 worldwide. The company is also continuously trying to update its HMS core. </p>
<p> It recently announced the HMS Core 5.0 which offers services in seven areas including App services, Graphics, Media, AI, Smart Device, Security, and System. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei Mate 40 series will be the last smartphones to be powered by Kirin chipsets </p>
<p> Well, the company is trying to do whatever it can to mend the dent caused by the trade-ban by the US government. Huawei is in talks with MediaTek to find a viable path for covering its chipset needs. </p>
<p> Richard Yu also added that Kirin 9000 chip will power the upcoming Huawei Mate 40 series devices. But it will be the last smartphones from Huawei to use a Kirin chipset. </p>
<p> Yu said that they already have a HarmonyOS Huawei phone ready. But due to an agreement with Google, the first HarmonyOS phone is still waiting in line for its release. </p>

<p> The company aims to bring HarmonyOS powered devices and expects to develop HarmonyOS as a worldwide platform. </p>

<p> First Smartphone With Snapdragon 865+ Will Launch On July 22 </p>
<p> So, it seems like the very first smartphone with the all-new Snapdragon 865 SoC could launch on July 22. What phone is that? Well, it’s the ASUS ROG Phone 3, a gaming smartphone. </p>
<p> This chip-related confirmation comes from Ishan Agarwal, a well-known tipster. He did share a post from the company itself, a post on Twitter, though that tweet has now been deleted. </p>
<p> We don’t really know what that post was about, to be quite honest. In any case, the tipster says that the phone will “probably” launch with the Snapdragon 865+. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That is something every rumor in the last couple of weeks has been pointing at. The phone is all basically confirmed at this point, it got certified recently, while the company has already teased it in China. </p>
<p> The first smartphone with Snapdragon 865+ to launch on July 22 in form of ASUS ROG Phone 3 </p>
<p> The company did confirm that the phone will launch on July 22, as a landing page is already up and running. That will also be a global event, by the looks of it. It will start at 11 AM EST / 5 PM CET. </p>
<p> The ASUS ROG Phone 3 will look like a gaming phone, no doubt about it. In other words, it will probably look considerably different than your regular smartphone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can expect this phone to launch free of display notches and holes, as it’s all about screen real-estate and gaming enjoyment. The phone may also include some sort of LED lighting on the back. </p>
<p> The device will most likely keep the 6.59-inch fullHD+ AMOLED panel from the ROG Phone 2. It may even have the same refresh rate as that device, 120Hz refresh rate. </p>
<p> The phone will include a large battery </p>
<p> The device will, allegedly, include three cameras on the back. Two of those three will be 64 and 13-megapixel cameras. Its battery will also be quite large, it will be between 5,800mAh and 6,000mAh in capacity. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone is said to support fast charging as well. If rumors are to be believed, it will ship with 30W fast wired charging, just like its predecessor. 10W reverse charging may also be included (wired as well). </p>
<p> Android 10 will come pre-installed on the phone, along with ROG’s very own software. The company will release some accessories with this device, almost certainly. While some previous accessories will be compatible as well. </p>
<p> There you have it. The ASUS ROG Phone 3 may become the first smartphone to feature the Snapdragon 865+. Everything will be revealed on July 22. </p>

<p> Fitbit Sense ECG Feature Rolling Out In The US & Europe </p>
<p> Fitbit announced its latest smartwatch back in August, i.e. the Fitbit Sense. And now with the new app, Fitbit Sense becomes the first smartwatch from the company to feature ECG. </p>
<p> Notably, after gaining clearance last month, the Fitbit Sense ECG app is now rolling out in the US and some parts of Europe. At the launch of the device, the company promised to bring this feature. </p>
<p> And by the looks of it, it is widely rolling out for Fitbit Sense smartwatch users. Fitbit has gained regulatory approval in the US & Europe for now, hence the rollout in these regions. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To give you some insight, it got approval from the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in the US, while it got clearance from Conformite Europeenne (CE) in the European Union. </p>
<p> Fitbit Sense users in the US, UK, and Germany have reported the arrival of this new ECG (Electrocardiogram) feature. India too is on the list but we will have to wait for it to arrive there. </p>
<p> Well, this is not a trial and go feature that has been put in the Fitbit Sense. Apparently, the company conducted a multi-site clinical trial across the US. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And the collected data was submitted to concerned authorities for approval. Besides, as per TizenHelp, the ECG feature on the Fitbit Sense is successful in 98.7% of AFib cases with 100% accuracy in identifying participants with normal sinus rhythm. </p>
<p> The ECG feature makes Fitbit Sense an apt rival for Apple Watch Series 6 & Galaxy Watch 3 </p>
<p> As already mentioned, the Fitbit Sense is the first smartwatch from the company to feature the ECG feature. Moreover, this also makes the Fitbit Sense an apt competition for the Apple Watch series and Galaxy Watch 3. </p>
<p> Fitbit has plans to rollout this ECG feature to more Fitbit devices. However, note that it is not supported on the Fitbit Versa 3 or any other older smartwatches from the company. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The addition of the ECG feature makes the Fitbit Sense a complete smartwatch. Because it already features blood oxygen variation, and stress management, and other activity tracking features. </p>
<p> Users at the receiving end of this new Fitbit Sense ECG feature have highlighted that the app may show up on its own. But the users can force update the app by heading to the Fitbit app and updating it from there. </p>
<p> Once you have installed the app, you can immediately start using it. Though you might need to set up the connected device in order to use the new ECG feature. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You need to go to Discover>>Assessments & Reports>>Heart Rhythm Assessment. Some terms and conditions along with a notice will be shown. Once agreed, you can open the ECG app on your Fitbit Sense. </p>
<p> The process takes about 30 seconds to complete. And you need to keep the fingers on opposite corners of the Fitbit Sense’s chassis. The normal reading message will read "Normal Sinus Rhythm." </p>

<p> Fly Around & Check Your Whole Home With Ring Always Home Drone Cam </p>
<p> Amazon-owned Ring is reportedly taking home security in an unexpected direction with a new device dubbed the Always Home Cam. And because the new camera is also a remote-controllable drone, that's effectively any direction at all. </p>
<p> The new Ring Always Home Cam is, when it's docked, an unassuming white box with an LED ring on the front and Ring branding emblazoned in the black lid. The company added a grille over top of the lid, because that's where the propellers are enclosed. But, when undocked, it's a drone-attached security camera that also links into the Ring Alarm system. </p>
<p> So how does Ring Always Home Cam work? </p>
<p> Ring designed its new drone to be fully autonomous. It works similarly to a robotic vacuum, building a map of the home when it's first turned on. It uses the map to create flight paths. And that, in turn, gives users the ability to ask the device to fly in and check up on specific rooms or regions of their home or business. Or it will also fly automatically, if set up to do so, to inspect any disturbances detected by the Ring Alarm system. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In-flight programming and obstacle detection allow it to fly around without bumping into things if the in-home environment changes. The propellers are tucked into the frame and protected by a covering to prevent harm to in-home objects or people. </p>
<p> Conversely, users can control the drone themselves if they want to check on their home instead of automating. For example, to see if they left the stove on or locked the back door. </p>
<p> The video footage, whether recorded or played back via a smartphone or other alexa-enabled device, is 1080p. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For privacy purposes, not only do the propellers make a deliberately audible noise while in flight. This is also the only Ring camera that isn't always recording. When docked, the camera is entirely obscured by the charging box. </p>
<p> How much does this cost and when can you get one? </p>
<p> In terms of pricing, the features and functionality in the Ring Always Home Cam come at a premium. That's down to the challenges involved in building this type of product and the advanced drone technologies used to keep things stable and working. The device is slated to cost $249.99 at Amazon when it lands. </p>
<p> Ring says it will begin selling the Always Home Cam sometime next year, but hasn't offered a more specific date as of this writing. </p>

<p> Android News / Former Lenovo Mobile Head May Face Legal Issues After Joining Xiaomi </p>
<p> Former Lenovo Mobile Head May Face Legal Issues After Joining Xiaomi </p>
<p> Former Lenovo Mobile head joined Xiaomi recently, and may face some legal issues because of it. We’re talking about Chang Cheng, who has been Lenovo’s Vice President and Head of Lenovo Mobile China for quite some time. </p>
<p> Mr. Cheng has joined Lenovo 19 years ago. He resigned on December 18 last year, on the same day as Liu Chuanzhi. Mr. Chuanzhi, for those of you who do not know, is the founder of Lenovo. </p>
<p> Chang Cheng joined Lenovo back in 2000, as the Director of Research and Development for the company’s notebook business. He was appointed the Vice President of Lenovo Group back in 2011, which is the same year he became the General Manager of the mobile end-to-end software platform. In mid-2015, he became the CEO of Lenovo’s ZUK mobile brand. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Mr. Cheng left Lenovo because of ‘personal health issues’ and because he wanted to spend more time with his family, says the source. So, the fact that he joined Xiaomi so soon after quitting his job at Lenovo is quite odd. </p>
<p> Chang Cheng has decided to join Xiaomi, as he became the company’s Vice President. That news got confirmed by Lei Jun, the founder, Chairman and CEO of Xiaomi. Mr. Cheng confirmed the news via his Weibo account as well. </p>
<p> In his new role, Mr. Cheng will be responsible for smartphone product planning, reports Gizmochina. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Former Lenovo Mobile head may face legal issues if he signed a non-competition agreement </p>
<p> That being said, former Lenovo Mobile head may face some legal issues because of joining Xiaomi. According to Tech Sina, Lenovo has released a statement that confirms that all employees working with the company have to sign a non-competition agreement. </p>
<p> This actually means that former employees are under a contract not to move to a competitor, though that probably goes for highly-ranked officials. Chang Cheng is definitely one of those. </p>
<p> We’re not entirely sure what Chang Cheng signed, so we cannot really know what comes next. If he did sign such a contract, which prevents him from joining a competitor after he leaves the company, then Lenovo has the right to sue. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If that ends up being the case, Chang Cheng may be faced with a fine, and also a new type of contract which would prevent him from sharing Lenovo information with Xiaomi, though that part was probably a part of the initial contract. </p>
<p> Do note that a lawyer from Beijing pointed out that the competition agreement does not fall under mandatory signing. So, we don’t really know if Chang Cheng signed such a contract or not, though considering his position at Lenovo, chances are he did. </p>
<p> Chances are we’ll hear more about this in the coming weeks / months. We’re still waiting for a statement from Xiaomi and / or Chang Cheng regarding all this. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Fortnite On The Galaxy Tab S7 Offers Up Super Smooth Gameplay </p>
<p> Fortnite On The Galaxy Tab S7 Offers Up Super Smooth Gameplay </p>
<p> Fortnite is available to a wide range of Android devices, including the Galaxy Tab S7, Samsung's latest tablet. </p>
<p> Even though you can no longer install the game from the Play Store, Samsung still offers it in its Galaxy App Store. And if you have a Galaxy Tab S7, you now have more of a reason to install Fortnite. </p>
<p> It has some super smooth gameplay that wasn't available on the Galaxy Tab S7 prior to today. That isn't to say the gameplay wasn't smooth before, but it's certainly better now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Fortnite on the Galaxy Tab S7 now runs at 90fps </p>
<p> Since 90fps Fortnite was introduced earlier this year for mobile, it was only ever available on OnePlus devices. </p>
<p> This was because OnePlus has an exclusivity deal with Epic Games to allow 90fps on mobile. That exclusivity is now over, which means the compatibility is going to start opening up to more phones and tablets that support 90fps on their displays. </p>
<p> For Samsung, the first device in a line of probably many is its newest tablet. To be clear, this works with the Galaxy Tab S7 and the Galaxy Tab S7+ model. So you won't be locked out if you don't have the more expensive version of the tablet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung doesn't mention any other devices that will gain the 90fps capability. It does however have at least a few more devices that would work. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is one example. Though it's still just a variable refresh rate, it will go up to 120Hz where available. </p>
<p> So Galaxy Note 20 Ultra owners may want to look forward to playing Fortnite at 90fps at some point in the near future. </p>
<p> You will need to update Fortnite from the Galaxy App Store </p>
<p> This is fairly obvious, but you'll need to update the game (or install it) from the Galaxy App Store. Since it's no longer available on the Play Store. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You could technically update or install the APK from the Epic Games Launcher, and it would likely still work at 90fps. But Samsung does mention that the app has to be updated through the Galaxy App Store. </p>
<p> So perhaps it's a special version of the game on Android that allows for the support. In either case, now you can play the game with a much smoother frame rate than before. And that's never a bad thing especially with games that have fast-paced gameplay like Fortnite does. Frames win games as they say. </p>

<p> Here's How You Can Get Disney+, ESPN+ & Hulu Free On Verizon </p>
<p> Earlier this week, Verizon announced some changes to two of its Unlimited plans, which would offer up Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu for free to its customers. </p>
<p> Verizon won't automatically move you to these plans, so you will need to make the changes for yourself. Luckily, nothing else about the plans have changed, you're just getting more free stuff. But if you are a current customer, you will need to go ahead and "upgrade" to this new plan. </p>
<p> New customers can simply select the plan, when they sign up. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What is the Disney+ bundle? </p>
<p> The Disney+ bundle is a bundle that Disney offers, and it includes Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu for $12.99 per month. Verizon is now offering this bundle in two of its four unlimited plans. </p>
<p> With this bundle, you're going to get a ton of great Disney content on Disney+, loads of sports (both live and original content) on ESPN+ and Hulu which has movies and TV shows. During this time of us all being stuck at home, and needing something new to watch, this is a really great bundle to include with Verizon plans. </p>
<p> Which plans include free Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu? </p>
<p> Verizon has four unlimited plans (five if you count the Just Kids one), and they start at $70 per month for a single line. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But only two of them will get you Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu free (Verizon's wording is "included" and not free). </p>
<p> Those two plans are the Play More Unlimited and the Get More Unlimited plans for $80 and $90 respectively. </p>
<p> The best plan for most people is going to be the Play More Unlimited plan. That is because it offers Premium Network Access (aka 50GB of high-speed data before you might get slowed down), 15GB of 4G LTE Mobile hotspot and unlimited after that, as well as Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu included. You also get Apple Music for six months, and 5G is included at no extra charge. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the Play More Unlimited plan, you also get streaming video at 720p instead of 480p on the Start Unlimited plan. </p>
<p> How do I activate my free Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu? </p>
<p> To activate your free Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu, you will need to do it through the My Verizon app. </p>
<p> Once you're in the app. Tap on Account. </p>
<p> Then tap on Add-ons. </p>
<p> From there, swipe over to Entertainment. </p>
<p> Now you'll see a "Learn More" button for each service. Click on that, and it'll give you some details about the perk, and at the bottom there is an "Enroll" button. Tap on that. </p>
<p> This is going to enroll you in the perk and then have you sign into Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. </p>
<p> That's pretty much it. From there, you're all set and will have Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu included for the life of your account. This is a $12.99 value, and definitely worth the price. </p>

<p> Prime Gaming Has More Free SNK Games For Prime Members </p>
<p> Amazon's newly re-branded Twitch Prime, now called Prime Gaming, has additional free games on offer from SNK. </p>
<p> This collection of games will be the third drop of free game titles from the publisher. And it will also be the last game drop as part of the promotion. Which means if you're a fan of SNK titles, snag these while you still have the opportunity to do so. </p>
<p> Altogether there are eight new games from this third and final drop. And the best part is that you have a pretty long time to claim them. Not just these eight though, all of the free SNK games in fact. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Free SNK games from Prime Gaming are available to claim until next year </p>
<p> If you're worried about missing out on these games, don't be. Amazon is keeping them around for quite some time. </p>
<p> While you might want to pick them up as soon as you can, you don't necessarily have to. Amazon will offer all of the SNK games as part of Prime Gaming all the way until next year. </p>
<p> Specifically, the games can be claimed until March of 2021. So you have about seven months to get your hands on all of them. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The games included in this particular drop are The Last Blade 2, Garou: Mark Of The Wolves, Metal Slug 3, Samurai Shodown V Special, The King Of Fighters '97 Global match, The King Of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match Final Edition, The King Of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match, and Shock Troopers. </p>
<p> Don't forget about the 14 other titles </p>
<p> Outside of the eight games in today's third drop, there are 14 other titles to pick up. This includes hits like Art Of Fighting 2, Blazing Star, Metal Slug 2, and Samurai Shodown II. </p>
<p> Really though, it includes much more than 14 other titles. Because one of the free games is the SNK 40th Anniversary Collection, which includes a ton of game from SNK's lineup over the years. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Just a reminder that if you want the benefits of Prime Gaming, which includes a lot more than just these free SNK games, you need to be subscribed to Amazon Prime. </p>
<p> In addition to free games from SNK, members end up with a lot of other free games from various developers. Prime Gaming also includes a bunch of free in-game items for popular titles like DOOM Eternal, Destiny 2, Black Desert Mobile and more. </p>
<p> This is on top of all the other non-gaming Prime benefits like free two-day shipping, and access to Prime Video and Prime Music. </p>

<p> First Expandable LG Smartphone Coming In 2021: Insider </p>
<p> An unprecedentedly expandable LG smartphone that's been rumored about for some time now is becoming a reality in 2021. That's according to Ross Young a recently established – but so far extremely reliable – display industry insider. I.e. a person with enough industry ties to know this is happening but not enough LG ties to keep quiet. </p>
<p> Young's latest prediction even comes with an added bonus of a decent-quality illustration. Or the other way around, to be more specific. </p>
<p> The renders featured herein went from a curious concept to a newsworthy visual within one hour earlier today. As the Twitter exchange embedded below clearly shows. Plus, it confirms one of LG's most excitingly feasible flexible smartphone patents to date is verging on commercialization. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That would be the "expandable smartphone" design submitted for IP protection review in early 2019 and published last November. By all accounts, the few illustrations found within that application were the sole basis for the renders at hand. </p>
<p> The image itself shows only the front view of the still-conceptual device, though in both its modest and extended forms, thankfully. Last year's IP documentation suggests the back of this gadget will be just as curious-looking, as well. </p>
<p> When contracted, the design resembles a miniature closed elevator door. Stretching it out results in a less uniform shape which even the limited angle shown above hints at. </p>
<p> An expandable LG smartphone is just the thing third-gen foldables need </p>
<p> But questionable ergonomics are par for the course when it comes to any novel form factor in consumer electronics. Most importantly another unique and truly flexible design could be just the thing to shift the foldable momentum into a higher gear. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Not just because it's meaningfully different or doesn't come from Samsung. Because it's meaningfully different and doesn't come from Samsung. As clunky as the initial Galaxy Fold batch was, and as </p>
<p> Further adding to this rumor's credibility is a working prototype of a rollable mobile display LG showcased last month. It isn't directly relevant to the foldable LG smartphone now expected to hit the market within the next nine months. </p>
<p> But it does prove LG's flexible screen tech is already at least as moldable as that of Samsung. Mass-producing it presents another set of challenges, of course. Yet between this incredibly futuristic-looking expandable smartphone design and the comparably distinctive dual-screener called the Wing, it would appear the bold, aggressive LG of old is reawakening. And nothing breeds innovation like inspired competition does – especially in consumer tech, of all industries. </p>

<p> Android News / Galaxy Note 9 Is The Latest Smartphone To Receive One UI 2.5 Update </p>
<p> Galaxy Note 9 Is The Latest Smartphone To Receive One UI 2.5 Update </p>
<p> Samsung has already rolled out the latest One UI 2.5 update to several of its smartphones launched in the last one year. Today, the two-year-old Galaxy Note 9 is receiving the One UI 2.5 update, which is still based on Android 10. Currently, the new update is rolling out to users in Germany. </p>
<p> The One UI 2.5 update for the Galaxy Note 9 comes with the build number N960FXXU6FTJ3 and includes the latest October 2020 Android security patch. Since the update is incremental, it might take a few more days to show up on all the eligible devices. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Starts Receiving One UI 2.5 Update </p>
<p> In the coming weeks, the One UI 2.5 rollout should expand to other markets. If there is no notification about the latest update, users can manually check for the update by going to Settings > Software update > Download. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There will be a prompt to download and install if the update is available. Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 9 in August 2018 with Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box. With the Android 10-based One UI 2.0 update released in December last year, the device has received its promised two major OS updates. </p>
<p> The new update also brings the wireless DeX mode </p>
<p> With the latest One UI update, the Galaxy Note 9 will support the new wireless DeX mode. The default Samsung Keyboard app has received a couple of new features. It gets the split keyboard functionality when using the device in landscape mode. Also, the keyboard's search feature now works with Youtube as well. </p>
<p> The updated camera app gets a few new features like choosing the resolution and frame rate for recording video using the Pro video mode. Even the Single Take mode introduced with the One UI 2.1 gets a new option to choose the recording duration. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The default Messages app will allow users to send SOS messages every 30 minutes for 24 hours to pre-selected emergency contacts. Finally, this new update will also include several bug fixes and stability improvements. The Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ smartphones are also expected to soon receive the One UI 2.5 update. </p>
<p> As per the new software update policy, Samsung will be offering three years of software support for all its flagship smartphone since the Galaxy S10 series. Unfortunately, the Galaxy Note 9 and Galaxy S9 smartphones will be left out from the upcoming Android 11-based One UI 3.0 rollout. </p>
<p> However, the monthly security patch updates will continue for one more year. Toward the end of their life cycle, these devices will be getting the security patch updates on a quarterly basis. </p>

<p> Galaxy S21 Could Arrive In This Many Color Variants </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S21 is starting to take shape. With a January launch all but certain, the device has started to make rounds on the internet more often. Over the past few weeks, multiple leaks have revealed the design and spec details of the two Galaxy S21 models – the standard Galaxy S21 and the Galaxy S21 Ultra. We now have some information about their color variants as well. </p>
<p> According to a new leak, the Galaxy S21 series, which is codenamed Galileo, will be arriving in as many as five different hues. We'll be seeing the upcoming Samsung flagship in gray, pink, violet, silver, and white colors, at least. It's unclear if both the models will be arriving in these many colors and whether they'll be available globally. Samsung does tend to make certain color variants limited to select markets, sometimes for a brief period only. </p>
<p> To recall, the Galaxy S20 series is available in Cloud Gray, Could Blue, and Cloud Pink colors while the Note 20 series comes in Mystic Bronze, Mystic Gray, and Mystic Green color variants. So that's another strategic shift from Samsung for the Galaxy S21 series. Perhaps it's something the company is picking up from the Galaxy S20 FE. The affordable Samsung flagship arrived earlier this month in no less than six colors – Lavender, Cloud Mint, Cloud Navy, Cloud White, Cloud Red, and Cloud Orange. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Galaxy S21 color variants leak </p>
<p> This is the latest in a plethora of Galaxy S21 leaks over the past few days. Renders of both Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S21 Ultra leaked earlier today, revealing the two phones in all their glory. The upcoming flagships see subtle design changes from their predecessors. The most notable of them all is a less-protruding rear camera module. </p>
<p> The vanilla S21 gets a flat screen while the Ultra model keeps those curved edges. There should be a third "Plus" (Galaxy S21+) model as well sitting in between the two, but there hasn't been much talk about it. It remains to be seen if Samsung is shifting to a two-model strategy for the Galaxy S series as well, like the Galaxy Note series. </p>
<p> The Korean company is yet to officially communicate a word about the Galaxy S21 launch. However, multiple reports have suggested that the phones would launch early in January next year. Retail units will reportedly arrive in stores later in the month, or in early February. The company previously launched the Galaxy S series phones in February, with sales commencing in March. </p>

<p> Galaxy S21 Fast Charging Speed May Disappoint You </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S21 fast charging speed may disappoint you. The device got certified by the 3C authority in China, and that certification revealed the phone’s charging information. </p>
<p> According to it, the Galaxy S21 will support 25W fast charging. It will also ship with a 25W charger, it seems. That 25W fast charging will be identical to the one on the Galaxy S20, it seems. </p>
<p> Some people expected improvements in this regard, but it seems like we won’t get any. The Galaxy S20 Ultra can charge up to 45W, so many people expected such charging to arrive to the vanilla Galaxy S21. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Well, that won’t happen, it seems. This is somewhat surprising, as many other smartphone manufacturers have already upgraded to considerably faster charging. The recently-announced OnePlus 8T, for example, offers 65W fast wired charging. </p>
<p> The upcoming iPhone 12 units, however, will offer slower charging than the Galaxy S21. The Google Pixel 5 is also stuck at 18W, so in those comparisons, the Galaxy S21 charging actually looks kind of compelling. </p>
<p> 25W fast charging that the Galaxy S21 will offer isn’t slow, but some competitors offer faster charging </p>
<p> 25W fast charging from Samsung is not exactly slow, far from it. In comparison with 45W and 65W offerings, however, it is. Quite a few phones are also expected to offer 100W fast charging in 2021, so… yeah, Samsung was expected to upgrade. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The device will likely ship with a 4,000mAh battery. A tipster, NOT DJ Koh, suggested that the original capacity will be 3,880, so its typical capacity will likely be marketed as 4,000mAh. That is also the same battery capacity the Galaxy S20 offered. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S21 Ultra will stick to 45W charging, most probably. Some rumors popped up, suggesting that the device may offer 65W charging, but those rumors are not accurate, it seems. </p>
<p> A tipster went to Twitter to confirm that the Galaxy S21 Ultra will not offer 65W fast charging. It seems like Samsung will stay put when it comes to Galaxy S21 series charging speeds. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A rumor surfaced yesterday, claiming that the Galaxy S21 series will launch before the end of 2020. Well, that rumor is probably not accurate, but we’ll have to wait and see. It’s still more probable that we’ll see those phones launch in February or March. </p>

<p> Galaxy Tab A7 10.4 (2020) Retail Listing Reveals European Pricing </p>
<p> Samsung has officially launched the Galaxy Tab S7 and the Galaxy Tab S7+ with flagship specifications. The company is also rumored to be working on new affordable Android tablets under the Galaxy Tab A series. Ahead of its official launch, the Galaxy Tab A7 10.4 (2020) was spotted on a Dutch website revealing the pricing. </p>
<p> As per the listing, the all-new Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 10.4 comes in LTE and Wi-Fi-only variants. While the Galaxy Tab A7 10.4 LTE comes with the model number SM-T505, the Wi-Fi-only variant bears the model number SM-T500. </p>
<p> 10.4-inch Galaxy Tab A7 2020 pricing revealed ahead of launch </p>
<p> Apart from a slightly larger display, there might not be major differences between the 2020 Galaxy Tab A7 10.4 and last year's Galaxy Tab A 10.1. Last month, the LTE variant of the Galaxy Tab A7 with model number SM-T505 got listed on Google Play Console. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab A7 10.4 LTE with 32GB and 64GB of storage is mentioned to cost €293 and €323 respectively. Speaking of the Wi-Fi only variants, the 32GB and 64GB storage variants will be costing €235 and €266 respectively. </p>
<p> While the customers can pre-order the Galaxy Tab A7 10.4 (2020) now, the shipping date is specified as September 11. The 2020 Galaxy Tab A7 will be available in Gray, Gold, and Silver color options. </p>
<p> The new budget tablet from Samsung will be coming with a 10.4-inch display with Full HD+ (2000 by 1200 pixels) resolution. While the flagship Galaxy Tab S7 tablets came with AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, the affordable Galaxy Tab A7 will only get a usual LCD panel. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The 2020 variant will likely sport 7,040mAh battery </p>
<p> Under the hood, it packs the 11nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 Mobile Platform coupled with Kryo 260 CPU and Adreno 610 GPU. Both the 32GB and 64GB storage variants might include only 3GB of RAM. Also, there should be a MicroSD card slot for further expansion of storage. </p>
<p> The 2020 Galaxy Tab A7 will be running on Android 10 out of the box. Samsung recently confirmed to offer up to three generations of software updates for its flagship devices. Just like the select Galaxy A smartphones, the company might also apply the same update policy for these new budget tablets. </p>
<p> With all these specifications, the tablet will be powered by a 7,040mAh battery. While LTE is optional, the 2020 Galaxy Tab A7 will be supporting Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0. While there is no confirmation over the official launch date, these listing suggests it is going to happen very soon. </p>

<p> Galaxy Tab Active 3 Launch Imminent, Receives Multiple Certifications </p>
<p> Well, new reports suggest that we might be seeing a new Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3 launch pretty soon. Because the device has recently grabbed multiple certifications. </p>
<p> In the Unpacked event which happened in August 2020, Samsung unveiled its two flagship tablets, the Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7 Plus. </p>
<p> However, new sources reveal that the company is already working on another Android tablet. Notably, the Android tablet market is not that exciting. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We have players like Huawei, Samsung, and some other scratching their heads off in this segment. But none have been able to capture what Apple has done with their iPads. </p>
<p> On a positive note, it is a good sign that those who have the Android ecosystem around them can look forward to a new Android tablet from Samsung in the coming months. </p>
<p> Furthermore, the live images and battery capacity of the new Galaxy Tab Active 3 has also popped up with build numbers. Moreover, it suggests that the Galaxy Tab Active 3 will come in both WiFi and dual-SIM variants. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Galaxy Tab Active 3 is spotted with multiple model numbers in Bluetooth SIG certification </p>
<p> Besides, as per the Bluetooth SIG certification, the Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3 is spotted with multiple model numbers. These are SM-T570, SM-T577, SM-T577_DS, SM-T575, and SM-T575N. </p>
<p> However, the leaked Bluetooth SIG certification fails to tell us anything more about the device apart from the model numbers and SIM card support. </p>
<p> But there is nothing to worry about Galaxy Tab Active 3 specifications. Because the device has previously popped up on Geekbench, which reveals quite a few things about the tablet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Firstly, it is rumored to come with an Exynos 9810 processor, coupled with 4GB of RAM. Moreover, the phone will come with Android 10 OS out of the box. </p>
<p> It could come with a 4,900 mAh battery capacity </p>
<p> Notably, the device is also spotted in the FCC certification and Safety Korea certification. The certifications reveal that it will pack a 4,900mAh (or a 5,050mAh typical) battery. </p>
<p> Besides, the model number of the battery is EB-BT575BBE. Live images of the Galaxy Tab Active 3 were also leaked, which shows thick bezels on top and three capacitive keys at the chin. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All in all, the device's leaks are already making rounds of the internet before its launch. Apparently, this also suggests that the company is working with full force to launch Galaxy Tab Active 3 in the near future. </p>
<p> However, nothing is confirmed because all these are leaks are based on speculations. We will have to wait for official confirmation from Samsung to say anything affirmative. </p>

<p> Android News / Galaxy Tab Active Pro & Tab S5e Get September 2020 Security Update </p>
<p> Galaxy Tab Active Pro & Tab S5e Get September 2020 Security Update </p>
<p> Samsung has started rolling out the September 2020 Android security patch update for a couple of its tablets. The September update is now rolling out to the Wi-Fi only variant of the Galaxy Tab S5e in Colombia, Chile, and Trinidad and Tobago. </p>
<p> For the Galaxy Active Pro tablets, the September update is currently limited only to the LTE variant. Moreover, the latest update is only available in Australia and Mexico. The update patches several vulnerabilities from both Samsung and Google. </p>
<p> Samsung rolls out September 2020 update for Galaxy Tab Active Pro & Galaxy Tab S5e </p>
<p> A few of the high severity bugs even affect all the devices featuring Qualcomm chipsets. Notably, both these tablets come powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. The changelog doesn't mention any other changes apart from the September 2020 security patch. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S5e gets the new update with the firmware version T720XXS1BTI3. Whereas, the update for the Galaxy Tab Active Pro comes with firmware version T545XXU2BTG3. Since it is an incremental rollout, it will take a few days to reach all the eligible devices. </p>
<p> No mention of the rollout in other markets </p>
<p> The same update should be soon rolling out to the unlocked variants in other markets as well. For the carrier-locked tablets, the update has to come from their respective carriers. In the meantime, the users can also manually check for a new OTA update by going to Settings > Software update > Download and Install. </p>
<p> If the new update is available, tap on the "Install now" button to download and install the latest update. Samsung launched the Galaxy Tab Active Pro and Galaxy Tab S5e with Android 9.0 Pie out of the box. Recently, the company released the Android 10 OTA update for both these tablets. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the Galaxy Tab S5e gets One UI 2.1 update, the Galaxy Tab Active Pro received One UI 2.0 update. Going by the priority list, both these tablets might not get the latest One UI 3.0 update based Android 11 anytime soon. However, the company might rollout the newly released One UI 2.5 in the coming months. </p>
<p> Unlike the Galaxy Tab S5e, the One UI 3.0 could be the last major update for the Galaxy Tab Active Pro. Samsung promised to provide three years of OS updates for the flagship Galaxy smartphones, Galaxy Tab S tablets, and select Galaxy A smartphones. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S5e along with the other Galaxy Tab S5 tablets should be getting one more major Android update after the upcoming One UI 3.0 update. </p>

<p> Galaxy Tab S7+ 5G Gains A Support Page On Official Website </p>
<p> The 5G variant of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ has gained a support page on Samsung Germany’s official website ahead of the impending launch. The listing doesn't explicitly mention the device's name but we already know the SM-T976B model number corresponds to the Galaxy Tab S7+ 5G. </p>
<p> While the support page didn't reveal anything new about the tablet, it confirmed the tablet's existence. The webpage is still live, so it's unlikely to be an inadvertent publish. </p>
<p> This further suggests that the two Galaxy Tab S7 tablets may not be too far away from an official introduction. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung is launching two size variants of its flagship Android tablet this year. There's the standard Galaxy Tab S7 with an 11-inch screen, as well as a bigger Galaxy Tab S7+ featuring a 12.4-inch display. The two tablets should both get Super AMOLED panels with a 120Hz refresh rate and QHD+ resolution. </p>
<p> Galaxy Tab S7 rumored specs </p>
<p> Samsung has at least five different Tab S7 variants in the works. The Wi-Fi-only (SM-T870) and LTE (SM-T875) variants of the smaller model as well as those of the bigger (SM-T970 and SM-T975). </p>
<p> Additionally, the Tab S7+ is also coming in a 5G variant (SM-T976B), that has just been spotted on Samsung Germany’s official website. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ 5G will be the first globally available 5G Samsung tablet. The Tab S6 5G last year was limited to South Korea only. There's no sign of a 5G variant of the standard Tab S7 model yet. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 duo have also been spotted on various certification and benchmarking websites over the past few weeks, revealing a whole lot of their specs. </p>
<p> According to a Geekbench listing, the two flagship Samsung tablets will both run on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ processors. The listing also revealed 8GB of RAM, although the tablets will come in multiple memory configurations. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 will pack a 7,760 mAh battery, while the Tab S7+ will get a massive battery of about 10,000 mAh capacity. </p>
<p> Other rumored specs include Android 10 with One UI 2.5, two cameras on the back, and support for S Pen. The stylus pen was recently certified by the FCC. </p>
<p> Samsung is gearing up to launch the Galaxy Tab S7, as well as several other products in the coming months. The Galaxy Watch 3 and the Galaxy Buds Live are likely to arrive in a couple of weeks. The Galaxy Note 20, Galaxy Z Flip 5G, Galaxy Fold 2, and the Tab S7 should follow them in August. </p>

<p> Galaxy Tab S7 Shows Its Design In Seemingly Official Render </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 design has just leaked in a seemingly official render. This image comes from Evan Blass, who is usually spot on when it comes to leaks. </p>
<p> The tipster shared this image via his Patreon page, by the way. He shared a single image, which is showing the design of the Galaxy Tab S7’s front side only. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 render shows thin bezels, sleek design </p>
<p> If you take a look at the picture, you’ll notice that the device has really thin bezels… for a tablet. Those bezels are still there, though, so grasping the device should not be an issue. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You’ll notice that the power / lock, volume up, and volume down buttons are all on the same side. They’re on the top in landscape mode (when you hold the tablet in landscape), and on the right side in portrait mode. </p>
<p> Interestingly enough, the device seems to have sensors both at the top, and on the side. We presume those are not all cameras, even though they look like it. </p>
<p> At least one of those sensors is a camera sensor, while the rest are probably a light sensor and a proximity sensor. Do note that they do not look like it, though, and their placing is quite odd. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This phone has both rounded corners, and rounded display corners. The curvature of the device’s corners is much more pronounced than the curvature of its display corners, though. </p>
<p> It remains to be seen whether this device will have a single camera on the back, or two of them. The Galaxy Tab S7+ did leak in CAD-based renders last month, and it showed two rear-facing cameras. </p>
<p> Considering this is the base model, it could include only one, we’ll see. We’re not sure if Samsung plans to include a fingerprint scanner here. If it does, it will be placed under the display, as it’s not on the side or the back. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Not much information surfaced when it comes to the Galaxy Tab S7 specs. Its ‘Plus’ sibling got a lot more attention in that regard. We did see some information, though. </p>
<p> The device will include an 11-inch display </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 is expected to feature an 11-inch display. Its ‘Plus’ sibling will ship with a 12.4-inch one, if rumors and leaks are to be believed. The Galaxy Tab S7 will be fueled by the same SoC as the ‘Plus’ model, though. </p>
<p> Both devices are said to include the Snapdragon 865 Plus from Qualcomm. Now, Samsung may opt for the regular Snapdragon 865 instead, as the ‘Plus’ model is brand new. It remains to be seen. These two tablets will launch either this month, or during Samsung’s Unpacked event next month. </p>

<p> Galaxy Tab S7 Won't Use An In-Display Fingerprint Scanner </p>
<p> Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Tab S7 tablet will be available in two sizes but the smaller 11-inch variant won't feature in-display fingerprint scanning. That's according to a recent report from SamMobile, citing a 'usually reliable' insider source. </p>
<p> The larger, 12.4-inch version of the device will still come with an in-display fingerprint scanner, the source indicates. But the smaller of the two devices will pack the fingerprint scanner under the power button. Speculatively, the decision for Samsung may ultimately come down to cost-cutting measures. Those would, in turn, help the smaller gadget sell better. </p>
<p> What does this mean for Galaxy Tab S7 end-users? </p>
<p> It's debatable whether or not an in-display scanner is going to really be a 'feature'. Ultrasonic fingerprint scanners, as the company is likely to use in the "plus" variant, are typically considered to be more accurate and secure. But they also aren't necessarily the best option, in terms of comfort and positioning, in a screen as large as 12.4-inches. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In smaller smartphone screens, the scanners are already well-within thumbs reach effectively no matter how the device is held. In a tablet, a center-placed scanner is arguably not in such a convenient position. Either users must be able to reach several inches or they must hold the device awkwardly in one hand while pressing on the screen with the other. </p>
<p> S0 a power button-mounted scanner would arguably be more well-positioned to favor comfort. Samsung could also use an optical scanner under the display in its larger tablet. If it does, the difference in terms of security may effectively be moot. That would result in a choice for end-users that comes down to preference rather than which is the better or worse fingerprint technology in the Galaxy Tab S7. </p>
<p> Why would Samsung be worried about pricing here? </p>
<p> The last premium Samsung Galaxy-branded premium tablet to launch was the Galaxy Tab S6. That only just landed in August 2019. Users are already reluctant to update expensive smartphones and undoubtedly are more reluctant still when it comes to less popular devices such as tablets. So Samsung needs to make sure it gets the pricing right. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Perhaps as pertinently, the company's flagship smartphone sales are not going as well as might be hoped. So it makes sense that Samsung would want to compromise on some features to ensure a high-value offering. Fingerprint scanning technology represents just one place it can do that without damaging the user experience. </p>

<p> There's No Limits On The Galaxy Tab S7+ Refresh Rate </p>
<p> Unlike the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and the S20 series, the Galaxy Tab S7+ is able to run at 120Hz at full resolution. </p>
<p> That means that even at the full resolution of 2800×1752, the Galaxy Tab S7+ will run at 120Hz. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra can only run at 120Hz when its at FHD+ resolution. </p>
<p> So there are no limits on the refresh rate on the Galaxy Tab S7+, and that's something we love to see. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Why is it possible on Galaxy Tab S7+ but not Galaxy Note 20 Ultra? </p>
<p> It's very confusing as to why the Galaxy Tab S7+ is able to run at 120Hz at its highest resolution, but the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra can't. Especially since both devices have basically the same specs. In fact, the Galaxy Tab S7+ has less RAM. At 6GB or 8GB versus the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra sporting 12GB. </p>
<p> There was an explanation a few months back, explaining that it was not possible due to the chipset not giving the display enough bandwidth. </p>
<p> Which seemed odd at the time, given the fact that OnePlus is able to do 120Hz at QHD+ but the Galaxy S20 series was not. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, now it looks like it was not a Snapdragon issue, but likely an Exynos 990 issue. </p>
<p> Remember that Samsung's smartphones run on an Exynos chipset in other areas of the world. And they will sometimes nerf the features on the Snapdragon version, to provide feature parity with the Exynos variant. And that appears to be the case here. Since the Galaxy Tab S7+ only runs on the Snapdragon 865+ chipset. </p>
<p> If this is indeed the case – which we likely will never know for sure – it's yet another reason why Samsung should switch to Snapdragon entirely, and leave Exynos out. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's great news for Galaxy Tab S7+ buyers, though </p>
<p> This is definitely great news for potential buyers of the Galaxy Tab S7+. As you'll be able to run that 12.4-inch display at its full resolution and refresh rate. </p>
<p> And let me just tell you, using the Galaxy Tab S7+ in its full resolution and at 120Hz, is amazing. Especially with that AMOLED display, it makes everything on the tablet look incredibly beautiful. From dealing with email, to watching movies and everything in between. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ is going to be available later this fall, Samsung has not yet given us a concrete release date for the tablet just yet. </p>

<p> Galaxy Tab S7 Will Be Powered By New Snapdragon Chipset </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 has appeared on Geekbench, seemingly confirming it will ship with the Snapdragon 865+. The tablet managed to hit 971 points in the single-core, and 2,984 points in the multi-core benchmark. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 will ship with the Snapdragon 865+, and 8GB of RAM </p>
<p> The device will also include 8GB of RAM on the inside, this listing confirms. On top of that, Android 10 will come pre-installed on the device, along with Samsung’s custom UI. </p>
<p> This device’s model number is ‘SM-T875’, in case you were wondering. The device is expected to launch alongside the Galaxy Tab S7+, which already surfaced on Bluetooth SIG. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So, this Geekbench listing hasn’t been all that revealing, but at least it kind of confirmed the processors that the tablet will use. We do have some additional information on the Galaxy Tab S7, though. </p>
<p> The device is expected to ship with a large display, and an 11-inch panel is rumored. That will be an AMOLED panel, and it will offer a high refresh rate… probably 120Hz. </p>
<p> A large battery will also be a part of the package </p>
<p> A 7,760mAH battery will be included in the device, if the rumors are to be believed. 5G connectivity is also expected, while the S Pen stylus will be included in the package. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The tablet itself will be made out of metal and glass. It will ship with rather thin bezels also, though thick enough so that you can safely grip it while it’s in use. </p>
<p> We’re still not sure how many cameras will Samsung include on the back. It could include only one, as on the Galaxy Tab S6, or perhaps two of them. We’ll have to wait and see. </p>
<p> Now, these two tablets are expected to arrive in July. We still do not know the date of their launch, but chances are they will be accompanied by another Samsung product. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Watch 3 has been leaking intensively lately, and it is also rumored to arrive in July. It would make all the sense in the world for the company to launch all those products at the same time. </p>
<p> Why? Well, because the company will probably host some sort of an online-only press conference for these launches. These are, after all, flagship-grade products. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Note 20 series, Galaxy Z Flip 5G, and Galaxy Fold 2 are expected to follow in August. All of those products, five of them, will launch during the company’s Unpacked event. The exact date still hasn’t been confirmed, though. </p>

<p> Galaxy Tab S7 S Pen & Book Cover Keyboard Get Certified </p>
<p> Samsung is preparing to launch the Galaxy Tab S7 lineup in the coming months. A lot about the two upcoming Android tablets is already known, thanks to various leaks and rumors. Now, ahead of their impending launch, a couple of accessories for the tablets have received necessary certifications. </p>
<p> Firstly, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has certified the S Pen that'd come along with the Galaxy Tab S7 duo. The FCC listing doesn't reveal the design or features of the stylus pen but does offer some details on its specs. </p>
<p> The S Pen, which bears the model number EJ-PT870, will operate within the frequency range of 2402MHz to 2480MHz and will feature 40 channels. The listing also reveals the S Pen's modulation technique, power source, antenna specification, and operation temperature. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additionally, South Korea's NRRA (National Radio Research Agency) has also certified the book cover keyboards for the Galaxy Tab S7 and the Galaxy Tab S7+. This certification also doesn't reveal any details about the keyboards, except for their model numbers. The EF-DT870 is for the vanilla Tab S7 while the EF-DT970 is for the 'Plus' model. </p>
<p> We already know that Samsung is working on at least five different Tab S7 variants. The standard model has a Wi-Fi-only (SM-T870) and an LTE (SM-T875) variant. The bigger, S7 Plus, meanwhile, has a Wi-Fi-only (SM-T970), an LTE (SM-T975), and a 5G (SM-T976B) variant. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ 5G is expected to be the first globally available 5G tablet from Samsung. The Tab S6 5G last year was limited to the company's home market only. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 rumored specifications </p>
<p> Samsung's upcoming flagship tablets will be available in two screen sizes- the standard model with an 11-inch display and the 'Plus' model with a 12.4-inch display. Rumors have it that they'll feature AMOLED panels with a 120Hz refresh rate. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ 5G (SM-T976B) will run on the Snapdragon 865 processor with at least 6GB of RAM. The processor details of the other Tab S7 variants are not clear as of yet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Tab S7+ also gets a huge 9,800 mAh battery. The battery capacity of the vanilla Tab S7 is rumored at 7,760mAh, which is still higher than the battery capacity of the Galaxy Tab S6, which utilized a 7,040mAh module. Both the tablets will run Android 10 from day one, possibly with One UI 2.5 on top. </p>
<p> Samsung could launch the Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+ alongside the Galaxy Note 20 series sometime in August. The event should also see the arrival of the Galaxy Fold 2 and the Galaxy Z Flip 5G. </p>

<p> Global Tablet Market Registers Growth For The First Time Since 2014 </p>
<p> The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in billions of people going online for all their needs. With the recent shift towards working from home and remote learning, there has been a sudden spike in the demand for consumer electronics like tablets and laptops. The latest report from Strategy Analytics confirms the growth in the global tablet market share for the first time in the last six years. </p>
<p> In 2020, the global tablet market is expected to register a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth of 1-percent. A total of 160.8 million tablets are likely to be sold during this period. While the numbers don't look that impressive, the tablet market has been suffering over the last few years. </p>
<p> 10-inch plus tablets set to dominate the global tablet market </p>
<p> The pandemic is finally having a positive impact on the slumping tablet market. Perhaps best of all, most people are now opting for larger display tablets. According to the report, tablets with 10-inch and above screen size will contribute to 56-percent of overall sales. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As a result, this will be the first time the industry will be witnessing the 10-inch plus tablets dominate global market share. By 2025, a whopping 65-percent of sales will be coming from these larger tablets. Currently, most of the new flagship tablets come with the 10-inch plus screen size. </p>
<p> Apple, which dominates the tablet market overall, is also moving towards bigger tablets. Apart from the iPad Mini, all the other iPads in its portfolio come with 10-inch plus screen size. Additionally, the detachable 2-in-1 tablets will register a Y-o-Y growth of 10-percent in 2020. </p>
<p> Foldables are still in their infancy </p>
<p> However, the regular slate tablets will continue to dominate for the foreseeable future based on current predictions. There are already a few Android OEMs like Samsung and Huawei working on bringing laptop-like UI to Android tablets. The DeX mode on the newly launched Galaxy Tab S7 tablet already offers the closest to a laptop experience. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Notably, foldable tablets will register a 1-percent market share by the end of 2021. These foldable devices are still fragile for regular day to day usage. Once the companies overcome current limitations and bring the pricing down, the foldable tablets can be considered an excellent alternative to the slate tablets. </p>
<p> By 2025, foldable tablets will make up 5-percent of the global tablet market share. While there is clearly a growing demand for tablets, the Android OS lacks the maturity like Apple's iPadOS to cater to the larger screen sizes. </p>

<p> Gmail Go Now Works On All Android Smartphones </p>
<p> Google launched the lighter versions of its most popular apps for low-end smartphones powered by Android Go Edition. Over the years, many of the Android Go apps from Google were made available even for non-Go smartphones. Now, the Gmail Go is listed on the Google Play Store for downloading on all Android smartphones. </p>
<p> The Gmail Go app also comes with a Go badging on the app icon to distinguish itself from the non-Go version. It even comes with all the basic functionalities offered with the regular Gmail app. However, the bottom bar with Google Meet integration is missing on this lighter version. </p>
<p> Gmail Go app available on Play Store for all Android phones </p>
<p> Though the UI looks very minimal and cleaner, the company removed all the UX elements to make the app work smoother on low-end smartphones. Google launched the stripped-down version of Android called Android Go Edition in 2017. The company came up with this initiative to target first-time smartphone users in emerging markets. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Initially, Google limited the Android Go Edition to smartphones with 1.5GB of RAM or less. With the newly launched Android 11 Go Edition, the company increased that limit to 2GB. Moreover, these smartphones also come with either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage. </p>
<p> The Go version of the Gmail app comes in just 9.9MB in size </p>
<p> Apart from offering a smoother experience, the Go version apps are also smaller in size. While the regular Gmail app is about 80MB in size, the Gmail Go comes in at just 9.9MB. Since the Gmail Go is mainly intended to work on low-end smartphones, it doesn't offer a smoother scrolling experience even on high-end smartphones. </p>
<p> These apps are also optimized to work seamlessly even on slower internet speed. The company already made Google Go, Gallery Go, and Google Maps Go available for all Android smartphones. Now, Gmail Go is the latest Google app to join the list. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Furthermore, Google still restricts Assistant Go and YouTube Go apps to the Android Go phones. Initially, Google partnered with local OEMs for selling these Android Go smartphones in markets like India. Now, several of the top Android OEMs also include Android Go smartphones in their portfolio. </p>
<p> A couple of months back, Samsung launched the Galaxy M01 Core smartphone running on Android 10 Go Edition. The base variant of the smartphone with 1GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage is currently retailing for INR 4,999 (approx. $68). </p>

<p> Google Adds Election Features To Its Services To Aid Users </p>
<p> Google has made it easier to find your nearest election voting locations by adding features to many of its apps. According to Google, its Google Maps and Search services as well as Google Assistant will now have features to help with users voting in the election. </p>
<p> Many companies have had to tread a fine line in the run-up to this election with the way they behave. Fighting the spread of misinformation has been difficult for the likes of Google and Twitter. Both have still developed new methods for curbing its spread. </p>
<p> However, most technology companies also wish to promote registering to vote on their platforms. TikTok for example has created an in-app guide to persuade users to vote. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is similar to what Google is doing by providing better access to information for its users. By making it easier to find where they can vote Google will hope this persuades more to go out and make their voices heard in November. </p>
<p> Google adds elections services to many of its apps </p>
<p> Yunhan Xu, Product Manager at Google has written a blog post on the subject. He noted that "this year, searches for "how to vote" in the U.S. are higher than ever before." As a result, Google has "launched election-related features with information from trusted and authoritative organizations in Google Search." </p>
<p> In the near future users will be able to find their nearest in-person voting location or returning mail-in ballots. You can do this by simply searching for terms such as "early voting locations" and "ballot drop boxes near me." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google also plans to make it possible to get the same information from the Google Assistant. Simply by "Hey Google, where do I vote?" to your smartphone, smart speaker, or smart display you will get useful election information from reliable sources. </p>
<p> After getting this information Maps will show you the directions of how to get to the voting location. Maps will also show you information about the voting hours of said location. </p>
<p> To achieve all of this Google has joined up with the Voting Information Project. The company plans to list more than 200,000 voting locations across the U.S. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For those places it cannot get direct information for then users will be directed to state and local election websites. Overall, this seems like a positive move for Google as they look to convince more Americans to vote by simply making it that bit easier to access that information. </p>

<p> You Will Start Seeing Ads On Your Android TV Today </p>
<p> For a little while now, we've been hearing that Google was looking to bring ads to Android TV, and there's been a few tests. Well, those ads are now rolling out. </p>
<p> So yes, you are going to start seeing ads on your Android TV home screen. </p>
<p> They are called "Staff Picks". And show up at the top of the screen. They show a popular movie or show from an app that you may or may not have installed. It's not a trailer, though you can click on the ad to start watching that show. So the ads aren't totally terrible. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's no auto-playing audio or video </p>
<p> One of the most annoying things about Netflix is the auto-playing of audio and video in a trailer when you're looking for something to watch. Thankfully, Google is not doing that here. </p>
<p> It just shows you a show that you can watch and what app it is on. Like Moana on Disney+. </p>
<p> These ads are going to be a mix of sponsored and Google Play Staff Picks. Particularly right now until Google gets more ads into their system here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> They seem to be based on apps that are already installed on your Android TV. So it's not necessarily about you downloading more apps, but watching content in those apps. After all, that's how these services make their money. </p>
<p> The ads aren't bad, actually </p>
<p> As much as we are all going to hate seeing ads on our Android TV homescreens, the ads aren't bad actually. They appear at the top of the screen, and really don't bother you much. And who knows, they might show you something you want to watch and makes it quicker to jump into that show and watch it. Which is always a good thing. </p>
<p> These are tasteful ads, and fortunately, you can actually get rid of them. At least for now. That is likely going to change in the future. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Let's face it, we know that Google was going to bring ads to Android TV at some point. After all, Google is indeed an ads company, and it makes more than 90% of its revenue from ads. So every product it makes, is to get you to see more ads. So this was bound to happen. Though it did come a lot sooner than it did on Gmail, which is somewhat surprising. </p>
<p> This should be rolling out to your Android TV devices right now. </p>

<p> Android News / Android TV / This Is How Google Is Making Your Android TV Experience Better </p>
<p> This Is How Google Is Making Your Android TV Experience Better </p>
<p> Google is introducing new developer features for Android TV that will ultimately give users a better experience. That's based on a recent developer blog entry from the search giant. Of course, not every change is going to directly impact users on the UI side. But at least a few of them will. And they should make a big difference. </p>
<p> This is what's new for end-users </p>
<p> The most obvious changes, of course, are going to be to the Google Play Store on Android TV itself. For starters, Google is introducing Google Play Instant on TV. So, when developers implement the feature, users will be able to try out titles and apps before they download them. That'll work almost identically to how it does on Android mobile devices. </p>
<p> When users do get around to purchasing content, that'll be easier too. And that's on two fronts. First, Google is enabling PIN code-based purchasing. So users won't need to enter their password every time they buy something. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Beyond that, the company is making typing on Android TV easier, to begin with. New speech-to-text and predictive text features, alongside other improvements, are being made to the on-screen Gboard for Android TV. Among the changes, the company is adding new layouts for the keyboard for quicker, more intuitive typing. </p>
<p> The final change users are likely to notice will appear in games due to a change under-the-hood. Namely, it's introducing a new "Auto low latency mode." </p>
<p> With the mode enabled, developers can disable post-processing and reduce latency automatically. That'll happen whenever a game app is displayed fullscreen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What else is improving for Android TV? </p>
<p> Coming in alongside a plethora of other user-facing features, those additions should make the entire Android TV experience even better. But there's some decently-impactful alterations coming behind the scenes too. </p>
<p> For example, it's adding an Android TV Emulator with Play Store support. That will enable a more seamless test process, including for subscriptions. The biggest benefit will be a reduction in the timeframes required for testing and the need to test on real-world devices. But that should also help reduce issues from device-to-device for end-users. </p>
<p> Finally, a new set of improvements to the Leanback Library will improve app navigation and compatibility. </p>

<p> Google-Focused Android TV Rebranding Seems More Likely Than Ever </p>
<p> The potential rebranding of Android TV, dropping the Android branding in favor of Google, now bears even more weight. That's based on a recently reported teardown of the Google Home application. Within the code, as of app version 2.28, there are several instances where "Google TV" is referenced. Specifically in descriptors. </p>
<p> The strings still also reverence Android TV, calling it "atv," suggesting this change isn't quite ready for primetime. Or, at the very least, that Googlers haven't made the effort yet to change the referencing in the code. That's something that could happen at any time in the development process. Or it could change the branding with the launch of a new product. </p>
<p> Why is this code change appearing in the Google Home app? </p>
<p> Now, it might be expected that changes to Android TV, particularly branding, would appear first in associated apps. Or in code pertaining to the platform itself. That's as opposed to in the Google Home app. But the code itself also centers around another device. Namely, the Android TV dongle codenamed Google Sabrina. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That dongle is expected to act as a kind of update to the Google Chromecast devices that are currently on the market. But, instead of just working to receive Chromecast signals, it also functions as a full-blown Android TV device. </p>
<p> Leaks have pinned down a price for Sabrina around $50 or $60. And the package comes complete with a bundled remote control for the device. </p>
<p> There has already been a plethora of other information about Sabrina in leaks, leading up to the eventual launch. But it may be that launch that explains why Android TV rebranding is happening in Google Home. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Home is a central hub for controlling smart home devices. That includes smart home devices such as the upcoming TV dongle from Google. If the company plans to announce Google TV branding at the same time, it makes sense for the code changes to be associated with the Google Home app. </p>
<p> When will Sabrina and, potentially, Google TV arrive? </p>
<p> As of this writing, Google is expected to kick off an upcoming event a bit early for 2020. As early as September 30, compared to earlier events in early- or mid-October. </p>
<p> That's the search giant's annual hardware event and, as a result, the above-mentioned Sabrina TV dongle is expected to arrive at that event. Because the two products appear to be related, the event would appear to be a reasonable platform for both Android TV-related announcements. </p>

<p> Google's Android TV Streaming Device Clears FCC, Launch Imminent </p>
<p> Google is reportedly working a new media streaming device powered by Android TV. There are also several leaks about this upcoming device in the last few months. Now, two new Google devices got certified by FCC, which are expected to be the "Sabrina" Android TV streaming device and its remote controller. </p>
<p> It was first spotted in the Android 11 preview for Android TV released in June this year. There is a short video of just 8 seconds duration found in the source file showing how to restart this new streaming device. While it is codenamed as Sabrina, we are yet to know its marketing name. </p>
<p> Android TV-powered streaming device from Google gets FCC certified </p>
<p> As per the FCC listing, the device with the model number GZRNL is mentioned as an interactive media streaming device. Just like any other streaming device, it also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. On the other hand, the G9N9N is listed as a Wireless Device and comes with only Bluetooth support. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The label on the G9N9N is said to be placed under the power cover. The remote controllers typically come with a power cover to hide the replaceable batteries. It also reaffirms that the G9N9N is indeed a remote controller for Google's upcoming media streaming device. Also, the labels on both devices confirm they are manufactured in Thailand. </p>
<p> Remote controller comes with a dedicated Google Assistant button </p>
<p> According to the previously leaked marketing materials, the remote controller will look very similar to the one offered with the Daydream View VR headset. It features a circular D-pad along with six circular buttons, one of them is for the Google Assistant. </p>
<p> With this new streaming device, Google will also introduce revamped Android TV UI. Speaking of the hardware, it will come powered by an Amlogic chip and supports Dolby Vision. Considering the other smart home products from Google, this new media streaming device could also come with Nest branding. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It is a successor to the Google Chromecast Ultra and competes with the hugely popular devices like Fire TV Stick and Roku Streaming Stick. There are also cheaper options like the newly launched Mi TV Stick which also comes powered by Android TV. </p>
<p> The smart TV market is already filled with TVs running on Android TV OS. However, we have to wait for the official launch to see what new features this new dongle brings to the table. As of now, there is no official confirmation over the launch date of Google's own media streaming device. </p>

<p> Google Arts & Culture Gets Artwork-Themed AR Filters </p>
<p> Google is pushing a new update to its Google Arts & Culture app, adding a very trendy feature – AR selfie filters. Called "Art Filter," the new AR filters are themed to famous art pieces including paintings, objects, and accessories from all around the world. </p>
<p> There's the legendary self-portrait of Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh. Users can apply this filter to see themselves drawn as that iconic painting. It supports multiple angles and works just as good as any other AR filter. The digital effect impressively matches the brushwork of the renowned artwork from 1889. </p>
<p> Next up is Frida Kahlo's "Self-portrait with Monkey". The collection also includes the famous Girl with a Pearl Earring, a 17th-century oil painting by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. There's also the traditional Samurai helmet and an Ancient Egyptian necklace. Each filter is crafted to allow users to explore the artifacts in high-quality detail from every angle. </p>

<p> Google also offers a short description explaining the history and context of the artwork. At a time when in-person visits to museums aren't possible, this effort from Google allows users to virtually enjoy the famous art pieces. </p>
<p> You can see real-time effects and even capture and save a still image or a short video with the effect to share on your social media channels. The new AR filters are accessible through the rainbow camera icon at the bottom of the Google Arts & Culture app's homepage. </p>
<p> "Art Filter applies Machine Learning based image processing because making this kind of AR feature possible needs a sophisticated anchoring of the virtual content to the real world. Through this approach, the artifacts are able to position themselves organically and smoothly on your head or react to your facial expression," said Florent Robineau and Ion Esfandiari of Google in a blog post on Wednesday. </p>

<p> Google adds artwork-themed AR filters to its Google Arts & Culture app </p>
<p> The Google Arts & Culture app offers virtual tours of art exhibits and collections from around the world. From New York's Museum of Modern Art to the Musee d'Orsay in Paris and the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia, this app lets you virtually visit them all. </p>
<p> Google is now making that experience more personalized by letting you capture yourself with some famous artworks in history. Hopefully, the company will add more such filters to the collection in the future. </p>
<p> Google Arts & Culture also offers many other AR features. The "Art Transfer" feature lets you superimpose an art style to an existing image while "Art Selfie" uses machine learning to find portraits that look like you. Lastly, there's "Art Projector" that shows how artworks look in real size by virtually projecting them in your living space. </p>

<p> Google Assistant May Get Some Android App Interactions Soon </p>
<p> Google is seemingly well on its way to adding some new features to Assistant, specifically Android app interactions. </p>
<p> As spotted by 9To5Google, it looks like Google wants users to have more control over their Android apps via voice. Google Assistant can not yet control these Android app interactions but Google has laid out a list of possible commands that users could make. </p>
<p> This is to give people an idea of the sorts of things Google is looking at implementing. Even without Google giving examples, one could simply imagine the possibilities for a minute or two and come up with a few on their own. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Assistant Android app interactions will be very specific </p>
<p> You might not think about how specific you are when you interact with the apps on your phone. But you're probably more specific in your intent when using your apps than you might think. </p>
<p> We're just so used to interacting with our phones on a daily basis that it just comes natural. And perhaps we think nothing of it. Google wants to make Assistant capable of being this specific when you tell it to do something with an app. </p>
<p> It can already launch apps if you tell it to. And to some degree it can do slightly specific things. Like if you tell Assistant to send a message in Discord, it will recognize this. But all it does is open Discord and bring up the search bar where you can then type in who you want to send a message to. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With Google's new changes though, you could tell Assistant to message a certain user in Discord specifically and it will go that message thread. Then likely ask you what you want to say. This is just one of Google's examples too. </p>
<p> Others include telling Assistant to order a smoothie on Postmates, and find a motivation mix on Spotify. Keep in mind these are just examples. And not necessarily reflective of exact commands that you could make once this goes live. </p>
<p> Custom voice prompts are coming too </p>
<p> In addition to these new interactions, Google is setting out to add custom prompts. Letting users choose what to say to activate commands is something users will no doubt love. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But it's not just about having a cool custom prompt that you may enjoy. It also allows users to personalize their commands to something that only they know. Presumably, you'd be able to set up a custom prompt for the command for any app that's compatible with these new interaction features. </p>

<p> Google Assistant Driving Mode Finally Rolling Out To Users </p>
<p> More than a year after the initial announcement, Google is finally ready to roll out Google Assistant's Driving Mode for Android smartphones. According to a report by XDA Developers, the feature is now starting to appear for some users. </p>
<p> XDA spotted the first signs of this rollout a couple of weeks ago when users reported seeing a new navigation UI in Google Maps. They discovered more evidence that linked this UI change to Google Assistant's Driving Mode last week. And now, the new Google Maps navigation UI has arrived for Mishaal Rahman of XDA and he confirms that it's indeed a part of the much-awaited feature. </p>
<p> The feature appears to be rolling through a server-side update, though. For Rahman, the new driving mode was available on a Google Pixel 4, the LG Velvet, and the ASUS ZenFone 7 Pro, all running different versions of Google Maps and the Google App. However, all the devices were signed onto the same Google account, which suggests it to be a server-side rollout. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Assistant Driving Mode is finally here </p>
<p> Google announced Assistant's Driving Mode back at Google I/O 2019 in May last year. A replacement for the Android Auto app on smartphones, the company promised to launch it soon after the announcement but that wasn't to be. </p>
<p> After over a year-long wait, Google Assistant's Driving Mode finally seems to be ready. In the screenshots shared by XDA, one can clearly see that the description for "Google Assistant settings" under "Navigation settings" of Google Maps now reads "Manage driving mode". The description previously read "Google Assistant settings." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tapping this menu takes you to a new driving mode settings page for Google Assistant. However, it still seems to be a partial rollout, at least in this case. The feature wasn't responding to voice commands. As per Google's announcement, a "Hey Google, let's drive" voice command should bring up the Driving Mode dashboard. The dashboard would show driving-relevant activities as well as several personalized recommendations. </p>
<p> The new UI also looks quite different from what Google showed during the announcement. Perhaps the feature may have undergone multiple changes since then. And that may have been the reason for this unprecedented delay as well. </p>
<p> There's also a possibility that Google is still running A/B tests for the UI. We'll have to wait for an official announcement from the company. And it may not be too far off now given some of these changes started to appear about two weeks ago for some users. </p>

<p> Android News / Android TV / Google Assistant Voice Match Support Could Be Coming To Android TV </p>
<p> Google Assistant Voice Match Support Could Be Coming To Android TV </p>
<p> Your Android TV may soon get Google Assistant's Voice Match feature. That's according to some recently added code strings in the Google Search app for Android TV. </p>
<p> Google is rolling out a new update for the Search app on Android TV, jumping from version 3.14.2 to 4.2.0. The 9to5Google team have decompiled the APK for this version and discovered that the company is working on deeper Google Assistant and Google Home integration for Android TV. </p>
<p> They discovered some code strings that hint at the possibility of Google Assistant for Android TV gaining Voice Match functionality. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> <string name="voice_match_setup_screen_title">Activate Voice Match on this TV</string> </p>
<p> <string name="voice_match_setup_screen_description_1">"Your Assistant can already recognize you by your voice, and tell you apart from others. </p>
<p> Voice Match allows your Assistant to identify you and tell you apart from others. The Assistant takes clips of your voice to form a unique voice model, which is only stored on your device(s). Your voice model may be sent temporarily to Google to better identify your voice. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you decide later that Voice Match isn’t for you, simply remove it from Assistant Settings. To view or delete the audio clips you record during Voice Match setup, go to activity.google.com."</string> </p>
<p> Google Working on Voice Match support for Android TV </p>
<p> Google Assistant’s Voice Match feature is already available on several smart speakers and displays available in the current market. The company recently added support for third-party devices such as those from Bose or Sonos as well. </p>
<p> These devices can recognize up to six different voices. This enables them to differentiate between multiple household members and tailor the responses accordingly. Now, this functionality appears to be headed to Android TVs as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once the feature rolls out, your Android TV will be able to do tasks such as logging into the correct Netflix profile based on who is speaking. In its current form, Google Assistant on Android TVs simply uses the Google Account currently logged in to handle a request. </p>
<p> This news comes at a time when Google is rumored to be preparing an Android TV dongle. Codenamed Sabrina, the Amazon Fire TV stick-like dongle will likely come with a dedicated remote control with Google Assistant integration. It would certainly benefit from Voice Match support. </p>
<p> Sabrina will most likely release at the upcoming Made by Google event. However, it's not known when that'll occur. There's already a lot of confusion regarding the launch date of the Pixel 4a. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Televisions are among the devices that are used by multiple peoples in a household. So Voice Match support would be a great addition. In fact, it should have come much sooner. Nevertheless, Google now seems to be putting in efforts in this regard. </p>
<p> That said, code strings present in an app's APK is never a confirmation that such features are coming. It's entirely up to Google to decide. </p>
<p> It may or may not ever ship those features. Even if it does, they may function differently. So nothing is set in stone until Google officially announces Voice Match support for Android TVs. </p>

<p> Google Challenge Invalidates Three BlackBerry UI Patents </p>
<p> Three patents held by BlackBerry concerning user interface elements have been invalidated this week, following Google's decision to challenge four of them, as well as a subsequent review by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). Two of the patents in question specifically apply to portions of the user interface which appear to be associated with the notification bar and similar navigation elements. In the former of the three cases, Google successfully argued that the language used by BlackBerry in its patent claims do not accurately describe the interface elements in question, noting that there was a separation between elements that BlackBerry's claims describe as being embedded. Because of that, the technology being patented was effectively the same as that covered by previous inventions. </p>
<p> The board ultimately ruled that the problems with the patents would have been obvious to any person with sufficient understanding of graphical user interfaces "the time of their invention." As a result, the two patented technologies are unpatentable. Meanwhile, the third patent was invalidated prior to this most recent ruling by a day and pertained to a timestamp displayed alongside messages. It was also at the center of a dispute between BlackBerry and BLU which was settled back in 2017. In the more recent ruling, the PTAB found that in some circumstances where the patent claim had been brought to bear, the patent was already well-defined in previous patents not held by BlackBerry. As of this writing, Google has one more challenge remaining to be reviewed by the board with regard to a patent claimed by BlackBerry. </p>
<p> In the meantime, BlackBerry is currently involved in at least three other lawsuits regarding its patents. The first two of those series involves Snap Inc.'s Snapchat service and a total of seven patents. Facebook hasn't escaped the fray either and has been accused of infringing on messaging patents through its subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram. Those cases were filed back in April and March of this year, respectively. The latter case pits Nokia as the defendant and was filed last year. However, unlike the other patent infringement cases brought by BlackBerry, the allegation against Nokia is that the latter company infringed on BlackBerry's mobile networking technologies. None of those trials is expected to begin until at least 2020. </p>

<p> Google Demos New Nest Thermostat's Full Integration With The Home App </p>
<p> Google is offering full-fledged integration with the Google Home app for the newly announced Nest Thermostat. The company has officially introduced its new Thermostat earlier this week in the US and Canada. It is currently available to pre-order via the Google Store and costs just $129, which is almost half the price of the third-gen Nest Thermostat launched in 2015. </p>
<p> Unlike earlier, the Home app can be used to fully control the new Nest Thermostat. In a video posted on Google Nest's Youtube channel, the company demos all the features of this new integration. Users can access these controls by tapping on the "Thermostat" shortcut in the quick actions tab on the Google Home app's home screen. </p>
<p> New Nest Thermostat gets full integration with the Google Home App </p>
<p> Just like in the past, there is a dial for adjusting the temperature. It also includes + and – buttons placed below the dial to increment or decrement the temperature by one degree. Apart from showing the current temperature value, the app also displays humidity. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, the new addition here is the quick actions tab at the bottom of the screen. The first option is for selecting a mode. Tapping on it shows four different temperature preferences — Heat, Cool, Heat + Cool, and Off. Users can select a temperature preset by tapping on the second button. </p>
<p> There will be a total of three options — Comfort, Eco, and Sleep. Additionally, these presets can be customized to the user's liking. To customize the presets, tap on the "Settings" icon in the top right corner of the screen and go to temperature preferences and select temperature presets. </p>
<p> Users can also create custom temperature presets </p>
<p> Apart from adjusting the default presets, users can also create their own preset by tapping on the "Create custom" button at the bottom. While customizing these presets, the app will display a green leaf icon to let users know that they have selected an energy-saving temperature. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The next button in the quick actions tab is for holding the temperature at a certain level. Apart from selecting the desired temperature, users can also select the time period to hold that exact temperature. The last option is to run the fan for at least 15 minutes to up to 12 hours. </p>
<p> The app shows an orange glow to indicate it is in heat mode and a blue glow for cool mode. By the time the new Nest Thermostat goes on sale, the company might also bring the complete Google Home integration to the older Nest Thermostats. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Put Down Your Phone & Video Call On Your Android TV With Google Duo </p>
<p> Put Down Your Phone & Video Call On Your Android TV With Google Duo </p>
<p> Google Duo is coming to Android TV soon, the company has reportedly announced. A screenshot shared alongside the announcement reveals that it will even hold to a similar UI. At least in-call. There, the streaming video that's being received will fill the majority of the screen. A thumbnail of the streamed-out feed will show in the bottom-left-hand corner. </p>
<p> The company indicates that group calls will also be possible, allowing for larger meetings. So that will most likely work exactly how the other app-variants of the service do too. </p>
<p> Wait! How does Google Duo on Android TV work without a phone for a camera? </p>
<p> Now, the overwhelming majority of televisions — Android TV or not — don't have cameras on them. That presents a bit of a puzzle, at least at the surface, regarding how this feature will work on the platform. But Google is sidestepping the issue entirely by allowing users to connect on USB accessory. In this case, a camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That means that, in effect, users will be able to just pick up whatever camera they want. Whether that's a budget-friendly HD camera or a high-end webcam meant for studio-style streaming. Google hasn't detailed any limitations to that. Presumably it will simply need to be an Android-friendly plug-n-play camera. </p>
<p> When can you start using this? </p>
<p> While Google has given a fairly good description of how Google Duo on Android TV will work, its timeframe is a bit foggy. The search giant says that the app will land sometime over the "coming weeks." </p>
<p> That will also be as a "Beta" build. So it's equally unclear whether or not the app will be available for everybody right out of the gate. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google isn't giving away any details about what the app will look like or if it will offer all of the same features as the Android app either. The company has launched Duo on smart displays recently. And it's spent a good deal of effort on bringing AR effects across the board. That all should be intact but hasn't been specified. Ideally, Google will kick off at least a few other novelties at the same time. But that's all still unknown as of this writing. </p>

<p> Google Duo For Android TV Brings Improved Support </p>
<p> After announcing that Google will be bringing Google Duo support for Android TV back in August, it finally arrived for Android TV back in September for the users. </p>
<p> The company announced that the Google Duo for Android TV will carry the same UI and other features. And the Android TV app carried all that was expected out of it. </p>
<p> The Google Duo for Android TV OS is available to download from the Android TV App Store. This enables the users to attend meetings on their big screens. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Moreover, students can attend their online classes on the big screen instead of small screens on their devices or laptops. The experience of watching friends and family on the big screen is also something great. </p>
<p> For those who are wondering how the app will work on Android TV without a camera. Well, Google thought it out ahead of you, and it allows the users to attach any USB camera device to the TV to use Google Duo. </p>
<p> Preferably, as pointed out by us in the previous post, an Android compatible plug-n-play USB camera would be more appropriate to use. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> According to a report by 9to5Google, the new update brings improved support and some more subtle new features that would help you treat Google Duo as an Android TV app. </p>
<p> The new Google Duo update makes it is more compatible with Android TV OS </p>
<p> After arriving on the Play Store back in early September, a new update is already live for the users. It makes the app more compatible with the Android TV OS. </p>
<p> Google Duo now supports Android TV's home screen. Meaning that you can place the icon of the app in the favorites row. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This would enable the users to quickly launch the app and connect a video call with their loved ones. You can now access the app from the "app drawer" itself. </p>
<p> However, there are no in-app changes or features that have been added to the app. The features remain the same, but it is good to see that Android TV compatibility is improved. </p>
<p> Once you run the app, it will show you the familiar interface which you see on the smartphone app. Making a call is functional, and if you are opt-in for the voice-only call, it will use the TV remote's inbuilt microphone to connect voice calls. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But there is still a caveat. Receiving video calls on Google Duo Android TV app is still not available. On the positive side, we presume that this is something Google may be already working on. </p>
<p> So, it is better to give some time to the app to mature. We will keep an eye on the lookout if any new changes come to the Duo app for the Android TV OS. </p>

<p> Google Duo App Can Now Be Downloaded On Android TV </p>
<p> Well, some good news is up for the Google Duo users, especially in times of the pandemic. Google Duo app is now available for the Android TV OS. </p>
<p> Notably, the app is available to download from the Android TV App Store and users can install the app to use Google Duo on their big screen. </p>
<p> Google announced last month that Google Duo will be coming to Android TV soon. This will help the users to make video calls and do meetings from the comfort of their big smart TV screens. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One important question that may come to your minds is how Google Duo will work with Android TV without a camera. Fortunately, Google has a pretty neat and simple solution to this. </p>
<p> Users will be able to use a USB camera device to connect to their Android TV and make calls using Google Duo. In fact, users are free to choose any budget camera they want. The only trick is that the camera device should have a USB attachment. </p>
<p> However, it is more preferable to use an Android OS compatible plug-and-play camera to avoid any compatibility issues. If you cannot find one or have an old spare camera device, then that will also do the job. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Duo Android TV app is available on the Play Store as a stable version </p>
<p> The good thing is that the Google Duo for Android TV app is not listed as a beta app. Besides, it is listed as a stable version of the app. </p>
<p> Meaning that users will be able to enjoy all the features as fluently as possible. This also means that the Google Duo app is properly cooked for Android TVs. </p>
<p> Though there is one caveat as noted by XDA, that there is no banner available for quickly launching the app. But that is not something Google cannot bring in future updates. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is one great addition to the list of apps to Android TV as it lets you connect to your loved one's straight from your Android TV. This also negates the need for using laptops and smartphones. </p>
<p> You can simply relax on your couch and perform a video call or attend a meeting via the Google Duo application. The app is available to download from the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Let us know in the comments below if you are also able to download the Google Duo app on your Android TV. Also, do let us know if you come across any issues while using the app on your big screen. </p>

<p> Google Can Help You Find A Song If You Hum </p>
<p> Yesterday, Google announced that it is adding a new hum to search feature to its search tools. This would allow the users to just hum the tune and search for any song that is stuck in their heads. </p>
<p> Notably, this could be very beneficial for those who could not remember the lyrics of the song. You can just hum the tune of the song and Google will try to identify the song with that tune and show you the results. </p>
<p> It is a common case scenario, where a nice song playing at the coffee shop, stucks into our head. Due to some of the other reasons, we could not recall the lyrics of the songs. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can literally search for the song that goes "da daaaa da da daaaa na naa naa ooohh yeah?" and Google will use the machine learning capabilities to search and identify the song the resembles the hum that you searched in the first place. </p>
<p> Besides, users would be able to hum, whistle, or sing a melody and let Google do its job for searching the song. However, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of the Google app installed on your device. </p>
<p> Google hum to search feature is available on the Google app for both iOS and Android </p>
<p> Good thing is that Google has not limited this feature only to the Google App on Android. Instead, the iOS users can also take advantage of this Google hum to search feature on their Apple devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You simply need to tap on the mic icon and say "what's this song?" or click the newly added "Search a song" button and then hum the tune you remember for 10-15 seconds. </p>
<p> Google will make use of the inbuilt machine learning and will try to closely show the result that is likely a match. Users will be able to listen to the search results and take note of the song's name if that is perfect to your hum. </p>
<p> Once the search is complete, you can view the matching videos, listen to the audio that is correct to your hum, find the lyrics of the song, and much more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To go into the details, Google explains this feature using machine learning models to "transform the audio into a number-based sequence representing the song’s melody." It then compares the melody with the existing songs. </p>
<p> The machine learning models are trained on a variety of sources. For instance, humans singing, whistling, or humming, as well as studio recordings. </p>
<p> Apparently, this feature is currently available in English on iOS and in more than 20 languages on Android. Google will expand this to more languages as the days go on. </p>

<p> Google Kids Space Is A Cool New Feature On Android Tablets </p>
<p> Kids get to be showered with technology these days and Google Kids Space is a way for parents to take advantage of all that. </p>
<p> Whether you've purchased your kids their own tablet or you simply let them use yours, Google Kids Space is a way for you to make things more fun and educational at the same time. </p>
<p> That being said, Kids Space is currently only available on a few different Android Tablets right now. However it will be expanding in the near future. Which means it'll reach more kids, and that means more curious minds being fed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Kids Space comes to various tablets from Lenovo </p>
<p> Google is starting the Kids Space rollout with some of Lenovo's new tablets. Which were actually just announced back on August 28. </p>
<p> This includes the P11 Pro, as well as the second generation of the Smart Tab M10 HD. Both of these should have the new kids feature right out of the box. And Google does say that it will roll the feature out to other Android tablets soon. </p>
<p> Albeit without giving a specific date. Does that make Kids Space a feature that will help sell tablets? It really depends on how much you want your kids to have access to it. And if you've already got a tablet that you own and let them use. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Essentially what the feature does is aggregate a bunch of curated kids content. So if you want a collection of stuff that caters to kids to be easily accessible to them, you might want this feature right away. As it certainly makes kids content easy for them to find. </p>
<p> Get the kids involved in the setup for the best experience </p>
<p> The whole focus is on your kids. And for the best experience Google designed the feature in a way that is meant to surface content that they like. </p>
<p> So what you'll do is basically go through the content with your kids and have them select categories that they show interest in. Not too unlike Netflix has you do when setting up your account for the first time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> After having done this, Kids Space can begin to recommend content that fits into those selected interests. Which means it'll be stuff they actually engage with as opposed to just whatever is listed as kids content. </p>
<p> It's a tailor-made experience and was designed to engage their curiosity and foster it further. Plus it's no doubt entertaining for them. </p>

<p> Google Maps Adds New Vehicle Icons With Latest Update For Android </p>
<p> It is Google's way of bringing some quirky elements to its apps that elevate the user experience. Though it may not sound like much, in the latest Google Maps Android update, Google has added new vehicle icons. </p>
<p> Notably, Google Maps is the best and most used navigation map for any Android app. Over the years, the app has gained features that set this app apart. </p>
<p> And the latest update finally brings new vehicle icons for the Android users. There was not much hullabaloo around this new addition on Google Maps. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As a matter of fact, most of you might not even know that this feature was even supposed to come to the Google Maps app. As long as Google Maps is serving its purpose, such minor changes don't really grab the attention of general users. </p>
<p> However, after being added to iOS first, Google decided to add vehicle icons to Android. This is quite surprising that Android which is Google's own product receives certain features after iOS. </p>
<p> Whatever the reason may be, now users on Android can also change the vehicle icon when using navigation. This feature was available on iOS for quite a while. </p>

<p> Google Maps vehicle icon arrives with version 10.52.2 update for Android </p>
<p> For those who have been keeping track of this vehicle icon feature, the Google Maps app version 10.52.2 is the version for Android that you need to be on in order to get new vehicle icons. </p>
<p> You can choose between a red car, yellow SUV, and a green pick-up truck vehicle icon in place of the standard arrow mark which shows while navigating. </p>
<p> Notably, this feature was there in the beta builds of Google Maps Android. So, it is good to see that the stable app users are also getting this little feature for Google Maps. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In order to use or change the navigation icon, you need to first navigation on the Maps app. Then tap on the arrow icon and a small pop-up menu will show you all the 3 vehicle icons that you can choose from. </p>
<p> The iOS app also works in the same fashion. However, the icon will only appear when you start driving. When you start driving a 3D vehicle icon will turn, spin, and move in real-time. </p>
<p> Surprisingly, Google has not mentioned this new change in any of the official support blogs. Besides, the app on the Google Play Store also does not mention this change. </p>

<p> If you have not yet got this feature, then make sure to update the Google Maps app with version number 10.52.2 for Android. You can head over to the Google Play Store for updates. </p>

<p> Google Maps Will Help You To Stay Away From Crowds </p>
<p> The year 2020 has really brought the entire world to a standstill. However, restrictions are now easing down and to navigate in this world, Google will give you information on whether the place is safe and free from a crowd. </p>
<p> Earlier, Google has already added the COVID-19 layer, that shows critical coronavirus related information in that particular area. The worst-hit areas will be highlighted in a different color. </p>
<p> Google is taking every possible step to make its users aware of COVID-19 by keeping them updated with the latest information on coronavirus. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Although it is still not advised for people to go out in the crowd. As things have still not gotten better. In fact, until the vaccine comes in, the only way to keep safe is to avoid public gathering or limiting going out. </p>
<p> This way we will be keeping ourselves and others safe from this deadly virus. And adding to this convenience, Google Maps will provide busyness information about places like stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. </p>
<p> This information will include whether such places are free from the crowd. Additionally, it will also show information if social-distancing is being followed in those places or not. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can also get information about all other public areas as well. Crowded places will be visible for the users on the Google Maps app and you can take your decision to go out or not, based on that. </p>
<p> Google will be using its Duplex AI technology to keep the information up to date </p>
<p> Now, the most important thing about this Google Maps Busyness feature is to have the latest and current information. And for that, Google will be using its Duplex AI technology. </p>
<p> This would help Google to call and ask the businesses if their Google Maps busyness information is up to date or not. During the pandemic, several businesses may have changed their working hours. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So, the Google Duplex AI system would interact with the business owners and ask them to keep the information updated. This would help the customers to keep in check, when to visit the store and when not. </p>
<p> Furthermore, users will be able to have a glance at businesses if they are busy or not, even without the need of searching for a specific place on Google Maps. </p>
<p> Besides, this Google Maps Busyness feature is going to be pushed for Android and iOS in the coming days. Moreover, the desktop application will also get this new feature. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Maps already provides tons of information about COVID-19 in the surrounding places. And the addition of this feature would definitely improve upon that and will help keep people safe. </p>

<p> Google Meet Android App Gets Revamped User Interface </p>
<p> Google has been pressing the Google Meet app as its alternative to the Zoom app. And in the process of this, on Friday, Google announced a refreshed look and feel to the UI of the Google Meet Android app. </p>
<p> The updated UI brings an all-new look to the user interface of the app, and it brings some nifty quick shortcut buttons as well. This piece of information was shared by Google on its official blog. </p>
<p> Well, this is not the first time, Google is pushing new features for the Google Meet app. Just back in September, Google pushed a very important AI-powered noise-canceling feature for the app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This was aimed to improve the video calling experience of the user by reducing the background noise. It makes use of Google AI to automatically filter out the background noise from your device's audio input. </p>
<p> This Google Meet feature was made available for all the users of the Android and iOS. And now another new feature and revamped design is making its way for Android users. </p>
<p> The new Google Meet Android update brings a quick launch summary and a new meeting button to the app. Moreover, the new meeting button gives access to up to three options. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These options are Get meeting joining info to share with others, Start a Meet call instantly, and Schedule a new meeting in Google Calendar. </p>
<p> Google Meet gets the new Blue color and ditches the swampy-green color </p>
<p> The color scheme of the Google Meet Android app is also changed. Notably, Google Meet is now getting re-colored with the Blue color instead of the swampy-green color which it was known for. </p>
<p> Google has been projecting this app as its alternative to the uber-popular Zoom app. And in order to stand toe to toe with Zoom, Google needs to timely update and bring new features to the app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The new look and user interface of the Android app is the same as seen with the Gmail app. The video chat app allows the user to connect with anyone from anywhere in the world. </p>
<p> And due to the current pandemic situation, when everyone is stuck at home and are working from home. This is a good app for companies, educators, and friends and family to stay connected with each other. </p>
<p> Notably, this feature was first pushed for the Google Meet tab in Gmail, and then later for the iOS app. And now finally it is making its way for the Android users. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Note that the new update is available for all the users of Google Meet, including Workspace customers and anyone with a personal Google account. You can grab the latest update from the Google Play Store. </p>

<p> Google Nears Agreement With EU Over Fitbit Data Use </p>
<p> Google appears to have nearly reached an agreement with the EU over data use in its acquisition over Fitbit. As reported by Reuters, Google offered to sweeten the concessions to the EU in order to get the agreement over the line. </p>
<p> Google first ran into problems over the acquisition of Fitbit back in the summer of 2020. What followed was a lengthy investigation by the EU focusing on concerns of Google using the data acquired from Fitbit users. </p>
<p> Google has always maintained that the acquisition was always about devices rather than data. Hence why the company was happy to offer some concessions to the EU. As a result, positive signs about the deal began to emerge at the end of September. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now it has emerged why those positive muting began, which is because Google has offered more concessions to the EU. It now looks as if the deal will go through before the end of the year. </p>
<p> Google offers EU more concessions to get Fitbit deal over the line </p>
<p> The EU's concerns boiled down to how Google may use the data gained from Fitbit's users. The fear was Google would feed this data into its targeted ads side of the business hence making the acquisition even more profitable for the company. </p>
<p> However, Google has agreed to restrict the use of Fitbit data for Google ads which alleviated some of these fears. Google has also agreed that it will facilitate rival makers of wearables seeking to connect to the Android platform. This curbs some of the antitrust concerns about the deal. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In that same vain Google has also said it will allow third parties’ continued access to Fitbit users’ data with their consent. </p>
<p> This appears to have been a revised offer from Google following feedback it received from rivals and consumers. Reaching an agreement in this way will be much more beneficial to Google. This is because it should prevent the EU from producing a charge sheet setting out its specific concerns. </p>
<p> As a result, the deal will appear much more amicable and straightforward than it probably was behind closed doors. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google says that a deal between Fitbit and itself will "increase competition in the sector, benefiting consumers and making the next generation of devices better and more affordable". </p>
<p> This deal will certainly be a way for Fitbit to try and regain market leadership in the wearable sector. Using Google's hardware efforts will no doubt make them a more competitive offering. Hopefully, the cost of this to the consumer in terms of data use will have been mitigated in this agreement between Google and the EU. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Google Photos Tests Premium Print Series, A Monthly Subscription Service </p>
<p> Google Photos Tests Premium Print Series, A Monthly Subscription Service </p>
<p> As per the latest reports by 9to5Google, Google is testing out a new automatic monthly subscription service, called the Premium Print Series. This will allow the user to print their best photos. </p>
<p> Notably, when subscribed to this Google Photos Premium Print Series, Google will send the user's prints uploaded to its Photos app every month. </p>
<p> Note that when a similar service was highlighted previously, it was available for a price of $7.99. However, as per new reports, the new Google Photos Premium Print Series could arrive for $6.99. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Well, it is a good thing to have all your captured memories saved in a cloud. But having a printed copy of that memory is something special. </p>
<p> Besides, users were able to get prints of their saved images on Google Photos for a while now. You can take prints in the form of photo books, canvas art, etc. </p>
<p> But this new Google Photos Premium Print Series subscription gives another option. This would include the photos suggested by Google, with all the controls available to the user. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Keep in mind that the user has the utmost control over which photos they want to choose for this service. Moreover, the suggested images can be easily edited by the users or they can skip a month if they want to. </p>
<p> Google Photos Premium Print Series will provide users with more customization options </p>
<p> This feature was discovered by Reverse Engineer Jane Manchun Wong. When a user opts for this subscription, Google will send 10 photos each month. </p>
<p> Over which the user has full control. Moreover, this feature brings more customization control options for the users. Apparently, users will be able to choose between matte or glossy print options or choose to have a border or no border. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additionally, users will also get the option of including postcard type photo information at the back of each photo. After choosing the options at your convenience, Google Photos will send ten 4×6 prints each month. </p>
<p> These photos will be based on Google algorithms on Google Photos. However, as already mentioned, the user has the final call and can review and edit the images. </p>
<p> Good thing is that, if you are busy or did not take memorable clicks during a month, you can pause your subscription. It is priced at $6.99, which is affordable to say. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You do not have to visit a physical store, which is a bit risky in current times of the pandemic and social distancing. There is no info on when this Google Photos Premium Print Series will come to reality. </p>
<p> But taking a look at the leaks, we expect a formal announcement in the coming weeks. We will keep you posted once we have more information in this regard. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-5" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484852" filename="google-pixel-5">
<p> Google Pixel 5: Release Date, Specs, Price & More </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 5 was announced by Google on September 30, in a virtual event. It's the follow up to one of 2019's worst smartphones, the Pixel 4. </p>
<p> With the Pixel 5, Google opted to go back to the basics, and make a cheaper smartphone, that included all of the fundamentals. So instead of having the latest bleeding-edge silicon inside, or having the biggest and best screen, Google opted for specs that everyone can love. That includes a slightly slower processor, a smaller display, but keeping the same great camera that Pixel has been known for. The Pixel 5 isn't here to compete with Apple and Samsung, but to be a cheaper alternative to those two smartphone giants. </p>
<p> You'll find everything you need to know about the Google Pixel 5 here. From the release date, to the specs, to pricing, availability and everything in between. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How much does the Pixel 5 cost? </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 5 costs $699 in the US and £599 in the UK and most other places. </p>
<p> It also comes in one storage variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. And only two colors. So there isn't a better model that you can spend more on to get better specs, unlike in previous years. </p>
<p> That brings it back down to a price we haven't seen for the flagship Pixel since the original Pixel in 2016. The Pixel was $699 and the Pixel XL was $769. Those were simpler times. It's good to see it being brought down to a more affordable price, when we have other smartphones that are crossing the $1,200 mark nowadays. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Should I wait for a price drop? </p>
<p> Pixels always get some sort of price drop, shortly after they go on sale. And that's because these phones are not big sellers like the Galaxy S20 or Note 20 series. And carriers are looking to move these. At launch, Verizon has some pretty good deals on the Pixel 5, but it is likely to drop even further on Black Friday in November. You could ideally see the Pixel 5 go as low as $500 then. </p>
<p> No matter the phone, prices always drop as soon as a month after its launch. So do keep that in mind before picking one up. Especially if you're looking to get one at a pretty cheap price. </p>
<p> When can I pre-order the Google Pixel 5? </p>
<p> Pixel 5 pre-orders are open right now. At Verizon, Best Buy, Amazon and the Google Store. Other carriers and retailers will open their pre-orders later this month. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In the US, the Pixel 5 won't be available until October 29, but elsewhere, you can get yours as soon as October 15. This is likely due to the mmWave model that they are selling in the US, because of Verizon's 5G network using mmWave only right now. Elsewhere, the Pixel 5 costs $100 less. The Pixel 4a 5G comes in two different models because of this. With Verizon technically getting its own model with mmWave support. </p>
<p> What carriers support the Pixel 5? </p>
<p> In the US, the Pixel 5 is supported by all three major carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. That also includes any MVNOs that run on those networks, like Straight Talk, Cricket, and such. </p>
<p> It also supports all 5G networks in the US. Including Verizon's mmWave network. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Which carriers will sell the Pixel 5? </p>
<p> So far, only Verizon has opened pre-orders for the Pixel 5. But AT&T has confirmed to AndroidHeadlines that it will be carrying the Pixel 5 (and Pixel 4a 5G) as well. Though pricing and pre-order availability has not been confirmed just yet. T-Mobile has not said a word about the new Pixels. So it's possible that they could be opting not to sell either device. </p>
<p> Verizon has always been a big partner for Google with the Pixel devices, having the exclusive for the first three years and spending tens of millions, advertising the phones. But, even if the carriers are not selling the Pixel 5, you can still pick it up from Google and use it on your carrier. Since it is being sold unlocked. All you need to do is pop in your SIM card and you're all set. </p>
<p> What colors does the Pixel 5 come in? </p>
<p> Google is offering it in two colors this year: Just Black and Sorta Sage. Unfortunately, there isn't a white color this time around, as there has been for every Pixel device, ever. But you are getting the plain black that a lot of people love, along with an exciting color in Sorta Sage, which is sort of a darker green color on the Pixel 5. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's possible that the Pixel 5 is not coming in white because it's using a metal-ish back. And doing white would have been tough and possibly discolored a lot sooner than one would want. </p>
<p> What are the specs of the Google Pixel 5? </p>
<p> Many refer to the Pixel 5 as being a mid-range smartphone, and well, that's their opinion. This is still a very capable smartphone, even without Qualcomm's most powerful chipset on the market. The specs are pretty much what you'd expect for the Pixel 5 though. </p>
<p> $699 </p>
<p> What new features does the Pixel 5 have? </p>
<p> Google was actually pretty quiet about new features on the Pixel 5 this year. There are plenty of new features, but not nearly as much as the Pixel 3 and Pixel 4 had when they were announced. This could partly be due to the fact that the Pixel 5 is much more affordable this year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Night Sight Portrait Mode </p>
<p> As always, the biggest new features are within the camera. And this year, it has a few new camera features available, like Night Sight Portrait Mode. Google has essentially taken two of its most popular camera modes and combined them into a single mode. That's Night Sight and Portrait Mode. Allowing you to get some great selfies, at night. And with most of us doing bonfires now that it is starting to get cold, you can get some really cool looking night selfies out of the Pixel 5 camera. </p>
<p> Though, the images that Google released to show off this feature, don't look all that great. So these may not be stunning. But still cool that it can be done. </p>
<p> Cinematic Pans </p>
<p> Google is finally taking video seriously this year with the Pixel 5. It has added Cinematic Pans, so creators can really use this phone to make videos. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Pixel team took a feature that creators use quite a bit in their videos and built it into the phone. Something that would normally need a gimbal to be done properly. Basically, Google is taking its OIS to a whole new level with the Pixel 5, and this Cinematic Pans feature. It is slowing down your video to 2X, so that it can get those smooth and crisp shots. </p>
<p> 4K60 video recording </p>
<p> Speaking of video, Google also added a much requested feature for video. And that's 4K60. Last year with the Pixel 4, many were shocked that it was not included. After all, the sensor and the processor were both capable of 4K60, but Google had a few reasons why it was left off. Stating that no one wanted it, it took up to much storage (remember Pixel 4 came in 64GB and 128GB models), etc. </p>
<p> But this year, 4K60 is here. Allowing you to get some really smooth video in 4K on this smartphone, making for an interesting way to make videos. Of course, it will use up more storage, but since the Pixel 5 comes with 128GB of storage, that shouldn't be a big issue. You can also offload these to Google Photos to make more room. </p>
<p> Hold for Me with Google Assistant </p>
<p> Outside of the camera features, there are a few others included. Like the new "Hold for Me" feature with Google Assistant. If you've ever called your ISP, wireless carrier, or really any other company, you've probably been put on hold for a while until someone can answer your call. </p>
<p> Well, now instead of having to sit there and listen to their terrible hold music, Google Assistant can do that for you. It'll sit on hold for you, and let you know when someone is on the line to speak with you. So you can keep going about your day. It's a fairly simple feature, but a very useful one. </p>
<p> There are plenty of other features available on the Pixel 5 as well. Some of which will be coming to older Pixel devices via a feature drop in the coming months. </p>
<p> Is the Pixel 5 environmentally friendly? </p>
<p> Google has been working to eliminate e-waste lately, and with its new products, they are mostly made from recycled materials. Including the Pixel 5. So if you're worried about the environment, you can purchase the Pixel 5 without worrying about it being bad for the environment. </p>
<p> The cases that Google is selling for the Pixel 5 are also made from 100% recycled fabric too. </p>
<p> Pixel 5 isn't the first product from Google to be made from recycled materials. The Chromecast and Nest Audio announced the same day, are made 100% from recycled materials. The Pixel 4a announced in August is also partly made from recycled materials, as well as the Pixel 4a fabric cases. So Google is doing its part to help the environment, and eliminate e-waste, without taking out your charger when you buy a new phone. </p>
<p> What cases are available for the Pixel 5? </p>
<p> There are plenty of cases available already for the Pixel 5. And we've rounded up the ten best cases here. </p>
<p> Google also has its usual fabric cases available, which are made from 100% recycled fabric. So they are good for the environment. And they also come in a few different colors to match the Just Black and Sorta Sage color of the Pixel 5. They are available in green chameleon, blue confetti, static grey and basically black. All of which would look good on either color of the Pixel 5. </p>
<p> Where's the Pixel 5 XL? </p>
<p> There is no Pixel 5 XL. </p>
<p> Google had initially planned on releasing two Pixel 5's this year, but never a Pixel 5 XL. It planned on a Pixel 5 and a more high-end, premium Pixel 5s. Those turned out to be the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5, as the year progressed, due to the pandemic and the economic downturn though. </p>
<p> All three of this year's Pixels are actually fairly small in size. Ranging from 5.8-inches to 6.2-inches. If you want a larger phone, you'll need to grab a Samsung smartphone, unfortunately. Or you can get one of Motorola's newer devices like the Edge+ if you want a bigger screen with a nearly stock version of Android. </p>
<p> Should I buy this over the Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G? </p>
<p> That really depends on what you want. The Pixel 4a series are plastic smartphones, while the Pixel 5 is metal coated in paint for some wireless charging trickery. But if you're debating on getting the Pixel 5, the Pixel 4a 5G might be more your speed. </p>
<p> There's not a lot of differences between the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5. It has the same cameras, it has a slightly larger display, a little bit less RAM and a slightly smaller battery. Otherwise it is mostly the same. Not to mention $200 cheaper – unless you are planning to get the Verizon model, which is going to be $599. </p>
<p> At this price point however, there are a few other phones that are really good contenders for your next smartphone. Like the Galaxy S20 FE, which is also $699 and discounted in a lot of places already. It sports better specs – like the Snapdragon 865 chipset and 120Hz display – and comes in more colors. The OnePlus 8T is also coming soon and it is pegged to be around the same price. It'll also likely come with better specs than the Pixel 5, knowing OnePlus' way of faster than fast. </p>
<p> This $700 price point is becoming a very popular price point as of late, and there's a lot of new contenders coming in here. So you aren't going to have to spend a grand to get a good new smartphone. </p>

<p> Make Your Phone Look Like A Pixel 5 With These Live Wallpapers </p>
<p> If you're sick of looking at the same old boring wallpapers on your device, you can jazz things up by making your phone look like a Pixel 5 with these live wallpapers. </p>
<p> As reported by XDA, you can now download the Pixel 5 live wallpapers and install them on any Android device. Which means you can make your phone look like a Pixel 5 to some degree. Even if you aren't actually changing its physical appearance beyond adding the wallpapers that come from one of Google's latest smartphones. </p>
<p> All that being said, there are just two live wallpapers that you can actually apply right now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Download the Pixel 5 live wallpapers through an app </p>
<p> To get these wallpapers for yourself, you'll need to essentially grab them from an app. But this isn't an app you can grab from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Rather this is an APK file that you'll have to install on your device. You can get that APK from this link here, which comes from the XDA forums. Worth noting though is that there is a specific set of instructions you need to follow if you want things to go smoothly. </p>
<p> For starters you need to uninstall any previous versions of the Pixel Live Wallpapers APK. As it will conflict with the one that was ported over from the Pixel 5. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once you've done that, then your next step is to download the new APK from the download link above. Before you can install the APK though you will likely need a file manager of some sort. According to the forum post you will need this to install the APK. </p>
<p> And that's about it. From here you should just be able to select the wallpapers you want. Worth noting is that there are more than just live wallpapers included. There's also a set of still wallpapers from the device. </p>
<p> This should work on any device running on Android 7.0 or later </p>
<p> The only requirement that there seems to be, aside from the installation instructions, is that your device be running on at least Android 7.0 Nougat. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That's most Android devices these days. So it shouldn't be much of a stretch to say just about any Android users can get their hands on these wallpapers. They may look the best on certain phones though. Such as devices with a similar size display. </p>
<p> Pixel 5 wallpapers aren't quite the same as the Pixel 5, but it's still a step in that direction. And who knows. Maybe you'll love the wallpapers so much that you actually buy a Pixel 5. </p>

<p> Android News / Google Pixel 5 Has Marginally Better Wireless Charging Compared To Pixel 4 </p>
<p> Google Pixel 5 Has Marginally Better Wireless Charging Compared To Pixel 4 </p>
<p> Google unveiled two mid-range 5G capable phones this year, i.e. the Google Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G. And as per a report by the Wireless Power Consortium, the Pixel 5 has slightly faster wireless charging compared to Pixel 4. </p>
<p> Well, Google Pixel 5 is a mid-ranger and comes with a Snapdragon 765G processor to even out the price tag. Besides, the phone does not look flashy, and it definitely means business. </p>
<p> You get a reliable and brilliant Google image processing with two cameras on the phone. It packs a 4,000 mAh battery and also ditches the IR facial scanning for the rear-based capacitive fingerprint scanning. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the other hand, Google Pixel 4 came with Snapdragon 855 processor, a mediocre 2,800 mAh battery, and all those facing Project Soli hand gestures and IR-based facial scanning features. </p>
<p> However, despite being a mid-ranger, the Google Pixel 5 managed to beat, although by slight margins, in terms of wireless charging. Note that it was the Google Pixel 3 that brought in the Qi charging to the lineup. </p>
<p> But it was capped at 5W charging only available via the Pixel stand. Thankfully, Google took a detour, and with Pixel 4, it changed this capping to 11W and you could use almost any Qi Charger for wireless charging. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Pixel 5 is apparently capable of charging at up to 12W </p>
<p> Not much changed a year later and Google came up with 12W wireless charging support for the Google Pixel 5. While other OEMs are advancing in this front and we have 50W fast wireless charging already. </p>
<p> No, we are not advising Google to take up some jarring numbers. But as per current standards, it should have been at least 15W wireless charging. </p>
<p> It is too late for Google to take that advice now, but we can expect them to have this number in their mind for their next device. Besides, Google Pixel 5 is capable of 12W fast charging on a compatible Qi wireless charging. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And since it is 1W faster than last year's Google Pixel 4, there is a marginal difference between the speeds at which both Pixel 5 and Pixel 4 wirelessly charge themselves. </p>
<p> While we are already looking at other OEMs going ahead with providing better features and faster wireless charging, we could only hope Google takes a positive step in this direction. </p>
<p> Moreover, Google can also improve on that 5-year old 18W wired solution and dial the numbers up to about 25W or even 30W. All these numbers would help Google to position its smartphones among other competitive devices. </p>

<p> Because other OEMs are very well and brilliantly catching up with the latest trends in the market. So, the next year's Google Pixel 6 demands to be something extra-ordinary. </p>

<p> Google Pixel 5 Is Already Out Of Stock In Many European Countries </p>
<p> During its "Launch Night In" event held on September 30, Google has officially unveiled the Pixel 5 and the Pixel 4a 5G smartphones. The Google Pixel 5, priced at $699, will be available by the end of this month. While pre-orders opened on launch day itself, the Pixel 5 is already out of stock on the Google Store in several markets. </p>
<p> It comes in Just Black and Sorta Sage color options. At the time of writing, both color options are out of stock on its official website in the UK, Germany, France, and Ireland. In France, the device was made available only in Just Black. The Sorta Sage Pixel 5 is the first to go out of stock in other markets. </p>
<p> The Pixel 5 went out of stock in several markets </p>
<p> Unlike in the US, the Pixel 5 will be available in Europe starting October 15. In contrast, the Pixel 4a 5G will first launch in the US before releasing in other parts of the world. And the bundling of the Bose QC 35 II headphones for free further sweetens up the deal in the UK. </p>

<p> Users in the US can still pre-order the device on the Google Store with the shipping date set to the first week of November. The Google Fi version is listed as out of stock though. After several disappointing years, Google finally gave up on the flagship segment with the newly launched Pixel 5. </p>
<p> Looks like Sorta Sage is the most popular color option </p>
<p> However, this new device makes the right compromises to undercut several premium flagships. On the front, it sports a 6-inch hole-punch OLED display with Full HD+ resolution and a 90Hz high refresh rate. It is powered by the 7nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G 5G mobile platform. </p>
<p> Like the other 2020 Pixel smartphones, the Pixel 5 also comes in a single storage option. It packs 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB of UFS 2.1 flash storage. The device runs on the latest Android 11 out of the box. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the rear, there is a 12.2-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide camera with f/2.2 aperture. For selfies, it comes with the same old 8-megapixel front camera with f/2.0 aperture. The device is also IP68 certified for water and dust resistance. </p>
<p> It features a 4,000mAh battery with 18W fast charging. Unlike the Pixel 4a 5G, this device supports Qi wireless charging, reverse wireless charging. The Pixel 5 also comes equipped with stereo speakers but lacks the 3.5mm audio jack. It measures just 8mm in thickness and weighs 151 grams. </p>

<p> Download Google Pixel 5 Pixel Launcher With Grid Size Options </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G, which was launched recently, pack in some cool features. And as per the latest report, the Google Pixel 5 Pixel Launcher is available to download. </p>
<p> Thanks to XDA, users of the old Google Pixel devices can now download the new Google Pixel 5 Pixel Launcher app, which also added a new grid size options feature. </p>
<p> Well, ditching the flagships for 2020, Google went ahead with the mid-range Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G. Besides, both the phones are 5G compatible and bring forth some cool new features for the users. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, some of the features are currently limited to the Pixel 5 smartphone. Though these features will eventually make their way to older models, for that older Pixel users would have to wait. </p>
<p> Good thing is that XDA was able to extract the latest Google Pixel 5 Pixel Launcher APK. It brings a new feature that lets you set the grid size between 4 different options. </p>
<p> You can select, 5×5, 4×4, 3×3, or 2×2 grid size options, in order to customize your Pixel's home screen. In fact, you can download this APK and install it on any of your Pixel devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Pixel 5 Pixel launcher can be installed on any Pixel phone </p>
<p> We will give you the download link to the latest Pixel 5 Pixel Launcher APK down below. Once you have downloaded that app, install the APK just like any other normal APK. </p>
<p> And you can access the grid size customization feature by simply long-pressing an empty part on the home screen. You will be shown a list of grid size opinions, i.e. 5×5, 4×4, 3×3, 2×2. </p>
<p> You can set the home grid size as per your convenience or your home screen setup. Based on the selection of grid size, the app icons will adjust their size and show up on the home screen of your Google Pixel phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> XDA has tested the feature running perfectly on Pixel 3 XL and Pixel 4. Apparently, there is one thing before downloading this APK is that you should be running Android 11 in order to install this app. </p>
<p> Moreover, sideloading this new Pixel 5 Pixel launcher APK will also bring a new live wallpaper picker UI on older Pixel devices. </p>
<p> But there is a catch. You will not be able to use this new live wallpaper UI as the Google Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G are using a slightly newer version of Android 11. </p>

<p> Google Pixel 5 Review: Redefining "Premium" Smartphones </p>
<p> The Pixel 5 hits all the right notes, but some stiff competition spoils this price for Google. </p>
<p> Google supplied us with a review unit of the Pixel 5, and we have been using it for about seven days before forming this review. This review was written with the Pixel 5 running on Android 11, the October 5, 2020 security patch and the September 1, 2020 Google Play System Update. </p>
<p> The Pixel has never been, and likely never will be a top seller in the smartphone world. And that might be by design, as Google does not want to outsell Samsung and force them to turn to Tizen for their phones. But the Pixel has always been the phone for enthusiasts. Which explains why readers of AndroidHeadlines love the Pixel (and OnePlus) so much. Because it's Android, the way Google envisions it. </p>
<p> Every year, when we review the latest Pixel smartphone, we say something about how it is so good, but it lets us down in one or two areas. And that is kind of true again this year. The silver-lining though, the Pixel 5 is not the same price as other flagships. It is just $699 in the US (or €599 in Europe, because the US has to pay the Verizon 5G tax). That sounds like a good price, but the Pixel 5 is now entering a new segment of the market that has recently become very competitive. With the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE ($699), OnePlus 8T ($749) and the iPhone 12 ($799, iPhone 12 Mini at $699). </p>
<p> So does the Pixel 5 do enough to stand out? Does it do enough to get you to spend your hard-earned cash on this new smartphone? Let's find out in our pixel 5 review. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pixel 5's design isn't boring </p>
<p> Many will disagree, but I don't think the design of the Pixel 5 is boring at all. I quite like it. It's utilitarian. The Pixel 5 is not flashy, but it does get the job done. Giving us a somewhat small, 6-inch display with minimal bezels, and a small camera bump on the back. In fact, the camera bump is almost non-existent. And after using phones like the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 2 recently, I welcome this much smaller camera bump. </p>
<p> We can't talk design, and not talk about that back plate. So the Pixel 5 is made out of 70% recycled aluminum. That's good for the environment and all, but what is this finish on the aluminum unibody? Well, it's paint, and it's not bad actually. I quite like it. The back has a quite interesting feel in the hand, but most importantly, it adds some grip. Metal and glass phones have been slippery for years, so this is a welcome change, in my opinion. On top of that, you can still see fingerprints on metal phones – depending on the metal. And with this backing, no fingerprints at all. That's something I like to see. </p>
<p> But there's more to the back plate than just the aluminum and paint. How did Google get wireless charging working on the Pixel 5, with an aluminum back plate? Well, Google did a Google thing and cut out a portion of the back plate for the wireless charging coils. If you tap your fingernail on the back of the phone, you can tell exactly where that "hole" is, for the wireless charging. It's in the center of the back, which makes it easy to line up for wireless charging. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the back being aluminum, the Pixel 5's fingerprint sensor is recessed a little bit. Making it easier to find it, unlike with the Pixel 4a and 4a 5G. That is likely due to the fact that metal is thicker than plastic (or polycarbonate). And thank goodness Google ditched face recognition for a fingerprint sensor this year. With everyone (with common sense, at least) wearing a mask. </p>
<p> In the hand, the Pixel 5 feels compact, it feels comfortable. This is one of the few phones this year, that I haven't been able to put down for a long period of time, simply because I love the feel of this phone. And the fact that it can actually fit in one hand. Yeah, big phones are nice. Especially for watching YouTube. But if you're trying to fire off an email while walking to your next appointment, it's tough. With the Pixel 5, you can type with one hand. And even navigate through the OS with one hand very easily. </p>
<p> This display is vibrant, and I don't even miss QHD resolution </p>
<p> Let's jump back to the display. It's a FHD+ OLED display that does 90Hz. It looks amazing. Many people are worried about it because it is not QHD+ resolution this year, but don't be. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A lot of phones that are QHD+ ship at FHD+ by default. So you likely wouldn't notice the difference. And for someone like me that uses almost every flagship phone to come out this year, I haven't noticed the difference either. And in fact, prefer FHD+ over the increased battery life that it'll provide. </p>
<p> The screen is surprisingly bright. I was actually very surprised with how well I could see this display when outside in direct sunlight. Much brighter than the Pixel 4 XL and previous Pixels were. Normally, only Samsung is able to hit brightness like this. </p>
<p> It's a very vibrant panel, that looks incredible when watching Netflix and YouTube. Let's not forget that the Pixel 5 is able to do HDR playback on Netflix. So it does look really incredible. And I have to admit, I watched a lot of Netflix during the review process of the Pixel 5. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pixel 5 has a display that looks incredible, because of the minimal bezels and hole-punch camera. I enjoyed using the Pixel 5 much more than the Pixel 3 XL and Pixel 4 XL before them, because of that. The Pixel 3 XL had that bath tub-like notch that was just insane. While the Pixel 4 XL ditched the notch for a thicker forehead that was not symmetrical and just looked… bad. </p>
<p> I really like this display, and regardless of what DisplayMate says, this is a good display on a 2020 smartphone. </p>
<p> Performance can be a mixed bag </p>
<p> Performance is a bit of a mixed bag on the Pixel 5, and that's not entire the Snapdragon 765G's fault. You see, the Snapdragon 765G is a perfectly capable chipset, I've used it on a number of smartphones released this year, and it's been pretty remarkable. And on the Pixel 5, it's done very well. Haven't noticed any slowdowns or even apps being pushed out of memory in my day-to-day usage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, where things change a bit is when it comes to gaming and camera performance. Let's start with Gaming. </p>
<p> This is not the best chipset on the market, so the gaming experience is going to suffer a little bit on the Pixel 5. It can play many games quite well, without any issues whatsoever. Just don't expect it to offer up some incredible graphics performance, as it does have a lower-end GPU included. </p>
<p> And when it comes to the camera, Google ditched the Pixel Visual Core on the Pixel 5. That is Google's own ISP that would process images after you take them. That is done on the chipset now, and it's a tad slower. In my experience during this Pixel 5 review, it hasn't been super slow, but it does take another couple of seconds. Of course, with images that need more processing, it will take longer. Think Astrophotography, Portrait and Night Sight pictures. It's unclear why Google ditched the Visual Core, but let's hope it comes back on the Pixel 6 next year. </p>

<p> Android 11 is mighty sweet on the Pixel 5 </p>
<p> We've already talked a lot about Android 11, so we won't get too into detail about it in this Pixel 5 review. But it runs really great on this hardware. </p>
<p> Outside of regular Android 11, Google has made a few changes to Android for Pixel devices. With the majority of them being in the Pixel Experience Launcher. </p>
<p> Now when you long-press on the home screen and go into "Styles & Wallpapers" (you can also get here from the settings), you are greeted with a new wallpaper picker. I actually like this new wallpaper picker much more. As you can see the entire home screen, and what it will look like before applying it. You also see smaller thumbnails for each category of wallpapers on the Pixel 5. Unfortunately, that Pixel 4a live wallpaper is not available here – you can of course, sideload it though. Pixel 5 does have a couple of its own live wallpapers that look mighty sweet too. Like the "Stepping Stones" one, which is actually the default wallpaper. As you tilt your phone, the rocks tilt on the screen. Which is pretty neat. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This menu gives you access to change the wallpaper, style and now the grid. Though the grid portion could use some work, in my opinion. It allows you to choose from default, 4×4, 3×3, and 2×2. And obviously the less icons on the screen, the bigger they get. Though the "Default" one should say 5×5, to be in line with the others here. But it would be nice to get it 6×6, especially for those that use smaller display settings. </p>
<p> There are also some changes to the camera UI, but we'll cover that a bit later. Otherwise, Android 11 is the same as on other devices. With bubbles for conversations, native screen recording, the new media controls and more. </p>
<p> Pixel is finally a battery life king </p>
<p> And I don't use that term lightly. The Pixel smartphones have always been rather terrible on battery. The Pixel 2 XL was perhaps the best, and even then it was not that great. It all came to a head last year with the Pixel 4 series, where the battery couldn't even last a full day. This year, Google went in a totally opposite direction. And during this review of the Pixel 5, I have consistently made it a day and a half (or longer) on a single charge. That's not something that I can say often. </p>
<p> On the Pixel 5, I've been able to hit seven and a half hours of screen on time without any trouble. And that was with it on 4G LTE/5G for more than half of the day. Also without using any battery saving features, or turning things off like the 90Hz display. That is rather impressive, and I'd say the best I've gotten on a smartphone in 2020. Which is saying something. </p>
<p> So how exactly did Google hit its stride in battery life on the Pixel 5? Well there are four choices that attributed to the Pixel 5 having this epic battery life. Firstly, a larger battery size. We'll compare it to the smaller Pixel 4, since it's closer to that physical size than the Pixel 4 XL. Pixel 4 had a 2800mAh capacity battery. That means the Pixel 5 is more than 40% larger. That's a big jump in battery size in a single year. </p>
<p> The other choices Google made to improve battery life were, a smaller and lower-resolution display (FHD+ instead of QHD+), the very power-efficient Snapdragon 765G, and the changes to Adaptive Battery. Though the bigger culprits here are hardware. The Snapdragon 765G is super battery efficient, compared to the Snapdragon 865. Which is why this performs better than the Galaxy S20. Which has the same size battery and slightly larger display. </p>
<p> During the week or so I've had the Pixel 5, and have been writing this review, this phone has been incredible on battery life. The Pixel 4 XL would struggle to end the day above 10%, and that was with much lighter usage. So yes, I am very impressed with Pixel 5 battery life. And once Adaptive Battery really starts to set in, we should see even better battery life out of the Pixel 5. </p>
<p> Google also added reverse wireless charging on the Pixel 5. This is a feature that seems to be gaining popularity now, but I'm still no on-board with it. Basically you are transferring power from your phone to another phone or your Pixel Buds (or anything that can do wireless charging). It's slow, and takes juice away from your phone. Maybe if I was headed to the gym and my Pixel Buds were low on battery, it would be good in a pinch, but I'd rather just plug them into the charger in the car. They'll get more juice, and my Pixel 5 won't be losing battery. Anyways, it's available here and works as advertised. </p>
<p> There's regular old wireless charging here too, and it has seen an increase in speed to 12W. Not much faster, in fact it is 1W faster than Pixel 4 series last year. </p>
<p> With the Pixel 5, Google is still giving us 18W charging speeds. It's time to step it up Google. Other companies are doing 25W, 45W and even 65W over USB-C PD (which is the correct way to do it). Now it's time for Pixel to follow suite. 18W is plenty fast if you're charging overnight, or even during the day, as the Pixel 5 does charge in about an hour and a half. But faster would always be better – as long as it's safe. </p>
<p> Great camera, but it's starting to show its age </p>
<p> My favorite feature of any (and every) Pixel, has been its camera. It just works. And it provides some incredible images. But Google needs to upgrade the camera sensor in the Pixel 5, it's the same one they've been using since the Pixel 3. So it's definitely showing its age now. I've already talked about this in an opinion piece I published last week. </p>
<p> The back has a 12.2-megapixel sensor, and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide sensor. Thankfully this year Google decided to swap out the telephoto for an ultra-wide. After hearing the pleas from customers and the haters. While the front still has the same 8-megapixel front-facing sensor. I really do miss that ultra-wide sensor that was on the front of the Pixel 3 series. That was such a good addition, shame it only existed for one generation of Pixel. </p>
<p> Google also redesigned the camera app, a little bit. And this is mostly due to the fact that an ultra-wide sensor was added. The changes here, you likely wouldn't notice, unless you were using an older Pixel side-by-side with this new Pixel 5. But the menu at the bottom to switch modes, has changed, It is now gray with white text instead of white with black text for the selected mode. The Shutter button has also changed. It now has the button with a white ring around it. The Shutter button show the Night Sight icon when there's not a lot of light. So Night Sight is automatic now. </p>
<p> Above the shutter button, is a new setting for zoom levels. Default is 1x of course, but you can go out to 0.6x and use the ultra-wide or zoom in to 2x. You can still zoom in up to 7x, it's just not one of the buttons there (pinch to zoom in the rest of the way). Some settings have moved around too. For example, there is a new "Composition" section that has the Framing hints and Grid Type settings available. </p>
<p> Like I said, the changes to the camera app are pretty subtle, but they are there. And honestly, I feel like it makes the camera app even easier to use. </p>
<p> How well does portrait lighting work? </p>
<p> One of the new features this year for the camera is portrait lighting. Interestingly, you cannot apply these while you're taking the photo. Instead, you apply them afterwards, but you do need to take it in Portrait mode. </p>
<p> After you've taken a photo, tap on it in the viewfinder to view it like you normally would. Then you can tap on the settings button at the bottom of the picture. Now swipe over to "Adjust" then over to "portrait light". There's not a lot of options there. But you can adjust how the lighting looks. The default is 50, so you can raise or lower it if you wish. You can also drag the light to anywhere on the picture you'd like. It does give a rather nice effect. </p>
<p> Though, as someone that doesn't take a lot of selfies, I can't say whether or not this is a game-changer or not. But it is cool. And it works on portrait mode photos from other phones, if you edit them in Google Photos. </p>
<p> How good do the photos look? </p>
<p> Pictures look great on the Pixel 5. If you've used any of the previous Pixels, you know what to expect. Though something we did notice while doing our review of the Pixel 5, is that the pictures do seem to have a warmer tint this year. Normally, Google runs closer to "natural" for the tint on its pictures. But a lot of the images we've shot, have a warmer tint this year. And that's not just something we've seen, other reviewers have reported the same. </p>
<p> When it comes to Night Sight, I think Google can do some improvements here. It's still insane that this works as well as it does. But depending on the light, there might be some grainy-ness. Part of that is likely due to the 12-megapixel sensor too. And doing Portrait Mode in Night Sight is where you'll really see that grainy-ness. </p>
<p> Portrait Mode is just as good as ever. I have noticed slight improvements in its edge-detection. It's not perfect, but it is improving. Normally, it would cut off the corner of my glasses, if I didn't look straight at the camera. That doesn't seem to always be the case now, it was with Pixel 4 XL. It happens from time-to-time, but not every time. </p>
<p> You can check out our Flickr gallery below to see the pictures we've taken with the Pixel 5. These were all shot on auto mode, and the only edits were made to portrait shots by using the portrait lighting mode. Noting else has been done here. </p>
<p> Has video quality improved? </p>
<p> The biggest complaint with the Pixel has always been video. It didn't seem like Google was taking it seriously. But it is, with the Pixel 5. Google added a few features here. Like Cinematic Pan and 4K60 video recording. </p>
<p> Since I'm not a YouTuber, and we don't do a lot of video here at Android Headlines, it's hard to really gauge how good the Cinematic Pan feature is. But it does seem to work really well. It's kind of like having a gimbal built-in to your phone. But you do still need to take your time with it, so the shot doesn't look super shaky. The locked pan mode works well too, unless, again, you are moving your phone a lot further than you should be. </p>
<p> The stabilization needed for modes like this is pretty incredible, and even more incredible that Google got this built into the Pixel 5. </p>
<p> Don't buy the Pixel 5 for 5G </p>
<p> You may have heard that the Pixel 5 has 5G (as well as the Pixel 4a 5G). But that is not the reason to buy this phone. In 2020, we recommend people not to buy a phone solely for 5G. If you're buying a new phone, it likely has 5G, but that shouldn't be the reason you buy that particular phone. And that's still the case for the Pixel 5. </p>
<p> Why? Well because 5G just isn't ready. And most phones that you buy today, won't work on a finished 5G network. For instance Verizon 5G phones do mmWave and not Sub-6. And non-Verizon phones do Sub-6 and not mmWave. Though there are some that do both – like the Pixel 5. And you're going to need both if you plan on taking advantage of 5G in the coming year or two. The Pixel 5 does support both mmWave and Sub-6. But as far as we can tell, it only supports Verizon's mmWave. So AT&T and T-Mobile customers will be out of luck when their flavors of mmWave launch. </p>
<p> Confusing right? Never mind the fact that most people can't access 5G. </p>
<p> For instance, Verizon launched its "nationwide 5G" network this week. Which is its Sub-6 network. It shows that I should have it everywhere I go in Ann Arbor, with mmWave downtown. Yet I rarely see it pop up on the Pixel 5. And when it's Sub-6 5G, it's actually slower than 4G LTE. That is a similar case for AT&T and T-Mobile too. </p>
<p> So if you're buying the Pixel 5, don't even think about 5G. You probably won't be able to use it. </p>
<p> Should I buy the Pixel 5? </p>
<p> The case for buying the Pixel 5 is a tricky one this year. Mainly because it's cheaper, and because it has a lot of competition in this price range – Galaxy S20 FE, OnePlus 8T and iPhone 12/Mini. And the majority of those have better specs than the Pixel 5. </p>
<p> However, where the Pixel always wins out is in software experience and with the camera. If you're one that prefers stock Android, and a great camera that doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, then the Pixel 5 is a great choice. But if you're a gamer, then it's not a good option for you. The OnePlus 8T will be better, with the Snapdragon 865 and 12GB of RAM. </p>
<p> There's a lot of really great $700 smartphones right now, and I love it. Hopefully this trend continues, and possibly drives prices even lower. After all we are in an economic downturn right now. </p>

<p> Google, It's Time To Upgrade The Pixel's Camera Sensor </p>
<p> Google, I'll be the first to admit, the Pixel camera is incredible. But it's time to upgrade the Pixel camera sensor. You've been using the same 12.2-megapixel sensor since (at least) the Pixel 3. If not earlier. And now, it's starting to show it's age. </p>
<p> When this sensor appeared on the Pixel 3, two years ago, Google was able to run laps around the competition. Not so much due to the sensor, but due to its software and computational photography. Now, two years later, the competition has caught up – except for one area. Basically every smartphone takes great photos these days, and now Google needs to step it up a notch and use a newer sensor. </p>
<p> I would love to see what Google could do with one of the 48-megapixel or even 64-megapixel sensors that are out in the wild now. That a lot of the Chinese smartphone makers are using, like OnePlus. Google could jump all the way to the 108-megapixel sensor that Samsung, Xiaomi and others are using. But that sensor is still very new (and not too good). Don't forget that more megapixels doesn't automatically make it a better sensor. Larger megapixels are more important than the number of megapixels in a smartphone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's incredible what Google has done with this 12.2MP sensor, but it's time for an upgrade </p>
<p> If Samsung or even OnePlus stuck with the exact same sensor for three iterations of its flagship device, they would be laughed out of existence. But for Google, that's not the case. </p>
<p> Google has been using the Sony IMX363, which is a very good sensor. It's one that almost every smartphone used, two years ago. Google is the only one still using it these days, and when you compare the Pixel 5 to other smartphones like the OnePlus 8T and the Galaxy S20 FE, you can see its age in some photos. In most photos, the Pixel 5 still wins out, but there are some environments where the other $700 smartphones are better. Largely thanks to their new sensor. </p>
<p> An upgrade to the Pixel camera is desperately needed, even if it is only to a 16-megapixel sensor, or even a newer 12-megapixel sensor. As mentioned before, it's not the number of megapixels that makes the camera better, but the size of the megapixels. And of course software. We've seen vastly different results from smartphones with the same 108-megapixel sensor, coming from different manufacturers. Then there's also Sony, who makes these sensors, but don't have the best camera on a smartphone. Which is very surprising, to be quite honest. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We're not asking Google to get crazy and give us three, four, five cameras on the back of the next Pixel. Just upgrade what is already there. I'm fine with an ultra-wide and a wide sensor. A telephoto is nice to have, but out of all the phones I've reviewed this year that have had telephoto, I've only ever used that camera for a review. I just don't need it, most of the time. But it is nice to have for those times you do need it. </p>
<p> Why is Google still using such an old camera sensor? </p>
<p> They likely still have left overs from 2018. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google's Pixel phones have never been big sellers, and they likely bought a bunch of these sensors from Sony in 2018 (and possibly 2019 after everyone moved on, and got a nice discount). So Google could be looking to get rid of the rest of these sensors before giving us a nice Pixel camera upgrade. </p>
<p> But the more likely reason is that Google has spent years fine-tuning the software for this sensor, and really doesn't want to start over from scratch. Which they would need to do if they decided to change sensors. Google is big on computational photography, and it has come a long way since the first Pixel. It has also schooled its partners and forced them to up their game in the camera department too. </p>
<p> I won't claim to know the ins and outs of how to optimize a sensor with software to get the best quality, like Google has done here. But I'd imagine that if Google went with another Sony sensor, perhaps a newer 12-megapixel sensor or even a 16-megapixel sensor, they may not need to do as much fine-tuning. One, because they've already done it, and kind of know what needs to be done. And two, it's a sensor from the same company. So there many similarities in the technical aspect of it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is another case of Google relying heavily on software to fix things </p>
<p> Google's mantra seems to be, let's make software to fix hardware problems. We had seen this with the battery life on Pixel phones up until 2020. Google consistently put in small batteries in their Pixel phones. I mean, the Pixel 4 had less than a 3,000mAh battery inside, while competitors are pushing 4,000mAh in the same body size. And thus, the Pixel 4 couldn't even make it to lunch time before needing to be charged. It was sad, but Google did eventually hear its customers complaints. And added a larger battery in the Pixel 4a series as well as the Pixel 5 this year. </p>
<p> We're not quite at that level for its cameras, yet. The camera can still take some really great pictures, and I still prefer it over any other phone that has launched this year. While phones like the Galaxy S20 FE, LG Wing and OnePlus 8T all take phenomenal pictures, they just aren't as good (to me) as the Pixel lineup has been and continues to be. One big part of that is shutter speed. If you are ever taking photos of a moving object, you'll know those other phones are slower and will produce a somewhat blurry image. But the Pixel does not. </p>
<p> With every phone, I take photos of my one and a half year old puppy, she moves a lot and almost every phone comes out blurry at least 80% of the time. Unless she is sitting perfectly still. That's similar to how a newborn or even a younger kid would act. They don't stop moving either, so this isn't just a dog owner's issue, but a parent issue. It's incredible that a company like Samsung can give us 100X Zoom, but not a faster shutter speed on its phones. Hopefully that changes in the future. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pixel 5 is still my camera of choice, but it's time for an upgrade </p>
<p> If I don't have my DSLR with me, my Pixel 5 is what I want to use to take photos. It doesn't oversaturate things like Samsung does. It doesn't over-expose like some of the cheaper smartphones do. And it doesn't have a ton of modes that you'll never use (and get in the way). Though I do wish Google would give us a nice manual mode on the Pixel. </p>
<p> I can just pull the Pixel 5 out of my pocket and take a photo. Not worrying about having to change any settings, or switch modes. Google does all of that for me. Allowing me to get the shot quickly, before the moment is over. And that's just as important as the quality of the image. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Ever since I got my hands on the Pixel 2, I've been impressed with the Pixel camera and it has not left my pocket ever since. Which is pretty insane, considering the number of phones that have come across my desk since then (probably over 100, and that's no exaggeration). Even if the battery life is trash – like on the Pixel 4 XL – I still had a Pixel in my pocket for the camera. And I want it to stay that way. So Google, let's get a new sensor for the Pixel 6. Okay? </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Google Recorder With Transcription-Based Editor Is Now Rolling Out </p>
<p> Google Recorder With Transcription-Based Editor Is Now Rolling Out </p>
<p> At the beginning of this month, we reported that Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G packed the transcription-based editor for the Google recorder app that lets you edit/cut/crop the recorded audio straight from the transcript itself. </p>
<p> And it seems like this latest feature of the Google Recorder app is now rolling out for early for all via the Google Play Store. However, note that it is not as widely as you would expect. </p>
<p> This new Google Recorder app transcription-based editor is not rolling out for devices running on Android 10. Moreover, it is a bit messy when used or sideloaded on Android 11 running phones. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So, it is advised that users running Android 10 should pick up the update and Android 11 users should avoid the Google Recorder app update for the time being. </p>
<p> Notably, the reason behind this mess on Android 11 is not clear at the moment. But if you still wish to try out the Google Recorder app transcription-based editor feature, then you can grab the update via APK Mirror. </p>
<p> In fact, this new feature was announced alongside the release of the Pixel 5 smartphone. It uses AI for letting the users edit the words in the automatically-generated transcript. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Recorder app shows a scissor icon at the top while reviewing the clips </p>
<p> For those who have updated the app, you will see a 'scissor' icon on top while reviewing the clip. Once you tap on that button, it will bring up the editing interface. </p>
<p> From here, you can select a specific region of the automatically generated transcript. And then choose to edit, remove, or crop it from the recording itself. </p>
<p> It is a brilliant feature for those who often use the Google Recorder app for recording lectures or interviews. You can edit out the un-wanted conversations with ease with this new feature. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Firstly, the Google Recorder app lets you automatically transcribe any recorder conversation and now, you can chop out the unwanted parts of it, it is a pretty nifty feature in our opinion. </p>
<p> Moreover, it also negates the need of listening to the entire conversation or recording in order to crop it out. Furthermore, the Google Recorder app is now rolling out via the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Note that it should start rolling out for Pixel devices in the next several weeks. The good thing for those eyeing the Pixel 5 or Pixel 4a 5G is that it will come pre-installed on both the devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One of the reasons which Android Police deduced is that Android 11 might be looking for a new signatures scheme that may be missing. This is just a guess and wild speculation. </p>
<p> You can grab the latest version of the Google Recorder app with a transcription-based editor from the below button that will redirect you to the Google Play Store. </p>

<p> Android News / Google 'Sabrina' Android TV Device To Launch As Chromecast with Google TV </p>
<p> Google 'Sabrina' Android TV Device To Launch As Chromecast with Google TV </p>
<p> Google is long rumored to be working on a new Android TV dongle codenamed as Sabrina. It is expected to be the successor to Chromecast Ultra but comes powered by Android TV OS. According to Android Police, the company might soon launch its new Android TV Dongle as "Chromecast with Google TV." </p>
<p> While the previous leaks suggested this new device to come with Nest branding, Google is continuing to launch it as Chromecast. However, the company will rename Android TV as Google TV. The first leaks about this rebranding appeared in early May this year. </p>
<p> Chromecast with Google TV pricing & color options leaked </p>
<p> Currently, Android TV OS is the preferred choice for several smart TV manufacturers including Sony and TCL. Even after the rebranding, the UI and functionality of the OS should remain the same. Speaking of the upcoming Chromecast with Google TV, it could cost as low as $50. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As per the leaks, it is currently listed between $50 and $60 at Home Depot, Target, and Walmart. While there is confirmation over the final pricing, it should certainly cost lower than the $70 launch price of the Chromecast Ultra. Moreover, this new streaming device will also come bundled with a remote controller (codenamed as Abbey). </p>
<p> It will be available in Rock Candy, Como Blue, and Summer Melon color options. Just like the other Google devices, some color options could be limited to specific markets. Based on the leaks, the company might launch its new hardware products by the end of September or early October. </p>
<p> It might officially launch on September 30 </p>
<p> Along with the new Chromecast with Google TV, the company will also launch a new Nest speaker, Pixel 4A 5G, and Pixel 5. One of the Chromecast listings mentioned the launch date as September 30, but there is no official confirmation yet. A few weeks back, this new streaming device from Google with the model number GZRNL was certified by the FCC. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The remote controller with the model number G9N9N confirmed to come with Bluetooth support. The previously leaks revealed the first look of the remote controller. It looks very similar to the remote controller of the Daydream View VR headset. </p>
<p> There is a circular D-pad along with six circular buttons, one of them is for the Google Assistant. With the support for 4K HDR playback, the new Chromecast will be competing with the already popular Roku Streaming Stick+ and the Amazon Fire TV Stick. </p>

<p> Google Officially Shuts Down Play Music Store Globally </p>
<p> Well, it has been long back reported that Google is parting ways with Google Play Music. And latest reports confirm that Google has completed the worldwide shutdown of Google Play Music Store. </p>
<p> Google is well ahead in switching and transferring the users of the Google Play Music over to YouTube Music. Yes, YouTube Music is the app that is being projected as an alternative to the soon-to-die Google Play Music. </p>
<p> Besides, it was reported back in August itself, that Google Play Music will completely shut down by the end of this year. The US was set to lose access to it by the end of October. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, good news for the fans is that the Google Play Music data will be intact until December 2020. Notably, Play Music users who have a subscription that goes beyond September will get them converted to Play Store credits. </p>
<p> Moreover, Google also provided a tool for Play Music users to transition over to YouTube Music. But new reports confirm that Google has already killed the Google Play Music Store. </p>
<p> In fact, we have recently reported that the Google Play Music Manager on Windows has already died for many users in the US. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Play Music Store allowed users to buy songs and listen to them </p>
<p> And now, the service that allowed users to buy any song and listen to them in Google Play Music is permanently shut down by Google. </p>
<p> According to 9To5Google, the 'Browse music' option also no longer appears in the app. Additionally, the web version of the Music store shows a "Music store on Google Play is no longer available" shutdown message. </p>
<p> The shutdown was gradually planned from August. And over the course of time, we have seen several users losing access to services of Google Play Music. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We speculate that Google is going all-in with online streaming and would be ditching the music download market entirely. Apparently, the Google Play Music app will also go away by the end of this year. </p>
<p> So, it is high time that you shift over to YouTube Music and make adjustments accordingly. Well, not all is wrong with YouTube music. </p>
<p> Good thing is that Google has pushed over several new features and enhancements for the app to make it on par with Play Music. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And time would be the great healer in this situation. The early you start spending your time on the YouTube Music app, the more familiar you will get with the new music streaming application. </p>

<p> Google Begins To Take Action Over COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation </p>
<p> Google, as well as a number of other social media companies, are begging to crack down on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. As reported by Reuters, Google has expanded its current rules to included falsehoods about a potential vaccine. </p>
<p> Coronavirus misinformation has been a problem from the start of the pandemic for social media companies. Google and Facebook have removed a significant amount of posts about the topic. Both have bans in place concerning misinformation on COVID-19. </p>
<p> However, it has also emerged that the likes of Facebook have largely failed in its attempts to curb the spread of misinformation. Despite all its efforts fake news and conspiracy theories have continued to spread on social media platforms. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google and Facebook will hope that a move to target COVID-19 vaccine misinformation will have an effect on the overall spread. However, as we have seen the task appears a mammoth one which no one is really up to the task of tackling. </p>
<p> Google to target coronavirus vaccine misinformation </p>
<p> Google has begun removed videos on YouTube which contain falsehoods and misinformation around COVID-19 vaccines. </p>
<p> Currently, the platform removes that "disputes the existence or transmission of COVID-19, promotes medically unsubstantiated methods of treatment, discourages people from seeking medical care or explicitly disputes health authorities' health authorities' guidance on self-isolation or social distancing". </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now that has been extended to any questionable content about vaccines. This is largely an attempt to curb the spread of misinformation from anti-vaxxer groups. </p>
<p> Facebook also announced that it would ban adverts which were aimed at preventing people from getting vaccinated. The company simply made a statement saying, "we don't want these ads on our platform". </p>
<p> However, Facebook will continue to allow adds which criticize government vaccination policies. The platform will only ban ads which discourage individuals from getting a vaccine as reported by Android Central. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Facebook noted that "we regularly refine our approach around ads that are about social issues to capture debates and discussions around sensitive topics happening on Facebook". </p>
<p> The company see vaccines as one of these sensitive topics pointing out that "we may narrow enforcement in some areas, we may expand it in others". </p>
<p> This all seems like positive moves from Google and Facebook. Both have made strides here to continue to slow the spread of misinformation. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, we know that up till now most companies have failed in their attempts to prevent misinformation spreading. It does not seem like these changes will have a major impact on the spread. However, here is to hoping that they will be successful. </p>

<p> Google, Tech Giants Will Pass New Tax Costs Onto Customers </p>
<p> Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and other tech giants will reportedly pass new tax costs in Europe onto customers. That includes new taxes in the UK as well as in other countries on the continent. But the companies won't necessarily be passing the tax onto everyday users of their products. At least not directly. Instead, the cost could potentially be pushed that direction by advertisers and developers. </p>
<p> How are Google and others passing the tax costs on? </p>
<p> The taxes in question are split across the UK and other European countries. The decision to implement an individual tax rate for the countries follows talks to create a globally-utilized tax on digital services which ultimately fell apart. </p>
<p> So the costs being passed onto customers for tech giants aren't going to be evenly distributed. In the UK, for instance, Google and YouTube will be passing on around 2-percent in costs to advertisers. That will be 5-percent in Austria and Turkey. And, in the UK, that's going to equate to around £120m added to marketers' costs. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Facebook is another company that's expected to follow that same path forward. </p>
<p> Other tech giants, including Amazon and Apple, appear much more likely to pass costs onto end-users though. And that's because both will be increasing costs for sellers on their platforms. For instance, Amazon has said that the 2-percent increase in the UK from digital services taxes, will be pushed over to sellers in its online marketplace. </p>
<p> Apple, conversely, will be changing how it pays developer fees. Typically, it pays a 20-percent VATfor each purchase. But it's tacking on the extra 2-percent in the UK as a split cost between itself and developers. So developers will effectively eat an additional one percent cost. And so will Apple. That will have an impact on developers' bottom lines, potentially disrupting the app market on pricing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In Turkey, Apple is raising App Store prices for consumers more directly. That's at a rate of 7.5-percent. That follows an earlier increase for UK customers by 25-percent, resulting from Brexit dropping the value of the pound. </p>
<p> How will this end up on end-users? </p>
<p> Tax increases aren't necessarily unsurprising here but neither is the decision to pass that cost onto customers. And this will undoubtedly impact costs for customers across each service. While the majority of costs are being put on developers and advertisers, advertisers may end up charging more themselves. Developers could too. </p>

<p> Google Planning To Shut Down 'Trusted Contacts' App Soon </p>
<p> Well, it seems like Google is on a run to shut down most of its older apps. Because, as per a new report, Google Trusted Contacts app will soon close its doors and shut down. </p>
<p> The Google Trusted Contacts app was launched back in 2016. It is an app via which users can easily share their location information with anyone they want to. </p>
<p> The app also gained several new features via updates over the years. However, Google will now shut down the app and users will lose access to the Trusted Contacts. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Although users would be able to use the app but not for too long. Specifically, the Google Trusted Contacts app will continue to work for existing users until 1, December 2020. </p>
<p> After the deadline, the app will stop working entirely and will stop supporting it. The bad news is that no new user will be able to use the app, as it now officially removed from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. </p>
<p> So, if you wish to download your list of trusted contacts, you have till December 1, 2020, to download it. Users can head over to the official website and make it happen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Trusted Contacts apps was a nifty app for emergency situations </p>
<p> Now we are using 'was' because the app will die down soon. Trusted Contacts apps was a nice app for sharing location info, in case of emergency situations. </p>
<p> Besides, users can also see the person's status, including important information i.e. whether their phone's battery is low or dead. This is a pretty good app for parents who want to keep a safety check on their children. </p>
<p> As an alternative, Google is projecting the Google Maps app. Basically, those who wish to continue using this location-based service, they can opt for Google Maps, which also includes real-time location sharing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Moreover, there is an option to stop sharing the location at any time. If you wish to use Google Trusted Contacts like location-sharing on Google Maps, then head to your profile. </p>
<p> Then select Location Sharing and tap New Share. Then choose the person in your Google Contacts with whom you wish to share the location. </p>
<p> So, there is this decision of shutting down the Trusted Contacts app, and also, it has projected Google Maps as an alternative. This means that Google can kill any app, they find un-useful. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For those who don't know what they will be missing, can still get the Google Trusted Contacts APK file from trusted third-party sources like APK Mirror. Note that the app will stop working from December 2020. </p>

<p> Google TV App Is Available, But It's More Or Less Useless At The Moment </p>
<p> Google's online event saw the arrival of a lot of new products. And along with the new Chromecast, Google also introduced the new Google TV. </p>
<p> Google TV is an app that just landed on the Play Store. This new app that powers the new Chromecast is now available for users on the Play Store. </p>
<p> However, the app, at present, does not do anything or add anything new for the users who are willing to download the app from Play Store on their Android TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But this move by Google to place Google TV on the Play Store is to provide new updates more quickly and easily. The new Google TV app is live on the Play Store with version 1.0.331643392. </p>
<p> Interestingly, it carries the same app icon or logo as the Android TV application. Moreover, the app is already downloaded over 5,000 times. </p>
<p> Another advantage of placing the Google TV app on the Play Store is that users will be able to get the latest updates for the app without waiting for a major system update. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Though there are many similarities between Android TV and Google TV app, the latter has different functionalities altogether. </p>
<p> Google TV app basically focuses heavily on content recommendations </p>
<p> One of the main differences between Android TV and Google TV is that the latter heavily focuses on content recommendations. These recommendations are from different sources. </p>
<p> This negates the need to rely heavily on each of the dedicated apps. You will be able to see all the recommendations on the home screen so that you spend more time watching content than surfing for it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Good thing is that this new feature is not slapped onto the users permanently. You can disable this option from the settings menu if you prefer the old home screen. </p>
<p> And if all the said things have gotten you excited, then we have a bit of sad news for you. Because sideloading this Google TV app on your Android TV or Android TV box for that matter, does not do anything. </p>
<p> Basically, it does not add new features or do anything new for the Android TV. In fact, you can install the app but there is no option to launch the new home screen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So, for now, it is just a new app that does nothing for the Android TV users. Good thing is that Google TV will not be exclusive to Google. Google plans to make Google TV available to other manufacturers that want it as an option. </p>
<p> This means that though the app does not do anything, for now, you should expect Google to bring new features and enhancements to this app. </p>

<p> Google TV Is The New Easier Way To Discover Entertainment </p>
<p> Like with most Google products these days, the new Google TV is about making things easier, and in particular it's about making it easier to discover entertainment. </p>
<p> A big focus on this new device is cutting down the time you spend searching for something to watch and more time actually watching the content. </p>
<p> While not everyone spends more time browsing than watching, many people do, and a big part of that is because there's so much content available. Google TV is Google's way of making that entertainment content simpler to get to so you can enjoy more of it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's a lot that goes into this new experience, but the core of it is ease of use. </p>
<p> The Google TV entertainment experience is tailored to the user </p>
<p> Google made this new experience tailored to the user in a way that gets more of what you love in front of you. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Part of that comes from the improvements in Google TV's knowledge graph. Google says that it comes with enhanced capabilities for understanding your favorite media topics and genres. </p>
<p> So if you're more into Rom-Coms, you should see more of this type of content surface on your home screen. If it's Sci-Fi that you prefer, then the same thing is true. </p>
<p> You can also easily find what you want to watch either by browsing or searching. And searching is even easier now thanks to the included remote which has a dedicated Google Assistant button. Simply press that and ask Google to find the content you're looking for. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's even an area for movies and TV shows that are trending on Google so you can discover stuff you may not have heard of or seen before. </p>
<p> Find something you like but can't watch it right away? Save it to your watch list </p>
<p> The watch list is another huge part of the new Google TV experience. Sometimes you discover new stuff you may be interested in watching but aren't able to watch it right away, or you're just more interested something else at that time. </p>
<p> That's where the new watch list feature comes in. This new feature supports movies, TV shows, and live TV. So if you come across something that looks interesting, save it and you can always come back to it later. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google also integrated YouTube TV into the live TV function. So if you're already a YouTube TV subscriber, you'll have a wealth of tailored content right from the start. </p>
<p> The YouTube TV content is located in Google TV's Live Tab. Where you can see currently airing shows and what's coming up next. </p>
<p> With Google Assistant baked into Google TV, you can even ask all the questions you want the answers to, or control all of your smart home devices. So long as they're Google Assistant compatible. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Google TV Gives New Chromecast Users Opt-Out For Recommendations </p>
<p> Google TV Gives New Chromecast Users Opt-Out For Recommendations </p>
<p> Google TV offers a ton of recommendations with regard to available content, in addition to apps. But it's also going to offer a way to opt-out of those, based on recent reports, via an "apps-only" mode. </p>
<p> Now, at the surface, the mode seems like a common-sense addition. Not every user is going to want to be bombarded with new recommendations every time they open their smart home streaming device. Even if that is going to offer the easiest way to discover new content on the newly-rebranded platform. The goal, of course, is to ensure users aren't spending more time looking for content than actually watching the content. </p>
<p> But the additional sections also put Android apps, featuring prominently on the new Google TV platform, as a secondary feature. Summarily, placing that below recommendations entirely. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> An Android-centric fix is present </p>
<p> Google's solution to the app problem and for those users who don't want recommendations is simple. The company is including its apps-Only mode, as noted above. That will leave only the highlighted content segment — represented by the full-size image at the top of the display in the example image above — and a user's apps visible. </p>
<p> The usual row of oval-shaped chips along the top of the UI, labeled Search, For You, Live, Movies, Shows, Apps, and Library, are also removed. The only chip remaining next to the Google TV branding is one that reads "Home." </p>
<p> Below the highlighted content panel, a message will also be displayed. That reads "Apps only mode is enabled. You can adjust this in Settings > Accounts & Sign In." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So users will need to go into their settings, tucked behind their profile picture at the top-right-hand side of the UI, to turn off apps-only mode. </p>
<p> What good is an apps-only mode on the Google TV platform? </p>
<p> Now, there's no guarantee that entering into apps-only mode on Google TV will do anything to stave off the user data collection that typically goes into recommendations. So the ability to enter the mode doesn't necessarily negate that. Users concerned about privacy and data collection will want to look for other settings on that front. Specifically on the Google Account management pages, also tucked behind their profile image in many Google apps. </p>
<p> As a result, the mode will likely serve a better purpose when it comes to managing what others see. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For example, it will help keep any guests — or children — from seeing recommendations. More succinctly, recommendations that might give away a bit too much about the device owner's watch history. Or help keep them in apps that are approved for use instead of able to click on — and potentially make purchases — in other apps. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Google TV Is Also A Play Movies & TV Replacement App, But Better </p>
<p> Google TV Is Also A Play Movies & TV Replacement App, But Better </p>
<p> Google TV is a free-standing Android-based platform for the new Chromecast devices but it also has its own app, now replacing Google Play Movies & TV in the Play Store. The change, widely circulating in the news, has started already, in fact. That means that the next time users update the Google Play Movies & TV app, it will be rebranded to Google TV. </p>
<p> It also means a wealth of other changes are coming, from Watchlist integration to content aggregation. And that may be the biggest change that's incoming. Google TV, unlike the product it's replacing, is anything but a place solely intended for content purchased on the Play Store. </p>
<p> With Google TV, either on-device or on their television, users will be able to search up content from all of their different services. Whether that's Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max, CBS All Access, YouTube TV, Sling TV, Amazon Prime Video, Showtime, Starz, or another service. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All that's needed is a search. The app will then pull up the content, similar to in a web-based Google search. In fact, content can be added via a web search or Google app search too. Adding content on those platforms via the "Watchlist" button adds the content to the Watchlist in the new app. And on the new Chromecast-based Google TV platform. </p>
<p> There's even more on the Google TV-enabled Chromecast </p>
<p> Now, Google TV will also aggregate any content purchased through the Movies & TV segment of the Google Play Store. But users who buy into the new Chromecast will also bring additional perks. That's on top of the ability to save content for later viewing via Watchlist. </p>
<p> The new hardware device replaces the Google Chromecast Ultra in the line-up of streaming devices but on that's more than just another castable gadget. Instead, the new device serves the aggregation features of the new Google TV platform. And that comes complete with a remote, voice controls, and voice search. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once users fire up that device, they'll also get recommendations based on their watch history, services, and other details gathered by Google. Or they can choose to focus on apps themselves with apps-only mode. </p>
<p> All of that is to say that Google TV isn't just replacing long-standing platforms. It's bringing them all together with the best of what Google has to offer in entertainment. And that's culminated nowhere better than the new Chromecast device, powered by Google TV. </p>
<p> This will affect apps on other platforms too </p>
<p> Since one of the biggest aspects of this change is a complete rebranding of Google Play Movies & TV, it's also going to affect those apps on other devices. Or at least it will eventually. Google hasn't fully laid out its plans on other platforms such as Roku or smart TVs yet. Or on iOS, for that matter. More details will likely become available over time. For now, those apps will continue to work as they always have. </p>

<p> These Are All The Streaming Services Compatible With Google TV </p>
<p> With the new Chromecast yesterday, Google also re-debuted Google TV. Which is basically an interface that lives on top of Android TV. It's almost like a new home screen for your TV. </p>
<p> Google TV offers a more streamlined interface, with the ability to see all shows and movies from all apps installed, on your home screen. Instead of just a row of apps. Making it easier to find something to watch. </p>
<p> What streaming services are compatible with Google TV </p>
<p> As of today, the following streaming services are compatible with Google TV. Expect to have more added in the future though. </p>
<p> Can I use streaming services that are now compatible? </p>
<p> If you have a streaming service that you subscribe to that is not compatible with Google TV right now, you can still use them. They just won't show up with their content in the content section. You can still launch them like normal though. </p>
<p> Just head over to the Apps tab, and you'll see all of your installed apps on Google TV. The "For You" Tab also has many of these apps, as well as top picks. So you can find something to watch easily. These Top Picks will change over time, based on what you watch and don't watch. So that Google can recommend shows and movies that you'll actually like. </p>
<p> Is YouTube TV compatible? </p>
<p> You might have noticed that Sling TV is compatible, but YouTube TV is not located in that list. That is because YouTube TV is in the "Live" section of Google TV. So you'll be able to scroll through YouTube TV listings like you would if you were using a cable box. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Thats' going to make it super simple to find something that you can watch, live or DVR'd on YouTube TV. </p>
<p> YouTube TV does also work with most of the TV Everywhere app, which will also show content in your library. </p>
<p> This is going to make it a much nicer way to interact with your TV and find something to watch while you're eating dinner and such. Which is what Google TV is all about. Making it easier to find something to watch, in a cleaner interface. With all of these streaming services it can sometimes be tough to find something good to watch. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Guest Mode & New Security Features Announced For Google Assistant </p>
<p> Guest Mode & New Security Features Announced For Google Assistant </p>
<p> Yesterday, Google in an official blog, announced that it will be adding some new security features along with a guest mode for the Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Notably, the Google Assistant is one handy tool that gets your job done using just your voice. You can perform multiple tasks like calling someone, send a message, or open an app or ask for any advanced commands. </p>
<p> Basically, it is the only voice assistant that is at least a competitor to Apple's Siri. And now, with the addition of the new security features along with Google Assistant guest mode, the security has upped a notch. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Users will be able to activate the Guest Mode using simple voice commands. Moreover, when the Google Assistant guest mode is activated, there is a perk attached to it. </p>
<p> And i.e. whatever commands you give to the assistant will not be saved in the history. In this way, your commands will not be saved, hence enhancing the security. </p>
<p> This feature can come handy for users who do not want Google to know what commands they have used. Or in scenarios where your friends are asking your smart speaker, several times, to change songs. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The new Google Assistant guest mode will keep your commands history nice and clean. Neither anyone using the device will know your commands and nor the company. </p>
<p> Google Assistant guest mode can be disabled using voice commands </p>
<p> Just like the way you have enabled Google Assistant guest mode, you can also disable it. Meaning that you can use your voice commands to disable the guest mode on your smartphone. </p>
<p> However, note that in the official blog, Google has clarified that the search results while using guest mode will not be personalized. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Another added perk is that Google will itself remind you to delete the last command which you have told the Assistant. You can do that just by saying "Hey Google, that wasn't for you", or "Hey Google, delete everything I said to you last week." </p>
<p> Apparently, this new Google Assistant guest mode will be hitting the Android devices soon in the coming weeks. So, keep checking the play store for an update. The guest mode feature will roll out in the coming weeks. </p>
<p> Google is also adding critical security alerts within Google Apps </p>
<p> Along with the new guest mode, Google will be adding new critical security alert features for your Google Account within all its Google Apps. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The critical alert notification now gets revamped. And it will be much bigger and visible whenever Google detects any serious or suspicious account security issue. </p>
<p> The alert will be shown on the app on which the issue has been detected. And steps will also be displayed via which you can address that particular security issue. </p>
<p> In this way, users won't be needing to shuffle across their emails or phone alerts to know that there are any security issues with your Google account. The limited rollout will begin in the coming weeks. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And to avoid any confusion or spoofing, the new security alerts will be resistant to spoofing. This would enable the user to understand that the alerts are coming from Google itself. </p>
<p> The Google Safety Centre is also given an overhaul. Here you will be able to see all your security-related information associated with your account in one place. It is rolling out in the US, while the global rollout is expected in the coming weeks. </p>

<p> Handcent App Review: The Perfect Messaging Application </p>
<p> Are you tired of the stock app? It dos what it is supposed to, but there isn't much flash to it right? Maybe you have heard of maybe you are brand new to Android and you have no idea, but there is a replacement, one is chompsms but I am not going to talk about that, I do not know anything about it, my preference and the preference of many is handcentsms. My droid is set up to receive only messages from handcent and the stock notification app is disabled. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> I use this quite often and when I heard you could use it, I jumped at the chance to download this free app. Members of many forums talk about it quite often, its a topic of discussion and I participate in them letting others know how much I enjoy this app. The things that the stock app does not have, this usually does. For one this seems to play all forms of media better than the stock app. </p>
<p> I have heard from some that this app will sometimes delete your texts, but it has never happened to me </p>
<p> It tends to have a few bugs </p>
<p> From one of my screen shots you can see there is an ad that they do not mention </p>
<p> Over all I love this app, its nice… really nice. it has completely replaced my stock app and I have never had any reason to go to any other messaging app out there. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/06/hands-on-with-keyboard-equipped-blackberry-key2.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485117" filename="hands-on-with-keyboard-equipped-blackberry-key2.html">
<p> Hands On With Keyboard-Equipped BlackBerry KEY2 </p>
<p> BlackBerry Mobile and TCL Communication announced the BlackBerry KEY2 today, the second-generation physical keyboard smartphone from the new partnership that the two companies forged back in late 2016. This smartphone borrows a lot of its looks from the original KEYone that debuted last year, with the main difference being the smaller forehead and larger keys on the physical keyboard. That makes the KEY2 more modern-looking and also easier to type on for those that weren't big BlackBerry users back in the day. </p>
<p> The keyboard on the KEY2 is still a traditional physical unit, making the handset rather unique in this day and age. The team behind the KEYone also went and made the keyboard better, having spent time with the Bold 9900 which was one of the most popular BlackBerry smartphones ever, to make sure it was clicky enough. And in our limited hands-on time, the KEY2 is much easier to type on than the KEYone was, especially for those that were never die-hard BlackBerry users. BlackBerry Mobile and TCL have kept all of the keyboard shortcuts here, and added a "Speedy" button so you can press that along with a letter to quickly open up a specific app. For example, you can assign Twitter to the "T" key and press the Speedy key then the T one to open the said app. Much easier than going home and hitting the icon or having to find it in your Recents menu. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The display on the KEY2 is still a bit strange, with a 4.6-inch 1620×1080 resolution, giving you a 3:2 aspect ratio. While many smartphones are going with taller displays, BlackBerry is opting for a shorter one here. That is actually because of the physical keyboard but it still looks good and works pretty well with Android, as you'd expect. Even being slightly higher than full HD resolution, the display looks really good and the viewing angles are also top-notch. The advantage to going with a full HD display and the Snapdragon 660 means that BlackBerry can promise some pretty insane battery life – which isn't new, considering the KEYone also had great battery life. </p>
<p> Picking up the KEY2, it's going to feel like an old-school BlackBerry smartphone, and that is definitely nice. It is heavier than most other smartphones out there, and it can definitely do some damage if it were dropped. The KEY2 is rugged, but not so rugged that it can't be damaged when dropped – so don't drop it. But it does definitely feel really solid in the hands. Even though BlackBerry has gone away from the curved sides, which made the KEYone feel really comfortable in the hand, the KEY2 has flat sides, it is still easy to hold onto thanks to the rubberized backside. The black version of the KEY2 looks really nice. It's all black, so it looks very stealthy, and everything just blends in nicely. While the silver model has some accents around it that do also look really sharp, especially around the physical keyboard there. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's a lot to like about the KEY2, and for those die-hard BlackBerry fans that are waiting on a new BlackBerry smartphone, you won't have to wait much longer. BlackBerry will be releasing the KEY2 later this month in several markets, with its full global launch happening in July. The BlackBerry KEY2 is going to cost you $649, which is actually cheaper than most flagship smartphones, but still a bit higher than the OnePlus 6 and other "premium" mid-range smartphones on the market. BlackBerry KEY2 is going to be available in both black and silver as well. </p>

<p> Say Goodbye To Hangouts Soon, A Free Google Chat Is Coming </p>
<p> Google chat is going free for general Hangouts users in the future, which means users will eventually need to say goodbye to Hangouts as their form of communication. </p>
<p> This week, Google announced upcoming changes to Hangouts, as well as Google Chat and its free offering, Google Fi, and Google Voice. </p>
<p> 9To5Google reports that while the Hangouts app isn't being shut down this week or even this month, it's not far off. Google will apparently be taking the Hangouts app offline sometime in November. That means users have maybe a month and a half at most before they will no longer be able to use the Hangouts app on their phones. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All that said, this applies to the Hangouts app. The web version of Hangouts will still be available until Google requires the migration to Google Chat. </p>
<p> Free Google Chat will arrive in 2021 </p>
<p> The Hangouts app may be shutting down next month but Hangouts in general isn't going away until Google is ready to require the migration to Chat. </p>
<p> According to Google that will be happening sometime in 2021. The company hasn't confirmed a specific date yet. it has however given a more general window of time to expect this to happen. Which is supposed to be in the first half of 2021. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Whether that's closer to the beginning or the end of that first six months, is unclear. So anyone still using Hangouts may want to start looking at alternative options rather soon. If not now. </p>
<p> Google will make the transition pretty easy </p>
<p> Fear not, if you're worried about losing anything in the switch to Google Chat. </p>
<p> Google says it will make the transition between services pretty simple. And judging by the diagram it shared to give an example of the process, it does in fact look like it will be an easy one. </p>

<p> Users will be able to move over pretty much everything too it seems. Including conversations, contacts, and any message history. As part of this change when it happens next year, users will also lose the ability to make Google Fi calls via Hangouts. </p>
<p> Google will be taking that ability and handing it off to Messages for Web. Which is its web interface for the Messages texting app on Android smartphones. Hangouts will also be letting go of Google Voice. And any time you get a call through Voice Hangouts will cease to ring. </p>
<p> If nothing else, users should be happy they want have to deal with Voice and Hangouts ringing. </p>

<p> Android Buyers Guide / Harman Kardon Adds New Speakers To Its Citation Multi-Room Lineup </p>
<p> Harman Kardon Adds New Speakers To Its Citation Multi-Room Lineup </p>
<p> Harman Kardon has announced a few new additions to its Citation Multi-room speaker lineup at CES 2020 in Las Vegas. </p>
<p> The company is announcing a soundbar, a subwoofer, a portable and smart alarm clock with a wireless charger. </p>
<p> The Citation 200 is a portable speaker that's also great for the shower </p>
<p> Harman Kardon is announcing the Citation 200, which is a portable speaker and has a charging base. This is going to be a really great speaker to use in the shower, since it is splash-proof with a IPX4 rating. That does not make it waterproof though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The rechargeable battery on the Citation 200 is rated for around eight hours. It of course, works with the multi-room setup that Harman Kardon has with the rest of the Citation speakers. </p>
<p> The Citation Oasis is a multipurpose compact speaker that has a built-in alarm clock, along with wireless phone charging and music streaming. Making it a really great speaker to put on a bedside table. </p>
<p> Harman Kardon's newest compact soundbar is the Citation Multibeam 700 </p>
<p> Harman Kardon is also announcing the Citation Multibeam 700, which is a compact soundbar and actually has a color LCD display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It sports seven speaker drivers, which will give you a pretty immersive experience. </p>
<p> Harman Kardon is allowing you to pair the Citation Multibeam 700 with the new Citation Sub S. Which is a compact, wireless subwoofer. This is going to deliver "best-in-class" bass. And it has WiSA technology built-in. When you pair these two together, you're going to get a pretty incredible experience. </p>
<p> All four of these new speakers do also include support for "Hey Google". It works with Google Assistant, but does not have Google Assistant built-in. So you'll need to talk to a Google Home or even your smartphone, to control the volume on these speakers and such. Not quite smart speakers, and that might be a good thing for most people. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pricing & Availability </p>
<p> As is the case for most products announced at CES, Harman Kardon has not announced a release date for these products. Surprisingly, though, there are some prices. </p>
<p> So the Citation 200 is going to cost you $299. While the Citation Oasis will be $199. The Citation Multibeam 700 will set you back $699, and finally the Citation Sub S will be $399. Which means that if you were looking to get both the Citation Multibeam 700 and Citation Sub S, that's going to cost you over $1100. That's gonna cost you a pretty penny, but it'll be worth it. </p>

<p> The LG Wing Looks Like A Phone For Users Who Like Crazy Concepts </p>
<p> LG has reportedly been working on a crazy new concept for a device design called the LG Wing. </p>
<p> In the video below (via Android Authority), the phone can be seen being used briefly by a driver who has it set up in a car dash mount. As for what the LG Wing is, it seems to be LG's next phone with a second screen. </p>
<p> Unlike the LG Velvet which flips open with the help of an entirely separate second display, this device's second screen is attached to the phone. It flips out to the side in what's described as a swivel-like motion. Basically it's a rotating display. Which opens up possibilities for plenty of ingenious uses that you couldn't get from a regular slab-style smartphone with a single display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The LG Wing can support multiple screen configurations </p>
<p> According to the report from Android Authority, the device supports multiple screen configurations. In the video the second display is flipped out to the side. </p>
<p> Meanwhile the main screen is being used in portrait mode. It's also said to be usable in a T formation. Which would basically be the main screen in landscape mode with the flipped out secondary screen is usable on the bottom. Essentially just take the whole phone and flip it towards the right. Making a T shape. </p>
<p> It's possible this may not be a production-ready model of the phon. Still, the possibilities of use could be vast and varied should it ever launch. The user in the video has the main screen displaying navigation, while the secondary display shows the streaming music interface. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A few more seconds into the video a phone call comes in and replaces the music interface. All while the navigation stays in view on the main display. </p>
<p> Myriad uses for an app-packed smartphone </p>
<p> A phone like this would definitely be presented to a niche market. It's sure to be cool for tech enthusiasts, but it would likely not be accepted by the mainstream consumer. </p>
<p> That doesn't take away from all the stuff you could do with it. The video is merely one example of how it could be beneficial to have a phone like this. But think about all the times you use your phone for one thing and then have to stop briefly to do something else. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Imagine you're watching a movie on Netflix and then start getting messages from a friend. You don't want to stop watching your movie, but you also want to have this conversation. The LG Wing could easily solve this issue. </p>
<p> Simply flip the screen out and position the phone in the T shape. Netflix could play on the main display, while messages could be interacted with on the secondary display. It's a weird concept to be sure. But if foldables are proof of anything, it's that a phone like this would definitely find a market in some users. Even if it was small. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / You Can Finally Watch HDR10+ Google Play Movies On Your Samsung TV </p>
<p> You Can Finally Watch HDR10+ Google Play Movies On Your Samsung TV </p>
<p> Google is finally rolling out HDR10+ support for every compatible Samsung TV via Google Play Movies, SamMobile reports. The change, now noted as effectively going live everywhere, is available in at least 117 countries. That means that users of Samsung TVs should already have noticed an update to the Google Play Movies app. Or that the update should arrive sooner than later, otherwise. </p>
<p> What does HDR10+ bring to the table? </p>
<p> Media lovers around the globe can tell you about the advantages of an HDR10-compatible screen or television. But HDR10+ is something different entirely, even before it arrived in Google Play Movies for any compatible Samsung TV pretty much anywhere. Developed by Samsung, Panasonic, and 20th Century Fox, it's open-source like its predecessor. It's also entirely free from licensing, unlike some competing platforms such as Dolby Vision. </p>
<p> In effect, it's a different way to encode and decode HDR10 content but it works somewhat differently too. HDR10+ content sends dynamic metadata to TVs. That metadata allows the television to adjust color, brightness, and more on a more pixel-by-pixel, frame-by-frame basis. The result, in conjunction with up to 4000 nits maximum brightness over HDR10's 1000 nits, is a more realistic image. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That is, of course, driven by a better contrast between light and dark areas, as well as clearer visibility across the spectrum. </p>
<p> Now, Google Play Movies users can take advantage of that too on Samsung televisions that support HDR10+. </p>
<p> HDR10+ support for Google Play Movies on Samsung TVs definitely took long enough </p>
<p> Now, Google initially promised support for HDR10+ in Google Play Movies back in January. That was followed by a promise to support Dolby Vision a few months later. But this is really arriving late no matter how it's viewed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For instance, Amazon and Samsung partnered to ensure around 100 television shows and movies would work with HDR10+ a long time ago. Nearly three years, as a matter of fact, after announcing the bid in early 2017. And the library on that service and others has only grown since that announcement was made. </p>

<p> Here's How You Can Install Google TV UI On Android TV </p>
<p> Google introduced a new Google TV UI with the new Chromecast during the recently concluded online event. Well, the standalone app of Google TV is available to download from the Play Store. </p>
<p> However, the app itself neither brings any new features, not it does anything for Android TV devices. But in the future, all Android TV devices will slowly adapt to the new Google TV. </p>
<p> There is a key difference between Android TV and Google TV. The latter heavily focuses on content recommendations from different streaming platforms. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the help of this feature, users can focus on watching more content instead of relying on dedicated apps of these platforms to look for content. </p>
<p> For all those enthusiasts who wish to try out Google TV UI on their Android TV, can feel fortunate. Because in this post, we will share with you the steps that would help you to get the Google TV on your Android TV device. </p>
<p> So, let us take a look at the steps that you need to perform to get Google TV UI on your Android TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google TV UI can be installed on Android TV devices running Android 9 or above </p>
<p> Like any process, there are some pre-requisites that you need to check before following the steps. Basically, your Android TV, set-top box, or dongle need to be running Android 9 Pie or above. </p>
<p> If you are unsure about the version of Android running on your Android TV device, you can head over to Settings > Device Preferences > About > Version. </p>
<p> Moreover, there are a couple of files that we will need for sideloading to your Android TV. The first one is the Google TV Home launcher itself. While the other one is the updated Google app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, move the download APK files to your Android TV. To do that, simply use Bluetooth or use any WiFi-based transfer app. </p>
<p> Once you are successfully done with the transfer of both the files, open File Manager like File Commander, etc. on your Android TV device. </p>
<p> Install the APK files </p>
<p> Locate the APKs and install them one-by-one on your Android TV device. After installing the apps, you need to uninstall the original Android TV Launcher app from your TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And to do that, head over to Settings, tap Device Preferences, then click About. After that tap on Build repeatedly seven times until a message says "You Are Now A Developer!". </p>
<p> Head back and enter the newly added Developer Options. Under developer options, toggle on the Network Debugging to send ADB commands to Android TV from phone or tablet. </p>
<p> On your Android smartphone or tablet, install the Remote ADB Shell on your device from the Play Store. Open the app and you will be asked to enter the IP address of your Android TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You will find the IP address of your Android TV by heading to Settings > Device Preferences > About > Status > IP Address. Notably, keep the port number as 5555. </p>
<p> Press the Connect button and a message will pop-up on your Android TV. Select OK to enable wireless connection. This will connect your smartphone to your TV. </p>
<p> Type pm uninstall –user 0 com.google.android.tvlauncher command and hit Enter. If the command works, you will see a "Success" message. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That's it! Now, when you press the Home button, you will be taken to the new Google TV UI. Installing the Google Home app would also enable the Search tab as well. </p>

<p> Android News / Here's Your Best Look Yet At The New Google Chromecast With A Remote </p>
<p> Here's Your Best Look Yet At The New Google Chromecast With A Remote </p>
<p> Alongside the Pixel 4A 5G and Pixel 5 smartphones, Google is also expected to launch the successor to Chromecast Ultra on September 30. Despite constantly being in the leaks, there are no renders revealing the complete design of the new streaming dongle. Thanks to WinFuture, there are now a set of leaked renders of the new Google Chromecast with a remote. </p>
<p> The new Chromecast device will do more than just streaming content from the smartphone. It is actually the company's first-ever standalone streaming device and comes loaded with full-fledged Google TV OS. As per the leaks, the company will also announce the rebranding of Android TV as Google TV during the same event. </p>
<p> New renders reveal the design of the upcoming Google Chromecast and its remote </p>
<p> The new Google Chromecast will work similarly to the Roku Streaming Stick and the Amazon Fire TV Stick. The Oval-shaped dongle comes with an HDMI port for connecting to any TV. It also includes a USB Type-C port for power supply. As seen on previous Chromecast devices, there is also a LED status indicator and reset button. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Speaking of the remote, the company got rid of the "Star" button that was present in the previously leaked renders. The rumors suggested this button will allow the users to open the pre-assigned app. Like the remote controller of the Google's Daydream View VR headset, this one also features volume buttons on the side. </p>
<p> Remote comes with a dedicated button for Netflix </p>
<p> It also sports three dedicated buttons for Google Assistant, YouTube, and Netflix. There is also a circular D-pad and a few more additional buttons. As per the FCC listing, the remote comes with Bluetooth support. </p>
<p> In terms of performance, the dongle packs in a quad-core Amlogic S905X2 SoC coupled with 2GB of RAM. According to the leaked listings, the new Google Chromecast with Google TV will be available in Rock Candy, Como Blue, and Summer Melon color options. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Just like the Chromecast Ultra, the new Chromecast with Google TV will work with Stadia. When connected to a compatible smart TV, it supports a wide range of HDR standards including 4K HDR, Dolby Vision, and HLG. The dongle is expected to cost cheaper than the $70 Chromecast Ultra. </p>
<p> While there is no confirmation over the official pricing, the leaked retail listings suggest it might cost as low as $50. The pricing and availability details will be revealed by the company during the September 30 event. </p>

<p> Android News / Hisense's Ultra-Short Throw Android TV Projector Finally Hits Store Shelves </p>
<p> Hisense's Ultra-Short Throw Android TV Projector Finally Hits Store Shelves </p>
<p> Hisense first announced the L5 ultra-short throw projector at CES in early January. And it is just now going on sale at several retailers. </p>
<p> We often see products announced at CES and go on sale in the second half of the year, but this time around it was likely due to the pandemic. So we'll blame that for the long wait. We were impressed with the L5, at CES, and even gave it a "Best of CES" award. </p>
<p> Anyways, the Hisense L5 series is on sale now at Amazon, BeachCamera and a few other retailers for $3,999. Yes, it received a $1,000 price cut since its announcement, seven months ago. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Hisense L5 is pricey, but worth it </p>
<p> The Hisense L5 is a premium ultra-short throw projector that happens to run on Android TV. And these ultra-short throw projectors can sometimes cost many thousands of dollars. </p>
<p> The L5 series uses a blue laser source, which will hit 2,700 lumens of maximum brightness, while also offering 25,000 hours of viewing. </p>
<p> Hisense is also using a Texas Instruments DLP chip that can produce 4K via pixel shifting and fast scanning. That's going to provide a better image, which is important since projectors are not typically known for their image quality. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It also supports HDR10 and HLG, while also covering around 83% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. Basically, you're going to get a really incredible picture here. </p>
<p> Because this is an ultra-short throw projector, it can sit just 11-inches from the wall. Which allows you to put it on a table without needing a ceiling mount. </p>
<p> Hisense has also built 30W speakers inside the L5, and it uses dbx-TV for surround-like sound. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Powered by Android TV </p>
<p> In recent years, Hisense has gone all-in with Android TV, and that's something we really like seeing. </p>
<p> And the L5 series is no different. </p>
<p> This projector comes with Android TV built-in, which is going to give you access to thousands of apps like Netflix, Hulu, Google Play Movies & TV, YouTube and much more. There is also Google Assistant available, as well as Cast. So just about everything is covered here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That's actually a really big deal, considering a lot of other projectors will use their own proprietary software, which is a mess, and difficult to use. Not to mention the fact that most apps are unlikely to be available on a proprietary platform. But something like Android TV or Roku, they will be available. So that is a very wise decision by Hisense. </p>
<p> As mentioned, the Hisense L5 series is available from Amazon and BeachCamera now. </p>

<p> HONOR ViewPad 6 & X6 Tablets Are Official, And Really Affordable </p>
<p> HONOR has announced two new budget tablets, the ViewPad 6 and X6. These tablets are really affordable, though we’ll talk more about that later on. </p>
<p> These two tablets look the same, and share the vast majority of their specifications. The only difference between them comes to their display sizes and resolutions. </p>
<p> Both devices seem to be made out of plastic, though we cannot confirm that. Both of them include a single camera on the back, and looks rather plain from the front. A stylus is also included in the marketing materials, but we’re not sure it ships with these tablets. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The HONOR ViewPad 6 is the larger of the two </p>
<p> The HONOR ViewPad 6 is the larger tablet of the two, it sports a 10.4-inch 1920 x 1200 IPS display. The ViewPad X6 comes with a 9.7-inch 1280 X 800 IPS display. </p>
<p> Both of these tablets are fueled by the Kirin 710A 64-bit octa-core processor. That is Huawei’s very own mid-range chip, and it’s actually a really good performer. </p>
<p> Both tablets include 3GB with 32GB of storage, or 4GB of RAM with 64GB / 128GB of internal storage. You can expand that storage by using a microSD card of up to 512GB. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Android 10 comes pre-installed on both devices, along with HONOR’s Magic UI 3.1. Neither of these tablets comes with Google services, by the way, and both have been announced in China. </p>
<p> A 5-megapixel camera can be found on the back of these tablets. A 2-megapixel unit is included on the front. Bluetooth 5.1 is supported, while a 4G variant is also an option, it seems. Regular models come with WiFi only. </p>
<p> A 5,100mAh battery is included in both devices </p>
<p> A 5,100mAh battery is also included in the package here. Fast charging has not been mentioned, so we guess that neither of the two tablets supports it. We could be wrong, though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, in terms of pricing, most of these variants are available in both 4G LTE and WiFi only options. Pricing starts at CNY1,099 ($157) for the 3GB RAM ViewPad X6 with WiFi only. It goes up to CNY1,899 ($271) for the ViewPad 6 with 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and 4G support. </p>
<p> As already mentioned, these tablets have been announced in China. The HONOR ViewPad 6 will become available starting on July 27. The ViewPad X6, on the other hand, will go on sale in August. </p>
<p> HONOR will probably bring at least one of these tablets to Europe. The company did not confirm anything just yet, so we cannot know for sure, but it’ll probably happen. </p>

<p> How To Activate Secret 96Hz Mode On Samsung Galaxy S20 </p>
<p> The Galaxy S20 series packs a secret 96Hz display mode that can be activated with a bit of fiddling. In other words, it turns out Samsung does offer some middle ground in regards to resolution and screen refresh rate. </p>
<p> The lack of a hybrid solution between 120Hz and WQHD+ (3,200 x 1,440) has been among main user complaints directed at the Galaxy S20 lineup. After all, nearly all of the product range's 120Hz rivals also offer a 90Hz mode. It now came to light Samsung developed an equivalent solution, even though the solution hasn't been launched yet. </p>
<p> How to set your Galaxy S20 display to a 96Hz refresh rate </p>
<p> Changing the "Settings.System.min_refresh_rate" and "Settings.System.peak_refresh_rate" integers to "96" via shell commands activates the option. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you're familiar with those, that's all the crucial info you need. If you aren't, no worries; we won't be delving into the world of keyboard-to-OS commands here but simply point you to an easier method. </p>
<p> That would be an open-source app called S20RefreshRateControl available on GitHub via the link below. Developer SatySatsZB put it together shortly after the existence of the Galaxy S20's secret 96Hz mode was revealed. </p>
<p> Both options also allow you to set the display of your Galaxy S20-series handset to 48Hz. Few will want to do that given how the choppier experience doesn't deliver significant battery life improvements, though. The 96Hz mode, on the other hand, appears to provide a better balance of smoothness and battery longevity. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Unfortunately, this setting remains limited to FHD+ resolutions, much like the 120Hz one. </p>
<p> Why is Samsung keeping these settings hidden? </p>
<p> It's unclear whether the company is still tweaking the 96Hz mode or has abandoned it. Both scenarios would explain the fact this setting remains hidden to users a month after the Galaxy S20 series launched. </p>
<p> It's almost a given that Samsung's trying to get the alternative display mode working with WQHD+ resolutions, assuming it hasn't given up on it. That's because the company's already pursuing an even more ambitious goal of 120Hz/1440p support. It may also be improving its stability, though initial reports suggest consistency isn't an issue. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Higher refresh rates equate to smoother end-user experiences on virtually any display type, including mobile panels. As such, they're particularly advantageous to gamers. The Galaxy S20 is Samsung's first handset lineup supporting this feature, and more are likely to follow soon. </p>
<p> The product range as a whole hasn't had the greatest of starts, however. In fact, its sales are reportedly even worse than expected, cutting-edge display tech notwithstanding. </p>

<p> How To Add "Sports Plus" To Your YouTube TV Account </p>
<p> After a few hints that it was coming, YouTube TV has finally announced its new Sports Plus package. And it is available to add to your account right now. </p>
<p> The only question right now is, how exactly do you add it to your account? That's the question we are going to aim to answer here. </p>
<p> What is Sports Plus? </p>
<p> Sports Plus is a new add-on package (in fact the first, add-on package for YouTube TV). It is going to give you access to a boatload of new sports channels, it'll cost you $10.99 per month. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The channels that are included in this package are: NFL RedZone, Fox College Sports, GolTV, Fox Soccer Plus, MAVTV Motorsports Network, TVG, and Stadium. </p>
<p> This is an add-on for YouTube TV, so you are not seeing a price hike this time. But those that want access to those channels, will have to pay the $10.99/month for them. It's a better deal than paying for them individually, as these would likely cost around $5 each. </p>
<p> The NFL Network is not included in this package, and that is because YouTube TV is adding it to everyone's account. So it's included for "free", with your core YouTube TV account. Which is a good move by YouTube TV, as that is something that most of its customers have been wanting to be added for many years. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to add Sports Plus to your YouTube TV </p>
<p> Firstly, open the YouTube TV app, or go to tv.youtube.com. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Next, tap on settings. </p>
<p> From there, the first tab should be "Membership". </p>
<p> You will see the different add ons that you can add to your account. Sports Plus should be at the top, unless you have other add-ons on your account. For example, in the image above, it is below HBO MAX, since I have added HBO MAX to my account. </p>
<p> Just tick the check box next to Sports Plus. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, YouTube TV will let you know that your subscription to Sports Plus will start immediately, and use your 7-day free trial. It will also tell you that you will be charged a prorated rate – and that amount will depend on when your billing date is. Then the $10.99 will be added to your normal $64.99 price of YouTube TV going forward. And you can cancel anytime. </p>
<p> Just click on "Purchase" and you'll be all set. Now you have all of those channels available on YouTube TV. </p>

<p> How To Adjust Backlit Keyboard Brightness On A Chromebook </p>
<p> Owning a Chromebook with a backlit keyboard can be exceptionally useful but it's equally useful to know how to adjust that lighting. One backlight setting simply doesn't work for every environment or every circumstance. If the keyboard backlight on a Chromebook — or any device — is too dim in a dark environment, it can be difficult to really see the keys. And what works here is going to vary widely from user to user. </p>
<p> For older users, a brighter backlight than the default setting may be better. For younger eyes, too much brightness can grow painful if they happen to look down at the keyboard a lot. Conversely, the backlit keyboard on a Chromebook may be set too bright. Or it may not be needed at all. Users may want to adjust the setting to save some battery. The savings there aren't going to be substantial, of course. But every little bit helps when it comes to extending battery life. </p>
<p> Finally, it's entirely possible that those who are suffering from a backlit keyboard that "isn't working" have accidentally turned the brightness too low. That's as opposed to the hardware itself having a problem. Turning brightness up would, in that case, act as a "fix." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Fortunately, Chrome OS on most Chromebooks that feature a backlit keyboard offers a quick way to adjust that lighting. With that said, the setting is generally tucked behind a keyboard shortcut. It's not found in the Chrome OS shelf's Quick Settings. And that means that many users may not even know that changing the setting is possible. Without further ado, let's take a closer look at how users can accomplish the task. </p>
<p> Three keys, lots of backlit Chromebook keyboard levels to adjust </p>
<p> Summarily, users will only need three keys to adjust the brightness of the backlit keyboard on a Chromebook. Those are the "alt" key and the brightness adjustment keys used for the display panel. In Chrome OS, the brightness adjustment keys each feature a "sun"-like icon. One of the two icons is slightly smaller than the other, differentiating the two. The larger, bolder sun-shaped icon takes brightness up while the smaller sun-shaped icon takes brightness down. For clarity, in this 'how to' the smaller key will be referred to as the "brightness down" key. The larger icon will be referred to as the "brightness up" key. </p>
<p> To adjust the brightness of the backlit keyboard on a Chromebook either up or down, users will need to begin by pressing and holding the "alt" key. As with most shortcuts on most operating systems, either the left- or right-hand alt key can be used. Users should just choose to press whichever is easiest to reach while still being able to press the screen brightness keys. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Adjusting the backlit keyboard to a brighter setting requires users to press the alt key and then either tap or hold the "brightness up" key. Taps will adjust the brightness slowly while holding it will gradually brighten more quickly up until the maximum brightness is reached. </p>
<p> Tuning down the backlighting for a Chromebook keyboard requires users to press the alt key. Then they'll need to tap or hold the "brightness down" key. That's going to work the same as turning the brightness up. Or users can just keep holding the key until the backlighting turns off entirely. </p>

<p> How To Disable Bixby On Galaxy Note 20 </p>
<p> Bixby is once again, front-and-center on the Galaxy Note 20, and the first thing a lot of people are wondering, is how to disable it. </p>
<p> Since Samsung released Bixby on the Galaxy S8 three years ago, it hasn't really found its footing as being a virtual assistant. It's just not that great at a lot of things. And many prefer to use the Google Assistant. Luckily, Samsung does allow you to disable it on the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra. </p>
<p> Why would you want to get rid of Bixby? </p>
<p> There's a number of reasons why you might want to get rid of Bixby. For one, you prefer something else like Google Assistant or even Amazon Alexa. But you also may be annoyed that Bixby pops up every time you hold down the power button. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You see, Samsung decided to make it possible to wake Bixby by holding down the power button. Which is a much better thing than having a dedicated Bixby button on the opposite side of the phone, which always gets pressed. This was a major issue starting with the Galaxy S8. </p>
<p> Then there's the fact that you might just not even use Bixby on your Galaxy Note 20. Which is perfectly fine, and a good reason to disable it as well, to help conserve some battery. </p>
<p> What will I lose by disabling Bixby? </p>
<p> By disabling Bixby, you won't really lose anything, other than Bixby. In fact, you're going to gain a whole lot more. Like the ability to double-tap the power button and open the camera app. Or press and hold to actually turn off or reboot your smartphone. Among other things. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pretty much everything that Bixby does, you can do with the Google Assistant, and likely do better. So it's no real loss if you disable Bixby. And it doesn't really affect other Samsung services on your device. </p>
<p> How to disable the Bixby Button </p>
<p> On the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra, Samsung has made the default setting for the power button to wake Bixby when you press and hold it. This was also the case for the Galaxy Note 10, Note 10+, S20, S20+ and S20 Ultra. But you can change that pretty easily. And here's how. </p>
<p> Swipe down the notification shade. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tap on the power menu button in the quick settings panel. </p>
<p> Now, tap on the Side key settings – it's a button at the bottom of the screen. </p>
<p> Next, you'll want to change the double press interaction to be Quick Launch Camera or to open an app, instead of opening Bixby. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Secondly, you'll want to go down into the next section for press and hold. And change that to "Power off Menu". </p>
<p> And that's it, you won't be bringing up Bixby accidentally. Now if you want to totally get rid of Bixby, you'll want to disable Samsung Daily (which used to be called Bixby Home), and you can see how to do that here. </p>

<p> How To Disable Facebook Bloatware On The OnePlus 8 & Nord </p>
<p> You’ve probably heard by now that some Facebook apps come pre-installed on the OnePlus 8 series and Nord. Well, in this article, we’ll show you how to disable those Facebook apps aka bloatware, and keep your OnePlus 8 / Nord Facebook-free. </p>
<p> You can disable Facebook apps on the OnePlus 8 & Nord easily, but you’ll need ADB in order to remove them </p>
<p> Do note that we’ll only show you how to disable those apps here, as you can’t really remove them that easily. You can disable these apps by using your phone only, without a problem, removing them requires some extra steps, as you’ll need ADB in order to do it. </p>
<p> In any case, the OnePlus 8, 8 Pro, and Nord come with three Facebook apps pre-installed. Those apps are ‘Facebook App Installer’, ‘Facebook Services’, and ‘Facebook App Manager’. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All three of those apps are system apps, by the way, that is why you can’t remove them that easily. It is quite surprising to see that OnePlus agreed to something like that, Facebook must have forked over quite a bit of cash, but I digress. </p>
<p> All three of these apps should not affect your phone’s performance that much, if at all, but disabling them just in case may be the best idea. The first thing you need to do is enter your phone’s settings. </p>
<p> From there, navigate to ‘Apps & notifications’. Hit the ‘See all [NUMBER OF APPS] apps’ option. On that list, track down those three apps that we’ve mentioned earlier. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For each of those apps, you’ll need to hit the ‘Disable’ option. Unfortunately, there is no ‘Uninstall’ option, as mentioned earlier, but disabling them will do the trick. </p>
<p> These apps are tiny, so you don’t have to worry about storage space at all </p>
<p> These apps are quite small, so the extra space they take up on your phone won’t bother you that much, and by disabling them you won’t really have to worry about them doing anything in the background either. </p>
<p> Do note that OnePlus mentioned these apps may allow for Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps to be more power-efficient if you don’t disable them. So, if you use either of those apps, you may want to reconsider disabling these apps. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the flip side, those Facebook apps will work just fine even if you disable these three applications that come pre-installed. I’ve tried it myself, and didn’t really notice the difference, at all. </p>
<p> If you want to completely remove these apps from your phone, you’ll need to use ADB. The procedure is quite simple, to be quite honest, but you’ll need ADB, and you’ll also need to hook up your phone to your PC, of course. XDA Developers did a really nice guide on how to do this, if you’re interested. </p>

<p> Android how to / How To Disable, Remove, Or Limit Data Access For Chrome Extensions </p>
<p> How To Disable, Remove, Or Limit Data Access For Chrome Extensions </p>
<p> Chrome is a big part of day to day life for a significant portion of the world. That's true not just for day-to-day users either. That includes work, entertainment, or other use cases too. Google's app is well-known and widely used. And that means that most users are familiar with most of its features. From its security measures to the steps required to clear browsing data. But, Chrome extensions are a bit different, particularly when it comes to understanding how they work and the data they can collect. </p>
<p> As a result, not nearly as many users have a good understanding — even if they use quite a lot of extensions — when it comes to managing those. Here, we'll discuss how to take better control over extensions so they won't just collect everything wholesale. Potentially saving some big headaches later on. </p>
<p> There's only one way to completely limit Chrome extensions' data access </p>
<p> Learning how to completely disable access to data for extensions in Chrome is fairly straightforward. Google has gone a long way to making it as easy as possible. But, as with just about every web-based tool or site, it requires removing the extension entirely. Or by disabling them. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Otherwise, the extensions will have access to at least some user information, if not the data about which sites are visited and interactions. That's a matter of course due to how extensions, sign-in, and syncing with Chrome work. </p>
<p> As noted above, the following steps will cover how to remove an extension. But the same steps, with the exception of tapping or clicking "Remove" can be followed to simply disable them. So users don't need to uninstall their extensions every time they want to stop them working. And they don't need to follow that up by finding and reinstalling them to get them working again. </p>
<p> Similarly, these steps lead to the user interface (UI) for reporting extensions believed to be malicious. That way, if users happen across an extension that's behaving badly, Google can be notified and investigate. On one hand, the search giant might pull the extension and it could return with fixes in place to make it better. Or it might just give the developers a heads-up that the extension isn't working properly </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Under different circumstances, it might simply be malicious and get pulled and reported to the proper authorities. In either case, ultimately preventing other users from encountering the same problems. </p>
<p> To get started: </p>
<p> Open Chrome </p>
<p> Tap or click the three-dot menu at the top-right-hand side of the UI </p>
<p> Hover over or click on "More tools" </p>
<p> Tap or click "Extensions." Chrome will load the dedicated Chrome Extensions menu </p>
<p> Scroll to find the extension you'd like to remove </p>
<p> Tap or click the "Remove" button </p>
<p> Tap or click "Remove" on the resulting pop-up card. Select the checkbox for "Report abuse" first, if the extension has been exhibiting abusive behavior or if it appears to otherwise be malicious </p>
<p> OR </p>
<p> Open Chrome </p>
<p> Navigate to the Extension page as described above </p>
<p> Tap or click on the "Details" button to see what's being accessed and where </p>
<p> Scroll down to the "Remove extension" option to remove the extension </p>
<p> Tap or click "Remove" on the resulting pop-up and select the checkbox if the extension has exhibited abusive behavior </p>
<p> In the seventh step of the first method, selecting the checkbox will alert Google to potential bad behavior. That could result in the extension being removed from the Chrome Web Store, potentially saving others headaches. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But here's you can limit site data access for extensions </p>
<p> Some extensions, particularly those that appear next to the URL Omnibox, can also be limited on a site-to-site basis. In effect, they can be made to work with a single site, across all sites, or only on-click. That will — or at least should — limit how the Chrome extensions can access data. </p>
<p> It's worth noting that this only works for extensions that actually appear in that location in the UI. There are, it goes without saying, plenty of extensions that won't appear there even when they're activated. So users will want to check out the next set of steps for a deeper explanation. Especially if they extension they're looking for doesn't appear next to the Omnibox. </p>
<p> Open Chrome </p>
<p> Check to see whether there are any extensions in the UI next to the URL Omnibox (the address bar) </p>
<p> Long-press or right-click on the extension that needs to be managed — conversely, press the 'alt' key and click in Chrome OS or click with two fingers </p>
<p> Hover over or select the "This can read and change site data" option in the resulting context menu </p>
<p> Select "When you click the extension" to ensure the extension only accesses data when it's clicked or otherwise selected </p>
<p> Or select the second option to only enable the extension for the currently in-use website. That's "AndroidHeadlines.com" in the example images below. </p>
<p> Choose "On all sites" to allow the extension to access all sites' data across all open tabs </p>
<p> There is also a deeper way to manage site access as well. But we'll cover that in the next set of steps, showing how multiple sites can be added to Chrome extensions' data access list. The segment will also discuss Incognito Mode, as well as how deeper extension settings are handled. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> …and how you can limit access for at least some Chrome extensions </p>
<p> Now, extensions management isn't limited to that UI by any stretch. The above-mentioned tools will primarily be useful for quick access to controlling extensions and the data they can peruse. So here we'll take a deeper look at how Chrome extensions and data access can be controlled more comprehensively. </p>
<p> Google built a full menu for controlling extensions almost from the very beginning. And, within that menu, users can not only complete the above actions. They can also manage deep controls that will vary from extension to extension. Chrome also displays permissions, extension install size, the source of the extension, and other details here. </p>
<p> There are two ways to get to that menu, just for starters. The first is through the extensions listed out next to the Omnibox. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Open Chrome </p>
<p> Long-press or right-click on an extension next to the URL Omnibox </p>
<p> Select "Manage extensions" </p>
<p> OR </p>
<p> Tap or click the three-dot menu at the top-right-hand side of the Chrome UI </p>
<p> Scroll down to "More tools" and then select "Extensions" </p>
<p> From there, each individual extension can be toggled on or off. </p>
<p> From the above-mentioned steps </p>
<p> Scroll to the desired extension </p>
<p> Click or tap the toggle switch on the extension card to disable or enable it </p>
<p> Or can be managed directly, whether that's removing Chrome extensions, reporting them, managing site data access, or how the deeper settings are set. </p>
<p> Open Chrome and navigate to the Extensions menu </p>
<p> Tap or click on the "Remove" button for any extension that needs to be removed or removed and reported </p>
<p> Tap or click on the "Details" option for deeper management </p>
<p> To limit site access, choose "Details" and then scroll to the "Site access" heading, for extensions that allow the adjustment. Choose the appropriate site access setting. </p>
<p> To allow access to specific details, such as full site URLs — or to allow access in Incognito Mode — select the appropriate toggles </p>
<p> For deeper settings, on extensions that have deeper settings such as the Google Translate extension shown in the example images below, select "Extension options." </p>
<p> Why limit access at all? </p>
<p> Now, it's important to note that adjusting these settings has absolutely nothing to do with how Chrome itself tracks user data — only extensions. There's an entire set of other steps required to change how Chrome tracks other user data. And it isn't possible to individually control permissions. At least not yet. </p>
<p> Chrome leaves it up to the end-user to decide what is or isn't appropriate permission access. Although it does limit permissions to those that the extension actually needs via its store policies, even if some extensions do slip through. </p>
<p> That leaves open a question as to why users should limit access at all. And the answer is fairly straightforward. Privacy and security. Chrome is the most popular web browser and it isn't even a close race. More users are gradually becoming aware of the risks associated with Google's data collection. And Google itself is putting more tools in place to help users manage that, it isn't perfect. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That is, at the very least in part, down to the fact that the company itself is facing increasing scrutiny in the US. On both sides of the political aisle. But, as noted above, some problems slip through. </p>
<p> Extensions can also slow down the browser significantly. Whether that's because they're large, to begin with, or because they eat up a lot of RAM — either immediately or over time. There are other workarounds for those issues as well. But the best solution is often prevention. And Chrome users don't necessarily need a lot of extensions. </p>
<p> These steps, at least for now and at least in Chrome's current iteration, help to address those potential issues. </p>

<p> How To Disable Samsung Daily On Galaxy Note 20 Ultra </p>
<p> Samsung is one of the few manufacturers that have resisted integrating the Google Discover feed into its home screen. And instead uses Samsung Daily, which is very similar. But you can disable Samsung Daily on the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. It's actually very simple to disable too. </p>
<p> What exactly is Samsung Daily? It's the replacement to Bixby Home, and has been on Samsung's smartphones, starting with the Galaxy S20 release earlier this year. It will show you sports scores, apps to download from the Galaxy Store, news from Flipboard and much more. There's also some Spotify integration too. </p>
<p> But it's not for everyone, and here's how you can disable Samsung Daily. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to disable Samsung Daily on Galaxy Note 20 series </p>
<p> This process is going to be the same for virtually any Samsung smartphone, running One UI 2.5. </p>
<p> Either pinch in on your home screen, or long press in a blank area on your home screen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now swipe over from left to right to bring up the Samsung Daily screen. </p>
<p> You will now see a toggle at the top, next to where it says "Samsung Daily". Slide that toggle over. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And that's it. </p>
<p> Now when you go home, you won't be able to swipe to the left page any longer. As there is now nothing there. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Samsung does not allow you to replace it with the Google Discover feed, which would be a nice addition. But that's not possible here. </p>
<p> There is a potential workaround though. As you can install a third-party launcher onto the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and get the Google feed on the left of the home screen. But you'd also lose some of the other features that Samsung has baked into its own launcher. So you'd need to weigh the pro's and con's, for your own usage. </p>
<p> This may conserve some battery life for you, but you may also not notice any real differences with battery life when you disable Samsung Daily. Especially if you had never set it up in the first place. It really all depends on how you use your phone too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you decide that you want to turn Samsung Daily, you can do so by following the steps above and simply turning the toggle back on. All of your settings are saved, so you won't need to do anything like setting it back up again. Which is really nice, for those that do want to use it again. </p>

<p> How To Download Fortnite On Android Without Google Play </p>
<p> If you're tuned into the mobile gaming industry at all, even a little bit, then you probably already know that Fortnite was pulled off of the Play Store, but you can still play it on Android and if you don't how to get a hold of it, we're here to help. </p>
<p> The first thing to know is that the downloads themselves aren't coming from Google Play. That's obvious since it was removed from the store yesterday afternoon. </p>
<p> As a bit of a recap, Epic Games pushed an update out to Fortnite that implemented a way for players to make direct payments for vbucks to the company. This way it could skirt around the 30-percent fee that both Apple and Google charge developers. Apple responded by removing the game from the App Store and Google followed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The good news is that there are still two ways you can download Fortnite on Android. Both of which are legitimate methods that don't force you to go to seedy back hollow websites to grab the APK. </p>
<p> How to download Fortnite on Android for all users </p>
<p> No matter what phone type you have, if it runs on Android you can still grab a legitimate copy of Fortnite. All you have to do is sideload the game. </p>
<p> Prior to its launch on the Play Store, Fortnite was offered this way. Directly through Epic Games and its Epic Games launcher. Which was an APK file you could download from Fortnite mobile's website. Epic Games is still offering this method of access. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To grab it, open your mobile phone's browser and navigate to the page for Fortnite on Android. Here you can download the Epic Games launcher APK. </p>
<p> Install the Epic Games launcher. Once that's finished, open it up and you'll find two games there which you can download. One of them is Fortnite. Simply proceed to download and install the APK for the game the same way you did with the launcher itself. </p>
<p> The sideload shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes and you'll be playing in no time. However, this is a slightly easier way to grab the game. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you're a Samsung phone user, getting the game is quite simple </p>
<p> If you're a Samsung phone user then you're in luck and you won't have to go through any extra hoops to get the game. Such as downloading another new launcher. </p>
<p> You see, Samsung was actually the first brand to have access to Fortnite exclusively on its phones. It achieved this through a partnership that it struck with Epic Games. That partnership saw it available on Galaxy phones only for a while. </p>
<p> To get the game, simply open the Galaxy App store and search for Fortnite. You should find it without issues since Samsung itself is not hindering your access to it in any way. This is a faster and simpler process than downloading a new app store (The Epic Games launcher) and then downloading the game and sideloading it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That's all there is to it. You can now pop open the game and play to your heart's content. And you can continue to buy vbucks either through the Galaxy App store or from Epic Games directly. </p>
<p> Be cautious if you're sideloading </p>
<p> To wrap things up, it's worth mentioning that you should be careful when sideloading apps or games. </p>
<p> Fortnite is no different. While there shouldn't be any issues with grabbing it from Epic Games directly, you'll want to stay away from other sites that offer the APK download. It's best to just play it safe and get it straight from Epic. </p>

<p> The thing is, even from Epic you still have to allow sideloading. Which can be a security risk. Once the sideload of the game is finished, unless you keep sideloading on for any other reason, you might want to disable it again. This will prompts in your way so you can't sideload apps with approval. Which includes re-enabling the action from settings. </p>

<p> How To Download & Install Progressive Web Apps Via Google Chrome </p>
<p> Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are, in effect, web applications that can be downloaded and installed from Google Chrome and run like native apps. But learning how to download or install a PWA in Chrome isn't necessarily the most intuitive process. Even if it is easy once learned. </p>
<p> Now, PWAs come with a whole lot of benefits. Most of those will be for developers but that has a knock-on effect for users. Not least of all, it gives users ready offline access to information and web-built tools. Those function like native apps and do so across any platform Chrome can be installed on. </p>
<p> For instance, Google has shown how a PWA can replace a basic image compressor and editor with its web-based Squoosh app. The company built it as a PWA. So the tool can be used either online or off. And it functions just like downloaded software should. Users can just as easily access Squoosh on Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebooks, Android, or iOS. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course, it isn't just basic tools like a photo editor that can take the form of a PWA. Google has also demonstrated drawing tools as PWAs, websites, word editors, chat apps, and more. </p>
<p> The possibilities are, in effect, only limited by developers' imaginations. So the platform has grown significantly since its 2019 introduction. And it's going to get bigger thanks to a recent team-up between Google and Microsoft aimed at making creating them even easier. All of that makes learning how to install a PWA in Chrome more pressing than ever before. </p>
<p> To download a PWA in Google Chrome </p>
<p> The "how" when it comes time to download or install a PWA via Google Chrome really couldn't be a much easier process. In fact, it can easily be summarized in just a few steps. And that's because Google has stopped just short of tossing in a pop-up message to inform users that a site can be installed as a PWA. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It goes without saying that there may, at any given point, be some differences between how different operating systems install PWAs. Or whether or not they can be installed at all. On Android, for example, installing a PWA doesn't seem to follow the process below at all, at least for now. </p>
<p> This guide will use a Chromebook but the UI should stay the same across Windows, Mac, and Linux too — for the Chrome browser. It could potentially stay the same on iOS but we'll discuss Android just below the steps. </p>
<p> Open Google Chrome. </p>
<p> Using the URL Omnibox, navigate to the page you would like to download from Google Chrome as a PWA. For this example, we're using Google's image compression and light editing app 'Squoosh' </p>
<p> Click or Tap on the URL Omnibox once the page loads. </p>
<p> If the site is downloadable as a PWA, a new "install" icon will appear on the right-hand side of the Omnibox. Google shaped the install icon like a 'plus' symbol inside of a circle and typically just to the left of the star-shaped bookmark icon. To begin with, the word "Install" should also appear there briefly, before sliding back out of view. </p>
<p> Tap or click the install icon. </p>
<p> Click or Tap "Install" in the resulting pop-out to install the PWA. </p>
<p> Once installed, the PWA will be presented in its own native-like window. Chrome places an appropriate icon alongside other installed applications and software. On Chromebooks, that's in the app launcher, as shown in the images below, while on Windows that should be within the start menu. </p>
<p> On Android devices, the current state of affairs seems to be that there's no native Chrome UI telling users how to install a PWA. Instead, web apps apparently need to include their own install button. For Squoosh, for instance, the purple-colored "Install" button shown in the above sample images also appears on Android. And tapping that, as with desktop Chrome, results in a pop-up. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The key difference is that the pop-up asks users to add the Squoosh PWA to their home screen. That's similar to how the Google app, when "weather" is searched, presents users with that option. Choosing to add the Squoosh PWA to the home screen won't cause it to appear in the app drawer on Android. It can be found on the home screen instead. </p>
<p> Keeping PWAs up-to-date </p>
<p> Now, after installing a PWA from Google Chrome, there's really no need to worry about keeping the app up-to-date. That's not because they don't need to be updated, of course. But, for the most part, PWAs will keep themselves up-to-date. In fact, they update in a few different ways but always when the installed device is connected to the internet. </p>
<p> For example, the Squoosh app used in our example doesn't update as often as a typical PWA. That's because it is, under the hood, a basic photo editing application. Explicitly meant for compressing, resizing, and otherwise shrinking down image file sizes. So there isn't a lot in terms of user-facing details that need to change. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Instead, it will periodically receive improvements via an update when the Chromebook it's installed on is connected. When that does happen, a pop-up appears, telling users there's a new version. Tapping the update button relaunches Squoosh, a lot like reloading a website. </p>
<p> Things are different when a website is installed as a PWA that does have a lot of user-facing details that need to update. For instance, a news site PWA will effectively update every time its opened, as long as a connection is available. And it'll do that in the background just like a native app for the service in question would. Google worked to ensure that no user interaction is needed. When connected, it simply pulls down the update while it's opening. </p>
<p> All of that means that, like a native app, unless there's a big change to functionality, users won't need to do much at all to keep things up-to-date. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Not every site or service is available as a Progressive Web App </p>
<p> One final note to be made on progressive web apps is that not every website or service is going to be available. At least not yet. As noted above, Google only just introduced PWAs in 2019. The goal, of course, was to get everybody involved and building the apps so that sites and services would work on any platform. In effect, it was to create a 'code once, release everywhere' platform. But not everybody has gotten on board with that. At least not yet. </p>
<p> Equally important, not every company that has built a PWA, such as Pandora, works with Chrome. The music streaming service does allow the use of Pandora as a PWA in the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge browser. That requires users to navigate to Pandora, tap or click the three-dot context menu, scroll down to apps, and then select an "Install" option. So not every instance of a web app is going to work the same either. </p>
<p> With all of that said, more PWAs are being added on a regular basis. So, where available, the process of installing them on Chrome should stay the same. </p>

<p> How To Download Region-Locked Android Games </p>
<p> Region-locked games on Android may seem like a difficult thing to get your hands on but they really aren't if you know how to acquire them. </p>
<p> The process is fairly easy though it may take a little bit of setup first. You might wonder why you'd want to go through learning how to get access to region-locked games, and that all depends on your taste in games. </p>
<p> Sometimes big games (and smaller indie ones) enter soft launches in other regions. Perhaps you want to play them. This is where this process comes in handy. There are a few steps you need to go through, so let's get to it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to download region-locked Android games </p>
<p> Step 1: Setup a new Gmail account for the country where the game has soft launched </p>
<p> Before you can even access the right content in the Play Store, you will need to first set up a new Gmail account. One that's for the country where the game has just been soft launched. </p>
<p> This requires a little bit of setup but it's not really all that bad. This does have to be a new Gmail account, so what you need to do is start by signing out of Gmail and then going to Gmail.com. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Instead of signing back in, click or tap Create New Account, which will allow you to select where the country is from. Though, that particular step comes a little bit later. </p>
<p> The reason why you want a new account is because you need to end up changing your Google Play country. You're only allowed to do this once a year. So if you do it on your main account, that account will be locked to the country you choose for an entire year. Which you don't want unless you're planning to live there. </p>
<p> Step 2: Download a VPN app with servers for the country you need </p>
<p> After the account is all set up, your next step is to download a VPN. Something like NordVPN would work well. Though, make sure the VPN app you pick has servers for the game you're trying to install. For example, Blade & Soul: Revolution soft launched in Malaysia, so I had to create a new Gmail and set the Google Play country to Malaysia, then get a VPN with Malaysia servers to find the game. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Something like Tunnelbear works pretty well too, as they have servers in places like Singapore, Canada, and many other places. Plus it's free. </p>
<p> Now this step can be a bit tedious because to figure out which VPN you need you need to first know where the game has soft launched. In many cases you will be able to figure this out with a Google search. </p>
<p> After you've figured out the country of release, find a VPN that has servers in that country. Install the VPN, launch it, and go through whatever setup process is likely there within that app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> From there connect to the server you need. </p>
<p> Step 3: Add the new Gmail account to your Android device </p>
<p> This is a pretty straightforward part of the equation. Simply open up the settings on your phone, then scroll and look for accounts. </p>
<p> Tap on that, then scroll and tap Add New Account. Select Google, then just login with the information from the new account you just set up. It should only take a minute to finish this step and then you can move on. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Step 4: Change your Google Play country to match the VPN server you chose </p>
<p> This is really the last step. Aside from actually finding and installing the game. </p>
<p> To change your Google Play country, you'll need the VPN on and connected to the server you need to get the game. For example if you want a game that soft launched in Singapore, then you want to connect to a Singapore server. </p>
<p> Once that's done, open Google Play, change to the new Gmail account you just created and then added to this device. From here, open the slide out menu on the left, then tap on Account. Towards the bottom you should see your country information. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tap on country and change it to the one you need. But remember you can only do this one every 12 months. So make sure you select the right one or you'll have to go through this whole process from the beginning. </p>
<p> Once your country is changed, go back to the main page of the Play Store and search for the game you want. Then install it and that's it. Now you can play the region-locked game. </p>
<p> How to play the region-locked Android games you've downloaded </p>
<p> In most cases you should be able to play the game without any problems. Meaning you should be able to connect the game to your normal, main Google account and not be connected to a server in the country where the game has soft launched. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This isn't always the case though. Call of Duty Mobile for example was available in a soft launch outside the US prior to the global release on October 1 of 2019. </p>
<p> It was possible to download the region-locked game, but then you would also need to stay connected to the server of that country while you play. You likely won't run into this often, but it can happen. So keep that in mind. </p>
<p> Generally though, after the game installs from the Play Store properly, you can simply launch it on your local Wifi or mobile data connection, and play with your main Google account. That's all there is to it. Happy gaming! </p>

<p> How To Easily Pin & Access Your Favorite Folders On A Chromebook </p>
<p> Chrome OS gadgets are not the most storage-savvy devices on the market and learning how to pin Drive folders on a Chromebook is, as a result, paramount. </p>
<p> The problems associated with that, of course, are many. Chromebooks may be cloud-based and future-forward, often only offering a minimal 32GB or 64GB storage. But they can also, in some cases, delete locally stored data unexpectedly. That all but forcing users to make use of Google Drive integration and other options for storing data online. </p>
<p> Even though the Chrome OS file management system, tucked in the "Files" application, should look familiar to most who migrate over. It isn't necessarily easier to navigate. Especially since specific folders can't be moved to the home page — the Chrome OS 'desktop' equivalent — or to the dock — or 'taskbar'. Users are, instead, required to navigate the maze of folders created in Drive and representing local partitions. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That's going to be every time a file is needed. So it isn't going to be as intuitive as might be hoped, although the rest of the operating system certainly is. Users have to open up the Files app and navigate around or search to locate files, making it a hassle to rediscover and manage even files that are accessed often. </p>
<p> Thankfully, Google has worked to ensure Chromebook users can pin folders for quicker access and it's made doing so easy. But it isn't a feature that's often advertised and learning how to do pin a folder on a Chromebook isn't intuitive either. </p>
<p> Why would you want quick access to Google Drive folders in Chrome OS? </p>
<p> There are plenty of reasons why a user might want to pin folders for easier access in Chrome OS. The most prominent of those are all going to center around ease-of-access, better organization, and file security. Now, each of those is intrinsically woven into the others, at the end of the day. And that all comes down to how Chrome OS works. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For starters, it's a fairly well-known fact that Chromebooks are low-storage devices that rely heavily on cloud storage. The Files application does allow users to create their own nested hierarchy of folders to better organize and keep track of everything on-device. But that storage isn't guaranteed. Files saved to Downloads, for instance, are deleted automatically when space runs low. And there are reports that other files on-device can be too in the worst-case scenarios. </p>
<p> Google Drive is also a nested hierarchy of folders. And it will serve as the easiest fix for most users since it is extremely well-integrated into the Files app. Nested folders aren't always the best way to find things, especially when there are dozens or hundreds of folders to manage. </p>
<p> While not applicable to every user, most users will predominantly use just a few locations in the storage partition. Or in Drive for that matter. But finding those folders each and every time is a very real pain point. It can feasibly mean minutes wasted searching every single time the File system is accessed. Using Google Drive is better for file saving. But it isn't any better for rediscovering or quickly moving things around. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The ability to create pinned Google Drive shortcuts represents one of the best solutions for those problems. Not only does that place users' most commonly used locations a single click away. That simultaneously helps users remember and keep the most important files off-device while addressing difficulties associated with organizing files. Safer saving is a click-and-drag away with pinned folders. And so is recovery or use of files when they are needed. </p>
<p> Of course, files and folders can also be made 'available' offline using the Chrome web UI. But that comes with complications of its own. Particularly where spotty connections and ensuring a proper backup are concerned. </p>
<p> So, without further ado, let's take a look at why users would want to pin folders in the Files application on a Chromebook and how to get that done. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Here's how to pin your favorite or most used folders </p>
<p> For the time being, pinning folders only seems to work with Google Drive folders. That might change in the future. It isn't out of the question that Google could add support for other cloud services natively. But, for now, that limitation remains in place. </p>
<p> Navigate to the app launcher in the Chrome OS shelf </p>
<p> Locate and open the Files application </p>
<p> Navigate to the desired folder </p>
<p> Right-click with either a two-finger click or by holding "alt" while clicking — on touch screen devices, an intuitive long-press can be used, just like in Android </p>
<p> Tap or click on "Pin Folder" </p>
<p> After finishing those steps, the folder selected should appear in the directory above "My Files." That directory is separated from others via a dividing line. Chrome OS places folders that users pin on a Chromebook alongside "Recent," "Audio," "Images," and "Videos" directly. More specifically, at the bottom of that list, organized in the order in which they're pinned. </p>
<p> So whichever folder was pinned first, that's the one that will appear at the top. Subsequent pins will follow in order. Those files remain intrinsically linked to Google Drive and represent local temporary directories for the online folder, intermixed with the online storage itself. But for most intents and purposes they can simply be viewed as a link between online and locally stored files. Or as an easy way to edit and manage cloud-stored files. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can remove folders that you pin just as easily on a Chromebook </p>
<p> Removing a pinned folder in Chrome OS is decidedly even more simplistic. That's mostly because users won't need to search for the folders they want to interact with or remove. It'll already be front and center amongst any other folders they have pinned. </p>
<p> Pull up the context menu via either a right-click on the folder or a long-press for users with touch-enabled screens. </p>
<p> Scroll down with either arrow keys or with the mouse and taps or click on the now-apparent "Unpin folder" option. </p>
<p> Chrome will then remove the chosen folder from that location automatically with no further interaction from users. The folder and its contained files do, of course, still exist in the Google Drive cloud. And they can still be found via standard search methods. But it will no longer be accessible in the quick access segment of the Files app's sidebar directory. </p>
<p> Now you can more quickly and easily access your files </p>
<p> Once the steps to pin folders are completed, navigating through the Chrome OS filesystem is much easier. But users should also be aware of a couple of UI quirks in the Chrome OS Files app that can be somewhat misleading. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The folders themselves work just like standard file folders on any desktop platform. Users can click and drag files to the folders or out of the folders. Or they can use keyboard shortcuts to copy or cut and paste the files. Many keyboard shortcuts in Chrome OS, including those, work just like they do on Windows or other desktop platforms. So that can be a much easier way to get the task done. </p>
<p> Google's platform makes it easy to see the progress of those moves when they pertain to the cloud too. But, as with pinning folders and as hinted here, it isn't intuitive. It can be easy to mistakenly think that files are finished. But shutting down before they've completely transferred can create problems of its own, forcing the system to constantly try and sync the files later on — unable to recognize that the process has already finalized. </p>
<p> In those latter cases, a factory reset using a powerwash is often the only answer. While not difficult, that resets the device to an 'as-new' state. So files can be lost in the process. So it's a good idea to cover how the syncing UI works as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In the Files app, while files are moving to the cloud, it's worth noting, a new card-style UI will appear. That's there to ensure users know that, when, and where the files are being moved. The first card to appear does only that and it only shows the movement locally. It absolutely does not represent the completion of the file being moved over to the cloud. That appears on a second card. </p>
<p> After the first card disappears, a separate card appears for syncing. The card denotes its purpose explicitly so that users can see what the system is doing. That way users can see when their files have been safely backed up to Google Drive. The card, like the one for the movement itself, comes complete with a figure representing how many operations remain to be completed. It also showcases a percentage to give some indication of the time remaining for the move. </p>
<p> Once the move is complete, the card will switch over to one showing that's the case. After just a few moments, that card will disappear too. Users should be aware that a short delay can happen between the cards showing or disappearing. So it's a good idea to watch for the UI changes while interacting with files to move them around. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / How To Enable/Disable Dark Mode In Google Docs, Sheets, & Slides </p>
<p> How To Enable/Disable Dark Mode In Google Docs, Sheets, & Slides </p>
<p> Google recently launched a dark mode option for its Docs, Sheets, and Slides apps, and how to turn them on and off is easier than you'd think. </p>
<p> Dark mode for all its wonders, is of course not to everyone's tastes. And that's ok. Personally though, I prefer it as it's less harsh on my eyes. I'm already staring at a bright PC monitor all day. So I don't need the blinding light from a totally white phone screen too. </p>
<p> If you're like me and tons of other users and prefer dark mode in your apps, here's how to get dark mode set up in these ones from Google's G Suite offerings. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to enable/disable dark mode in Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides </p>
<p> In many cases you may not need to enable dark mode if you're using a device with Android 10 or above. This is because in these newer versions of Android you can enable dark mode as a system default. </p>
<p> Which changes the theme of plenty of apps even before the dark mode option is baked into the app itself. If you don't have your system default theme set to dark mode though, then you have to set each app to dark on an a separate basis. </p>
<p> And now Docs, Sheets, and Slides offer that capability </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> First things first, make sure you're on the latest version of the apps </p>
<p> You'll need the latest version of the app for the dark mode theme to be accessible. Most users should have the update available, but if you're not sure whether or not you're already on it you can check. </p>
<p> Go to your settings, tap on the apps section, then look for and tap on Docs. From there tap on the advanced dropdown which should be at the bottom, and then the version number is at the bottom of this extended segment. </p>
<p> It should say version 1.20.282.03.40. If you're on that version of the app then you should be able to enable dark mode separately from the system. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Open Docs, Sheets, or Slides </p>
<p> Once you know you're on the latest versions of these apps, open whichever one you want to switch to the dark mode theme. </p>
<p> Tap the hamburger menu in the left side of the search bar at the top of the app UI. Then scroll and tap on settings. Theme will be the very top option you can select, and your dark mode option will be in there. </p>
<p> When you tap on themes you should see system default, light, and dark. Tap dark to enable dark mode and you're done. Alternatively, tap light to change it back to light mode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's also an option to view documents or spreadsheets in the light theme if your app or system default is set to dark mode. This will let you view that specific document in light mode but keep the app set to dark. </p>
<p> If this is the case, simply tap on any document or spreadsheet and then tap the overflow menu (the three dots in the top right corner). The option will be right at the top. </p>
<p> Keep in mind you will need to set the themes for each of these apps separately. The good thing is the option to enable dark mode is in the same spot in each app. So open hamburger menu, tap, settings, then tap theme. Dark mode will be there with the other two options. </p>

<p> How To Enable VoLTE On OnePlus 8 </p>
<p> VoLTE or Voice over LTE is not a new technology, but it available on your OnePlus 8 smartphone to enable. </p>
<p> One of the main advantages to using VoLTE for phone calls is that you're going to get better sounding audio on the other end. And you also get better coverage. Since LTE networks are more up-to-date and bigger than traditional voice networks. Basically what this means is that you're going to notice a huge difference in the quality of voice calls once you enable it. </p>
<p> Now, VoLTE should be enabled by default on the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro, but you can still enable it if you need to. And here's how you can do it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to enable VoLTE on OnePlus 8 </p>
<p> Firstly, you need to head into the settings app. </p>
<p> Now tap on WiFi & Network, which should be the first option. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Next, tap on SIM & Network. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Then flip the switch next to VoLTE. It should be the first option, and under the "Enhanced Communications" section on this page. </p>
<p> And that's it, for turning on VoLTE. It's just that easy. </p>
<p> What is VoLTE? </p>
<p> You might be wondering what VoLTE is and why you would want to turn it on. Well, as we explained already, it allows you to make and receive calls over the data network, LTE in this case. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> By using LTE to make calls, you're going to experience better sounding calls, as it can use HD Voice better than a traditional voice network can. Traditional voice networks run on 1XRTT, which is a really old network, and really hasn't been improved on in decades. So it's fairly limited in what it can actually do. </p>
<p> Every major carrier supports VoLTE, so you might as well take advantage of it. And with everyone having unlimited data as an option now, you won't need to worry about it using up your data. Though it wouldn't anyways. As that is counted as minutes and not towards your data plan. </p>
<p> As mentioned, VoLTE should be enabled by default on the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro. But if for some reason it is not, you do have the option to enable it. And you can also remove it from the status bar, if you prefer a cleaner looking status bar on your OnePlus 8 smartphone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OnePlus 8 does also support VoIP, which is the same thing, but over WiFi instead of LTE. And this is great if you're in an area where your carrier doesn't have great signal. </p>

<p> How To Get Started With GeForce NOW On Chromebooks </p>
<p> If you want to get started with GeForce NOW, NVIDIA's game streaming platform, Chromebooks are the easiest way to do that, so we're going to run through how to get that all up and running. </p>
<p> The process is really rather simple and just requires that you have a few things in place first. The most obvious being that you need to have a Chromebook for this work. Since this is a guide about Chromebooks. </p>
<p> Generally, this will work with just about any Chromebook that was released after June of 2016. So long as it's on Chrome OS version 77 or later. If you have a new Chromebook then this won't be an issue. Aside from the Chromebook itself you need two more things. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to set up GeForce NOW on Chromebooks </p>
<p> Get the necessary accessories </p>
<p> Once you have the Chromebook, you'll want to have an accessory for the controls. While you could technically use the touchpad on the laptop, this won't provide anywhere near the best experience and NVIDIA doesn't recommend it. </p>
<p> I wouldn't either. I played World of Warcraft on my very first laptop for a couple years, much of the time using the touchpad due to the convenience of not having to carry around a mouse, and it's utterly abysmal. Believe me, you want a mouse or a controller. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That being said, a mouse or a controller will work just fine. Chose the peripheral that suits you best. If you're partial to mouse and keyboard, get a decent enough mouse for the games you play and just plug it in. </p>
<p> If you prefer a controller, then you have a wide set of options here too. Any controller that connects through Bluetooth should work just fine. Such as the DualShock 4, the Xbox One Wireless controller, or something like the Razer Junglecat. </p>
<p> You could also use controllers that will plug in to the USB ports. Though, if you're using the Pixelbook Go like myself, then you'll a controller that has a USB-C connection as the Pixelbook Go only has USB -C ports. </p>

<p> Navigate to the website in your Chrome browser </p>
<p> The beauty of GeForce NOW on Chromebooks is that it doesn't need the application installed like it does on other devices such as PC, Mac, or Android. </p>
<p> You just have to point the browser in the right direction. On a related note, this is big for GeForce NOW as a whole. Because now that it works in the browser (just like Stadia), NVIDIA can move on to making this work for non-Chromebook devices. </p>
<p> With that out of the way, open Chrome and navigate to play.geforcenow.com and that should take you straight to the membership page or to the main login page for GeForce NOW on Chromebooks. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you don't have a membership, you should end up getting prompted to sign up for one. you can choose the free tier, or the founders tier. I recommend the founders tier which is $5 a month, as you get Ray Tracing and priority access with a much longer play session time. </p>
<p> There's even a deal going on right now where you get GeForce NOW for six months plus some extra rewards for Hyper Scape. One of the newest games on GeForce NOW. This deal is limited though, and won't last forever. It's also a bit cheaper than paying for GeForce NOW month by month. So it really is a great deal. </p>
<p> Find a game and click to play </p>
<p> After you get logged in, the process is pretty much the same as it is on Android, PC, or Mac. Scroll through the list of games and find one you want to play, the click. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Keep in mind that you will need to own the game on the storefront that it's tied to. Some are linked to Steam while some are linked to the Ubisoft launcher and others. You'll be asked to login to those stores. After which the game should launch. </p>
<p> One downside with GeForce NOW on Chromebooks is that you don't have access to things like Game Sync. This is a feature that launched not long ago and makes it way easier to find Steam games which are compatible with GeForce NOW. </p>
<p> You may want to launch GeForce NOW and initiate the Game Sync feature. This will link your Steam library to your GeForce NOW library. If you can that is, since you need a PC to utilize this as it's not available via Chromebook yet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> By doing this, any compatible Steam games should show up on the Chromebook. Making it simpler to find stuff to play. </p>
<p> Aside from that, you can still search for games and see if they're available. Or just browse through the list of featured games to find one you want to play. The click play and and you're off and running. </p>
<p> That's really all there is to it. NVIDIA made the process pretty simple and took out the step of having to install anything. Such as the GeForce NOW app from the Play Store. </p>

<p> How To Get Rid Of The Google Meet Tab In Gmail For Android </p>
<p> Google has decided to start bringing Google Meet (as well as Google Chat) into the Gmail app for Android and iOS. This is after Google decided that people wanted more apps, now they are putting them all into the same app. </p>
<p> But we all already know Google has no idea what it wants to do with messaging and video chatting apps, and that's a conversation for another day. </p>
<p> What we want to go over today, is how to get rid of that Google Meet tab that now appears at the bottom of the Gmail for Android app. It also appears on iOS, and on the left-side of the Gmail web app. Google's idea here was to make it easier to start a meeting. Since we spend loads of time in our email already, it was a logical place to put it. But it takes up a lot of space on the Gmail app, and most of us don't need it. So here's how you can get rid of it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How To Get Rid Of The Google Meet Tab In Gmail For Android </p>
<p> Open the Gmail app on your Android device. </p>
<p> Now open the hamburger menu on the left side of the device. </p>
<p> From there, scroll down to the Settings, and tap on that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Next, you're going to choose the email account that you want to remove the Meet tab from. </p>
<p> Now, scroll down to the "Chat & Meet" portion of the settings. (Note: on the screenshot below, it only shows "Meet" because it is not a G Suite account, on G Suite accounts, you should see "Chat & Meet). </p>
<p> The first option will say "Show the Meet tab for video calling". Uncheck that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And that's it. Now that Meet tab is going to be gone. It makes more sense to keep it in the web app though, since that is where you are most likely going to do most of your video chats anyways. </p>

<p> How To Use Google Nearby Share </p>
<p> Google's AirDrop clone, Nearby Share is finally here. And it is available for all devices running Android 6.0 or later. Which effectively means that everyone with an Android device has Nearby Share now. </p>
<p> But how exactly do you use it? Well it's pretty simple. And that's kind of the whole point of Google introducing this new feature. Especially since it is rolling out to virtually every single Android device on the planet, and not being an Android 11 feature – as we once thought. </p>
<p> Where is Nearby Share? </p>
<p> Nearby Share lives in the Share sheet, naturally. So you would access it just like you would to copy a link, or share to Twitter, etc. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There will be a button that lives next to the "Copy" button on the share sheet, that you can tap to get started. </p>
<p> Another way to get started is scrolling down in the share sheet and finding "Nearby Share" in the apps list. Or, you can add the Nearby Share toggle to your quick settings too. </p>
<p> So there's three ways to get started here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How do I use Nearby Share? </p>
<p> Tap on Nearby Share in any of the three ways we mentioned above. </p>
<p> From there, you will see a new screen that will ask you to adjust settings before turning on Nearby Share. These include your device's name, which you can change there. As well as Device Visibility. </p>
<p> There are three options for Device Visibility. You can opt to have it show to all of your contacts – of course, only those that are actually near you will get the notification. You can also choose "Some Contacts" and hit the toggle for each contact in your list. Or choose hidden. No one will see your device, except those that have Nearby Share open already, and waiting on a file. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> After you've adjusted your settings, tap on "Turn On". It's the blue button in the lower right-hand corner. </p>
<p> Now, Nearby Share is on and looking for nearby devices. </p>
<p> Devices that are nearby will see a notification saying that a device nearby is sharing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once the user of that device taps the notification, you will see it appear on your device – it'll show the persons name and their Google profile picture. So you know you are sharing with the right person. </p>
<p> Tap on that picture. Then the other person needs to accept the transfer. </p>
<p> Once that is done, it will automatically send over the file, link or whatever you are trying to send. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There seems like there's a lot of steps, but after the first run, it's pretty easy to do. And it's seamless which is really nice. </p>
<p> The good thing about this is that people won't be spamming you with stuff, like we see quite a bit with AirDrop actually, especially among teenagers. Both the sender and receiver have to confirm the transfer before it actually works. </p>

<p> How To Use Google One To Backup Your Android Smartphone </p>
<p> Many of you may not know, but you can back up your Android phone to the cloud, using Google One. And we're going to show you how to do that. </p>
<p> Google One is a somewhat new service that Google debuted a couple of years ago. It basically takes the 5GB of space they gave you for Gmail, Google Photos and Google Drive each, and combined it into one service. </p>
<p> Every user gets 15GB of space that can be used for Gmail, Google Photos or Google Drive. But it can also now be used to backup your phone. If you want, or need some more space, you can upgrade to 100GB for just $1.99 per month, or 200GB for $2.99 per month. And if you buy a Pixel (or select other Android phones) you can get three months of Google One for free. After those three months, you can then get the same plan for half off, so $0.99 for 100GB sounds really nice. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What data does Google One Backup? </p>
<p> Google One isn't going to back up everything that's on your phone. But it will backup some of the necessities. You can choose to have it back up Device Data, Multimedia Messages and Photos & Videos. These are granular, so you can choose to back up one and not the others if you wish to do so. </p>
<p> The "device data" is basically the data that is not messages, photos and video. Google is pretty vague in what that backs up. </p>
<p> How to backup your Android phone with Google One? </p>
<p> To get started backing up your Android phone to Google One, you'll want to install the Google One app. This should be pre-installed on virtually every Android smartphone. But if not, you can grab it from Google Play. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, you should see a card on the "home" screen of the app, that says "Set Up Data Backup". Click on that. </p>
<p> Now it is going to ask you to select your options. So you can choose what you want backed up, and then hit "Back up now". </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And that's it. It's just that simple to back up your Android phone to the cloud. </p>
<p> Now, if you are looking to retrieve a backup, simply hit the "Storage" tab at the top of the app screen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can scroll down and see when your last backup was. You can opt to back it up now if you wish to do so. But if you scroll down further you'll see "Previous Device Backup" tap on the "Get Backup" button to the right of that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There it will show you what was backed up, and allows you to restore it, if you wish. </p>
<p> And that's how you can backup and restore your Android phone using Google One. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2020/09/how-to-group-tab-google-chrome.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484787" filename="how-to-group-tab-google-chrome.html">
<p> How To Use The Tab Groups Feature In Google Chrome </p>
<p> Google Chrome is one of the most popular browsers around but it's also easy to get disorganized when a lot of tabs are open. That's at least partially because the UI that's shown on tabs, including labels, just gets smaller as more tabs are open. Eventually, only the tab icon is shown. So opening a lot of tabs isn't the easiest way to use Chrome but its easy to learn how to create tab groups and overcome that. </p>
<p> There are some missing features to be aware of, first and foremost </p>
<p> The biggest drawback to Chrome tab groups is that they are only working on desktop platforms. That means, at least for the time being, users will need to be in Chrome for Windows, Mac, Linux, or Chromebooks to use them. On Android, a different iteration of tab grouping is in the works. But this guide, based on current iterations of that, won't work for that platform at all. </p>
<p> Once Android tab grouping becomes available, this guide will be updated to include that process. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are still some missing features that have previously been spotted in development too. That includes the ability to collapse groups. Being able to do that frees up more space and makes the feature much more useful. But presently requires an experimental setting to activate. So we'll discuss that process as well. But that won't necessarily be widely available for everybody and will require extra steps to accomplish. At least for now. </p>
<p> Another feature that could potentially make its way to tab groups in Chrome is pinning. Pinning, in its current iteration, only works for tabs themselves. That hasn't been spotted in development for Chrome just yet. But it could bring a completely different level of multitasking and organization to the platform. So it wouldn't be too surprising to see that arrive at some point as well. </p>
<p> Group your Chrome tabs for better productivity and convenience </p>
<p> The feature in question is primarily geared toward productivity. But could come in handy for just about anybody who has a tendency to open too many tabs. In effect, the feature ensures that it's easier to locate tabs when so many are open that the icons alone don't make much sense. Or when tabs aren't necessarily opened for the same purpose. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For instance, a user might have a bunch of tabs open for work on their personal machine. They might also have entertainment tabs and other open for home improvement projects or general searches. With tab grouping, those can all be tied together visually. </p>
<p> It also helps where Chrome will automatically boot up with the last open window, such as on a Chromebook. Especially since multiple windows won't reload the same way. All the tabs can be organized and grouped in the same window, rather than forcing users to keep multiple windows running at once. </p>
<p> To create your first tab group in Chrome; </p>
<p> Open Google Chrome on a desktop, laptop, or Chromebook </p>
<p> Navigate to a page — our example uses AndroidHeadlines.com </p>
<p> Open any further Chrome tabs that need to be moved into their own group. Using the "plus" icon or pressing 'Ctrl + T' are the easiest methods </p>
<p> Navigate those tabs to the desired URL via the URL Omnibox </p>
<p> Right-click on the first tab that needs to be moved to a group. On Chrome OS that will be accomplished with a two-finger click or by holding the 'Alt' key while clicking. Conversely, touch screen users can simply long-press on the appropriate tab. </p>
<p> Select "Add tab to new group" </p>
<p> Once a new Chrome group has been created, a colored dot will appear to the left of the tab. A colored line will also appear underneath any tabs within that group. But that won't be completely customized just yet. Users can rename the Chrome tab group for easier discovery. And they can recolor it to their liking to give groups even more distinction too. Fortunately, learning how to do so is fairly straightforward. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To customize the tab group; </p>
<p> Click or tap the colored dot next to the grouped Chrome tab — the default color is grey </p>
<p> Click or tap the text field located within the newly-presented card UI </p>
<p> Type a name for the tab group. In our example, the group has been renamed 'work' </p>
<p> Select a color for the new group. Red was selected in our example to denote the importance of the group </p>
<p> Click or tap anywhere else to close the UI </p>
<p> From that same menu, it's also possible to create a new tab within the group. The card UI should remain open even after selecting a color, allowing users to alter the customizations to their liking without having to re-select the group. But creating a new tab will close the UI so users will need to select the tab group again for further adjustments. </p>
<p> It's also easy enough to move tabs that are already open to a present group. Or to create a new group from an opened tab. When right-clicking on a tab that's already grouped, Google gives users the option to move that tab to a new group. But creating a new group can also be accomplished from the right-click menu, just as in the steps above, as shown in our next series of guide images. </p>
<p> To place ungrouped tabs in an existing group; </p>
<p> Right-click or long-press on an existing tab that isn't in a group already </p>
<p> Select "Add tab to group" from the subsequent menu </p>
<p> Choose an existing Chrome tab group — or create a new group </p>
<p> OR </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Click and drag ungrouped tabs between grouped tabs </p>
<p> Finally, in addition to being able to create new tabs directly, injecting them into a tab group without the need for extra menus. Users can also close all tabs in the group or ungroup the tabs at a click. That's all found directly in the same group menu used for customizations. Conversely, it's possible in that same menu to move all tabs in a group to a new window directly. </p>
<p> To disband, close, or move grouped tabs to a new window; </p>
<p> Select the tab group that needs to be adjusted </p>
<p> "Ungroup" will keep all of the tabs within the group open but will remove each of those tabs from being grouped </p>
<p> "Close group" closes all tabs within a group and the group itself will be removed as well </p>
<p> Selecting "Move group to new window" will open a new Chrome window, copy the tab group to that window, and remove the tab group from the current window. The new window will also be brought to the forefront </p>
<p> Collapse your Chrome tab groups to save space </p>
<p> Another noteworthy feature of tab groups in Chrome is the ability to collapse those but how to accomplish that isn't immediately going to be clear. That's because Google hasn't officially provided any way for users to do it yet. The feature is still under development. This guide will be updated with the appropriate steps once it does go official. </p>
<p> In the meantime, it is possible to collapse tabs right now by enabling an experimental flag setting in Chrome. That flag is available in Stable Channel Chrome across the board though. So it isn't too complicated and can be accomplished by just about any user who wants to try it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To get to the experimental flag settings and activate the appropriate tab group collapsing setting; </p>
<p> Open Chrome </p>
<p> Navigate to 'chrome://flags' </p>
<p> Click or tap in the search bar located at the top of the page </p>
<p> Type "Tab Groups Collapse" and hit "enter." Chrome will sort the appropriate setting from the rest and highlight it. </p>
<p> Tap or click the drop-down menu to the right of the setting and select "Enabled" </p>
<p> Tap or click on the blue-colored "Restart" button at the bottom-right-hand side of the browser window </p>
<p> From there, collapsing Chrome tab groups is straightforward; </p>
<p> Follow the above steps required to create one or more tab groups. Assigning titles and colors here will help distinguish between them when they're collapsed </p>
<p> With the Chrome tab group expanded, tap or click on the tab group header — in our example, labeled "work." That will collapse the entire group of tabs under the single tab-like group label. The color and title for that group will remain visible </p>
<p> Tap or click on the tab group header once more to expand the tabs out again, making all of the contained tabs visible. </p>
<p> The final noteworthy point to be made is that editing tab groups no longer work as it did before once collapsing is enabled. Instead of a simple click, users will need to right-click on a given tab in order to edit the name, color, and other options in that menu. Additionally, if the only tabs created are in a single tab group, the group won't collapse on-tap or on-click. Additional ungrouped tabs or groups must be created before tabs can be collapsed. </p>
<p> Those are small differences but did take some experimentation to find while writing this guide. As always, that's going to be a two-finger click or "alt" click on Chromebooks. Or a long-press on touchscreen devices. </p>

<p> How To Manage Your Google Photos Memories & AI Creations </p>
<p> Google Photos has been a solid offering for uploading and saving photos since its 2015 launch. And its Memories feature only made that better when it launched last year. As might be expected, Memories in Google Photos is a feature, driven by AI, that crops up photos from the user's past. </p>
<p> The artificial intelligence utilizes machine learning to recognize not only places — for example a vacation spot or your home town. That would be easy enough to accomplish. It also recognizes specific objects or "things." It can pick out when you take pictures at a zoo. Or at a park, museum, during a holiday, or of the sky, a campfire, flowers, or a specific animal. </p>
<p> Perhaps best of all, it can recognize when you've taken photos of a person and who that person is — allowing users to self-identify the person if it doesn't quite catch them for sorting. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Memories, cycling back around, takes advantage of that to surface images that the AI thinks users will want to see. It typically displays those at the top on the main page, based on dates. So it will surface photos from a given week from previous years, allowing users to relive those memories. But it should probably go without saying that's not always a good thing. </p>
<p> Google Photos Memories are great when they work and when they're wanted </p>
<p> Now, it's also possible for the Google Photos Memories feature to surface content users wouldn't want to see. Or, at the very least, wouldn't want to be reminded of as frequently as the feature tends to update. And there are a wealth of reasons why that might be the case. </p>
<p> A user may hope to avoid seeing pictures of a pet, relative, or friend. For example, if they're deceased and the death was recent and still too fresh or if they've simply fallen out. Or, conversely, they may want to avoid seeing pictures of their now-ex-significant other. For instance, if that person happens to be in a lot of photos of other individuals, pets, or memories that are worth holding onto. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A co-worker or former coworker might crop up in photos for similar reasons. Or the system might associate individuals with a capture that the user shot of their food. Which only just happened to catch a friend, family member, pet, or something else in the background. </p>
<p> The reasons a person might not want to see certain memories surfaced are going to vary quite a lot from person to person. And the reasons for not wanting to just delete the photos outright will stretch across just as many reasons. </p>
<p> Of course, a person might also just want to manage what's surfacing for reasons entirely unrelated. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Fortunately, the process of adjusting how and what the Google Photos Memory feature surfaces are far less complicated. In fact, it's going to be outright easy to accomplish with some exploration of the UI. Here, we'll step through the different ways Google Photos Memories can be managed. Including notification management, in case anybody just wants to stop those but not everything else. </p>
<p> Here's how to adjust what Google Photos Memories show </p>
<p> Google Photos only shows Memories on the mobile platform. So it goes without saying this is a feature that can only be adjusted in the Google-built app. </p>
<p> For those who use browser apps or desktop to access Google Photos, it doesn't appear on those. And it also can't be adjusted in those. So users will need to navigate to the mobile app to get started. And they'll need to start by downloading the app if they don't already have it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once the app is installed, each of the features we'll be discussing here starts with the same basic process; </p>
<p> Open up Google Photos </p>
<p> Tap on the profile icon at the top-right-hand side of the UI </p>
<p> Select "Photos settings" from the resulting card UI </p>
<p> Choose the "Memories" option from the resulting sub-menu </p>
<p> Which memories do you want to feature, if any, to begin with? </p>
<p> Now, the first option for those who don't want to have Memories surface in Google Photos is going to be to simply turn that off. And users can do that individually or entirely by navigating to the "Featured Memories" segment of the above-mentioned Memories menu. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are three options and each is self-explanatory, with its own toggles for turning the features on or off. All of the toggles are "on" by default. </p>
<p> First is "Previous years" and that shows photos from the current week, years ago. That's followed by "Recent highlights," showcasing images saved over the past few weeks. Last, "Themed memories" are also toggleable. Those show photos about specific people, places, or things, as defined in the "Search" tab of the app. </p>
<p> Navigate to "Featured memories" </p>
<p> Toggle on or off any featured types that aren't wanted </p>
<p> To turn them all off, simply toggle off all of the switches in the Featured memories menu </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Hiding people and pets </p>
<p> Of course, users can also engage in more granular control over how memories are presented. And that includes controlling whether specifically-identified people or pets show up in Memories. </p>
<p> Navigate to "Hide people & pets" </p>
<p> Google will automatically hide some photos, particularly where people and pets haven't been explicitly identified. Scroll to make sure that there's no unwanted hiding going on by default </p>
<p> Tap or click on a thumbnail to hide or show the desired subjects in Memories </p>
<p> Hidden subjects are denoted by a slashed-out eye-shaped icon </p>
<p> Hiding specific dates </p>
<p> To hide specific dates is a similar process to hiding specific people or pets. But it's not exactly the same due to the fact that it's a more precise filtering mechanism. The reasons a user might choose to hide specific dates are going to be even more widely varied. But the process will be the same regardless. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Navigate to "Hide dates" </p>
<p> There is no automatic filtering for dates so users who have not set this up will see a brief description and a "Add dates" button. As dates are added, the button stays firmly planted. So there won't be any reason to scroll down unless users want to remove a date filter </p>
<p> Tap the Add date button </p>
<p> Select a start and stop date. The UI here works like date selection effectively anywhere in Android. Users can swipe through months or select the drop-down menu to pick a year first. Simply tapping on any date will select it as the start date. Selecting a second time will select the end date. Any photos that fall within the selected time frame will no longer be shown </p>
<p> To remove a date, simply click the "x" icon next to the desired date </p>
<p> To let the AI create things to showcase …or not </p>
<p> Last but not least, Google Photos also allows users to stop AI-created content from appearing in the feed. That includes Collages, Animations, Color Pop photos, and Stylized photos. Google Assistant, as it's been built into Photos, creates those on a fairly regular basis. While they can be stunning and fun, they aren't always. But the feature can actually be controlled and it's not just an on/off thing either. </p>
<p> Navigate to "Advanced." Google presents each of the above-mentioned options as its own toggle. </p>
<p> As with Memories itself, these features can each be toggled individually. So if users like Animations but not Collages, the latter option can be toggled to turn those off. Or these can be turned off entirely on every option. </p>
<p> Manage the notifications that Google Photos Memories generate </p>
<p> Now, sometimes Google throws out the Photos Memories feature as a notification. And, that can, arguably, be even worse since not everybody wants to see some of the memories it surfaces. Let alone when those memories are being thrown out in an apparently random fashion. </p>
<p> Conversely, turning off notifications to the entire app seems a bit drastic. A bit like throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Google Photos notifications can be useful. For example, where shared albums are concerned and when those are auto-populated using AI, the app sends a notification to inform users that a new photo has been added. </p>
<p> Otherwise, they'd be stuck navigating to the shared photo feed by chance. And potentially miss some great photos for an extended period of time. </p>
<p> Since turning off all of the notifications at the Android level isn't really a viable solution, then, it's a good thing that Google Photos allows granular control over notifications specifically from Memories. </p>
<p> To find those is as straightforward as anything else here. </p>
<p> Navigate to the Memories menu using the steps at the beginning of this guide and tap the "Notifications" option </p>
<p> Google presents users with notification controls across no fewer than five categories. All of which are laid out with their own subheadings and with toggles for individual settings within the categories </p>
<p> Notifications for "Sharing" and "Printing" are fairly self-explanatory. The former notifies users when they have new photos that the AI deems worthy of sharing. The latter is notifications about Google's print services for photos </p>
<p> Google also presents users with options for managing their library, including photo fixes and archiving suggestions </p>
<p> Under the "Other" subheading, users will find device-level and e-mail notification toggles </p>
<p> For Memories, Google explicitly lets users toggle off memory notifications about "Previous years," "Themed memories," and new AI-generated "Creations" </p>

<p> SmartThings Classic Is Discontinuing; How To Migrate To The New App </p>
<p> Samsung is discontinuing the SmartThings Classic app on October 14, 2020. It will no longer be usable starting that date. You won't be able to access or use the app to create and manage routines, the Lock Code Manager, and the Smart Home Monitor. In simpler terms, it will lose all of its smartness. </p>
<p> You'll have to migrate to the new SmartThings app to continue using routines and other smart features. The new app offers most of the same features as the Classic version but with a new and improved interface. It also brings more powerful automation features, a massive device ecosystem, and much more. </p>
<p> To ensure that you don't lose any of your SmartThings Classic routines, Lock Code Manager, and Smart Home Monitor data, you'll have to migrate to the new app before October 14th. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to migrate your data. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to migrate from SmartThings Classic to the new SmartThings app </p>
<p> Migrating to the new SmartThings app involves a few simple, easy-t0-follow steps. Open the SmartThings Classic app on your smartphone. You'll see a prompt that reads "Migrate This Location Now" at the top. Tap on that banner. </p>
<p> Now swipe left through the four slides explaining the migration process and tap on "Migrate now." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Wait until the migration process completes then tap "Next". You'll see a banner saying "Migration of Home was successful," where Home is the name of the location. There will be two options – "Not right now" and "Get the new SmartThings" – below. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you have multiple locations in your SmartThings account, tap on "Not right now" and repeat the above steps for each location. Once you finish migrating all your SmartThings locations, tap on "Get the new SmartThings." </p>
<p> Next, you'll be prompted to download the new SmartThings app. If you already have the new app installed, tap on "Got it" or tap on the Google Play button to download the app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now open the new app, grant the required permissions, and you're all set. You've successfully migrated all your data from the SmartThings Classic to the new SmartThings app. Make sure that you sign in with the same Samsung account you were using in the Classic app. </p>
<p> It might take you some time to get used to the new UI. Here are a few things to remember: </p>
<p> Routines are now Scenes and Automations. </p>
<p> Smart Home Monitor is now SmartThings Home Monitor. It can be found under SmartApps which is available from the side menu. </p>
<p> Smart Locks is now Smart Lock Guest Access. </p>
<p> A Lighting Groups menu lets you control multiple lights together. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / How To Open A New File Directly In Chrome – Google Docs, Sheets, Slides & Forms URL Shortcuts </p>
<p> How To Open A New File Directly In Chrome – Google Docs, Sheets, Slides & Forms URL Shortcuts </p>
<p> Google's GSuite offers users a healthily-featured alternative to expensive options such as Microsoft Office. And, it enables users to edit those documents, spreadsheets, slideshows, or even forms on the go. That's thanks largely to the fact that Chrome allows the files to be both created and edited directly from Google Drive. And, of course, that's ignoring the Android and iOS apps for the tools. But it's also possible to create a new file in the Chrome browser with some simple shortcuts. </p>
<p> That holds true for Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and even Forms. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to create a new file in any of those with shortcuts directly entered into the URL Omnibox in Chrome. </p>
<p> First things first, you need Chrome and probably want a new tab </p>
<p> Each of these new file shortcuts will require a new tab in Chrome. If a new tab isn't opened up, users will lose what's already been opened in their current tab. Chrome makes this easy via a quick tap. In the browser, it has placed a "plus" icon on desktop platforms, to the right-hand side of the right-most tab. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tapping on that opens up a fresh tab with Chrome's New Page UI, which will always open to the right-hand side of the right-most tab as well. </p>
<p> Conversely, users can also press and hold the 'ctrl' key while the Chrome window is active and then press the 't' key. Or, if users want a new tab in a new window, users can start by holding the 'ctrl' key and then press 'n'. The former keyboard shortcut will, as implied, open up a new tab on the right-hand side of the right-most tab. The latter will open up a new tab in an entirely new window. </p>
<p> Google Docs New File Shortcuts </p>
<p> Google Docs is the G Suite equivalent of Microsoft's Word program. As a word processor and a web app, it's a powerful tool that allows quick document creation on the go. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As noted above, there are actually several ways to open up a brand new document for each of the document types. Each URL is relatively straightforward but it's worth listing them all out for reference. Typing any of the following URLs into the Google Chrome Omnibox — Chrome's dual-purpose address and search bar — will open a brand new Google Docs document. </p>
<p> docs.new </p>
<p> doc.new </p>
<p> document.new </p>
<p> Google Sheets New File Shortcuts </p>
<p> Google Sheets is the G Suite functional equivalent of Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet creation and editing program. Like Docs, it's a web-based tool geared toward those who need the organizational and data tracking software. But it can be used directly in Chrome and saves directly to Google Drive — or locally, as we'll discuss later on. </p>
<p> Also like Docs, creating a new spreadsheet in Google Sheets via Chrome is straightforward. Users simply need to open a new tab as described above. That's if they don't want to lose the current tab. Then, entering any of the following URLs into the Omnibox address bar will call forward a new Sheets document. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> sheets.new </p>
<p> sheet.new </p>
<p> spreadsheet.new </p>
<p> Google Slides New File Shortcuts </p>
<p> Google Slides is, as might be guessed by now, a G Suite app for creating slideshows — a lot like Microsoft PowerPoint. It's web-based with easy saving in Google Drive or offline. And it's easy to access directly in Chrome via a short URL entry in the Chrome Omnibox address bar once users are in the tab or new tab they want to create the document in. </p>
<p> Entering any of these into the URL box will open a new Google Slides document. </p>
<p> slides.new </p>
<p> slide.new </p>
<p> presentation.new </p>
<p> Google Forms New File Shortcuts </p>
<p> Last but not least is Google Forms. While there really isn't a Microsoft equivalent to speak of here. That's because Forms is a survey administration app. It's used for creating, well, forms. That includes survey-type forms that can be created for filling and shared from — as Google puts it — a "variety of pre-made themes." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Or users can create their own. But in either case, the easiest way to create a brand new form directly in Chrome is to enter any of the following into the URL Omnibox in the browser. </p>
<p> forms.new </p>
<p> form.new </p>
<p> Here's how you can move the files once they've been created </p>
<p> Now, once the G Suite document or other file has been opened using shortcuts in Chrome — and edited — there's one final matter that should be discussed. That's how files that are created this way are saved. </p>
<p> As is the case with all G Suite files, they're typically saved to Google Drive. But that doesn't mean they'll save where users want them when created using URL shortcuts. Instead, Google generally just saves them to Drive without much care for the organization. Getting the files moved to where users actually want them to be stored is easy enough though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For this example, we're using a Google Docs document, but this works with any of the document types mentioned here. </p>
<p> To move a document around: </p>
<p> Rename the document, spreadsheet, slideshow, or form so that it can be found later as needed via a search </p>
<p> Once the UI informs that the changes have been saved to drive, the file will appear in the "My Drive" directory of Google Drive </p>
<p> Click the "Move" icon, shaped like a file folder icon with a right-facing arrow </p>
<p> Navigate to where the file will be kept </p>
<p> Clicking the right-facing chevron arrow will take users through and into individual folders, where those are nested. Clicking the folder icon with a plus inside will create a new folder in the current directory </p>
<p> A toast message will appear at the top, indicating that it was successfully moved </p>
<p> Conversely, users can also make the file available offline immediately simply by navigating the "File" menu shown in the above gallery. Downloads can be saved in a variety of formats for different purposes. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Those file types will vary depending on the G Suite tool in use. But Google does generally offer a variety of extension types. For instance, Google allows Docs files to be saved as Microsoft Word, OpenDocument Format, Rich Text Format, PDF Document, Plain Text, Web Page, or EPUB Publication. Conversely, users can tap or click "Make available offline" to get a quick download that they can take and save offline before uploading it later. </p>

<p> How To Play GeForce NOW Through Chrome On PC </p>
<p> Back in August NVIDIA announced that GeForce NOW was coming to Chromebooks through the Chrome browser, but this isn't limited to Chromebooks as it can be done on PC too. </p>
<p> Better still you can set this up in Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or any browser that uses Chromium as a backbone. All it takes is a little bit of setup to get things going. </p>
<p> That being said, the whole setup process of getting GeForce NOW to work on Chrome via your Windows PC is pretty simple. It doesn't take long and you never have to repeat it. Once you're done, you're done. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Here's how to set up GeForce NOW to work in Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers for your Windows PC. </p>
<p> How to get GeForce NOW working in Chrome for PC </p>
<p> To get things started, first choose which browser you're going to be using with GeForce NOW. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As stated above it'll work with Chrome, but it also works with Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers. Once you have that picked, you need to go the Chrome Web Store and add the User-Agent Switcher For Chrome extension to your browser. </p>
<p> The reason you want this is because you're tricking the browser into thinking that you're playing on a Chromebook when you aren't. </p>
<p> Install that extension to move forward. Then after it's installed either find it in the browser bar, or the extensions menu if you don't have the extension automatically pinned. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Open the options for the User-Agent Switcher extension </p>
<p> Once you have the extension installed, find the options menu. </p>
<p> If you have the extension installed in Chrome, then you're looking for the three-dot menu that sits next to the icon for the extension. If you have the extension pinned, then simply right click the extension icon. </p>
<p> For Edge users, the extension should pin automatically and you can find the extension options menu by right clicking it as well. Click on that and then what you're going to need to do is create a new user-agent string. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Create a new user-agent string </p>
<p> Remember you're creating a new user-agent string to trick the browser into thinking you're playing GeForce NOW on a Chromebook, rather than in Chrome or Edge for Windows. </p>
<p> Once you open the options menu for this extension it will default to the tab where you add new user-agent strings. Start by creating a name, which can be whatever you like. I chose GeForce NOW for Chrome on PC, because that's exactly what we're doing here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The only other things you want to alter are the actual user-agent string (copy and paste Mozilla/5.0 (X11; CrOS aarch64 13099.85.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.110 Safari/537.36 into the entry box), and the indicator flag, which can also be whatever you want. </p>
<p> Again I simply used something referencing GeForce NOW on Chrome and just put in GFN. After that just click the add button and you're almost done. </p>
<p> Add the new user-agent string to the permanent spoof list </p>
<p> This is the last step and then you can get right to playing all the games you want. All without installing the Windows app for GeForce NOW. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Navigate to the permanent spoof list tab, then add the new user-agent string to the list. To do this enter play.geforcenow.com into the domain box. Then you need to switch from the default user-agent string to the new one you created, the click the add button. </p>
<p> From here you can go to the website and play games after logging in. You only have to add this string to the spoof list once. </p>
<p> Log in and play games via GeForce NOW through Chrome or Edge on PC </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You've done it. Your setup to play GeForce NOW games through your browser on PC is complete. So enjoy the fruits of your labor. </p>
<p> Simply go to play.geforcenow.com anytime you want to play games via GeForce NOW and click to play a game and then login with the appropriate account info as you would through the app. </p>
<p> The whole thing from start to finish in getting this ready to go should take you no more than five to ten minutes. And for all that you save yourself from having to install another app just to play games. When this is really an easier method. </p>
<p> Though, it is worth keeping in mind that this may not provide the same experience to the app. And that may vary from person to person. In any case, enjoy having your games through your browser no matter what kind of laptop or desktop you use. </p>

<p> How To Play Xbox Games On Your Android Phone With Xbox Game Pass </p>
<p> Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now includes cloud gaming, which means you can play Xbox games on your Android smartphone or tablet. </p>
<p> You'll need a few things to make sure this works right, but once you meet those requirements you can play many of your Xbox Game Pass favorites on your Android device no matter where you are. </p>
<p> Previously known as xCloud, cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is a great way to experience the future of Xbox. Though, it's only part of Microsoft's vision for that future. If you're not sure how to get Xbox games on your Android device, this guide will walk you through each step. And from here on out, playing Xbox games on your Android device with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate couldn't be any easier. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to play Xbox Games on your Android device using Xbox Game Pass </p>
<p> Eager to play a bunch of awesome Xbox games on your mobile device? We were too. Which is why we wanted to help you get everything set up and ready to go. </p>
<p> Set up an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription </p>
<p> Before you can start diving into your favorite Xbox games, you'll need the subscription. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is $15 a month, so you may want to consider if you're going to be using it for more than just cloud gaming. And if not, then consider whether $15 a month is worth it to you to get cloud gaming on your Android device through Game Pass. </p>
<p> In either case, this will be the first step. You can set up your subscription here if you don't already have one. In addition to cloud gaming, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has a few other benefits too. </p>
<p> You can also use it to play Xbox games on your PC as well as your Xbox console. Assuming you have one of or both of those. One thing to keep in mind is that the PC and console games lists are slightly different than that of the cloud gaming list. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As you'll actually have a few games that can be played on either Xbox One or PC, but not via the cloud gaming option. It also comes with a Xbox Live Gold at no extra charge (normally it's $9.99), and you get additional exclusive perks and discounts. </p>
<p> Choose which Android device to play on and install the Xbox Game Pass app </p>
<p> Xbox Game Pass on Android supports a wide variety of devices. Both smartphones and tablets are included here. It's worth mentioning though that if you have more than one option available to you, give it some thought on which one to use. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Depending on how you plan to play, this may factor in to which device is the best option. For example, the controller you plan to use might be best-suited for a tablet. </p>
<p> If you're using something like the Razer Kishi (or plan to), then you'll need the phone to fit that controller. It will also need to have a centered USB-C port on the bottom and not one that's off-centered. For instance, the ROG Phone II. This has an off-centered USB-C port, so it can't be used with the Razer Kishi unfortunately. </p>
<p> Take these things into consideration, then decide on which device to install the app onto. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sign into Xbox Game Pass on your Android device </p>
<p> Once you have the app installed, launch it and sign into your Xbox account. This should only take a couple of minutes, probably less. </p>
<p> After you've signed in, you're nearly done and will be playing Xbox games in no time. Provided you can settle on one to dive into. There's a pretty large list of options, so choosing might be harder than you think. </p>
<p> At least it always is for me at first. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Connect the controller </p>
<p> Regardless of whatever you're controller you're using, connect it either before you launch the app or after you launch the game. If you launch the game first, it will tell you to connect a controller. If you're using something like the Razer Kishi, simply slot the phone into it and you're good to go. </p>
<p> There's no need for a Bluetooth connection because the controller is technically wired. It plugs directly into your Android smartphone, which is how Razer could achieved giving it ultra-low-latency. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you're using something like the Xbox wireless controller, then connect it to your phone through Bluetooth like you would any other gamepad that you would use with mobile games. Or just like any other Bluetooth device in general. </p>
<p> In this case, you may want to connect the controller first. So you don't have to back out of the app to do so after you launch the game. </p>
<p> Play on Wi-Fi or mobile data </p>
<p> With everything else out of the way, there's not much left to do besides find a game to play and launch it. </p>
<p> There are some other things worth considering though. Think about whether or not you want to play on Wi-Fi or mobile data. You can also set the app to allow game streaming on Wi-Fi connections only. </p>
<p> To get to that setting, launch the app and then tap on your account icon at the bottom. It's the button in the middle of the three. </p>
<p> Then, tap on the settings button in the top right corner. After you're in the settings menu, scroll to the App Settings section and find Network at the bottom of it. Tap on that, and then tap on the toggle for using Wi-Fi only to enable this feature. </p>
<p> This will make it so that you can only play games via the cloud gaming option when you're connected to a Wi-Fi network. Which in turn will be much easier on your mobile data plan. </p>
<p> You can always go back here and toggle this off too. Should you ever want to play games when connected to your mobile connection. You may not always have a Wi-Fi network near by. So this option will be useful from time to time. </p>

<p> Android how to / How To Reinstall, Recover Chrome OS When A Powerwash Isn't Enough </p>
<p> How To Reinstall, Recover Chrome OS When A Powerwash Isn't Enough </p>
<p> Chromebooks are some of the most reliable laptops on the market but that doesn't mean users will never need to reinstall Chrome OS. Unlike many competing operating systems, That won't require navigation of multiple settings menus or long wait periods. Google has made the process nearly painless. It has also gone out of its way to ensure that it requires very little effort or interaction. </p>
<p> In fact, the steps to accomplish a full reinstallation of Chrome OS on any gadget using the operating system is almost entirely automated. That stems, at least in part, from the fact that Chrome OS is tailor-made to work on the devices that utilize it. But it also comes from the fact that Chrome OS has a dedicated tool for recovering. And the system takes care of itself when it comes to using the media that the tool generates. </p>
<p> When to perform a Chrome OS reinstall? </p>
<p> Before getting started, it's important to note that a powerwash is typically enough to fix errors that appear in Chrome OS. That's because, on a Chromebook, the ecosystem is effectively a walled-garden. So users will almost never need to perform a full restart as described in this guide. That absolutely does not mean that no users will ever need to completely reinstall Chrome OS and start over. There are, in fact, at least a few circumstances under which that's actually advisable. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Fatal errors require a Chrome OS reinstall </p>
<p> The most obvious time to reinstall Chrome OS is if it suffers fatal errors. Namely, as with any operating system, sometimes things just go wrong and that makes the system unusable. In those instances, Chrome presents users with an error message. Google fills the screen with a white backdrop, an appropriate error icon, and words to inform users that "Chrome OS is missing or damaged." </p>
<p> If that occurs, users are essentially left with no choice but to reinstall Chrome. </p>
<p> No fix in sight? </p>
<p> Another situation that may present itself, requiring a complete recovery of Chrome OS, is errors that aren't otherwise fixable. That can include any number of problems from file system errors to quirks and bugs. In effect, these are going to be problems noted by users that can't be fixed via online troubleshooters. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google expressly recommends a reinstallation of the OS if they've followed those guides, talked with experts on Chromebook support forums, and tried a powerwash but still notice the errors. Most commonly, experts are only going to recommend recovery in the help forum if no other solution works. It's also a last-resort recommendation since it will clear away any and all local data. </p>
<p> Performing the reset </p>
<p> Installing Chrome OS on a Chromebook is a straightforward process. It's also relatively intensive in terms of its demand for resources. So users will want to plug their device in before starting to prevent problems later on. Bearing that in mind, Google made the process easy and are really only a few steps required. So, without further ado, let's dive into how to reinstall Chrome OS. </p>
<p> Finding and creating a recovery image </p>
<p> The first step to reinstall or recover Chrome OS is to create recovery media. There are two times when that can be accomplished. As is often the case, the best time to create this media is before any errors occur. For this guide, I created the backup using exactly the same Chromebook that it will be used for. But this can be created from any computer with Chrome installed, so it can be used after errors occur on a second computer. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> An SD card or USB flash drive is needed to accomplish this task as well. The tool for creating the recovery media notes that must be 4GB in size or larger. Google itself recommends an 8GB capacity or larger. </p>
<p> Regardless of the platform being used, users must first download and install the recovery app via the Chrome browser. Linux is the sole exception to this step but we'll discuss that later on. Found on the Chrome Web Store as an extension, Chromebook Recovery Utility is an easy to use wizard for creating the reinstallation materials. </p>
<p> Chromebook Recovery Utility can be installed on the Chrome Web Store by clicking the blue "Add to Chrome" button. Once it's been installed, tapping or clicking on the "Launch app" button on that same page will run the wizard. Users can also find and run that by navigating to the three-dot menu at the top-right-hand side of the UI, "More tools," and then "Extensions." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the second page of the recovery tool wizard, the utility presents users with a box to put in their Chromebook model number. That won't be the same as is printed on the box the gadget came in though. So most users will want to utilize the on-page link titled "Select a model from a list" instead. On the resulting page, they'll want to select their device manufacturer and then specific product model from the drop-down lists. </p>
<p> Conversely, following this process on a Chromebook will cause the tool to automatically detect the device in question. That will be shown as a link above the entry field for the model number without the need to use drop-box menus at all. Chromebook Recovery Utility will automatically enter the model number when that link is clicked. </p>
<p> The model number also appears on the error screen that leads to the need for this particular recovery tool. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tapping on "continue," once the model has been selected, will kick off the recovery media creation process. Users select the appropriate drive or card to be erased and formatted with the Chrome OS image. In the examples here, I utilized an SD card. Then the tool will create the recovery media. </p>
<p> It's important to note that creating the media necessarily erases all data on the SD card or flash drive. The SD card or flash drive cannot be used again for any other purpose until it's been formatted. Google's recovery utility does include an option to prepare the storage device for use elsewhere after a reinstallation is performed. That's found behind the gear-shaped settings icon in the Chrome extension. </p>
<p> What about getting a recovery image via Linux? </p>
<p> Linux users must instead navigate to a platform-specific download page. Then, they'll need to change script permissions via the command "$ sudo chmod 755 linux_recovery.sh" before running the script with root privileges. That can be accomplished via the "$ sudo bash linux_recovery.sh" command. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once the resulting on-screen instructions have been followed to create the recovery media, the remaining steps here are the same. </p>
<p> Getting into recovery mode (referencing bottom sections of this… remove this link after) </p>
<p> Now, there's a good chance that anybody who arrived at this guide did so because their Chromebook displayed an error message. Namely, that's an error message that appears during startup or otherwise which reads "Chrome OS is missing or damaged." </p>
<p> Once that error's been spotted, performing a recovery or reinstall in Chrome OS is effectively the only option. The message pushes users through the final recovery steps. Inserting the recovery media SD card or flash drive from that page will automatically launch the appropriate UI and process. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the other hand, users may also simply want to reinstall Chrome OS because they've bought a second-hand gadget and want to start with Chromebook that truly works like new. Or they may want have encountered errors that a powerwash just doesn't fix. If that's the case, Recovery Mode will need to be entered manually. </p>
<p> In either case, users will want to start by backing up any files they want to save — just as they would if they were performing a more straightforward powerwash. Then they'll need to hold down the "ESC" key before also pressing the "Refresh" key. The latter is shaped as a circular arrow in the top row of the keyboard. Then, users need to press the power key to shut off the device before letting go of the power button and continuing to hold down the other two keys. </p>
<p> A message will appear on-screen and then users will need to release the "ESC" and "Refresh" keys. </p>
<p> Chrome OS will present users with a message on their Chromebook. The message will either read "Chrome OS is missing or damaged" or "Please insert a recovery USB stick or SD card." </p>
<p> The process is somewhat different for Chromebox, Chromebit, and tablet users. So users of those devices won't be pressing the "ESC," "Refresh," power button keyboard shortcut listed above. Instead, users will need to press the appropriate hardware keys. </p>
<p> Chromeboxes and other non-laptop or -tablet Chrome OS gadgets, as well as some older Chromebooks, feature dedicated reset buttons. Those are typically found in a recess in the device's frame or build, only accessible via push-pin, paper clip, or similarly-shaped object. </p>
<p> On tablets, users will need to press the physical volume-up, volume-down, and Power keys simultaneously for more than 10 seconds. Releasing the keys will load up the recovery screen. </p>
<p> Follow the wizard </p>
<p> As noted on both the critical "missing" OS screen and the manually-entered recovery mode screen, the next part of this process is exceptionally easy. In fact, Google would be going a bit far to call it a recovery wizard. </p>
<p> To start with, all the user needs to do is insert the recovery media, whether that's installing via an SD card or a USB stick. Chrome OS should automatically detect that media and start the process. Overall, that should take around 10- to 15-minutes from start to finish. The longest portion, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the content verification segment. </p>
<p> After the content has been verified, it will install. Again, the entire process takes around 10-15 minutes typically. It can take longer than that, depending on a variety of factors but it generally won't. </p>
<p> Once the installation is complete, the next step is displayed on-screen. Users need to remove the recovery media drive, whether that's the USB flash stick or the SD card. Once again, Chrome OS will recognize the media has been removed and the entire system should restart. After the Chrome OS gadget has rebooted, it should start up just like a fresh-out-of-the-box Chromebook. </p>
<p> Now, that does mean that users will need to log-in and re-download any files or folders they had backed up prior to the reinstall. That's if the Chromebook had already been in use or if the user is coming over from another Chrome OS gadget. But as long as Chrome is being synced, it should automatically re-apply just about every setting. It should also download just about every app that's already been installed before. </p>
<p> So there really shouldn't be much more effort required than that. </p>
<p> If this Chrome OS recovery/reinstall guide doesn't work… </p>
<p> Errors during recovery with Chrome OS are not likely but also not uncommon. There are effectively two scenarios under which that could happen. The first is if users have any accessories are attached to the Chromebook being recovered during the process. If there are any external keyboards, hard drives, or other accessories hooked up — including SD cards that aren't the recovery media — the process will fail. </p>
<p> In that case, the accessories will need to be unplugged and then the recovery steps will need to be followed again. </p>
<p> The second likely scenario comes down to the recovery media or the device storing that. Namely, that's the SD card or flash drive in question. Some brands and models of those storage devices simply aren't going to work here and that's a somewhat random list. In fact, Google doesn't provide a recommended list at all either of the devices that work best or of those that don't. </p>
<p> If errors occur, users will need to start from creating the recovery media again. But recurring errors will most likely require users to install the media with a different SD card or flash drive. </p>
<p> Finally, if recovery is blocked by a “The security module on this device is not working” message, users will need to contact the Google Support team for assistance with recovery. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / How To Remove Suggested URLs, Search & Files From The Chrome Omnibox </p>
<p> How To Remove Suggested URLs, Search & Files From The Chrome Omnibox </p>
<p> With the arrival of Chrome 83 and Chrome OS 83, it is now possible to remove suggested links, search, and files from the browser's URL Omnibox with a mouse. For clarity, that's the address bar found at the top of the page. And the obscure feature in question, spotted by TechDows outside of the usual update log, applies to the browser's recommendations. Chrome refers to those as autocomplete suggestions. </p>
<p> Those appear when users start to type in the URL box and typically are derived from past history. They appear only while logged into Chrome. For instance, a user might be logged in and accessed a Google Docs file called "Best Phones." Then, they might open a new window or tab and start typing "Best Phones." Chrome will highlight previous pages, files, and searches as quick links. The same happens with regard to photos, files, URLs or websites, locally-stored files, and past searches. </p>
<p> The feature is intended to make it easy for users to get where they've already been. That's without having to navigate the often-complex and overloaded History page. Or without having to access Chrome's deeper, account-related history sites. But that doesn't always work the way users might hope. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sometimes, users have visited a website or opened a file that they don't want to appear in suggestions. And it was previously impossible to remove that without a keyboard shortcut. We'll discuss that shortcut here as well. But that isn't the most intuitive solution. </p>
<p> Now, users can remove suggestions from the Omnibox directly without complicated shortcuts. All that's needed is a mouse click or two after the suggestion appears. So let's dig into how that's accomplished in any version of Chrome after version 83. </p>
<p> With the keyboard shortcuts </p>
<p> Each method for removing a suggestion with the keyboard works in effectively the same way. That is, users will need to start typing in their desired term and then tap the arrow keys to navigate to the suggestion they'd like to remove. The sole exception to that is going to be Chrome for Android. But we'll get to that momentarily. Otherwise, the keyboard shortcut is going to vary based on the platform users are on. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course, users can also stop the predictive suggestions entirely but that will also eliminate Chrome-generated autocomplete suggestions. Users just need to open Chrome, navigate to Settings behind the three-dot menu, and use the on-page search tool to look up "autocomplete." </p>
<p> The requisite settings can be found under Sync and Google services, under the subheading "Other Google services." </p>
<p> On Android </p>
<p> Android, as noted above, is going to work a bit differently. And this same method should work for iOS devices as well. In Chrome for mobile, Google highlights suggestions derived from user activity with a circle-arrow-shaped clock icon. That's found to the left-hand side of the suggestion. To remove the suggestion, users simply need to press and hold on the link they'd like to remove. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Then, Chrome will surface a pop-out card that asks whether or not the suggestion should be removed "from history." </p>
<p> Users have the option to press either "Cancel" or "OK," with each doing precisely what is described. </p>
<p> On Mac </p>
<p> Moving forward, on Mac computers, the keystrokes needed to delete an autocomplete suggestion from the list aren't quite as straightforward as Linux and Windows. Users need to press and hold both the 'Shift' and 'FN' keys and then press "Delete." That will remove the currently-highlighted autocomplete suggestion. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On Windows & Linux </p>
<p> For Windows and Linux, users simply need to hold down the 'Shift' key before pressing 'Delete' after moving the highlighted selection to the suggestion that needs to be removed. </p>
<p> On Chromebooks </p>
<p> Chromebook users need an extra key, which seems to come back to the fact that there is no delete key on a Chromebook or Chrome OS tablet. That means, to delete a highlighted suggestion from autocomplete in the Omnibox, they'll need to first hold both 'Shift' and 'Alt'. Then, tapping on the 'backspace' key will remove that result from the list. </p>
<p> With the mouse </p>
<p> Now, the easiest way to remove a suggested autocomplete result from the Chrome Omnibox is going to be with the mouse. This is the newest method for accomplishing the task and should be fairly obvious to more tech-savvy users. But we'll cover it here anyway for those who aren't quite so tech-savvy or who didn't even know it was possible. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This will work the same way on any desktop iteration of Chrome from Windows through Chromebooks. So users on multiple platforms won't need to learn how to remove a suggested search differently on each one. </p>
<p> Summarily, Google has now added a small 'x' to autocomplete results in the Omnibox drop-down. As might be expected, that applies only to the suggested search results and not for autocompletion results put forward by Google by default. But that small icon does offer up an easy way for users looking for how they can remove unwanted results from appearing as suggestions while they're typing in the search box. </p>
<p> A simple click or tap on that 'x' to the right of the suggested search result will remove it from Chrome. No confirmation required. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What can this remove? </p>
<p> Now, it's worth pointing out that this method won't remove suggestions or recommendations that are put there by Google Search. Namely, those are suggestions that would appear if users were to go to Google.com and then start typing in terms. For instance, if users type in "Why is Chrome so," Google might suggest, "Why is Chrome so much faster than Safari?" </p>
<p> Those types of auto-completion are intended to be helpful and are pooled from a wider net of Google's search audience. But, it will work for previous searches. For instance, if a user has previously searched for "How do I make Chrome faster?" This method will let users stop Chrome from suggesting that term next time they make a similar query. </p>
<p> As noted above, this is also a great way to remove previously-visited links or pages as well as previously opened files such as PDFs, documents, spreadsheets, or images. </p>

<p> How To Completely Replace OnePlus Gallery With Google Photos </p>
<p> The OnePlus Gallery received a whole new design recently, and if you don’t like it, you can replace it with Google Photos. In this article, we’ll show you how to do that, as it’s not that complicated. By doing the following procedure, you’ll even be able to use Google Photos straight from the OnePlus Camera application. In other words, the OnePlus Gallery will cease to be a factor on your OnePlus device altogether, it will be completely disabled. </p>
<p> Completely replace OnePlus Gallery by disabling it </p>
<p> Disabled is the keyword here, as that’s exactly what we’ll do. First, you’ll need to open up your app drawer, and track down the OnePlus Gallery app. At that point, hold your finger on the app, until a pop-up appears, and then tap the ‘App info’ option. Once you do that, you should see the disable option, as shown in the image below. It’s located right between the ‘Open’ and ‘Force stop’ options. Once you tap that, you’ll be warned that some apps may no longer function as intended, as this is a system app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That being said, you shouldn’t have any issues following its deactivation. If you do, you can simply reactivate it and be done with it. That app will still be listed under your apps once you head over to the ‘Settings’ section of your phone. So, don’t worry, this won’t delete it or anything of the sort. Once you confirm the procedure, you’ll be reverted to another gallery on your phone. If you have only OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos installed, Google Photos will be selected immediately. If not, you’ll need to do it manually. </p>
<p> Set Google Photos as your default gallery app, if not set automatically </p>
<p> Head over to ‘Settings’, and scroll down to the ‘Apps & notifications’ section. There you’ll see the ‘Default apps’ menu, enter it. Here you’ll see default apps selected for various different services, from SMS and Music, to Camera and Phone. What we’re looking for is the ‘Gallery App’. Once you spot it, tap on that, and here you’ll be able to select ‘Google Photos’ as your default gallery, if it’s not already selected. If it is, leave it be. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Photos will now be the default gallery on your phone. Once you open the OnePlus Camera, and snap a picture, simply tap the circle in the bottom-right corner to access that image. Google Photos will appear, as OnePlus’ Gallery app is now gone. Now, some of you may wonder, why should I do this? Well, for some people, the reason will be that they simply don’t like the OnePlus Gallery. The app actually looks really good in my opinion, especially after the last redesign. But some of you may disagree. Another reason may be… well, you want to back up your photos to Google Photos, and want to avoid using two gallery apps. </p>
<p> This way, Google Photos will be your main gallery app </p>
<p> This way, you’ll use one app only. Once you delete a picture from Google Photos, it will be gone entirely. That will happen even if you keep the OnePlus Gallery, but… if you use a OnePlus Gallery app, and delete an image, it won’t be deleted from Google Photos. That’s the way things work, and that may annoy some people. This way, you can also instantly cash photos or videos to your smart TV, and access editing options straight in the Google Photos app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, do note that I’ve managed to do this without a problem on my OnePlus 8 handset. I did it on both Android 10 (a while back), and now on Android 11. I also managed to do it on the OnePlus 8T, which is running Android 11. So, if your OnePlus handset is running on either Android 10 or 11, you should be able to do this without a problem. Once again, if you do stumble into any issues, you can simply reactivate the OnePlus Gallery app, and be done with it. </p>

<p> How To See, Limit, Or Stop Chrome From Tracking Everything You Do </p>
<p> Google Chrome is both hugely popular and notorious for its data collections but learning how to stop the search giant's tracking isn't necessarily easy. That's because the world's most popular browser on both desktop and mobile platforms has a plethora of settings. More pertinently, those are often tied to deeper account settings rather than directly to Chrome. </p>
<p> The end result is a maze of options that can be difficult to navigate, making it nearly impossible not just to stop data from being tracked. But it also makes simply seeing what information is being tracked difficult. </p>
<p> Of course, it's fairly easy to switch to another browser such as Brave, DuckDuckGo, Firefox, or Opera. There are plenty of great options and some are better than Chrome in many ways. Users can also opt to sign out and, in at least some cases, that might provide enough protection against collection. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With that said, all of that data tracking does serve a purpose too. Beyond serving up relevant ads, Google Chrome lets users have easy access to a wide assortment of services from Maps to Gmail. All of those services are interconnected, with data moving between them to make users' lives easier. </p>
<p> Fortunately, Google does provide a way for users to see, adjust, or stop tracking outright and learning how to do that via Chrome isn't entirely impossible. </p>
<p> Stop Chrome tracking on desktop </p>
<p> While desktop platforms are rapidly being replaced by more mobile devices, they still serve as one of the primary ways that users browse the web. Given Chrome's popularity, there's a good chance that browsing is taking place in Google Chrome. And that's also still going to represent one of the easiest ways to adjust, view, or stop tracking for fans of the browser. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These steps can be followed in Chrome via any variant of the desktop browser, whether on Windows, Linux, macOS, or Chrome OS. </p>
<p> Getting to activity controls </p>
<p> Now, accessing the activity tracking tools in Google Chrome is a straightforward process but not one that's necessarily intuitive. On desktop platforms, the activity settings are buried deeper within a user's account settings. So users will need to navigate there first. </p>
<p> One of the easiest ways to get to account settings is to open up Chrome and then load up a new tab before navigating to Google.com. Any Google-run website will work here, thanks to consistency-building changes the company has put in place over the past year. But Google.com is what we'll be using for this guide. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On that page, users should see their Google Account profile picture at the top-right-hand side of the page. Clicking or tapping on that will bring forward a menu with a button that reads "Manage your Google Account." </p>
<p> Tapping or clicking on the button takes users to the base menu we're looking for. Then, users will need to tap or click on "Data & personalization." There's also a handy option to perform a privacy checkup, just in case. </p>
<p> See and Delete what's already there </p>
<p> Within the Account Management page, there are a few places a user can see what Google has stored on them. The data can be deleted fairly easily from many of those locations too. In this guide, we'll be saving the most obvious section for last. That's going to be where users can stop future tracking and set up automatic deletion of saved data. We've placed that "Stop future tracking" segment below. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To begin with, users will want to scroll down the page to find the section Google has labeled with a "Things you create & do" heading. That features a scrollable card with all of the linked services and Google products. A click or tap on the "Go to Google Dashboard" link calls forward a more in-depth view of that. </p>
<p> On the resulting page, users will be able to click any card to expand it. The UI shows a range of data, depending on the service chosen, pertinent to the data being stored. Clicking on the three-dot menu on that same card offers options for navigating in a separate tab to that service, where data can be found and removed on a per-service basis. </p>
<p> At the bottom of the "Data & personalization" page, users will also find a menu to download and/or delete all of their stored data. Each of those options is clearly marked. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Stop future tracking </p>
<p> For more a more granular readout of stored data, or to stop tracking across core services, users will need the "Data & personalization" page's "Activity controls" card. Behind a click on the "Manage your activity controls" link, users will find a scrollable page filled with various activity cards. For example, web and app history, location history, and even YouTube history are found on that page. </p>
<p> On each card, there is a toggle to quickly and easily turn data tracking off for its respective category. Each also contains a link to "Manage Activity." </p>
<p> Clicking or tapping through the above-mentioned link shows an itemized, organizable, and explorable list of the associated activity. For this guide, the "Web & App" history option was selected. Users can not only scroll through deleting full days of activity or individual activity via each entries' three-dot menu. Google also presents the option to automatically delete data after a set time has passed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Options there include 18-months, 3-months, or manual-only deletion. </p>
<p> Stop Chrome tracking on mobile </p>
<p> Now, each of these menus is just as easy to find on either Android or iOS. To begin with, users can actually find them in Chrome itself simply by navigating to a Google-run website. Then, they'll need to open up the three-dot menu and select the box next to "Desktop site" to load the full web page. </p>
<p> But users on either mobile OS do have a far easier way to access the same settings without ever opening Chrome too. The process behind that differs slightly between the two operating systems, with Android users having a much more easily-discovered method for accomplishing the task. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Here, we'll outline both so that it's easier to learn how to stop, view, or delete the data Chrome saves. </p>
<p> On any mobile devices </p>
<p> The process for bringing data tracking and storage to an end is fairly straightforward and identical across all platforms. But getting to that menu can be difficult, especially on operating systems built by competitors to Google. In this case, that's going to be Apple's iOS, although the steps in this segment can be followed on any mobile OS. </p>
<p> To begin with, users will need to ensure they have at least one Google app installed. For the purposes of this guide, we've utilized the dedicated Google app. Then, upon opening the app, users will need to click their profile picture to access their account menu. Typically, that's found at the top-right-hand side of the UI. </p>
<p> As with the desktop platforms, Google will present them with their name and email address associated with the account. Under that, there's a "Manage your Google Account" button, as compared to the link that's utilized on desktop platforms. </p>
<p> Tapping on Manage your Google Account will call forward a UI for managing everything to do with that account. iOS users will see a list while Android users will see a scrollable paged UI. On iPhones, users will need to click the "Personal info & privacy" option, followed by scrolling down and tapping on the "Activity controls." </p>
<p> Android users need to scroll to the right and tap the "Data & personalization tab" instead. Under that tab, with a quick scroll down, Google presents options identical to those found in Chrome's desktop variants. Clicking on any of the subsequent links will redirect to the web version of the associated site. Then, it's relatively easy to see, manage, or stop tracking settings precisely as is done when accessing those via a desktop Chrome platform. </p>
<p> Android users have yet another option to get to the settings </p>
<p> The final option, available to Android users, and much easier to navigate to, is found in that OS's Settings app. More directly, for most Android OEMs — but not all — the Settings app contains a direct link to Google Account management. That's tucked neatly behind a dedicated "Google" option within that app. </p>
<p> Getting to the deeper, Chrome-related settings to stop tracking or see what's been tracked simply again requires a simple click on the "Manage your Google Account" button. That's found at the top of the page just below a user's profile image and associated Google Account email address. </p>
<p> Now, that button does precisely what the above-mentioned button in any Google app does. That is, it navigates users to the same paged UI. So they'll need to tap the "Data & personalization" tab option. </p>
<p> From there, the settings are organized an accessible exactly as they would be on the web version. That means there will still be quite a bit of clicking left to do. But, as shown earlier in this guide, the UI is fairly intuitive. So it shouldn't be too hard for users to learn how to manage the data stored by Google. Or to stop that tracking to a considerable extent. </p>

<p> How to see and manage your Chromebook System Resources: RAM & Storage </p>
<p> Operating on Google's hyper-efficient, sandboxed Chrome OS, a Chromebook is not the first device users often think of when it comes to managing resources such as RAM, storage, and CPU loads. But its built-in efficiency doesn't mean there aren't ever any issues with the gadgets. And, even if things are running smoothly now, that doesn't make having the knowledge of how to accomplish that is any less valuable. </p>
<p> Here, we'll go over how to view and manage Chromebook system resources from RAM through storage. And, to an extent, CPU loads. </p>
<p> Do you really need to worry about your Chromebook resources such as RAM, Storage, and CPU usage? </p>
<p> Now, it bears pointing out that a Chromebook doesn't quite handle RAM or other resources in the same way as other computers do. That's true even with just 4GB RAM. It's often possible to keep dozens of tabs running at once and all the time. That won't necessarily take away from the experience once other windows or apps are run. That's as compared to what operating with 4GB of RAM would be like on a Windows or macOS machine. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> None of that means it's not useful to know a given system's specs or how to better understand what's eating away at RAM. Some applications, particularly Linux apps, are going to be more demanding. So it's a good idea to know what you're working with. </p>
<p> Similarly, storage on a Chromebook is typically used for photos, videos, and apps. As anybody who has owned a smartphone can attest, the average of between 32GB and 64GB on a Chrome OS device is great for most users. But others will be reliant on the cloud resources for storage on their Chromebook. So understanding how much storage is available to work with when it's needed is a must. </p>
<p> Checking CPU usage, conversely, is a matter of course when things start slowing down. That's not going to happen often with Chrome OS since it's not exactly the most intensive operating system on the market. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Those specs don't quite mean the same thing to Chrome OS as they do on other operating systems. Chrome is simply more efficient and effective. But in case things do go wrong, understanding how to discover and manage those aspects of a Chromebook is still good information to have. </p>
<p> So, without wasting any further time, let's take a look at a few ways you can check your device's usage and specs. </p>
<p> Accessing the Chromebook Task Manager and checking storage </p>
<p> Chrome OS features a built-in task manager and, while not the most helpful such piece of software I've ever used, that does allow users to check what's running and what's being used. The reason it's not the most helpful tool is that Chrome actually doesn't tell you what percentage of your RAM or processor's power is in use. Instead, it just parcels out raw data. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But that doesn't' make it entirely useless. To begin with, the Task Manager is a built-in out-of-the-box solution. So users can trust that it isn't malware and that the representative figures are accurate. If a Chromebook is running slow and has 4GB RAM and a budget-end processor, the task manager should make it fairly easy to see if one or two applications are eating up most of the resources. </p>
<p> On the other hand, it should also be fairly easy to discern if multiple apps or browser tabs are to blame and to close them. </p>
<p> Accessing the task manager in Chrome is fairly straightforward but not intuitive. That's because it's not found in the OS settings or as a separate utility as it is in other operating systems. Instead, it's found in Chrome itself. To discover the task manager, there are two possible methods. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Open the Chrome browser </p>
<p> Click or tap the three-dot menu at the top-right-hand corner of the UI </p>
<p> A click, tap, or hovering the mouse over "More tools" reveals a secondary submenu </p>
<p> Click or tap "Task manager" </p>
<p> Or, users can access the task manager via a keyboard shortcut. To launch the utility, once Chrome is active and is selected, it is a two-key process. Start by holding down Search — denoted by a magnifying glass icon on a ChromeOS keyboard and placed where the Caps-Lock key typically is on other keyboards. Then, pressing the "ESC" key will launch the utility. </p>
<p> The task manager, by default, shows tasks that are running, their memory footprint, CPU usage, network status, and a process ID. The memory footprint is shown in kilobytes. The list can be sorted in descending or ascending order for any of the available attributes. And a right-click on any one entry will call forward a list of other options to view. </p>
<p> For storage, the steps are a bit more straightforward but users won't find that information in the task manager. Instead, users will need to navigate to the chief file management system for Chrome OS, the Files app. That's found under the app drawer or via a search and is tucked behind a file-folder shaped icon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Open "Files" </p>
<p> Click or tap the three-dot menu at the top-right-hand side of the Files UI </p>
<p> Find the progress bar-style read-out at the bottom for a quick glance of remaining storage </p>
<p> Click the storage read-out to open up the Settings app and show more details </p>
<p> Checking available resources via a utility that's built to work with a Chromebook </p>
<p> As noted above, the built-in tools for viewing and managing Chrome OS assets leaves quite a bit to be desired. For a more accurate readout of overall assets, so that users can gain a better understanding of the specs and device state, users are going to want a utility. </p>
<p> Thankfully, there are some available in the Chrome Web Store as a matter of course from third-party developers. </p>
<p> One of the most popular and highly-recommended of such tools is from developer François Beaufort. Called "Cog," it not only offers a ready, read-out of CPU, RAM, and storage. It also offers a read-out of display refresh rate and CPU temperature for those who really want to get a handle on how their Chromebook is doing on resources. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Cog is fairly easy to download and use too. To download and install the utility, users simply need to navigate to the Google Chrome Web Store. </p>
<p> Navigate to "https://chrome.google.com/webstore" </p>
<p> Utilize the search bar at the top-left-hand side of the UI to search for "cog – system info viewer" and select the resulting option. </p>
<p> Click "Add to Chrome" </p>
<p> Click "Add app" </p>
<p> Running the resources-management app on a Chromebook is straightforward as well. </p>
<p> Open the Chrome OS app launcher </p>
<p> Click Cog </p>
<p> All of the details you're looking for will be displayed on a single, easy-to-read scrollable page. By way of reminder, scrolling in Chrome OS requires a two-finger scrolling gesture on the touchpad. Conversely, the keyboard arrow keys or touchscreen can also be used. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Manage your Chromebook storage resources for a better experience </p>
<p> Now, it's time to actually do something with the information at hand. If there are problems with the temperature of the CPU, for instance, it's possible that's being overused — or that any vents could just use a good air-dusting. </p>
<p> In the worst case, scenario, users might need to open their device up and air dust things. Although temperature management should never really become an issue with a Chromebook. So it may be a better idea to contact an IT admin or customer support in those cases rather than focusing on managing your Chromebook resources. </p>
<p> Setting that aside, storage, CPU usage, and RAM are things that any user will want to potentially keep an eye on for the best experience. And managing those aspects of the resources available on a Chromebook is fairly straightforward too. </p>
<p> Manage Chromebook Storage </p>
<p> For storage, there are really only a few options available if that becomes overloaded. First, users can opt to delete applications and/or remove files. Starting with removing applications: </p>
<p> Open up the app launcher via the circle icon on the bottom-left-hand side of the shelf (swipe up from the bottom for Chrome OS tablets or in Tablet Mode) </p>
<p> Scroll to locate the desired app </p>
<p> Right-click on the app icon with either a two-finger click or a click while holding the 'alt' key (long-press on touchscreens) </p>
<p> Click or tap "Uninstall" </p>
<p> Removing files can be particularly useful, especially if users are accessing Android apps that work with photos or other media. Those files can, as often as not, end up duplicated in the file manager under the "Play Files" directory: </p>
<p> Open up the "Files" application from the app launcher </p>
<p> Navigate to the folder containing the files to be deleted </p>
<p> Select the file or "ctrl" and click to select multiple files (long press on touchscreens and then tap the icons for the desired files) </p>
<p> Click or tap the trash bin icon at the top-right-hand side of the UI </p>
<p> Conversely, it may also be helpful to move files around. Especially since Google Drive cloud storage is baked right into the Files app. As long as there's still cloud storage available and the files don't need to be stored locally for offline use, that's a viable option to consider. </p>
<p> Follow the above steps for locating and selecting the desired files </p>
<p> Press and hold the "Ctrl" key and then tap the "x" key to cut the files (long-press and select "cut" on touchscreens) </p>
<p> Open up the "Google Drive" directory and navigate to the appropriate cloud location </p>
<p> Press and hold the "Ctrl" key and then tap "v" to paste (long-press and select paste on touchscreen devices) </p>
<p> Manage Chromebook CPU and RAM usage </p>
<p> Beyond just storage, the task manager noted above can be useful for getting rid of unwanted processes too. That will clear up some RAM and also stop over usage of the CPU if there are problems with performance. Of course, that's also a viable solution in other instances where performance is being affected by a running app or website. </p>
<p> First, users will need to start by opening up Task Manager following the above-mentioned steps for that. </p>
<p> Once a process has been discovered to be using too many resources, click or tap the offending process to highlight it (multiple selections can be made by holding down the "Ctrl" key before clicking selections) </p>
<p> Tap or click the blue-colored "End process" button </p>
<p> Beyond that, there are actually steps a user can take to alleviate the problem before it becomes one. Particularly if they notice frequent problems. For instance, if users notice problems arising in Chrome, it may be a good idea to examine which pages are opening and what they're doing. </p>
<p> In the Task Manager, each page is separated into isolation as its own process. So it should be possible to see in that tool if a page or pages are overworking things. Then, those can be killed following the same steps outlined here. </p>
<p> Chrome OS is typically not an operating system that's in need of a lot of management. Google has done a good job of ensuring that optimizations are so good, in fact, that even the Chrome browser won't often eat up the kinds of resources that it almost always does on other operating systems. Under circumstances where a Windows machine might need 8GB RAM to run Chrome, for instance, a Chromebook might only need 4GB and still not suffer from a shortage of resources. </p>
<p> But, generally speaking, it's just a good idea to keep permanently-open or pinned- tabs to a minimum. Or, at the very least, only opened on an as-needed basis. Or at the very least to periodically close and then re-open those tabs. Which clears out some of the resources they're using. </p>
<p> Rebooting the system to refresh things from time to time or even performing a full factory reset is recommendable too. That's after setting up a backup, of course. As long as that's not having to be done on a regular basis, Powerwashing is easy and Chrome is easy to restore to a like-new state without losing anything. If it does need to be done regularly, it may be a good idea to check with the manufacturer. It's not unlikely there's something else going on. </p>
<p> Cleaning up unused or unneeded files every once in a while, as outlined above, can be a big help as well. And killing off or uninstalling unused apps will undoubtedly make things better. </p>
<p> Check your extensions and Chromebook Chrome apps </p>
<p> The final recourse, for those noting performance problems, is to examine Chrome extensions and apps to see if those are causing issues. Chrome should automatically remove and disable problematic extensions as they're discovered. But that doesn't mean it will catch those that are just using up too many resources. </p>
<p> With Chromebooks designed to be less resource-intensive, it's a good idea to ensure that only the ones that are really needed are activated. The same can be said for resource-intensive Chrome and Chromebook apps that are available from the Chrome Web Store too. </p>
<p> That's fairly easy to accomplish though. So the following steps shouldn't cause most users any trouble in terms of finding the extensions they want. At least not after learning how to get to the Extensions menu. </p>
<p> Open up Google Chrome </p>
<p> Tap or click the three-dot menu at the top-right-hand side of the UI </p>
<p> Click, tap, or hover over "More tools" </p>
<p> Click or tap "Extensions." Google will list out all installed extensions and Chrome-specific apps </p>
<p> Once there, extensions can be disabled or enabled easily with a simple click of a toggle. Chrome also presents options to get more information on the add-ons via the Chrome Web Store. Or to remove them entirely. Users who are experiencing problems that might be caused by extensions will need to systematically go through their extensions toggling them off and testing to see if the problem is resolved. </p>
<p> For those who just want more efficient allocation of resources on their Chromebook, the menu allows users to simply toggle off or remove those extensions they don't need or want. </p>
<p> Restarting Chrome in-between any major changes or flipping toggles is also a good idea. That allows the system to go through and make any deeper changes that may be missed while the gadget is powered on. </p>

<p> How To Set Up And Configure Bedtime Mode On Your Android Device </p>
<p> Today Google expanded its Bedtime Mode feature beyond Pixel phones and we're here to tell you how to set it up and configure it to your liking. </p>
<p> If you've not had the pleasure of experiencing this feature before, then you're in for an bit of an eye opener. I've personally been using it for the past couple of days and it really does help me get a better night's sleep. </p>
<p> Mainly because it curbs my phone use after a certain time. Something which I have been notoriously horrible about for a while now. Needless to say, digital wellness can be just as important as physical and mental wellness. And the interesting thing is Bedtime Mode kind of plays into both of those by letting you disconnect and destress. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Less stress can lead to better mental health, and more rest can lead to better physical health. It's a win/win. Here's how to set up Bedtime Mode if you're new to the feature. </p>
<p> How to turn on Bedtime Mode </p>
<p> Enabling Bedtime Mode is pretty quick and easy, and there are a couple of methods for doing so. </p>
<p> All of it really depends on whether you want to set it up to turn on automatically for you at designated times or not. Because you can set a time and it will enable itself at the same time every night. You can also turn it on yourself manually if you want more control over it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Setting Bedtime Mode to enable itself automatically </p>
<p> To do this, head into your settings on the phone and then scroll to the bottom and find Digital Wellbeing. Tap on this and then scroll to find the Bedtime Mode option. </p>
<p> In that sub-menu You can set it to turn on based on a schedule, while your phone is charging at bedtime (you still select what time "bedtime" is here), or you can set it to off. The easiest option and the most hands-off approach is to set the schedule. </p>
<p> Tap that, and then select your start and end times. If you set it to only while charging you'll do the same thing with the time selection. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Enabling Bedtime Mode manually </p>
<p> If you want more control over things, you can turn Bedtime Mode on manually as well. </p>
<p> Naturally, Google set up a pretty easy way to do this too. As there's a quick setting tile that can be added to your quick settings panel. And as you may have guessed tapping that will turn on Bedtime Mode and it'll stay on until you turn it off. </p>
<p> This won't initially be a quick settings tile you have access to. So to change that, drag down your quick settings panel and then tap on the pencil button to edit your tiles. This will be in the bottom left corner of the panel. Find the Bedtime Mode tile and then drag it to the panel with the rest of the ones that are already there. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Going forward you can easily enable Bedtime Mode from the panel. </p>
<p> Configure things to be more personal </p>
<p> Bedtime Mode is better when you have things set up to be more personal. Meaning you've adjusted the options for this feature to your own personal tastes. </p>
<p> A couple of examples on what you can configure include choosing your alarm sound for Bedtime Mode as well as selecting sleep sounds. If you want sleep sounds in the first place. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> They're definitely nice and I recommend giving them a try if you don't sleep with a partner who may be impacted by the sounds playing. Not everyone will care to use these though. </p>
<p> With sleep sounds, you can select from a handful of options that are baked into the system. These are nice enough and they seem to do the job Google intended. If you want to branch out and have a wider selection, you can also choose sounds from streaming services like Spotify and YouTube Music. </p>
<p> Presumably it'll let you select from Pandora and other streaming music services too if you have them installed. When you tap one, you should see a curated list of albums or songs that can help to whisk you off to dreamland. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can also search for specifics like I've done here with the Japanese Tea Garden Zen Music album. </p>
<p> There are a few remaining options to personalize the experience here. One is that you can set reminders to be notified when the feature is about to be turned on if you have it set to automatic. </p>
<p> Another is that you can toggle on things like grayscale and do not disturb mode. Though having those on is kind of the point of bedtime mode in the first place. Otherwise you're basically just using a regular old alarm. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lastly, you can set a toggle to use the Sunrise Alarm setting. Which slowly makes the screen brighter as the alarm is about to play. This is to sort of mimic the sun coming up. </p>

<p> How To Set & Use Custom Keyboard Shortcuts For Your Chrome Extensions </p>
<p> Chrome is a hugely popular browser and ready access to a plethora of extensions is one of many things that makes it so hugely popular. And it may be surprising for some to learn that keyboard shortcuts can be used to access extensions or that those can be custom-set by end-users. But they can. </p>
<p> Now, Chrome and Chrome OS are already loaded with a wealth of shortcuts. Like many of the most useful of those, setting those for extensions up does require a physical keyboard. That shouldn't prove a problem regardless since mobile Chrome doesn't support extensions anyway. So this obviously isn't meant for smartphones or other small-form-factor gadgets. But it's worth noting now, well before we dive into the process itself. </p>
<p> With that said, here we'll go through the steps behind how those settings can be discovered and those required to set up the shortcut. But we'll also discuss what custom shortcuts for Chrome extensions can and cannot do, as well as why that's likely the case. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> First things first, this won't work for every extension but that's okay </p>
<p> As will be shown in the images used in this walkthrough, not every extension is going to be supported by this. The feature won't, in any sense, allow users an easy way to access more passive extensions. Or stand in as a way to turn extensions on and off easily. At the very least, it won't unless turning things on or off is one of the core functions of the extension in question. </p>
<p> So there's no security focus behind the feature. It isn't going to be a great solution for those who want extensions to only have access to specific sites or data. To do that, users will need to find the extension icon next to the URL address bar/Omnibox. Then they'll need to right-click on the extension icon, hover over the "This can read and change site data" option, and select from the available options there. Those include options to allow reading and writing for "When you click the extension," only for the current site, or for "On all sites." </p>
<p> Stepping past that, not every extension will be supported either. It's not immediately clear what the prerequisites are to qualify. But, of the eleven extensions that were installed on this work machine, only two appeared to work. And only one of those was built by Google. The other is Grammarly. We'll be using Translate for this example, as seen in the image galleries embedded below. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That will, of course, limit usefulness for custom keyboard shortcuts for extensions, to an extent. But there are undoubtedly plenty of extensions that work with this. And plenty of those could certainly be improved if they were simply made easier to access. So it's still a useful feature to be aware of. </p>
<p> Why use keyboard shortcuts for Chrome Extensions? </p>
<p> The biggest advantage of using custom keyboard shortcuts to access chrome extensions is that it eliminates the need to use the mouse. The shortcuts effectively launch the extensions in-browser UI. For those who are keyboard-savvy, the "tab" key can then be used to navigate between on-page options. Then, a simple click of the "enter" key will select that option. So it can be a serious time-saver. </p>
<p> That also means that accessing extensions is going to be easier. Particularly if not all of the extensions that are enabled show up in the UI next to the Omnibox. So setting up custom keyboard shortcuts for extensions means ready-access to those, even when they're not in sight and easily accessed via the mouse, to begin with. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As already noted, while it could easily — and mistakenly — be assumed that turning on these custom keyboard shortcuts can serve as an easy way to turn on or off extensions, that's simply not the case. Such functionality would, of course, be desirable. Especially since at least some extensions have been caught out engaging in dangerous activities before. </p>
<p> So being able to turn them on or off quickly would be great for security and privacy reasons. Users could easily turn off extensions to stop them from accessing browsing data, for instance. But that's not something these shortcuts will do. The feature is, realistically, only good for the convenience and the time it can potentially save over time. And that's also likely for privacy and security reasons. </p>
<p> It wouldn't necessarily be impossible for Google to implement the ability to use keyboard shortcuts to disable or enable extensions. But that could potentially create an exploitable loophole or vulnerability in the way that extensions can be interacted with behind the scenes too. That's something that malicious extensions or entities could potentially use to steal data or worse. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Having said that, saving time and effort can be its own reward too. </p>
<p> Here's how to find the feature and turn it on </p>
<p> As might be expected, finding the keyboard shortcuts option for Extensions is relatively straightforward. There are, in fact, several ways to do so. But the easiest of those is going to simply be to use the Chrome UI and built-in menus. For simplicity, we won't be using the keyboard shortcuts for accessing that menu. So, of course, we'll just use the mouse instead. To turn on and set up keyboard shortcuts for their extensions, users will need to: </p>
<p> Open up the Chrome browser. Again, this works on Chromebooks and other desktop or laptop platforms. </p>
<p> Tap or click the three-dot overflow menu. That's located at the top-right-hand side of the UI, just below the 'x' icon that's used to close Chrome </p>
<p> Click or tap on the "More tools" option, located just a few placements away from the bottom of the resulting menu </p>
<p> Click or tap on "Extensions" in that "More tools" submenu. </p>
<p> That will cause a new window to open up in Chrome in a new tab. As expected, the resulting page will showcase all installed extensions, whether those are disabled or not. And, as a result, that serves as a great place to turn on or off extensions as well as getting more details about any given extension. But that's not the menu we're looking for. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> From there, users will need to follow just a few more steps: </p>
<p> Tap or click on the three-dash overflow menu at the top-left-hand side of the UI. The menu will slide out from the left-hand side. As of this writing, it only houses two options. Those are "Extensions" and "Keyboard shortcuts" </p>
<p> Click or tap on the "Keyboard shortcuts" option. Extensions that support custom keyboard shortcuts will be shown automatically. All others will be removed </p>
<p> Next to the desired extension, select the text box for the desired extension </p>
<p> Type in the desired extension shortcut. The system is set up to only accept shortcuts using the standard "Ctrl," "Alt," and/or "Shift" keys. So one of those will need to be pressed and held, at the very least, before it will register the shortcut. The process shouldn't be too difficult. But a small message displayed below the entry box will also work to guide users through this step </p>
<p> In some cases, the shortcut creation menu implies that the keyboard inputs will be applicable when typed outside of Chrome too. But the associated drop-down menu selection can be left on the default "In Chrome" for the purposes of this walkthrough </p>
<p> Close the tab or adjust other shortcuts and then close the tab. The changes are saved automatically </p>
<p> What's the expected behavior from custom keyboard shortcuts for extensions? </p>
<p> Once Chrome's built-in menu for extensions has been closed — or navigated away from — the custom keyboard shortcuts are immediately usable. But that doesn't mean users should expect exactly the same experience from any and all extensions. That's going to vary, depending on how the extension responds to interaction with the mouse. </p>
<p> For the Google Translate extension, interactions are exceptionally straightforward. As with a click, activating the extension with the keyboard shortcut pops up a small Google Translate card at the top of the UI. The text box for entering items to be translated, into whatever the native Chrome language is set to, is already selected. So, in this case, we'd easily be able to type in the desired text, hit the "enter" key, and see the results. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Conversely, as noted earlier, the selectable items can be cycled through with the "tab" key. So it's fairly easy to move over to the "Translate this page" option too. </p>
<p> That's because the UI that appears upon shortcut entry is the same that appears when the extension icon in the upper section of Chrome's UI is clicked or tapped. In every case, that's going to hold true. </p>
<p> For example, Grammarly is a checking tool for writing. It has toggles for different options from spelling and grammar checking to searches for definitions and synonyms. As with Google Translate, all of those options appear too and are selectable in the same way. So it stands to reason, after fairly extensive testing across a few more extensions, that behavior can be expected regardless of which extension is being accessed. </p>

<p> How To Use Split-Screen To Multitask With Your Chromebook </p>
<p> Multitasking on a Chromebook is a relatively easy process thanks to a wide variety of features but that doesn't mean all of those are intuitive. Among those that some users might find less obvious, is how to move into a split-screen view on a Chromebook. But, combined with other productivity-focused features such as overview mode — which now includes and supports virtual desks — it's definitely worth taking the time to learn how to do. </p>
<p> Here, we'll explore exactly how that's done on a Chromebook or other Chrome OS gadgets. </p>
<p> Split-screen enhances multitasking </p>
<p> Now, there are two ways users can learn how to enter split-screen on a Chromebook or Chrome OS device. Each is relatively straightforward and, to an extent, at least one should be familiar. But we're here to see how that task is performed. So let's dig in. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Open up the first window, tab, or app to be used in split-screen </p>
<p> The obvious first step in using split-screen on Chromebooks is to open the first of the two windows that's going to be used in split-screen. Now, the view can be used in any app on Chromebooks. So it won't matter if users want to split-view a browser tab, Android app, PWA, Linux app, or some other app or window. This is a system-level feature. </p>
<p> Conversely, users can just jump to opening up both windows they want to use in split-screen here and then follow the remaining steps to see how to enter split-screen. For this example article, we'll be using a Chrome tab and the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Move the window, tab, or app into split-screen </p>
<p> Central to the ability to open up split-screen mode is the window movement tools found on a Chromebook — and how that's used is the same as other operating systems too. That's the 'underscore', 'maximize', and 'close' icon row found in the top-right-hand corner of any app or window. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As might be expected from other operating systems, the line-shaped underscore icon minimizes windows, taking them out of view while they remain pinned to the shelf. The x-shaped icon closes the app or window entirely. It's the multi-square-shaped icon between those that we're interested in here. If the window isn't already maximized, the icon will simply resemble a square. </p>
<p> To move a window into split-screen users will need to either click- or tap-and-hold on that icon. That will cause two chevron-shaped arrow icons to appear pointing left and right to either side of the icon. Users can tap or click on either if they're quick enough. And that will move the window selected to the left-or-right-hand side of the screen, occupying about half of the display. </p>
<p> Conversely, users can simply click or tap and hold the square- or squares-shaped icon and drag to the left or right. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Or, users can click and hold the empty space to the left of the icons. That space is typically reserved for window movement when windows aren't maximized. Users can also move to split by dragging from there all the way to the left or right-hand edge of the display panel. </p>
<p> It's worth noting, however, that using a touch screen to tap and hold that empty space will do something else entirely. As a quirk of Chromebooks, it isn't set up for performing the same action as a mouse, instead, acting as a right-click. So that will do something different depending on the context of the app or window too. For instance, in Chrome, tapping-and-holding will pop up options for a new tab, to reopen a closed tab, to bookmark all tabs, or to open the task manager. </p>
<p> Rinse and repeat </p>
<p> Now, users need to open up a second window, if they haven't already. And the same steps listed above will be followed here. But the key difference now is that users will want to move the screen to the opposite side. That's relative to the side they've selected for the first window. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If the first window was moved to the right-hand edge, the second should be placed on the left. If the first window was moved to the left-hand edge, the second should be placed on the right. </p>
<p> Now, it's also possible at this point to resize either app or window from the bottom or top. Although that seems to be buggy if done before the next step — so that should be performed first. Then a third, smaller window can be placed in the remaining space. And users can add as many windows they like in that way for maximized productivity. </p>
<p> Adjust the split </p>
<p> Finally, there's one last step to really getting the most out of split-screen apps, windows, and tabs. Namely, that's resizing the windows so that an appropriate amount of space is available for each one. That's because, when working with multiple documents, spreadsheets, a dead-even 50/50 split will probably be fine. But that won't necessarily be the case with other apps, such as the Google Play Store, a calculator, or a messaging app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In those cases, users can more effectively make use of those apps by ensuring they occupy less space — relative to the other app they're using. Thankfully, the split-screen feature on a Chromebook accounts for that, and there's a fairly easy 'how to' method. </p>
<p> The chief caveat here, of course, is that this method doesn't work properly in tablet mode. A mouse is absolutely required, for now, unless users want to resize both windows manually. </p>
<p> Setting that aside, the easiest way to adjust the split between two windows is going to be to hover the mouse over the space between the windows. That will cause a double-arrow-shaped resize icon to replace the mouse icon. Now, users can manually adjust each window with a click and drag from there. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Or users can simply perform a tap. That will cause a secondary bit of UI, shaped like a dark vertical bar with two arrows to appear just below the mouse. That's the UI we're looking for. </p>
<p> The icon can be dragged to the left or to the right, as its arrows indicate. Dragging toward the left will resize the window on the right-hand side to grow while the left window shrinks. Dragging the other direction has the opposite effect. </p>

<p> How To Start A Hulu Watch Party With Friends </p>
<p> If you're feeling a little anxious, and frankly a little bit lonely, from having to stay home more often than you might be used to, Hulu Watch Party can help and here's how to set it up if you're keen to try it out. </p>
<p> First things first, Hulu Watch Party is essentially a way for you to watch shows on Hulu with friends. For all intents and purposes, it's not really visually different from watching Hulu by yourself or with another person in the room. </p>
<p> The UI is mostly the same. The only real difference, aside from the fact that other people are watching your exact stream with you, is the chat room feature. Hence the "party" in Hulu Watch Party. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To be honest this came out around the perfect time. Or close to it. Because while not everyone is staying inside these days compared to just a couple of months ago, some still are and are craving interaction with friends and loved ones. Hulu Watch Party may be just what you need. Here's how to start a Watch Party and enjoy shows with friends. </p>
<p> How To Start a Hulu Watch Party with friends & family </p>
<p> To start a party, you or someone who's in the party has to have a Hulu subscription. Not just any subscription though. You need the no-ads one. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you've got that covered, then simply go to Hulu and find some content to watch. From there, look for the little icon once you bring up the show panel that looks like three little people. The button should be between the "my stuff" and the "resume episode" buttons. </p>
<p> Just click that and it'll open the party room for the episode of whatever it is you're watching. Assuming it's a show. If it's a movie it's the same thing. Just for a film and not a TV show episode. Also worth noting is that this is an early access feature. So it's not technically fully rolled out yet. </p>
<p> Once it does roll out, certain aspects of it could change. Though Hulu didn't mention as much when it announced Watch Party earlier this year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Copy and share the special party link </p>
<p> Once you open the party room with your selected content, the first thing that will pop up is a special link created for the party. </p>
<p> You just need to copy and paste this link anywhere you want to share it. Basically anywhere that anyone you want in the party will have access to it. If you want to share it with specific people, you can share the link in a message or email. Or you can just paste it to your social feeds and anyone who clicks it can join. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can only have up to eight people in a party though, including yourself. So keep that in mind. Each person in the party also needs to have a no ads subscription from Hulu. If they do not, they will simply be taken to the Hulu landing page to sign up. </p>
<p> Wait for everyone to join, then start the party! </p>
<p> After you share the link and everyone has joined up, you control the show. </p>
<p> You're the host (if you're the one who started the party), so when everyone is ready, hit the start party button and the show will begin. There's a chat panel off to the right of the screen, just in case anyone wants to discuss what's happening. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Chat with friends during the show </p>
<p> Hulu wanted this to be a social experience to be shared with a friends and loved ones. As such, the chat is an important factor in this endeavor. </p>
<p> Chatting in a watch party is easy. Just click in the text box and type up your message and hit send. You can even add in emoji if you feel the need. Each person pops up in the chat with an associated letter. This way everyone knows who's in the chat and who's saying what. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That'll be important if you want to avoid confusion on who you're speaking to. You can also hide the chat panel if you click the full screen button. If you want to watch the show uninterrupted. </p>
<p> This might be preferred by anyone who wants their viewing experience to be centered on their display to. When it's not in full screen, the chat panel pushes the show panel off to the left some. Which is probably the only downside of this Hulu feature. </p>
<p> Now that you know how to set everything up, start a party and enjoy some TV with your loved ones. Just because you can't hang out physically doesn't mean you can't enjoy watching TV together. </p>

<p> Make Your Chromebook Life Easier With These Handy Touchpad Gestures </p>
<p> So you've finally decided to replace your aging Windows machine with a new Chromebook. You've scoured the web to find the best devices available. You've learned the keyboard shortcuts that are unique to the underlying operating system — Chrome OS. And now you're looking to learn the touchpad with gestures, so you can use the Chromebook to its full potential. You've come to the right place. </p>
<p> Here, we'll discuss all of the intuitive ways Google has backed touchpad gestures directly into its Chrome OS operating system. Additionally, we'll discuss some of the ways the gestures might be used and some of the nuances associated with the gestures. </p>
<p> Chromebook touchpad gestures offer something new, something similar </p>
<p> Now, Chrome OS is still, comparatively, a new operating system. The ecosystem is growing and adapting every few months with gusto to better serve users. And Google has consistently worked to ensure they're easier to use with each successive update. But that doesn't necessarily mean learning the wealth of new tricks comes easily. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In many respect, usability features are identical on Chrome OS laptops compared to Windows. Keyboard shortcuts to select all, copy, cut, and past, for example, are the same. So are at least a few of the keyboard gestures found on a Chromebook. Simultaneously, some of them are entirely different or have no equivalent on Windows or Mac. </p>
<p> Fortunately, here at Android Headlines, we've spent a lot of time with the devices. And that's not just review devices either. Some of our writers actually use the gadgets on a daily basis. That means we're well-positioned to discuss various quirks, such as touchpad gestures. And below, you'll find some that we found most useful in day-to-day use. </p>
<p> What touchpad gestures are unique to Chromebook? </p>
<p> When it comes to touchpad gestures on a Chromebook, those are going to be a lot like those found on other operating systems. That is to say, they'll mostly be dedicated to navigation — whether in the Chrome browser or otherwise. As we'll cover a bit later on, at least a few gestures are going to be almost identical to Windows. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That means that users who have already been taking advantage of shortcuts on Windows will have an easy enough time rediscovering quite a few of their favorites. </p>
<p> But that's just about enough on that matter. Let's take a closer look at some of the gesture-style shortcuts unique to Chrome OS touchpads. And a few that almost make their way over from Windows with no changes at all. </p>
<p> Navigate Chrome </p>
<p> Of course, a significant portion of the navigation that happens in Chrome is navigating backward and forward. But users can do a lot more than that if they really need to. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Back and forward button gestures </p>
<p> For clarity, users can actually simply move forward or backward with the touchpad without ever clicking anything. That's when a user wants to stay in the same current tab but navigate back to a previous page. Or forward to a page after navigating back. The latter gesture, of course, only works after navigating backward. If there's nowhere to navigate forward too, Chrome can't navigate forward. </p>
<p> Regardless of whether users need to go backward or forward, these are probably going to be among the most commonly-used gestures on a Chromebook touchpad. </p>
<p> To go back, swipe on the touchpad with two fingers from the left-hand side to the right-hand side of the pad. </p>
<p> Or, to go forward, swipe on the touchpad with two fingers from the right-hand side to the left-hand side of the pad. </p>
<p> To close a tab without needing to find the 'x' icon first; </p>
<p> It's also possible to easily close out of tabs if there happen to be too many open. For example, if users have opened so many tabs that they can't properly see what's on each tab. Or if they've accidentally opened a new tab they don't need. Closing any tab is just a quick tap away. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Hover the mouse over the desired tab </p>
<p> Quickly tap the touchpad with three fingers </p>
<p> To open a link in a new tab </p>
<p> For those who want to dive a bit deeper into tab control, it's also possible to open a window in a new tab. As that suggests, that means opening up a window in an entirely new tab, leaving the current tab open and in place. That's without holding down any keyboard keys or instantiating any 'right-click' actions. </p>
<p> To open a link in a new tab, start by hovering the mouse over the desired link </p>
<p> Rest three fingers on the touchpad </p>
<p> Click with all three fingers </p>
<p> To switch between multiple tabs that are already open </p>
<p> Now, chances are good that any user at any given moment will have multiple tabs open all at once. Wherever that's the case, chances are good that — at least for some users — it's going to become a real pain to move from tab to tab. Or, at the very least, time-consuming. </p>
<p> There are, of course, keyboard shortcuts for cycling through open tabs. And those work just fine for those who want to move through one at a time. But it's also possible to simply gesture on the touchpad and cycle through. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To cycle through opened tabs, place three fingers on the touchpad and swipe to the left or to the right </p>
<p> In the tab strip at the top of the page, the currently selected tab will be highlighted </p>
<p> Continue swiping to the right or to the left until the desired tab is highlighted </p>
<p> Release the touchpad to select the highlighted tab </p>
<p> Navigate Chrome OS </p>
<p> Getting around inside the Chrome browser isn't the only navigation to be done with the touchpad either. In fact, it's possible to do quite a lot with touchpad gestures on a Chromebook without ever opening Chrome. Or to use gestures in order to open Chrome from the app launcher or to switch to the browser if it's already open. </p>
<p> Open up the app launcher </p>
<p> For clarity, the app launcher is effectively the drawer Chrome OS tucks all of the apps in. It's found on the bottom-left-hand side of the UI by default, specifically on the left-hand side of the app shelf. And it takes the shape of a circle within a thin circular line. </p>
<p> Typically, users would tap that to pull up the app launcher. But it is possible to open that up without moving the mouse quite so far. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To open up the app launcher, adjust the mouse position so that it is hovering anywhere over the shelf </p>
<p> Place two fingers on the touchpad and swipe upward </p>
<p> Users can search for apps or use Google Assistant directly from the resulting UI. </p>
<p> Or swipe up again with two fingers to open up the app launcher entirely, laying out all apps that are installed </p>
<p> Swipe down, still using two fingers, to close the app launcher </p>
<p> Drag and drop, in Chrome </p>
<p> Now, drag-and-drop in Chrome OS borders on being identical to how it works in Windows. But with one or two very important differences. For example, in Windows, users double-tap and hold to instantiate a click-and-drag. Double-tapping in Chrome OS will simply open up whatever the users double-taps on. </p>
<p> To click and drag in Chrome OS, single click-and-hold or tap-and-hold on the desired object </p>
<p> Slide to move the now-dragged object to the desired location </p>
<p> Release the touchpad </p>
<p> Conversely, it's also possible to use two fingers from different hands to accomplish the same task a bit easier if users are having a hard time getting a single-finger-click to work. </p>
<p> What's just about the same as Windows? </p>
<p> The touchpad gestures we're going to cover here for a Chromebook work identically to Windows or close enough to make no difference. Those are right-clicking — which can also be accomplished by holding the 'alt' key and clicking — as well as web scrolling, pinch-to-zoom, and opening Overview mode. The last of those is effectively Task View on Windows machines. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Right-click with just a gesture </p>
<p> Now, right-clicking opens up a wealth of possibilities because it provides access to menus that change based on the context of what's been clicked. For example, right-clicking a file or link offers ways to copy or paste the file or web address. But right-clicking on an image file will also offer options to copy the image or download it. Or just to open it up in another page. </p>
<p> So, obviously, right-clicking is something that all users should know how to do. And, thankfully, it's effortless with touchpad gestures on a Chromebook. </p>
<p> To right-click, simply hover the mouse over the desired object, page location, or another piece of UI </p>
<p> Quickly tap the touchpad with two fingers to call forward the context menu </p>
<p> Scroll windows without a click or the keyboard </p>
<p> Now, scrolling on a Chromebook with touchpad gestures, as with Windows, is an easy affair. It also doesn't only work in a browser, although that's going to be the most likely place it will see action most often. But it can, for example, also be used in the files app to scroll through a long list of media or in the Google Play Store too. </p>
<p> To scroll vertically through a window, start by placing two fingers on the touchpad within the desired window </p>
<p> Swipe down to scroll up or down to scroll up. </p>
<p> When zoomed in, using two fingers to swipe to the right or left will scroll horizontally. But a similar action, as noted above, is great for moving forward or backward too. So it's best to use that gesture sparingly. </p>
<p> Zoom in or out of windows </p>
<p> Speaking of zooming in, that works just like Windows here too. A pinch in or out can be used to zoom in or out. In effect, that simply magnifies the page to make content easier to see or read. </p>
<p> To zoom in and magnify, start by placing two fingers on the touchpad </p>
<p> Spread the fingers outward, diagonally in opposite directions </p>
<p> To zoom out, perform the same action in reverse, but pinching inward. </p>
<p> Zooming out only works to the 100-percent mark in Chrome but can be used to zoom out further in some other applications such as PDFs. </p>
<p> Open Overview Mode and cycle through current windows </p>
<p> The last area of discovery that's similar to Windows is Chrome OS's Overview Mode. The mode paves the way for multi-desktop use, easy management of open windows, and overall improved productivity. Getting there via keyboard shortcuts or via a click on the Overview Mode key — shaped like a square backed or flanked by lines or other squares — is easy. </p>
<p> It's equally easy to interact with the UI without ever touching the keyboard, to begin with. </p>
<p> To enter Overview mode, start by placing three fingers on the touchpad </p>
<p> Swipe upward on the touchpad with all three fingers </p>
<p> The screen will shrink in on itself, revealing over-sized tiles for each open window. At the top-right-hand side, there will also be a button to create a new desktop, if one hasn't already been created. But users still don't need to use their clickers or precision mouse navigation to get around this interface either. </p>
<p> To cycle through the UI in Overview Mode, start by placing and holding three fingers on the touchpad in Overview Mode. </p>
<p> Swipe to the left or to the right to highlight selectable items in the UI </p>
<p> Press 'Enter' on the desired selection. </p>
<p> Cycle through desktops quickly </p>
<p> Now, cycling through the UI on the Overview Mode page isn't always the most efficient way to get around. In fact, sometimes it's going to be desirable to just switch rapidly from one virtual desktop to another. Thankfully, there is one final bonus gesture that can be used to accomplish the task. </p>
<p> To cycle through open virtual desktops without ever entering overview mode, start by placing four fingers on the touchpad </p>
<p> Quickly swipe with all four fingers from the right to the left-hand side of the touchpad to cycle directly to the virtual desktop on the right </p>
<p> Quickly swipe with all four fingers from the left to the right-hand side of the touchpad to cycle in the opposite direction </p>

<p> How To Transfer Your Google Play Music Library To YouTube Music </p>
<p> The time is nigh, and soon users will need to transfer their music libraries over to YouTube Music if they want to keep them, and they'll need to know how to do it. </p>
<p> The entire process isn't too challenging. Thanks to Google's helpful transfer tool. The thing is, Google is just now starting to roll out this tool's accessibility to all users. But we'll show you how to migrate your Google Play Music library over to YouTube Music anyway so you know what to do when you can actually complete the process. </p>
<p> How to migrate your Google Play Music library to YouTube Music using the web tool </p>
<p> There are two ways you can end up with all of your music from Google Play Music in YouTube Music. That is if you want to stick with Google's music options. How to migrate the library from the latter over to YouTube Music begins with the web tool. Which is the first method. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To access the tool, simply head to the music.youtube.com/transfer webpage. If you have access you should see a button on that page that says "transfer" and that will start the process. Alternatively you can also enter the settings menu on this page. </p>
<p> From there you'll see an option for transferring from Google Play Music. This is right under the recommendations option. Click that option in the list of settings on the left, then click the button on the right side of the screen. </p>
<p> Google says this can be both a quick and a slow process. And it all depends on how much music content is being migrated. If you don't have a whole lot in your library it can take as little as a few seconds. If you've amassed a gargantuan level of music content, then it can take up to a few days. The key here is patience if that's the case. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to migrate your library over to YouTube Music with the app </p>
<p> This is really just as simple if not simpler than using Google's migration tool. If your Google account has been given access, then you should see a button for transferring your library inside of the YouTube Music app. </p>
<p> After the tool has rolled out to you, opening the YouTube Music app for the first time will bring up a message detailing the change to YouTube Music and there will be a button asking if you want to transfer your library. </p>
<p> There is also an option present that says "not now" if you want to hold off. Though keep in mind that the change is happening and you'd be better off migrating things sooner rather than later. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can also use the migration tool as many times as you want. So if you continue to use Play Music for the time being after starting the migration, you can simply use it again later to move over anything that's new. </p>
<p> Here's what migrates over, and what doesn't </p>
<p> If you're worried about losing content that's a natural reaction. You shouldn't be too worried though because most stuff will be included in the migration. </p>
<p> For starters, you won't lose any of the songs that you either uploaded or purchased. All of that will still be available after you move things over. So rest assured you can still listen to anything you've acquired and added over the years if it falls into these two categories. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Your likes and dislikes are also included in the migration. Didn't like a new particular album or single? This will be remembered. Google says that your playlists will migrate too. And that most stations will be included as well. </p>
<p> That said it does specifically say most stations. Which means there may be a handful of them which won't be around after you shift to the new service. Any albums and songs in your library are included too. </p>
<p> Luckily, your billing and subscription information will also be migrated, as will the monthly price you pay. Lastly, personalized recommendations will be updated to reflect your Google Play Music listening habits. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Anything else that hasn't already been mentioned won't be included. For the most part, not too much is changing or being left behind, and you shouldn't lose much, if anything. </p>
<p> Google will notify you when the migration is finished </p>
<p> Earlier we mentioned that the migration could take anywhere from a few seconds to a few days. It all depends on how much content is being moved over. </p>
<p> So you don't have to lord over the app and keep refreshing things (although you can if you want to), Google says it will send out notifications to let users know when the migration is all done. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You'll get an email as well as an alert in the YouTube Music app, so it should be hard to miss. Basically, just sit back and comfortably wait for things to fall in place. </p>

<p> How To Turn Off Android TV Ads </p>
<p> Today, Google started rolling out the new ads for Android TV, and naturally, we all want to know how to turn them off. Or simply get rid of them. </p>
<p> Thankfully, there is a way to get rid of them, for now. This method isn't going to work for long though. So enjoy it while it lasts. </p>
<p> The ads aren't really that intrusive, and you likely won't even notice that they are on your TV. But for many, they don't want to see ads period, which is understandable. They appear at the top of the screen, above your list of apps. And make it easier to find some new shows to watch on apps that you may or may not have installed on your TV already. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to turn off Android TV ads </p>
<p> The new ads, are also called "Highlights" and are located in the most recent Android TV Home update. </p>
<p> So, in order to kill these ads, head to Settings. </p>
<p> Then select apps. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now select See all Apps. </p>
<p> You are going to need to select Show System Apps as well. </p>
<p> Now scroll down to find Android TV Home. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> After you have found that app, click on it. </p>
<p> Then click on "Uninstall Updates." </p>
<p> This is going to revert it back to a previous version of the launcher, but it will also get rid of the ads. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, the reason why we say that this method will not work for long, as Google will (at some point) make it so that you cannot revert back to an older version of the Android TV Home launcher. This is a pretty common thing actually, and is done with most apps as well. It's normally done for safety and security. But in this instance, it might be to force everyone to see ads. </p>
<p> There is likely going to be another way to remove ads altogether, which may involve some trickery. But as for now, it's just this simple, which is quite nice to see. </p>
<p> None of us like ads, but it is a necessary evil. Ads are what keep the internet free, without ads, many of the things that we use and enjoy for free right now, would not be free. So keep that in mind here. It wouldn't be surprising to see more ads pop up on Roku and Amazon Fire TV as well. Roku kind of already has them in the lower right-hand corner of the home screen. And those are pretty unobtrusive as well, as they are out of the way, and you probably don't even notice them. </p>

<p> How To Update OnePlus 8 & 8 Pro To Android 11 Straight Away </p>
<p> Android 11 has arrived to the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, along with OxygenOS 11. We’ve already reported on this earlier today. That being said, the update is not rolling out to everyone straight away, it’s rolling out gradually. Well, in this article, we’ll show you how to update your OnePlus 8 or 8 Pro to Android 11 straight away. </p>
<p> Updating OnePlus’ devices manually is not a problem at all, as long as you have the right file to do it. Do note that you don’t need a rooted device for this, nor do you need ADB. You don’t even need to connect your phone to your PC, or anything of the sort. </p>
<p> It’s easy to update to Android 11 using your OnePlus 8 (Pro), this is how you can do it </p>
<p> All you’ll need is to download the right file from the links we’ll provide you with, and follow the instructions. That being said, first and foremost, the file. Below this article, you’ll see six links. Three of them are for the OnePlus 8, and three for the OnePlus 8 Pro. You need only one of those links, by the way. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All you need to do, is figure out what variant you need. So, there are software variants for Europe, India, and the Global model. This is quite simple. If you’ve purchased your phone from OnePlus in Europe, click that link. If you’ve purchased it in India, get that version, and for other regions, the Global file is what you need. </p>
<p> Now, before you start the download, do note that the file you’re planning to download is quite large. It weighs almost 3GB, so make sure you’re connected to WiFi, or have enough mobile data to throw around. Once you’re ready, hit the link that is right for your phone, and wait for the download to finish. </p>
<p> At that point, you’ll need to open the ‘Settings’ app on your OnePlus 8 or 8 Pro. Once you do, scroll down to ‘System’, and then open ‘System updates’. Once you’re there, hit the icon in the top-right corner. There, you’ll see the ‘Local upgrade’ option, tap that. At that point, the only file you’ll probably see is the file you need, unless you have similar files in your storage. If that’s the only one, tap it, if not, find the one you downloaded, and proceed. </p>

<p> There is a second way you can do this </p>
<p> The phone will simply install the new OS on your device, after which you’ll need to restart it, and there you go. You’re all done. Now, there is a second way you can do this, if you want. You can do it by installing the OxygenOS Updater app via the Play Store, that’s the way I did it, actually. Once you download it, simply choose the ‘Incremental Upgrade’ option, and the app will probably find the right software for your device. </p>
<p> Chances are you won’t even need to choose anything, as the app will recognize what you need to download, and for what device. But, just in case, make sure to re-check. Also, do note that we’re not responsible if something goes wrong. I’ve updated my devices like this a ton of times, and everything was good, but there’s always a chance something may go wrong. If you don’t mind waiting for the update to arrive OTA (Over The Air), be patient. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / How To Use The Gunsmith In Call Of Duty: Mobile – Ultimate Gunsmith Guide </p>
<p> How To Use The Gunsmith In Call Of Duty: Mobile – Ultimate Gunsmith Guide </p>
<p> The gunsmith in Call Of Duty: Mobile is the latest and greatest feature to be added to the game. If you've never played Call Of Duty Modern Warfare (the one launched in 2019 and not the original), then you may not be familiar with the gunsmith feature. </p>
<p> This is something you definitely want to be excited about because it really makes working with your loadouts a lot better. </p>
<p> It adds things like charms, stickers, and different reticles that can be customized on your guns. On top of all that it puts all of your gun skins into a blueprints section, just like in Modern Warfare, and it gives you a whole lot more customization options for your weapons from stocks to under barrel add-ons to muzzles. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you're not sure where to start with things. This guide is here to help. Here's how to use the gunsmith in Call Of Duty: Mobile and make the most of it as a beneficial feature. </p>
<p> Access the gunsmith in Call Of Duty: Mobile from the loadout screen </p>
<p> Getting to the gunsmith in Call Of Duty: Mobile is pretty easy and you won't have to track it down. In fact it's simpler to get to than in Modern Warfare where it's a little more convoluted. At least in my personal opinion. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Here, just head to the loadout screen and there will be a gunsmith button listed below each weapon in your loadout. In the example image, I have the Cordite – Zero G and the J358 – Meltdown equipped. </p>
<p> And you can see the gunsmith buttons below both of those. Tapping on either one will take you to the gunsmith menu where you customize the weapon. Which you'll want to do if you want to optimize your loadout to make the most of it. </p>
<p> Going forward, gunsmith should be your new home when you're not in a match. Become familiar with the different attachments and perks you can add to each weapon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Like before though, you can only add so many things to a gun. Altogether you can only have a mixture of five add-ons. Whether those are all attachments or a combination of the attachments and a perk. </p>
<p> Why you absolutely want to be messing around with attachments in the gunsmith </p>
<p> The short answer is, it'll improve your weapons. Which has a chance to lead to better results in your matches. </p>
<p> Obviously, as you level up your weapons you'll be pushed to add attachments and stuff to them. Which you'll do. But don't just go adding things willy-nilly. You can certainly do that and no one will stop you. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But if you want your game to improve, consider what attachments you're adding and what they will do for you. For example, different attachments will adjust things like vertical and lateral recoil control. Which will in turn impact how much your weapon recoil moves upward or to the sides while you shoot. </p>
<p> Considering this, improved recoil control both vertically and laterally means it won't kick as much in those directions. Giving you a better chance to hit your targets. </p>
<p> Some attachments can also adjust and improve the ADS (aim down sight) bullet spread accuracy, hip fire accuracy, ADS speed, sprint-to-fire speed and more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Other things to keep in mind are that some attachments will improve some stats but reduce effectiveness in others. An example of this are muzzles. Which will help your vertical and lateral recoil control but reduce your ADS speed and ADS bullet spread accuracy. </p>
<p> The idea is to find the best possible combination based on how you play. If you want better mobility, then try to find something that gets that as high as possible without impacting other areas too negatively. </p>
<p> Consider wiping the slate clean </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The developers have tried to make things as easy as possible to work with here. </p>
<p> While it might take you some time to figure out what works best for your own personal play style, that doesn't mean actually interacting with the gunsmith feature has to be a challenging task. And it's really not. </p>
<p> If you aren't sure what attachments to use, consider wiping the slate clean. What I mean by that is, utilize the "clear all" button located at the bottom of the screen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As the name of that button suggests, this will remove every attachment or perk from the gun. With this, you can start fresh by seeing the gun's base stats without any attachments. Then work forward from there to pick things that will work with your play style. </p>
<p> Other things to keep in mind. It's not such a bad idea to know how the gun feels without attachments. Learn the vertical and lateral recoil control on a gun you're interested in using before beefing it up. </p>
<p> If you're worried about using it in multiplayer or ranked modes, you can easily avoid the ire of your teammates by testing guns out in the Training or Practice vs A.I. </p>
<p> Compare guns to see how each one stacks up </p>
<p> Just as important as learning the attachments and how they impact the gun, it's important to know what each gun you have is capable of doing. </p>
<p> More specifically what the stats are of each gun and how they compare to each other. Like what the damage is for one gun as opposed to the other. Seeing your guns side by side like this makes it really easy to pick the one that's best for you. </p>
<p> As it gives you a better overall picture of the strengths and weaknesses of each gun. The Type 25 – Bloody Vengeance for example has stronger damage, mobility, and fire rate compared to the AK117 – Magmacomb. But it has weaker accuracy, range, and controls. </p>
<p> Consider looking at these things before picking a weapon. Then move onto testing that weapon out and then finally adding attachments to it. Or leveling it up to unlock attachments if you don't have any yet. </p>
<p> Use the gunsmith in Call Of Duty: Mobile to save customizations </p>
<p> Alongside everything else you can already tap into the gunsmith for, you can save your weapon customizations. </p>
<p> If you want to add things into your loadout without having to dive into the gunsmith every time, this is what this feature is for. You can go through and pick a few sets of attachments and then save them as a new customized weapon. </p>
<p> You can even rename it if you want or leave it as is. The default name is just the name of the weapon. This will save you time whenever you want to flip a new version of the weapon you're using into your loadout and swap out the other. </p>
<p> Trust me, this will be useful. Especially if you're trying to settle on an attachment combination that works best for you. If you go through and pick a few sets and save them, then you can more quickly swap in a different set if the first one didn't work out like you hoped. </p>
<p> The gunsmith is by far the best new feature added to Call Of Duty: Mobile. So dive in and check it out. Mess around with different attachments and find a good fit. And most of all, have fun. </p>

<p> How To Watch The 2020 NFL Draft </p>
<p> The 2020 NFL Draft is going to be quite different from previous NFL Drafts, but you'll still be able to watch it. The draft starts on Thursday, April 23, and it will be streamed live on the usual channels. </p>
<p> The NFL had been planning for a pretty impressive Draft in Las Vegas this year. But for obvious reasons, the NFL had to move the Draft to a virtual one. With the NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell hosting the draft from his basement. Even the NFL Commissioner has to work from home, on perhaps the biggest day of the year, for the NFL. </p>
<p> This means that the NFL had to change how the Draft works, and is relying on technology more than ever before. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How the 2020 NFL Draft will work </p>
<p> This year, all 32 teams will make their draft choices either online or over the phone. </p>
<p> NFL tapped its longtime partner, Microsoft, to make this virtual draft happen. Microsoft has created a version of its Teams application, which is going to be used for most of the communications between the league and teams. This includes making player selections. For redundancy, each team is going to have three people that will be able to submit picks, in case there are any technical issues. Seeing as the NFL Draft is going to be live, that is a good idea. </p>
<p> As always, timing is a big deal in the draft. In the first round, teams have 10 minutes to make their selection. And that time will dwindle down once it gets into the later rounds. With the seventh round giving teams only four minutes. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Over the three days of the NFL Draft, there will be 255 picks made. The Cincinnatti Bengals have the first overall pick. Followed by the Washington Redskins and the Detroit Lions. This order was finalized at the end of last season, with the worse team getting the first pick and so on. </p>
<p> The NFL Draft is a day where dreams come true. With hundreds of college football players looking to leave college early or looking for their next step in their career, waiting to hear their name called. There will be many that will go undrafted and even go in the much later rounds. But that isn't a bad thing. Remember, Tom Brady, who is heralded as the best to ever play the game, was drafted 199th overall (out of 255!) in the sixth round by the Patriots. So number one overall doesn't automatically mean the best player in the draft. </p>
<p> How to watch the 2020 NFL Draft </p>
<p> You can watch the 2020 NFL Draft virtually anywhere. And that's good news for cordcutters that still want to catch the big night. The NFL Draft will be broadcast on ABC, ESPN, ESPN Deportes and the NFL Network. So as long as you have a package that has one of those channels, you'll be able to watch the big night. Here are some of our picks for the best way to watch the NFL Draft this year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OTA Antenna </p>
<p> Since the draft is going to be airing on ABC, you don't actually need to subscribe to anything. And if you have an OTA antenna, you can watch the draft for free. If not, you can purchase one from Amazon, and get all of your locals for free. </p>
<p> You could also use the OTA Antenna to watch on Plex Live TV which is currently free. Plex Live TV does still require that your TV have an antenna, but you'll be able to DVR shows on your local channels, as well as watch on other devices that use your Plex account. Which can really be a lot more useful than just a regular antenna. </p>
<p> AT&T TV Now </p>
<p> AT&T TV Now is the most expensive option on this list, but it does offer up some premium networks in addition to ABC and ESPN. That includes HBO and even Cinemax. AT&T TV Now allows you to watch over 45 live TV channels, and can also DVR up to 20 hours content, that you can watch anytime and anywhere. AT&T TV Now does allow you to watch on many different devices including Android, Android TV, Chromecast, Apple TV, iOS, Fire TV and much more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pricing for AT&T TV Now starts at $65 per month. And offers a seven-day free trial. </p>
<p> fuboTV </p>
<p> fuboTV is also on the more expensive list, but still worth signing up for. It is a must-have for sports fans – even though there really aren't any sports happening right now. There are over 90 live TV channels available on fuboTV. While you won't get any locals like ABC and ESPN is also not available, you can still watch the draft on the NFL Network. fuboTV also offers up to 30 hours of DVR space for recording shows and movies. </p>
<p> fuboTV starts at $54.99. And it also offers a free seven-day trial. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Hulu with Live TV </p>
<p> When it comes to streaming TV services, Hulu with Live TV is actually one of the better options out there. In addition to over 60 channels, you also get the on-demand library that Hulu offers, as well as originals. Hulu does give you access to ABC and ESPN, but no access to the NFL Network, unfortunately. </p>
<p> Hulu with Live TV is going to cost you $55 per month. And there is also a free seven-day trial available. </p>
<p> Sling TV </p>
<p> Sling TV is going to be the cheapest option here, besides grabbing an OTA Antenna. Sling TV starts at just $20 per month and offers access to ESPN on the Sling Orange plan. And NFL Network on the Sling Blue plan. Now you can combine these two plans for $45 per month to get even more channels. You can also watch this on three screens simultaneously, and there is also the ability to record with cloud DVR. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When does it start? </p>
<p> The NFL Draft is going to start on Thursday, April 23. With round one starting at 8PM ET. </p>
<p> Rounds two and three will be held on Friday, April 24 starting at 7PM ET. While rounds four through seven will happen on Saturday, April 25 starting at noon ET. </p>
<p> You'll be able to watch the 2020 NFL Draft on ABC, ESPN, ESPN Deportes or the NFL Network. </p>

<p> How To Watch The NFL In 2020 Without Cable </p>
<p> The NFL is getting ready to kick off its 2020-21 season this weekend, with week 1 of the NFL season. And with sports having been gone (for the most part) for the last six months, we're all excited to watch the NFL once again. </p>
<p> It's hard to believe that Super Bowl 54 was over six months ago at this point. Not to mention all of the changes that took place during the off-season. Like Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski taking their talents to Tampa Bay this year. Among other trades. </p>
<p> This year is bound to be a good one, and you won't want to miss a second of the action. If you don't have cable, you aren't out of luck though. As there are more places than ever to watch the NFL this year, without having to pay for cable. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to watch NFL games </p>
<p> This season, the games will be broadcast on the usual networks, CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN and the NFL Network. CBS, Fox and NBC are free to everyone, as those are over-the-air channels. But ESPN and NFL Network will need to be included in your streaming TV plan to get the games on those networks. Luckily, the majority of them are on Fox and CBS. </p>
<p> Watch for free </p>
<p> As mentioned, CBS, Fox and NBC are free, over-the-air channels. So all you need to watch the games on those networks, will be an antenna. And if you don't have one, Amazon has a ton of them (literally). And some are pretty cheap. We're talking under $10. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can hook one up to your TV and watch the majority of the NFL games for free this year. Of course Monday Night Football and some Thursday Night games won't be available. But about 98% of this season's games are available over-the-air. </p>
<p> AT&T TV Now </p>
<p> AT&T TV Now is one of the many providers that offer access to NFL games this year. It includes CBS, NBC, ESPN and Fox. The only channel missing is the NFL Network. However, you can upgrade to the "MAX" plan to get the NFL Network, if you really want it. AT&T TV Now is going to cost you $55 per month, and it does come with a limited DVR. </p>
<p> FuboTV </p>
<p> FuboTV is the streaming TV platform for sports fans. It starts at $55 per month, and offers access to almost every sports network out there. Even ones you've never heard of before. </p>
<p> With FuboTV, you are getting access to CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN and the NFL Network at that price. And you also get Cloud DVR (500 hours of space) so you can watch the game later on. On top of that, if you forgot to record a game, you can use the 3-day replay feature to replay just about any game later on. Or any show or movie too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> FuboTV does also offer a seven-day trial of its service. </p>
<p> Hulu with Live TV </p>
<p> Hulu with Live TV also comes in at $55 per month. It includes CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN. It does not include the NFL Network. Hulu with Live TV is also available with only one plan, so you can't add it on with a higher-priced plan, like with AT&T TV Now, either. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Hulu with Live TV does offer a Cloud DVR option, but that is an extra cost, of $10 per month. </p>
<p> You can sign up for a free trial of Hulu with Live TV. </p>
<p> Sling TV </p>
<p> Sling TV is by far the cheapest way to watch the NFL this season, without buying an antenna. </p>
<p> Sling TV comes in two packages – Sling Blue and Sling Orange. These are both priced at $30 per month, or you can get both for $45. Sling Blue includes NBC and Fox. While Sling Orange includes ESPN. Unfortunately, CBS and the NFL Network are not available on Sling TV. So now you know why it's much cheaper than the other options on this list. </p>
<p> There is a seven-day free trial, which you can sign up for. </p>
<p> YouTube TV </p>
<p> Finally, we have YouTube TV. This is a personal favorite of mine, and one I use actually. YouTube TV will cost you $65 per month. It includes NBC, CBS, Fox, ESPN and the NFL Network (which it just added, in time for this season). </p>
<p> On top of that, with YouTube TV, you also get unlimited free DVR storage space for recording anything and everything. You can literally record everything on YouTube TV – because I do. </p>

<p> How To Watch The 2020 Stanley Cup Playoffs </p>
<p> Much like the NBA, the NHL also had to pause its season back in March, due to the pandemic. It recently started back up again, with a couple of bubbles in Canada. And now the Stanley Cup Playoffs are about to get underway. About four months later than normal. </p>
<p> Since Hockey needs ice to be played on, it makes sense that the bubbles are in Canada, where it is usually colder in August than in the US. </p>
<p> Unlike the NBA, the NHL is doing two bubble cities. With the eastern conference teams playing in Toronto and the western conference teams playing in Edmonton. The Stanley Cup Finals will also take place in Edmonton. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Stanley Cup Playoffs are going to be shown on NBC, NBCSN, CNBC, NHL Network and USA Network in the US. So any streaming TV service that has those channels, you'll be able to watch all of the Stanley Cup playoffs games. </p>
<p> Hulu with Live TV </p>
<p> Hulu with Live TV does offer the majority of these networks. Including NBC, NBCSN, CNBC and the USA Network. </p>
<p> It costs $55 per month, and it also includes a load of other sports networks. You can check out which networks are available in your area by putting in your ZIP Code. It also has DVR available, and you can watch on two screens simultaneously. </p>
<p> Fubo TV </p>
<p> Fubo TV is the go-to streaming TV service for sports fans. And that is because it has just about every sports network you can think of – it even added ESPN recently. Fubo TV does also have NBC, NBCSN, CNBC, NHL Network and USA Network, so you can watch all of the NHL games. </p>
<p> Sling TV </p>
<p> Sling TV is pretty popular for its a la carte offerings. Where you can get in for as little as $30 per month, but depending on what channels you want to add, you can really raise that price. It offers NBC, NBCSN and CNBC in its Sling Blue package, but NBC can only be watched live in some markets – it doesn't have many of the locals. There is also the Sling Orange plan that will get you the Fox sports networks, if you'd like those. You can add the $10/month sports extra package for $5 per month, which includes the NHL Network. </p>
<p> YouTube TV </p>
<p> Then there is YouTube TV, which includes NBC, NBCSN, CNBC, NHL Network and USA Network. Allowing you to watch all of the games. YouTube TV also has unlimited cloud DVR, allowing you to record all of the games if you wish, and just about anything else you'd like. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> YouTube TV recently jumped up to $65 per month, but it does have over 80 channels, many channels that other streaming services do not have. Making it more than worth the money. </p>
<p> Wrap Up </p>
<p> There are some really great options to watch the 2020 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Sling TV is going to be cheapest, but if you are looking for an option to cut the cord from your cable company, Fubo TV is a great option. Particularly if you are a big sports fan. </p>

<p> How To Watch UFC 251 Without Cable </p>
<p> The UFC 251 PPV is taking place this Saturday, July 11 from the UFC Fight Island in Abu Dhabi. Once again, there's no crowd, so the PPV will sound a bit odd, compared to how UFC fights normally sound.

<p> UFC 251 is happening this Saturday, so how can you watch online without cable? Well, luckily we have you covered. </p>
<p> How can I watch UFC 251 without cable? </p>

<p> The early prelims and prelims are available on ESPN+. And you'll be able to purchase the PPV through ESPN+ as well. </p>
<p> You can purchase the PPV for $64.99 through ESPN+. If you are not an ESPN+ subscriber, it'll cost you $84.98. The $20 extra goes towards a year of ESPN+, which is actually much cheaper than what ESPN+ is normally for an entire year. So it's a really good deal. </p>

<p> How To Update Your Google Pixel Smartphone To Android 11 </p>
<p> One of the main selling points of a Google Pixel smartphone, is the fact that it does get frequent updates, and it is usually the first to get the next version of Android. In fact, it is getting Android 11 today! So here's how you can update your Pixel to Android 11. </p>
<p> It's pretty simple to update to Android 11, thankfully. Unfortunately, Google hasn't yet found a way to do these updates automatically just yet, so there is some input needed from the user. </p>
<p> There are essentially two ways that you can update your Google Pixel. We are going to go through each method, with the first one being the easiest and the second one being much harder, obviously. The screenshots shown in this post are from the Pixel 4 XL, but they should look identical on any Pixel device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to update your Google pixel via OTA (Over The Air) </p>
<p> This is by far the easiest way to update your Google Pixel smartphone. </p>
<p> First, tap on the settings icon in your app drawer or in the notification shade. </p>
<p> Now scroll down to System, then tap on Advanced. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Then tap on System Update. </p>
<p> Now your Pixel is going to check for an update. It might not actually find one, depending on if it has been pushed to your device or not. You can also tap on the "Check for Update" button in the lower right-hand corner, to check again. </p>
<p> And that's it. It's just that simple to check for an update for your smartphone. If it does find an update, it'll start downloading it in the background and prompt you once it's ready to be installed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How to Sideload the OTA </p>
<p> This next method is a bit tougher, and has more steps. It should really only be used if your phone is for some reason, not getting the OTAs the regular way. </p>
<p> Basically, what you're going to be doing here is taking the a zip of the files that were changed and pushing it over to your device to force the update. You're going to want to pay close attention here, as there are many steps and if you do something wrong, it likely won't work. </p>
<p> Firstly, you're going to need to download the Android SDK from the Android Developer website. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Then you're going to want to open a command prompt or terminal (depending on the operating system of your laptop or desktop) in the folder that has the platform-tools. </p>
<p> Enable developer settings and USB debugging </p>
<p> Now that the SDK is installed. The next step is to enable developer settings and USB debugging, which will allow you to move onto the next step. </p>
<p> To do this, first go into Settings. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Then scroll down to System and tap on About Phone. </p>
<p> Next, tap on the Build Number seven times. Once you have tapped on it seven times, a dialog at the bottom of the screen will appear saying "you are now a developer". </p>
<p> Press back, so you're in the main settings page. Now you should see an option for Developer Options. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Go into Developer Options, and find USB Debugging. </p>
<p> Flip the switch for USB Debugging to on. </p>
<p> Now, plug your smartphone into your computer and click "OK" on the dialog box on your phone asking you to Allow USB Debugging while connected to that computer. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can use the command adb devices in the command prompt or terminal to make sure that it is reading your device too. If it says "unauthorized" that means you need to give it permission still. </p>
<p> Unlocking the bootloader </p>
<p> Before you can do anything, you're going to need to unlock the bootloader. That's another big selling feature for a Pixel smartphone. The fact that you can easily unlock the bootloader. </p>
<p> To get started, you are going to need turn off your phone completely. Then press and hold the power button and volume down button. This will take you into the bootloader menu. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can use command prompt to do this, type in adb reboot bootloader. </p>
<p> Now, to actually unlock the bootloader, you will need to use the command fastboot flashing unlock. </p>
<p> Moving back over to your phone, it will pop up with a dialog box asking if you are sure you want to unlock the bootloader. As it will factory reset your device. Use the volume buttons to highlight either yes or no, then use the power button to confirm it. </p>
<p> Once that is done, type in fastboot reboot-bootloader. </p>
<p> Flashing an OTA Update Image </p>
<p> Now, it's finally time to flash that OTA. Of course, if you've done this before, you probably don't need to worry about those last two steps. </p>
<p> And this also works without unlocking the bootloader. But to actually flash the entire factory image, you will need to unlock it. </p>
<p> In that command prompt or terminal window, type in adb devices to make sure that your device is connected. </p>
<p> Now, you're going to put the device into bootloader mode. You can turn it off and then press and hold the power button and volume down button, or type adb reboot bootloader into the command prompt. </p>
<p> Now, you are going to use the volume down button and press it twice. Until you have scrolled down to the Recover Mode option. Then press power to select it. Once you do that, it's going to look like your phone is restarting, then show an Android with a red exclamation mark over it. Now don't freak out and think that your phone is dead, this is supposed to happen. Hold the power button and press volume up. Now you'll be in recovery mode. </p>
<p> Being in Recovery Mode, you will not press the volume down button til you highlight the Apply Update From ADB option then press the power button to select it. </p>
<p> In command prompt, type in adb sideload [OTA file].zip as the command. You'll change the [OTA file] to the name of the ota file. It's usually easier to rename the file, so it's not a random string of numbers and letters. </p>
<p> In Recovery Mode, it will show the status of the update being pushed to your phone. Depending on the size, it could take a few minutes before it is completely pushed. But once it is, the phone will reboot back to the regular Android screen. </p>
<p> And then you're all set. You've successfully sideloaded an OTA to your Pixel smartphone. </p>
<p> That's just how easy it is to update your Google Pixel smartphone to Android 11. Of course, this works for more than just the Android 11 update on your Pixel. But also for security patches and the quarterly feature drops that Google does. </p>

<p> Huawei Delays Its 5nm Flagship SoC To Avoid Attention </p>
<p> Huawei was expected to unveil its new flagship HiSilicon Kirin chipset at the IFA 2020. At its keynote on September 3, Huawei made no announcement regarding the new Kirin 1000 / 9000 SoC. However, Walter Ji, President of Huawei Consumer Business Group (CBG) Europe, talked about Huawei's commitment to Europe. </p>
<p> The very next day, on September 4, its sister brand Honor announced a bunch of new products for the international markets. As per the latest report from China, Huawei decided to skip launching its new chipset to avoid drawing unnecessary attention. </p>
<p> Huawei delays flagship Kirin 1000 SoC launch at IFA 2020 </p>
<p> Huawei is at the center of US-China disputes over the technology sector. The Kirin 1000 will be Huawei's latest flagship mobile chipset. If everything went as per the plan, it could have been the world's first mobile chipset to debut with the latest 5nm process. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the company's HiSilicon unit designs Kirin chipsets, it uses third-party foundries to produce them. TSMC has been the long term partner for Huawei when it comes to producing its flagship Kirin chipsets. In May this year, the US Commerce Department made changes to the export rules which blocked TSMC from working with Huawei. </p>
<p> However, the Taiwanese company was allowed to fulfill previous Huawei orders until September 14. TSMC is reportedly working overtime to ship as many chipsets as possible, but it could still be a long way off. Huawei is reportedly doubtful over the inventory required for its upcoming flagship smartphones. </p>
<p> Huawei Mate 40 series will be launching soon with this new chipset </p>
<p> As of now, the company is rumored to have only 15 million units in stock. Last year, it sold 12 million units of the Mate 30 smartphones in its first three months. If you didn't know, the Mate 30 was the first flagship from Huawei to miss out on GMS support. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For now, the upcoming Kirin 1000 could be the last chipset from Huawei to hit the market. Based on the rumors, this new chipset will be powering the Mate 40, Mate 40 Pro, and Mate 40 Pro+ smartphones. On the other hand, domestic foundries in China lack the cutting-edge technology to produce the flagship Kirin chipsets. </p>
<p> Qualcomm is also looking to get permission from the US government to supply its chipsets to Huawei. While Huawei already uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon chipsets in its budget smartphones, the upcoming Huawei P50 series could become the company's first flagship device to carry a Snapdragon chipset. </p>
<p> As of now, Huawei hasn't officially mentioned anything about the delayed Kirin 1000 chipset launch. The new HiSilicon Kirin chipset will likely launch alongside the Mate 40 series in the next few weeks. </p>

<p> Android News / Huawei Unveils EMUI 11 With UX Improvements, New AI & Privacy Features </p>
<p> Huawei Unveils EMUI 11 With UX Improvements, New AI & Privacy Features </p>
<p> Huawei has announced the newest version of its Android-based UI, EMUI 11. It got announced during the company’s annual Huawei Developer Conference (HDC) in Dongguan, China. </p>
<p> Despite the number in its name, this version of Huawei’s software is not based on Android 11, at least not yet. It does, however, bring a number of new changes and features to the table. </p>
<p> EMUI 11 brings various UX improvements, along with some privacy changes </p>
<p> The company included a number of UX improvements here. There are some changes to the Always-On Display (AOD) feature, as you have much more customization options now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> New AOD themes are thrown into the mix, and customizable animated elements on the AOD. The ability to show any image, live video, GIF on the Always-On Display has been included, and that’s a huge step forward. </p>
<p> EMUI 11 also brings an updated design to the phone’s stock gallery app. The pinch gesture support has been included, similar to the one in Google Photos. We’ve seen more and more galleries do the same thing. This will allow you to switch between the Month and Day view. </p>
<p> The Albums tab has a new 4:3 layout, and new sort options. The animation engine has also been tweaked by the company. This resulted in a different set of animations, which are expected to minimize distractions while you’re using the phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Animated 'Live Icons' are also included </p>
<p> This variant also brought a new feature called “Live Icons”. ‘Live Icons’ are basically new, animated icons that the company opted to add in EMUI 11. They can be found in the notifications panel, and various Huawei applications. </p>
<p> A feature called ‘Smart Multi-Window’ is also here, and it allows users to adjust the size of floating windows and minimize them when they’re not in use. You’ll also be able to open apps in floating windows, from a dock. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> EMUI 11 also adds some new privacy features, and some AI improvements as well. Multi-screen collaboration 3.0 is a new AI feature. It allows users to simultaneously control three phone apps on tier PC, accept calls on a connected PC, and also use the device as a document scanner. </p>
<p> Now, when it comes to privacy, you’ll now see a new indicator icon in the status bar, which will indicate when an app is using your phone’s camera, mic, or location. </p>
<p> The Gallery app has received some security improvements as well, including on-device AI processing support, for example. These are only some changes in EMUI 11, as the company didn’t talk about absolutely everything, of course. </p>

<p> Hands-On With The Huawei FreeBuds Pro TWS Earphones </p>
<p> The Huawei FreeBuds Pro are a new pair of TWS earphones Huawei announced yesterday during HDC (Huawei Developers Conference). Those earbuds did arrive at the office recently, and we decided to share our initial impressions, and some hands-on images with the Huawei FreeBuds Pro. </p>
<p> The Huawei FreeBuds Pro hands-on images reveal familiar build materials </p>
<p> Let’s talk about the case first. It’s wider and shorter than the Huawei FreeBuds 3 case. It is made out of plastic, and we’re looking at glossy plastic here. That is something I never prefer, to be quite honest. </p>
<p> Don’t get me wrong, the case itself doesn’t feel flimsy, or poorly made, not at all. It’s just that it’s a magnet for dirt and fingerprints. I would have preferred a matte finish, but there you have it. The case does feel well-made, though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei’s logo is placed on the back of the case, while a Type-C port lays at the bottom. There is also a pairing button on the side, same as on the FreeBuds 3 case. This case does support wireless charging, by the way. </p>
<p> So, it’s basically a similar case to the one from the FreeBuds 3, but it comes in a different shape. This one has more of an egg-type-shape, compared to a circular design of the FreeBuds 3 case. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, when it comes to earphones themselves, these come with a silicone seal. The earbuds feature silicone ear tips, unlike FreeBuds 3, which are an open-ear type of earphones. </p>
<p> It all depends on your preference to be quite honest. If you prefer open-ear earbuds, these are not for you, if you do not prefer that type, well… you’ll be right at home here. There are three different ear tips in the box, by the way, one on the earbuds, and two additional ones on the side. </p>
<p> That way, you can change them to fit your ears perfectly. Even if you need different attachments, that’s not a problem at all. Swapping them is not an issue whatsoever. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These earbuds have shorter stems than the FreeBuds 3 </p>
<p> The earbuds come with shorter stems than the FreeBuds 3. These earbuds do resemble the Apple AirPods Pro earbuds, to a degree. Their stems are kind of box, which is a nice design touch by Huawei. </p>
<p> The earbuds feel really well in the ear, they’re quite light. The default silicone tips worked for my ears, so I didn’t even have to exchange them or anything of the sort. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In terms of sound quality, I haven’t really got the chance to test it properly. I did listen to some music, but not enough for me to talk in-depth about it. I’ll just say that the first impressions are positive, and leave it at that. I’ll be testing these earbuds in the coming weeks, so you can expect a full review to come in the near future. Until then, check out some Huawei FreeBuds Pro hands-on images down below. </p>

<p> Huawei / Huawei FreeBuds Pro Announced With "Intelligent Dynamic Noise Cancellation" </p>
<p> Huawei FreeBuds Pro Announced With "Intelligent Dynamic Noise Cancellation" </p>
<p> Huawei has announced a new pair of TWS earbuds during HDC (Huawei Developers Conference), the FreeBuds Pro. These are the company’s most advanced TWS earbuds to date. </p>
<p> The Huawei FreeBuds Pro are world's first TWS earbuds with Intelligent Dynamic Noise Cancellation </p>
<p> The company claims that these are the world’s first TWS earbuds to offer “Intelligent Dynamic Noise Cancellation”. These earbuds are shorter than the FreeBuds 3, and they are not of the open-ear type. </p>
<p> These earbuds do come with silicone earbud cups, which do a better job with noise cancellation. On top of that, the intelligent dynamic noise cancellation should also help with that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> They do ship with three different sizes of silicone earplugs, so you can fit them to your ear without a problem. Huawei says that it collected and analyzed ear canal data from over 1,000 real users around the world. </p>
<p> The company created a "wind-proof" design </p>
<p> These earbuds do look quite sleek. The stem is quite small, and it’s square-shaped. Huawei also says that this is a wind-proof design, which is especially great for when you’re running and cycling. </p>
<p> The Huawei FreeBuds Pro do support gestures as well. You can easily activate noise cancellation, adjust the volume, answer calls, press play, and skip songs using their stems. Those stems are touch-sensitive. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can simply swipe or pinch a specific area to take control. These earbuds will also learn from you, your operating habits, so that they minimize false touches. </p>
<p> Huawei engineers actually added a customized dynamic suspension between the speaker and a dynamic driver. This actually emulates the technique used by leading Hi-Fi manufacturers. It stabilizes the acoustic system of the entire earphone, and that reduces vibrations to deliver better sound. </p>
<p> Dynamic EQ Adjustment is also supported </p>
<p> The FreeBuds Pro also support Dynamic EQ Adjustment. That is a new feature which uses data from the in-ear microphone to automatically optimize the sound for the user’s specific ear type. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The noise cancellation in these earbuds is boosted up to 40dB. The earbuds can even detect your environment, and switch between Ultra Mode, Cozy Mode, and General Mode in order to cut out environmental noise. </p>
<p> You’ll get 4.5 hours of battery life out of these earbuds (55mAh battery per earbud), says Huawei, if you have noise cancellation on. If you don’t, they’ll last for 7 hours without the need to charge them with the included case (580mAh battery). </p>
<p> The Huawei FreeBuds Pro are also the "world's first smart dual-antenna Bluetooth earphones", says Huawei </p>
<p> These are also the world’s first smart dual-antenna Bluetooth earphones. These earbuds also support Awareness Mode and Voice Mode. Those two utilize the two microphones in order to help users hear the outside world when crossing the road, or talking to someone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The earbuds are fueled by the Kirin A1 chip, and they come in Ceramic White, Carbon Black, and Silver Front color variants. They do support wireless charging, and Bluetooth 5.2. The price tag is still unknown, but we’ll update the article once it’s released. </p>

<p> Huawei Announces HarmonyOS 2.0, Coming To Phones In 2021 </p>
<p> It's no secret that Huawei is working on developing an Android alternative for smartphones, which it calls HarmonyOS. The company has now confirmed that the first batch of HarmonyOS-powered phones would arrive as early as 2021. </p>
<p> During today's Huawei developer conference in Shenzhen, China, Consumer business CEO Richard Yu announced the company's second-generation operating system — HarmonyOS 2.0. A beta version of the HarmonyOS 2.0 SDK is already available for developers starting today. </p>
<p> However, the current iteration will only support smartwatches, car head units, TVs, and IoT devices. A smartphone version of the SDK will arrive in December this year, Yu confirmed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> "At the end of this year, the SDK tools and simulators of HarmonyOS 2.0 will be available to smartphones. Next year we will see smartphones running HarmonyOS 2.0," he said. Some of the HarmonyOS features Yu hinted include an adaptive user interface, voice recognition, device-to-device file transfers, and more. </p>
<p> It's unclear if the HarmonyOS 2.0 SDK will be available globally or will be limited to developers in China only. CEO Yu did mention Chinese developers during his keynote but no word was given on global rollout. We'll have to wait for confirmation on that. </p>
<p> Huawei announces HarmonyOS 2.0, makes it open source </p>
<p> Huawei is also making HarmonyOS open source. The OpenHarmony project will allow developers to build upon an open-source version of the OS, in a similar manner to that of AOSP (Android Open Source Project) for Android OS. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OpenHarmony project currently only supports devices with 128MB of RAM or below. Huawei expects to expand the memory limit to 4GB by April 2021. And come October 2021, the memory limit will be removed completely. </p>
<p> Huawei has been relying heavily on AOSP in recent times because of the US trade restrictions. The company isn't allowed to do business with American companies, essentially cutting it off from Google's Android OS, though it can still build on the AOSP version. </p>
<p> All of Huawei's current Android-based phones come without Google services. This is particularly a problem outside of China, as Android phones without Google apps such as Maps, Play Store, and Gmail would find it hard to attract buyers. That's possibly why the company is cutting down smartphone production next year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei does have a plan to improve the app ecosystem on its Google-less phones, though. Its HMS Core (Huawei Mobile Services) already have more than 1.6 million registered developers globally. The company also claims over 81,000 HMS Core apps and 700 million monthly active users. </p>
<p> Huawei's fighting the US sanctions at multiple fronts. While it already has alternatives for Android OS and GMS (Google Mobile Services), it's still struggling to find a solution in the hardware department. The latest US sanctions bar it from obtaining semiconductor chips from any manufacturer that uses US-origin software or technology. It'll be interesting to see how the company emerges out of all this. </p>

<p> Huawei Plans to Open HMS & HarmonyOS to Rival Manufacturers </p>
<p> Huawei's chairman has confirmed that the Chinese manufacturer plans to open up its HMS ecosystem to rival manufacturers. Incidentally, Huawei also plans to allow rival manufacturers to use its HarmonyOS. </p>
<p> Last year, Google had banned Huawei from using Google services. As a result, the Chinese manufacturer developed its own version of Google services. Thus Huawei developed the Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) ecosystem as a replacement for Google services on Android. </p>
<p> Simultaneously, Huawei has been developing an alternate mobile OS to rival Android -HarmonyOS. Zhang Ping An, Huawei's President of Consumer Cloud Services confirmed that the Chinese manufacturer is in ongoing discussions with other Chinese manufacturers. There is a high possibility that future Xiaomi phones, in China at least, could run HarmonyOS (HongmengOS) and HMS. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei wants to convince these Chinese manufacturers to move away from Google's Android OS and exclusively use HarmonyOS. If this tactic succeeds, Google could see its Android numbers dip sharply. </p>
<p> In fact, Guo Ping, Huawei's rotating Chairman, confirmed that Huawei will continue to focus on the development of the HMS ecosystem. The company will reach out to rival manufacturers as well in order to spread the ecosystem. </p>
<p> New sanctions imposed by the US restrict Huawei's access to smartphone chips. </p>
<p> Recently, new sanctions imposed by the US have now restricted Huawei's access to the latest technology and advanced microprocessor chips. The US Commerce Department announced these fresh sanctions, which restrict the sale of chips containing US-developed technology to Huawei. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Thus, any foreign semiconductor manufacturer will not be able to sell chips to Huawei, if these are developed using US software or technology. However, the sanctions include a caveat – the manufacturer would need to obtain a license first before supplying any technology to Huawei. </p>
<p> These new sanctions have hit Huawei's mobile business pretty hard. However, the Chinese manufacturer is already in discussions with AMD and Intel for the procurement of chips. Earlier this month, both, AMD and Intel had confirmed that the US had granted them licenses to provide chips to Huawei. </p>
<p> Though, Guo Ping did confirm that Huawei has sufficient chips for its telecom equipment, server, and cloud businesses. The challenge the Chinese manufacturer faces is with smartphone chips. Huawei consumes millions of these chips annually. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei hopes to develop an engaging ecosystem with rival manufacturers using HMS and HarmonyOS. </p>
<p> Zhang Ping An stated that Huawei's ambition is to develop an engaging ecosystem around HMS and Harmony OS. The Chinese manufacturer, he said, is under discussions with rival manufacturers and is discussing possible cooperation with them. </p>
<p> It will be interesting to see how this new ecosystem develops. Given the past failed experience with other manufacturers – including Microsoft – it seems to be an uphill battle for Huawei to remove Android from its pinnacle right now. </p>

<p> Lack Of Research & Development Talent Is The Biggest Worry For Huawei </p>
<p> Huawei is facing a dearth of research and development talent brought on by U.S. trade sanctions. As reported by Digitimes this may be their biggest worry going forward if they wish to stage a comeback. </p>
<p> This is an interesting report as it flies in the face of another recent story that argued Huawei would use the sanctions as an opportunity to grow and show strength. However, the sanctions have clearly had an impact as reports also suggest the Mate 40 series will be delayed due to the sanctions. </p>
<p> The U.S. clearly designed the trade sanction in order to create the maximum possible disruption for Huawei. A number of the impacts seen already have been things that most did not initially consider. However, retaining staff was certainly something that most had not foreseen at all. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei worried about losing R&D talent </p>
<p> Retaining and recruiting research and development talent is tough at the best of time for Huawei. However, in the position the company finds itself this becomes doubly difficult. </p>
<p> Despite the fact that de-Americanization and de-Sinicization sentiments are prevalent in the tech supply chains holding onto talent is still a problem. Right now strengthening Huawei's home-grown R&D momentum in the semiconductor conductor industry is Huawei's biggest task </p>
<p> This is because a lack of semiconductor chips is likely to be Huawei's biggest problem brought on by the trade sanctions. Therefore, procuring R&D talent is one of the biggest tasks to achieve a functioning homegrown semiconductor program. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> R&D talent have become scarce strategic resources </p>
<p> Insider resources have claimed that semiconductor research and development talent is now a scarce resource in itself. These trade sanctions now exacerbate the problem. </p>
<p> Right now Huawei and Hisilicon have had to halt their new chips R&D projects due to the sanctions. This has resulted in engineers taking long-term non-paid leave. Many of the R&D researches in Taiwan have already resigned. However, the team itself has not already dissolved. </p>
<p> Recently, reports suggested the Huawei could even drop out of the global smartphone market entirely due to the sanctions. At the time this seemed a little far-fetched but now these more wide-ranging impacts of the sanctions reveal themselves, the troubles Huawei face become clearer. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei will hope they are able to recover from such issues. However, the longer the sanctions go on the more problematic the situation becomes. With no solution in sight the chances of this saga ending soon also seem pretty low making Huawei's situation rather bleak. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2020/09/Huawei-Loses-Sony-Camera-Sensors-Another-Supply-Blow.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485145" filename="Huawei-Loses-Sony-Camera-Sensors-Another-Supply-Blow.html">
<p> Huawei Loses Sony Camera Sensors In Another Supply Blow </p>
<p> A scenario wherein Huawei loses access to Sony camera sensors would likely be a huge issue for the company. You know, in a hypothetical universe in which it still has any major suppliers left. But as it turns out, the latest blow to China's stranded tech giant probably won't change much. And seeing how long it took Sony to comply with the U.S. government's roundabout sanctions, this development pretty nonconsequential. </p>
<p> Relative to the fact that the world's leading mobile camera supplier just ditched perhaps its largest client. A move that cost Sony in the ballpark of half a billions dollars. More specifically, the company reduced its medium-term capital expenditures by $470 million allocated over the following three years. Well, not allocated, if you want to be pedantic. </p>
<p> Sony, of course, will be fine. Huawei's top rivals haven't really gone anywhere, but to be honest, neither has any global smartphone market growth forecast from late 2019. Not that anyone could have predicted the utter chaos this year has been throwing at us so far. It's just that Huawei really can't win here for the time being – even after spending the last year stockpiling chips. As it turns out, hoarding extremely complex systems humanity took millennia to mass-produce is difficult when Uncle Sam is angry at you. Impossible, even, as per some recent insider reports on Huawei's headaches. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Forced into frugality, Sony will miss Huawei at least just as much </p>
<p> Despite the glacial rate of management decisions, Sony did exhibit some foresight in other aspects of business before the Trump administration obliterated Huawei's smartphone component supply chains. It did so by signing an exclusive supply deal with Apple over its latest time-of-flight sensors. With those now heading to the next iPhones, Sony is likely to sell as many as it can produce. </p>
<p> This is ostensibly the main reason why the Galaxy Note 20 series featured a conventional laser autofocusing system over ToS tech. Namely, Samsung likely didn't want to go with the second-best option, why is also why it's now developing its own miniature depth-sensing radars. Which is pretty much what ToS solutions are all about, both in the context of smartphone applications and self-driving vehicles. </p>
<p> In the meantime, Sony will still be leveraging its newest imaging tech in its own products. Which is guaranteed to thrill all four remaining people on the planet who are aware the Xperia brand is technically totally alive and kicking. </p>

<p> Huawei Mate 40 5G Series To Not See Light Of The Day Until 2021 </p>
<p> If new information from Evan Blass is to be believed Huawei will not release the Huawei Mate 40 5G series device until 2021. There are several reasons to believe this piece of information. </p>
<p> Firstly, the clutches around Huawei has tightened by the US government. In fact, the company is not allowed to procure chipsets from its usual supplier, TSMC. </p>
<p> Besides, there is no information on whether MediaTek or Samsung has been granted permission to work with Huawei by the US government. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> According to the leaker, Even Bliss's latest tweet, the Huawei Mate 40 series 5G phones will not come this year. This also delays the potential launch of Huawei P50 series devices. </p>
<p> Notably, the Huawei P50 series phones were scheduled to arrive by March 2021. This is nothing new as previously Huawei delayed the launch of the Huawei Mate 30 series. </p>
<p> For the unaware, back in 2019, Huawei Mate 30 series launch was delayed in Europe by two months. And that is because of the Google software ban. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> From September 15, Huawei will supply stockpiled components until they last </p>
<p> Well, the restrictions imposed on Huawei by the US restricts the Chinese OEM to get chips from suppliers. Without proper license and permission, no supplier would be able to work with Huawei. </p>
<p> This means that Huawei will continue to supply stockpiled components until they last. Moreover, the picture after that is not yet clear. </p>
<p> However, one important concern about the information is whether the delay is subjected to every country or only international markets. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Because if the latter is true, then the Huawei Mate 40 series could arrive in the home country of China, on time. Besides, as per Phonearena, Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants is tipped that the unveiling will take place in October. </p>
<p> Till things get clarified officially, nothing can be said and confirmed as of yet. So, stay tuned with AndroidHeadlines to stay updated on this matter. </p>
<p> Huawei will release HarmonyOS powered phone next year </p>
<p> Earlier we have reported that Huawei has officially confirmed that it will release several HarmonyOS powered products, including smartphones in 2021. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And if we can take the speculation game ahead, Huawei may bring Huawei Mate 40 series power by HarmonyOS. Keep in mind that the Huawei Mate 40 series will be powered by Kirin chipset. </p>
<p> And there is a huge possibility that we might see it come equipped with HarmonyOS instead of Android. Besides, the Chinese OEM recently took the wraps off its HarmonyOS 2.0. </p>
<p> It will be interesting to see whether Huawei takes the big shot and brings an established smartphone lineup with HarmonyOS or will release a different phone with HarmonyOS. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Nothing is confirmed, and these are mere speculations. And things might get clearer in the coming months. So, take this piece of information with a pinch of salt. </p>

<p> Over the last few weeks, the same device was also spotted on various certification websites worldwide. Obviously, the company will be debuting its latest flagship Kirin chipset with the Mate 40 series. Under the hood, the Mate 40 series will come powered by the new HiSilicon Kirin 9000 processor. </p>
<p> Huawei Mate 40 Pro key specifications leaked </p>
<p> It will be the first Kirin chipset to be built on the 5nm process. Since the name of the chipset is not yet officially revealed, you have to take that with a pinch of salt. As per the leaks, the CPU on the new flagship Kirin chipset will come in a 1+3+4 tri-cluster arrangement. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The new Cortex-A78 cores should also further boost the performance of this chipset. In terms of GPU, the Kirin 9000 features the latest Mali-G78 GPU. As seen with the last couple of flagship chipsets from Huawei, the upcoming SoC will also come with a 5G modem onboard. </p>
<p> Huawei will also unveil the new 5nm Kirin 9000 SoC </p>
<p> Interestingly, the device listed on Geekbench runs on the last year's Android 10 out of the box. Still, the company should be offering the newly released EMUI 11. Moreover, the device will continue missing out the Google apps and services. </p>
<p> Instead of Google Play Store, the Mate 40 smartphones will include Huawei's own AppGallery for downloading the apps. The Mate 40 Pro variant used for benchmarking includes 8GB of RAM. The company should be launching all three devices in multiple storage options. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On Geekbench, the Mate 40 Pro has scored 1020 in the single-core and 3710 in the multi-core tests. Speaking of other specifications, the leaks already hinted the device to sport a quad-camera setup on the rear featuring a 108MP primary camera. </p>
<p> Like the P40 Pro launched earlier this year, the Mate 40 Pro will also come with dual punch-hole selfie cameras. It might feature a dual-curved OLED display on the front with 120Hz refresh rate support. To date, the company only offered 90Hz displays with its flagship smartphones. </p>
<p> With the Mate 40 series, the company is rumored to introduce the new 66W fast charging technology. Alongside the Mate 40 series, Huawei might also announce a new foldable smartphone as the successor to the Huawei Mate X. </p>

<p> Huawei Mate 40 Series Will Launch On October 22: Official </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate 40 series will launch on October 22, the company has confirmed. Huawei went to social media to confirm the arrival of its new flagship series, as we’re expecting to see two or three phones at the event. </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate 40 will launch on October 22, starting at 2 PM CET </p>
<p> The company will live-stream its press event on October 22, which is set to kick off at 2 PM CET / 8 AM EST / 5 AM PST / 1 PM BST. The official tagline for this event is ‘Leap Further Ahead’. </p>
<p> Based on the image that the company shared via Twitter (shown below), the focus will once again be on photography… amongst other things. The company also used the ‘Unprecedented Power is coming.’ tagline for this announcement. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate 40 flagship series will be fueled by the company’s brand new flagship SoC, the Kirin 9000. That will probably be its name. We initially thought it will be branded as the Kirin 1000, but that won’t be the case, it seems. </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate 40 series will likely consist out of the Mate 40, Mate 40 Pro, and Mate 40 Pro Plus. We’re only guessing here, based on what the company announced for the P40 series. It is possible that Huawei will stick to two flagships only. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei will likely use the metal + glass combo here </p>
<p> These phones will likely be made out of metal and glass, and at least some of them will offer curved displays. OLED displays are expected, and chances are that we’ll get high refresh rate panels on all models. </p>
<p> Android 11 will likely come pre-installed on all devices, but without Google Services, of course. The company’s new variant of EMUI is also expected on top of Android 11. Harmony OS is expected to arrive next year, though. </p>
<p> It remains to be seen what we’ll get in the camera department, but Huawei basically always delivers in that regard, at least when its flagships are concerned. You can expect quite a few cameras to be included overall. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate 40 leaks haven’t exactly been raining upon us lately, so for the most part, these devices are a mystery. Tune in on October 22, and find out what we’ll get. </p>

<p> Huawei MateBook X The Company's Most Powerful Laptop Yet </p>
<p> The Huawei MateBook X is the most powerful laptop this company has ever announced. This device has been announced during the company’s developer’s conference (HDC) today. </p>
<p> This is Huawei’s competitor for Apple’s high-end MacBooks, it’s essentially an ultrabook. It is made out of aluminum, and it’s really thin. It measures 13.6mm at its thickest part, while it weighs only 1kg. </p>
<p> The Huawei MateBook X features a 3K display with really thin bezels </p>
<p> This is the first notebook to feature the Infinite FullView Display. The device offers a 90-percent screen-to-body ratio, with very minimal bezels. This LTPS screen supports 3K (3000 x 200) resolution with 100-percent sRGB color. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The display comes with a 3:2 aspect ratio. It is touch-sensitive, and it comes with gestures support. You can, for example, utilize the ‘Fingers Gesture Screenshot’, all you have to do is swipe with three fingers towards the bottom of the display. </p>
<p> Eye Comfort mode is included in the package, and Huawei included a lot of brightness adjustment algorithms to ensure a consistent viewing experience no matter where you are. </p>
<p> The device is fueled by the 10th generation Intel Core processor (i5 or i7) with 16GB of RAM. Wi-Fi 6 is included, and it supports speeds up to three times of Wi-Fi 5. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This laptop comes with a 42Wh battery, working in collaboration with Huawei’s smart battery management. The device supports up to 9 hours of local media playback, for example. </p>
<p> A 65W charger is included in the box </p>
<p> A 65W charger is also included in the package, and it can replenish this battery rather fast, compared to many other laptops out there. It has an array of useful ports on the outside, so you won’t lack anything in that regard either. </p>
<p> This laptop’s full-size keyboard features scissors switches that offer 1.3mm of key travel, which should make typing more enjoyable. That keyboard is also illuminated, so typing at dark shouldn't be an issue. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Quad speakers are also a part of the package, with a split-frequency setup, and precise distortion correction. A dual microphone array is also included, and it should pick up sound really well, even at a distance. This is a Windows 10-based device, by the way. </p>
<p> The Huawei MateBook X will become available for purchase in September, in select regions. The Intel Core i5 variant with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage is priced at €1,599. The Core i7 model with the same amount of RAM and storage will be available for €1,799. </p>

<p> Huawei MatePad T10 & T10s Specs Leak, May Launch Soon </p>
<p> Huawei could be preparing to launch two new affordable Android tablets soon — the MatePad T10 and the MatePad T10s. Detailed spec sheets and first-look images of the two tablets have leaked online ahead of their release. </p>
<p> The two new Huawei tablets sport identical designs and also share a lot of specs. However, there are still enough differences in their internal components for potential buyers to separate them easily. </p>
<p> Huawei MatePad T10 and MatePad T10s specs leak </p>
<p> Both the Huawei MatePad T10 and T10s are powered by the company's in-house Kirin 710A chipset. It is a rather old octa-core processor from HiSilicon, featuring four Cortex-A73 cores operating at 2.0Ghz and four Cortex-A53 cores operating at 1.7GHz. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The two tablets run Android 10-based EMUI 10.1 and come with Huawei's AppGallery. The US government-imposed ban means the Chinese giant no longer have access to Google Mobile Services, which includes the Play Store, Google Maps, and more. </p>
<p> Huawei is equipping both MatePad T10 and T10s with a single 5-megapixel rear camera with autofocus and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera. </p>
<p> Neither of the two is getting an LED flash. The two tablets also both get a 5,100 mAh battery and a USB Type-C port. There's no sign of fast charging support on the two tablets. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> GPS, GLONASS, Beidou, and AGPS navigation systems, Bluetooth 5.1, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, 3.5mm headphone jack, and FM Radio and USB OTG support are also common across the two tablets. Both the tablets will be available in LTE variants as well. </p>
<p> So where do they differ? Well, while the MatePad T10s features a 10.1-inch 1920 x 1200 display, the vanilla MatePad T10 settles for a 9.7-inch 1280 x 800 panel. </p>
<p> Interestingly enough, despite the two featuring different display sizes, their overall dimension remains the same. As per the leaked spec sheet, both the tablets measure 240.2 x 159 x 7.85 mm and weigh 450 grams. This means the MatePad T10 will have bigger bezels all around. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The MatePad T10 also gets only 2GB of RAM and 16GB/32GB of storage capacity. The MatePad T10s, on the other hand, comes in 2GB+32GB and 3GB+64GB memory configurations. </p>
<p> Both the tablets support MicroSD cards of up to 512GB capacity. Huawei has also equipped both the tablets with dual speakers but only the MatePad T10s comes with Harmon Kardon sound. </p>
<p> There's no word yet on when Huawei plans to launch the new tablets. Pricing details of the two affordable Android tablets are also still a mystery. However, this leak comes from a pretty reliable source and the spec sheets look to be intended for official press releases for the Huawei MatePad T10 and MatePad T10s. So expect the company to make an announcement soon. </p>

<p> New Proof Tips Huawei Mate X2 To Launch In 2020 After All </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate X2 may launch in 2020 after all. As many of you know, this is Huawei’s upcoming foldable smartphone. The device was first rumored to launch this year, then next year, then this year again… and so on. </p>
<p> We’ve seen a lot of conflicting rumors when it comes to this phone. Well, the device just got certified by the WiFi Alliance. Considering the timing of that certification, it’s highly likely the phone will get announced in 2020. </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate X2 to launch in 2020, with Android 10 out of the box </p>
<p> It’s only the end of September, so… yeah, it’s almost certainly coming soon. This certification confirms that the device will ship with Android 10. It also confirms that Huawei’s EMUI 11 will come pre-installed on it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The device surfaced with a model number ‘TET-NX9’, in case you’re wondering. It confirms that WiFi 6+ wil be included. The certification listing did not really release any additional information. </p>
<p> A well-known tipster, however, did. He goes by the name of ‘Digital Chat Station’ on Twitter, and he did share some additional information about the device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, he also confirmed that the phone will be fueled by Huawei’s brand new flagship SoC, the Kirin 9000. That was to be expected, as pretty much every rumor suggested that will be the case. </p>
<p> For a long time, everyone thought that the chip will be called the Kirin 1000, but it seems that won’t be the case. Several rumors claim that Huawei will use the Kirin 9000 name, and this one is no different. </p>
<p> The device is expected to adopt a similar design to the Galaxy Z Fold 2 </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate X2 will have a different approach than the Mate X and Xs. How? Well, the phone will fold inwards, not outwards. In other words, it will likely have a similar approach to the Galaxy Z Fold 2. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Based on design patents, and rumors, Huawei opted to include a secondary display on the outside, similar to what Samsung has done. This way, the main display will be protected. </p>
<p> Bezels on the device are expected to be quite thin, by the way. The outer display is expected to sport a pill-shaped display camera hole, while we’re still not sure about the internal one. </p>
<p> The phone’s main display probably won’t sport a UTG (Ultra Thin Glass) display, unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 2. It will ship with a plastic display, though that will be an OLED panel. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone is expected to offer multiple camera sensors on the back, and those cameras will probably be quite compelling. A side-facing fingerprint scanner is also expected, while the phone will probably be made out of metal and glass. </p>

<p> Android News / Huawei Mate X2 Concept Includes Inward Folding Display & Dual Selfie Cameras </p>
<p> Huawei Mate X2 Concept Includes Inward Folding Display & Dual Selfie Cameras </p>
<p> Huawei is expected to launch the Mate X2 foldable smartphone in the coming weeks. Now, a concept video of the Huawei Mate X2 has surfaced online. The video is published by Jermaine (a.k.a Concept Creator) on his YouTube channel. It will be the successor to the original Huawei Mate X unveiled in early 2019. </p>
<p> Looks like the design of the device is inspired by the foldable smartphone patents of Huawei. Unlike the previously launched Mate X and Mate Xs, the upcoming Mate X2 will be coming with an in-folding design. There is also a large cover display on the outside. As shown in the video, the device will likely sport a glass back and aluminum frame. </p>
<p> Huawei Mate X2 concept design showcases in-folding display </p>
<p> While the Galaxy Z Fold 2 came with a 4.6-inch cover display, the Mate X2 is rumored to sport a slightly smaller 4.5-inch cover display. As seen on the flagship P40 series, Huawei's upcoming foldable will also feature dual punch-hole selfie cameras. Interestingly, there is no camera on the inside. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For capturing selfies or making video calls, users will have to live with the smaller cover display. On the rear, the Mate X2 comes with a large rectangular camera module featuring a quad-camera setup. For the first time, the Mate X2 might introduce a periscope-style telephoto camera on a foldable smartphone. </p>
<p> It could be the first Huawei smartphone with a 120Hz display </p>
<p> The power button with an integrated fingerprint scanner and volume rocker are placed on the right edge of the device. Speaking of the foldable display, the device sports a larger 8.03-inch in-folding display with a resolution of 2480 x 2220 pixels. The Mate X2 could also become the first-ever Huawei smartphone to support a 120Hz high refresh rate. </p>
<p> If you didn't know, the Huawei P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ smartphones launched earlier this year came with a 90Hz display. As per the previous leaks, Huawei will use CPI (colorless polyimide) instead of UTG (Ultra Thin Glass) to protect the foldable display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company will be sourcing foldable display panels from Samsung and China's BOE. During the Mate X launch, the company boasted about its no gap hinge design. It remains to be seen how Huawei handles the hinge of its first-ever in-folding smartphone. </p>
<p> Even the new Galaxy Fold 2's hinge leaves a small gap when folded. Last week, Huawei officially confirmed to unveil the Mate 40 series on October 22. It is being reported that the company will also launch the Mate X2 during the same event. </p>

<p> Huawei Mate X2 Foldable Smartphone To Launch Later Than Expected </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate X2, the company’s next foldable smartphone, is expected to launch later than expected. This information comes from a well-known analyst, Ross Young, who shared the information via Twitter. </p>
<p> Mr. Young claims that the Huawei Mate X2 won’t launch this year at all. He says that the main reason for it are the US government’s restrictions on Huawei. The company was forced to postpone the launch of its foldable. </p>
<p> As a reminder, the Huawei Mate X launched last year, while an improved variant of that device arrived last year as well. Well, it arrived last year in China, and early this year a global model was announced. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate X2 foldable smartphone expected to launch in 2021, later than expected </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate X2 was expected to see the light of day in 2020, but that won’t happen. We don’t know when exactly will it launch in 2021 either. Mr. Young did not give out any information regarding that. </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate X2, if rumors are to be believed, won’t feature an outwards-folding display. It will resemble the Galaxy Z Fold 2 much more than its predecessors. It will feature an inwards-folding design. </p>
<p> That is probably a better call, as you can protect the main display that way. The phone will have a secondary display on the outside, according to rumors, similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 2. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Back in August, that analyst actually shared some information about this device, but deleted his tweet soon after. That information stayed on the Internet, of course, but we wonder how accurate is it, considering that the tweet got deleted. </p>
<p> In any case, he said that the device will be fueled by the Kirin 1000 SoC, or Kirin 9000, depending on what will it be called. The phone was also tipped to include 8GB of RAM with 128GB of storage. A variant with 12GB of RAM was also rumored, along with 256GB or 512GB of storage. </p>
<p> The device is also tipped to offer 65W wired charging, though wireless charging was not mentioned. Android 11 is tipped to come pre-installed, along with EMUI 11, and something called ‘Laptop Mode’. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone is tipped to offer six cameras overall </p>
<p> A 40-megapixel main camera will be backed by a 40-megapixel ultra-wide camera, it seems. A 12-megapixel telephoto unit was also mentioned, with 3x optical zoom. The last camera on the back will be a 5-megapixel one, allegedly. </p>
<p> 16 and 32-megapixel front-facing cameras were also mentioned, while the phone’s main display is tipped to measure 8.03 inches. A 4.5-megapixel secondary display was also mentioned. </p>

<p> Huawei May Pair Its First Under-Display Camera With Five Rear Cameras </p>
<p> While under-display camera technology is seemingly the way forward selfie cameras on smartphones, the only major change we might see in the rear-camera setup in the near future is the addition of more sensors. And one of Huawei's upcoming smartphones might just do both. </p>
<p> According to a newly-discovered design patent, the Chinese company may be working on a smartphone featuring an under-display selfie camera and five rears cameras. The patent was filed with the CNIPA (China National Intellectual Property Administration) back in October 2019. The documentation which contains 24 product sketches was published earlier today. </p>
<p> A quad-camera setup on the back of smartphones is pretty much a norm these days. Even the entry-level phones now come with four rear cameras. However, we've so far seen only two major smartphones with fave cameras on the back. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Nokia 9.1 PureView arrived first back in February 2019, followed by Huawei's own P40 Pro+ earlier this year. Now, it appears the latter is developing yet another penta-camera phone. </p>
<p> Huawei patents a penta-camera phone design </p>
<p> Huawei's upcoming penta-camera phone features four sensors of identical sizes, while the other one is slightly smaller than the rest. There's also an LED flash within the same camera housing. </p>
<p> The hexagonal rear-camera housing on this phone is reminiscent of the Nokia 9.1 PureView. However, Huawei hasn't yet decided on the position of the rear camera module. It has patented three different designs, one each with the camera module on the top left side, on the top right side, and on the center. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The remainder of the back panel is clean with no apparent cutout for a fingerprint sensor. The phone will likely feature an in-display fingerprint scanner. The same goes for the selfie camera as well. The front of the phone is all screen. There's no notch or a punch-hole cutout. There's no pop-up module either. </p>
<p> All this suggests that the phone will feature an under-display selfie camera. However, the sketches in the patent documents primarily focus on the device's rear camera design. The ZTE Axon 20 5G recently launched as the world's first commercial phone with an under-display camera. </p>
<p> The bottom of the upcoming penta-camera Huawei phone has cutouts for a USB Type-C port, a microphone, and a speaker, while a 3.5 mm headphone jack and an additional microphone sit at the top. All the physical buttons, including the power button and volume control keys, are on the right side. The SIM card tray is seemingly located on the left side. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Since this is a design patent, there's nothing to take away in terms of the device's features or specs. Huawei is struggling to keep it's smartphone business intact following recent US sanctions. It remains to be seen if this smartphone design from the beleaguered Chinese company sees the light of day. </p>
<p> Even if it does, it's still unclear whether it'll arrive under one of Huawei's own smartphone lineups or its subsidiary HONOR will launch it. In either case, it'll surely be a high-end phone. Huawei also recently secured a design for a wrap-around display phone. </p>

<p> Huawei Will Not Launch A Smartphone With HarmonyOS This Year </p>
<p> In a recent development, the CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group has clarified that the company does not plan to bring a HarmonyOS-powered smartphone in 2020. </p>
<p> Notably, the company is still facing the ban by the US government. And it does not seem to boil down soon. In context to this, Huawei is also banned from using Google services on its devices. </p>
<p> This is the reason Huawei went ahead and developed its very own HarmonyOS (HongMengOS). Tech fraternity was pretty excited and was curious to know whether future Huawei phones will come with HarmonyOS instead of Android OS. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, note that HarmonyOS is not a smartphone dedicated-OS. It can also be implemented on other IoT devices from Huawei like tablets, PCs, etc. </p>
<p> Earlier we have highlighted that reportedly, Huawei was looking for opportunities to bring HarmonyOS to its smartphones, tablets, and PCs. Moreover, reports also suggested that the company is pretty adamant in equipping its future devices with HarmonyOS. </p>
<p> The main idea as elaborated by the CEO of Huawei Consumer Business, Richard Yu was to develop a Huawei ecosystem. In fact, this would be similar to what Apple is having currently. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Notably, recently Huawei unveiled new logos for HarmonyOS. The global and Chinese logos are pretty weird, as they are different for both the markets. The global HarmonyOS logo spots an "H" letter in it, while the Chinese logo is three separate dots. </p>
<p> Huawei CEO has refused the projection of introducing HarmonyOS-powered smartphone in 2020 </p>
<p> Now, new official reports claim that Huawei will not be bringing any new smartphones or devices powered by HarmonyOS. Though Huawei has an upcoming Huawei Mate 40 series smartphones lined up for a release, the company will stick with Android OS for now. </p>
<p> As per a report by Sina, in Yabuli Forum Qingdao Summit, CEO of Huawei Consumer Business, Richard Yu confirmed that the company has no plans for releasing a HarmonyOS-powered device in 2020. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, he did not rule out the fact that there will be no device in the next year. The company will continue to stick with the Android OS for now due to the already developed ecosystem. </p>
<p> But they will release devices with HarmonyOS to become self-reliant and develop their own eco-system in the long run. Notably, Huawei has already released a HarmonyOS-powered smart TV in China. </p>
<p> Huawei Mate 40 series to be the last device to come equipped with a Kirin chipset </p>
<p> A recent report by us highlighted the fact that the company might be unveiling a new chipset, reportedly the Kirin 1000 SoC in the upcoming IFA 2020. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Notably, the soon-to-be-releasing Huawei Mate 40 series will come equipped with Kirin 1000 chipset. This is mainly because of the trade war between the US and Huawei. </p>
<p> This has put a stop to any work between Huawei and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which develops Kirin chipsets for the former. </p>
<p> When asked about this chip-problem, the CEO did not address the question properly but mentioned that the company is looking for a solution at the moment. </p>

<p> Huawei Petal Search Aims To Compete With Google </p>
<p> Petal Search, which started off as a workaround for Huawei users has now turned into a much bigger project. Reports suggest that although the service began as a replacement for unavailable Google services, the project now wishes to compete with the tech giant as reported by Android Authority. </p>
<p> Given all the issues Huawei is currently experiencing with regards to its mobile device production moving into this space might be a sensible move. One report suggested that in a worst-case scenario Huawei could stop making mobile phone all together due to sanctions. The company also faces a dearth for R&D talent as it struggles to recruit under current restrictions. </p>
<p> Therefore, an attempt to go big with the Petal Search service may prove to be one of the few avenues available Huawei. However, the suggestion that they would compete with Google is a lofty one at best. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei's Petal Search set to go head-to-head with Google </p>
<p> Reports suggest that Huawei has plans to expand Petal Search to act more like a general search engine. This means expanding its scope from its previous limited operations. </p>
<p> It seems that the ban on Huawei using Google has spurred the company on. They now have the desire to fill the gaps left behind by expanding Petal Search as a genuine competitor. </p>
<p> As of now, Petal Search supports news, image and video, shopping, and flight searches directly from the search bar. Although this does not always work for all users. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company also announced some key search partners at the Huawei Developer Conference. These span four categories which are news, shopping, local businesses, and travel. </p>
<p> This means companies can now plug their results into Petal Search. They will do so using an ever-growing set of APIs. </p>
<p> Huawei will rely on these search partners to provide aggregated results like all other search providers. This allows them to provide direct feeds on things like shopping results or real-time data streams such as flight seats. Regional partners are also key to this in order to provide local results. </p>

<p> The company currently operates this engine in Spain and Turkey so has the capability to be a genuine rival to Google there. In other countries, Petal Search still relies on search engine partners in other countries. However, it has plans to its own service. </p>
<p> There is currently no official timeline for this worldwide roll out. However, Huawei says it will come over time. Given the platform is only four months old this sort of growth is very impressive. </p>
<p> The service is clearly a long way off genuinely being a competitor for Google or Bing for example. However, it does appear that the platform and foundation is there to make something powerful enough to rival the big boys at some stage in the future. </p>

<p> Huawei Procuring Semi-Assembled Chips To Overcome The US Chip Ban </p>
<p> The mounting US sanctions have led Huawei to more focusing on its survival than developing cutting edge technology. Moreover, the new amendments made by the US commerce department in May this year have forced TSMC to stop accepting new orders from Huawei. The US chip ban on Huawei comes into effect from September 15. </p>
<p> Though the new rule change will not affect the previous orders, they need to fulfill by midnight of September 14. According to a Nikkei Asian report, Huawei and its suppliers are working around the clock as the deadline is getting nearer. </p>
<p> US chip ban forces Huawei to fight for its survival </p>
<p> The company is mentioned to be stockpiling 5G mobile chipsets and other components from key suppliers including MediaTek, Realtek, Novatek, and RichWave. As per the source, the company is also buying semi-assembled products and that too without being tested. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Furthermore, suppliers like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are trying to fulfill the memory chip orders placed earlier this year. For the camera lens, Huawei is procuring them from Largan Precision and Sunny Optical Technology. Even after the US chip ban coming into effect on September 15, Huawei could survive for a shorter period. </p>
<p> However, the company has to address the issues in order to survive in the long-term. As per a recent report, Qualcomm could get a license from the US government to supply its Snapdragon chipsets for Huawei. Without flagship chipsets from Qualcomm, Huawei can longer compete in the flagship smartphone segment. </p>
<p> The upcoming 5nm Kirin SoC could be the last chipset from Huawei </p>
<p> The upcoming 5nm HiSilicon Kirin SoC could also be the last high-end Kirin chip from Huawei. While Huawei designs its Kirin chips in-house, it uses the third-party foundries for producing them. TSMC has been the sole producer of high-end Kirin chips for a very long time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With no advanced foundries in China, the company has nowhere to look but end its production. Once the company runs out of current stock, it might suffer a 75 percent loss in smartphone shipments in 2021. The US equipment and technology in the semiconductor industry has been an integral part of the global supply chain. </p>
<p> Huawei will no longer have access to them without getting a special license from the US government. On the other hand, the Chinese government is also offering huge incentives to boost the domestic semiconductor industry. Huawei has already scheduled its IFA 2020 keynote for September 4, where it might unveil its new flagship Kirin chipset. </p>

<p> Huawei Reportedly Has Only 8.8 Million Kirin 9000 Chipsets </p>
<p> Huawei was expected to unveil the flagship 5nm Kirin chipset during its IFA 2020 keynote earlier this month in Berlin. However, the company has indefinitely postponed the unveiling to avoid unnecessary attention. According to the latest report from China, Huawei was able to procure only 8.8 million Kirin 9000 chipsets. </p>
<p> This is almost 40 percent less than the 15 million order the company is expected to have placed with Taiwanese contract chipmaker TSMC. With such a low amount of stock, the company might not be able to match up with the demand. For comparison, Huawei has sold 12 million Mate 30 smartphones in the first three months of launch. </p>
<p> Huawei only procured 60 percent of the expected Kirin 9000 chipsets </p>
<p> Huawei's upcoming Mate 40 smartphones will come powered by the company's all-new 5nm Kirin chipset. The company is expected to launch these new flagship smartphones by the end of September or early October. However, a recent report suggests the company has reportedly postponed the launch to early 2021. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Moreover, the Kirin 9000 could have been the world's first mobile chipset to be built on the 5nm process. With the newly launched 4th-gen iPad Air, Apple introduced the A14 Bionic as the world's first 5nm chipset. </p>
<p> Will it be the world's first 5nm chipset with an integrated 5G modem? </p>
<p> If launched before the upcoming Snapdragon 875 SoC, the Kirin 9000 could become the world's first 5nm chipset with an integrated 5G modem. According to the source, there are a total of 22,000 5nm wafers. With an output of around 400 good dies per wafer, total production might not exceed the reported 8.8 million mark. </p>
<p> Huawei can't even replace its own Kirin chipset with alternatives from companies like Qualcomm and MediaTek. The suppliers also need to get permission from the US government to supply their chipsets to the banned Chinese company. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As per recent reports, Qualcomm, Samsung, and SMIC have requested approval from the US to supply to Huawei. Since domestic semiconductor companies in China lack the advanced technologies to produce 5nm chips, Huawei's HiSilicon unit has to completely depend on foreign companies for their flagship chipsets. </p>
<p> The orders from the US Commerce Department, released in May this year, banned all the chipmakers using American technology from working with Huawei. While TSMC immediately stopped accepting new orders from Huawei, it did receive permission to fulfill the previous orders by September 14. </p>
<p> Currently, Huawei cannot do anything but wait for its suppliers to get permission from the US government. We'll have to wait and see how this plays out for its flagship lineup. </p>

<p> Huawei's Chip Reserves Much Smaller Than First Suspected </p>
<p> Huawei's chip reserves are even smaller than originally suspected as TSMC left it in a pretty rough spot in mid-September. Insiders previously revealed Huawei received barely over half of its final chip order placed with the Taiwanese manufacturer. More specifically, TSMC ostensibly delivered roughly 8.8 million chips out of a 15-million order, as Chinese media widely reported in recent weeks. </p>
<p> There's been no shortage of speculation on how long could Huawei maintain something resembling a release schedule with that stockpile. Now, however, it would appear its life expectancy is shorter than originally anticipated. As far as actually competitive silicon goes, it almost certainly won't have components for anything beyond the Mate 40 series. In fact, it's dubious whether the said 8.8-million stockpile even consists of solely Kirin 9000 chips. </p>
<p> That's assuming it's just sitting on next-generation chipset designs, mind you. Which isn't outside of the realm of possibility, to be fair. Yet without constant prototype production, the Kirin design team's work can hardly proceed as usual. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Chip stockpile or not, is this the end of the road for Huawei? </p>
<p> As a reminder, TSMC is unable to do any kind of semiconductor business with Huawei as of September 15th. And while a lot of damage has already been done to tis near-term ambitions, the company itself won't be going anywhere. If anything, Huawei's using this turn of events as a lesson in sustainability. But coming up with competitive SoC designs is easier said than done. Well, at least if you can't use American IP and are forced to start from scratch. </p>
<p> This newest report out of the Far East hence adds some context to Huawei's predicament. With that said, the gravity of the situation was pretty well-established even beforehand. As while the lack of cutting-edge chips is crippling to its smartphone ambitions, it's not like other key components are freely available. For example, Sony's leading camera sensors are currently just as unreachable as TSMC's foundry business. </p>
<p> And unless the U.S. ban magically disappears in the following weeks, missing out on one smartphone generation will be the least of Huawei's worries. Of course, that isn't to say the company return to its explosive growth trajectory. But with active opposition from Washington, it's going to be years until its standalone semiconductor designs stand a chance of being competitive. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In fact, there's arguably no such thing as a "standalone" architecture in today's day and age. And with Huawei's stockpiling plan falling flat, it's apparently only a matter of time before what remains of its mobile unit follows suit. </p>

<p> Huawei Patents Smartphone Design With Cross-Shaped Rear Cameras </p>
<p> Earlier this month, a newly published Huawei patent revealed the smartphone with an under-display selfie camera on the front and a penta-camera setup on the rear. Now, the company's latest patent shows a similar-looking Huawei smartphone but with a cross-shaped camera setup on the rear. </p>
<p> Huawei filed the patent in October last year with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA). According to Letsgodigital, the patent was published on September 18 also includes a total of 24 images. </p>
<p> New patent showcases Huawei smartphone with cross-shaped camera module </p>
<p> The front of the smartphone is all display and there is no sign of a pop-up camera. Additionally, the lack of notch or punch-hole cut-out suggests the company might opt for an under-display selfie camera. On the rear, it comes equipped with a cross-shaped camera module featuring four sensors and an LED flash. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The square shape of the bottom sensor confirms it to be a periscope-style zoom camera. In the intersection of the camera setup is an LED flash. There are three iterations of the same design with the rear camera module placed in the right, center, and left position on the top rear. </p>
<p> Notably, the rear camera setup still protrudes out a little. Even the frame on this device is very thin with its curved front and back. Last year's Mate 30 Pro smartphone was also launched with a similar design where it replaced the physical volume rocker with a software-based alternative. </p>
<p> There is even a 3.5mm audio jack as well </p>
<p> Interestingly, the patented design still comes with a power button and volume rocker on the right edge. There is even an additional button on the left side. On the top, it comes with a 3.5mm audio jack and a microphone. The bottom edge houses the SIM card slot, speaker, and a USB Type-C port. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Since this is only on a design patent, there is no guarantee that the company will end up using it for any of its upcoming smartphones. Obviously, the company won't be launching the upcoming Mate 40 series with this design. As per the leaks, the three smartphones in the Mate 40 lineup will be coming with dual punch-hole selfie cameras. </p>
<p> On the rear, these upcoming devices will sport a total of five camera sensors. Recently, a new Huawei patent showcased a smartphone with a wrap-around display. It comes with a flexible display wrapped around to the back of the device from the left side. However, Xiaomi has already launched a similar-looking smartphone called Mi Mix Alpha. </p>
</doc>
<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2020/09/huawei-smartphone-design-wrap-around-display.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485161" filename="huawei-smartphone-design-wrap-around-display.html">
<p> Huawei Developing A Smartphone With Wrap-Around Display </p>
<p> Over the last couple of years, Huawei has launched a couple of foldable smartphones and also patented several futuristic-looking devices. As per the new patent filing spotted by LetsGoDigital, Huawei seems to be currently working on a new smartphone featuring a wrap-around display. </p>
<p> The company filed this new design patent with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA). According to the patent filed on March 17 and published on September 11, the design of the device looks quite similar to the Mate X and Mate Xs foldable smartphones — minus the foldable mechanism. </p>
<p> New design patent reveals Huawei smartphone with wrap-around display </p>
<p> Like the current-gen flagship smartphones, it sports an edge-to-edge display with minimal bezels on the front. However, the display will be wrapped around to the back of the device from the left side. On the right edge, it will sport both the power button and volume rocker. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the company already got rid of the hardware buttons on some of its flagship devices, the reference design in this listing still features them. As seen on the Xiaomi Mi MIX Alpha concept smartphone unveiled in 2019, Huawei could also opt for a similar flexible OLED display. </p>
<p> There will be no front cameras on this device </p>
<p> As the left edge of the device is completely covered by the display, the company has to make software tweaks to avoid accidental touches. With the dual-sided display, Huawei will be skipping the front camera sensors. The tiny strip on the rear will be holding the camera sensors and LED flash. </p>
<p> Moreover, the camera setup on the back of the device also serves as the front camera. So, the high megapixel cameras can capture beautiful selfies. As with all patents, there's no guarantee that this design will be used for its next upcoming smartphone. Based on the rumors, Huawei's next foldable smartphone might come with an in-folding design. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Furthermore, it might look similar to the Galaxy Z Flip clamshell foldable smartphone. The already launched Mate X and Mate Xs foldable smartphones come with a plastic display. Both these devices are more prone to scratches and damage than the foldables with in-folding design. </p>
<p> In the coming weeks, Huawei will also launch the flagship Mate 40 and Mate 40 Pro smartphones powered by the all-new 5nm Kirin chipset. The company could launch its new foldable smartphone during the same launch event. However, some leaks suggest the new foldable from Huawei will launch separately later this year. </p>

<p> Android News / Huawei Could Stop Making Smartphones, In The Worst Case Scenario: Report </p>
<p> Huawei Could Stop Making Smartphones, In The Worst Case Scenario: Report </p>
<p> A report from Tianfeng International analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has indicated that Huawei could stop making smartphones in a reasonable worst-case scenario. As reported by CN Tech Post Huawei will be negatively effected after September 15 but the extent is still unclear. </p>
<p> After September 15 Huawei will no longer have access US-developed technology in fresh sanctions. The US Department of Commerce also added Huawei's 38 subsidiaries in 21 countries onto its "entity list". </p>
<p> This will restrict Huawei's access to technology such as microprocessor chips. MediaTek has recently applied for permission to start supplying Huawei, however. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Taiwanese manufacturer may be able to alleviate some of the burden on Huawei if their application is approved. However, in any case, when these sanctions come into place on September 15 they will have a negative impact on the company and its ability to operate. </p>
<p> Huawei could stop making smartphones </p>
<p> Ming-Chi Kuo's report believes that the best-case scenario for Huawei is simply a significant market share reduction. However, in the worst case the company may cease to manufacture smartphones. In this case, the shares of Apple, OPPO, Vivo, and Xiaomi would likely increase to fill the void. </p>
<p> Huawei has higher requirements for the camera, HDI, storage and 5G chip parts specifications. This also means an increased unit price compared to competitors. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Therefore, if Huawei's competitiveness in the smartphone market declines then so will the innovation in technology. Without Huawei, Kuo argues that technological upgrading of the camera, storage, 5G chips will decrease. </p>
<p> This could, in turn, have the knock-on effect of cut-prices in 2021. This is because as smartphone manufactures are unable to create new advancements their only edge will be in cutting prices. </p>
<p> MediaTek expected to become Huawei's main supplier </p>
<p> As mentioned, MediaTek has put in an application to supply Huawei after September 15. Previously, MediaTek supplying Huawei would not have been a problem as the ban did not affect third party suppliers. This was in the case of supplying standard products, meaning Huawei Kirin chips were still blocked. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Reports suggest that Huawei may have ordered 120 million chips from MediaTek. Supposedly, seven of the companies mobile phones released this year have used MediaTek chips. </p>
<p> Under these new restrictions, MediaTek has to submit an application to supply Huawei after September 15. As of yet, there is no indication whether this will be successful or not. </p>
<p> The ability for Huawei to establish supply networks could be central to its continued operation in the smartphone market. If this becomes extremely difficult then perhaps Kuo's worst-case scenario prediction of the company pulling out could come true. </p>

<p> Huawei To Produce Only 50 Million Smartphones In 2021 </p>
<p> According to a report by The Elec, Huawei claims to drop down the production numbers in 2021. Notably, the company will reportedly produce only 50 million smartphones in 2021. </p>
<p> Huawei is the world's largest smartphone manufacturer in terms of shipment. And this reduced number is definitely going to hit hard on this recently received crown by the company. </p>
<p> For the unaware, Huawei became the world's largest smartphone manufacturer in Q2 of 2020. Besides, it achieved this feat by surpassing the mammoth, Samsung. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Many believe that it is because of the fact that China was able to re-group quickly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, Samsung was hit hard in the Europe and North American market were the outbreak was the worse. </p>
<p> But now recent reports suggest that Huawei has decided to produce only 50 million smartphones in the next year. For comparison's sake, it is a 74% drop from the total expected shipment in 2020. </p>
<p> Additionally, the figures for the previous year, i.e. 2019, stand at 240 million units. And this year it is speculated to reach 190 million units, even in this pandemic. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> US trade ban is the primary reason behind Huawei's fewer production in 2021 </p>
<p> Huawei is targeting lower shipments because of the trade restrictions imposed on the company by the US. If you are living under a rock, Huawei is banned from using Google services. </p>
<p> On top of that, it is also not allowed to purchase semiconductors for smartphones and laptops from manufacturers after September 15. </p>
<p> Manufacturers like Qualcomm, MediaTek, and even TSMC, which manufactures Kirin chipsets for Huawei, is also restricted to supply chipsets to the company. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Besides, this is the reason the upcoming Huawei Mate 40 series will be the last smartphones from the company to be powered by Kirin chipset. </p>
<p> However, MediaTek and other manufacturers have sent their applications to the US government, to be able to supply chipsets to Huawei. But that matter is awaiting confirmation. </p>
<p> In fact, Huawei's competitor Samsung will benefit from this crisis the former is facing due to the trade ban. And will eventually make its way to the top once again in 2021. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei is set to release a HarmonyOS powered smartphone in 2021 </p>
<p> Amidst all of this, Huawei is also trying to reduce its dependency on Google. In an earlier report, we have highlighted that Huawei is all set to release a HarmonyOS powered smartphone in 2021. </p>
<p> Moreover, the company is looking to bring smartphones, laptops, other IoT devices powered by HarmonyOS. This will help Huawei to create an ecosystem of HarmonyOS products. </p>
<p> At present, China's Huawei is all dependent on SMIC to produce some of the Kirin SoCs. These will be used in budget and mid-range smartphones. </p>

<p> Huawei Watch Fit Review: A Perfectly-Sized Hybrid Wearable </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch Fit is essentially a lightweight smartwatch, with a bunch of fitness-oriented features. </p>
<p> Huawei supplied us with a review unit of the Huawei Watch Fit, but didn’t have a say in our opinion, nor did they see this review before you. We’ve been using the device for a couple of weeks before forming an opinion. </p>
<p> Huawei had released quite a few wearables in the last couple of years. Its latest batch delivered two products, the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro and Huawei Watch Fit. These two gadgets are quite different. They do offer some of the same fitness and software features, but in terms of design, and targeted audience, they couldn’t be more different. We’ve already taken a look at the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro, and now it’s time to do the same with the Huawei Watch Fit. </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch Fit is both a fitness tracker and a smartwatch in one. Think of it as a small smartwatch that has a huge focus on fitness. I’ve been using this gadget for almost three weeks now, and quite frankly, I had a good time with it. It does most things really well, though it does stumble in some areas. Software is once again a sore point for one of Huawei’s wearables, even though things look a bit better than they did last year. </p>
<p> This gadget’s pluses definitely outweigh its minuses, and that is something you should remember even before we get into it. Keeping its price in mind may also be a good idea, as the Watch Fit costs around $100. That being said, let’s get down to the Huawei Watch Fit review, starting with its design. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A great-looking hybrid that is also comfortable to wear </p>
<p> Those of you worrying about its build materials based on its price tag… you shouldn’t be. The device is made out of metal, well, its body is. Not only is it made out of metal, but its body is really slim at 10.7mm. This device is also quite light at 21 grams, without the strap. It comes in four colors, Graphite Black, Mint Green, Sakura Pink, and Cantaloupe Orange. So, you have plenty of choices here. </p>
<p> The size of the device itself is also perfect, in my opinion. On my average-sized wrist, it looks fine, and I imagine it’ll be a good size for the opposite sex as well. The watch is really comfortable to wear, partially thanks to a comfortable silicone strap that comes with it. Unfortunately, though, you won’t be able to use your existing watch straps with this thing. Why? Well, it has proprietary connectors. It’s really easy to replace, but you’ll need Huawei’s original straps in order to do that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The bezels are thin, and the glass is curved </p>
<p> The watch has an elongated, square shape, and the same goes for its display. The bezels are quite thin, and the glass on top of the display is curved. That was actually a great design choice by Huawei, as I really enjoy scrolling on this thing, way more than I do on regular watches with flat glass. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed using it. There is a single button on this watch, and it’s placed on the right side. </p>
<p> Right next to that button, you’ll notice a microphone, by the way, while a speaker is not included. At the very bottom of the watch, you’ll spot a heart rate sensor. The Huawei Watch Fit does not support wireless charging, by the way, you’ll need to use the included charging cradle. That cradle doesn’t feel all that good, it actually feels cheap, but you’ll rarely use it. Yes, this thing’s battery life is great, but more on that later. </p>
<p> The display is both sharp and bright enough </p>
<p> The display is… well, it’s really good. The Huawei Watch Fit features a 1.64-inch 456 x 280 panel. This is an AMOLED display, and it is touch-sensitive, of course. The display is quite responsive, and thanks to the curved glass on it, I actually enjoyed using it… quite a bit. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed using it, to be quite honest. The colors on the display are quite punchy, and the blacks are black. This is not one of the best AMOLED panels I’ve seen on smartwatches, but it’s far from being the worst. It’s more than good enough. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can see what’s going on the display, even when outside, even though it’s not exactly the brightest display around. I did notice that on occasion, it did not register my swipe the way it should, but instead, it registered it as a press on the display. That didn’t happen often, but it’s something worth noting. I’ve had this happen on some other Huawei smartwatches as well, by the way. Overall, though, this display is definitely good enough, especially when you consider the price tag of the Huawei Watch Fit. </p>
<p> You'll be hard-pressed to make the Huawei Watch fit stutter </p>
<p> Now, the performance of the watch is really good. Do note that the software is the issue, as is on other Huawei watches I’ve been using lately, but more on that later. When it comes to sheer watch performance, it’s great, actually. The watch is extremely responsive, and I did not notice any lag. An occasional stutter is there, but it’s so rare, you’ll hardly even notice it. The watch is extremely smooth, and the Kirin A1 is probably the main reason why. That processor has been used in many other Huawei wearables, including the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro, the company’s flagship smartwatch. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When it comes to navigating the UI, opening apps, and general usage of the watch… well, everything works great. I really can’t complain, as the performance is comparable to Samsung’s Tizen watches, and better than on any Wear OS watch I’ve used. That being said, the software itself is the issue, as is the case on other Huawei watches I’ve used in the last year or so. I’ve stumbled on quite a few issues with it, mostly the notification system, to be quite honest, so let’s talk more about that. </p>
<p> Software could be better, especially the notifications system </p>
<p> So, for the most part, the software is okay, except for the notification system. Don’t get me wrong, the notifications are coming, there’s no issue with that, but they’re not synced with the phone. Once you remove a notification from the notification shade on your phone, it will remain on the watch. The same happens if you remove it from your watch, it will stay on your phone. You have to do it on both sides, separately. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On top of that, you also can’t swipe away a single notification from the watch, until you open it. So, you cannot swipe it away while browsing through a bunch of them. In order to remove all of them, you need to scroll all the way down to the clear all button. The thing is, scrolling is not the fastest on the watch, so that can be quite a chore if you have plenty of notifications listed on that screen. </p>
<p> You cannot reply to notifications </p>
<p> The watch also does not allow you to reply to notifications. It basically does not allow you to do anything with them, except read them, and remove them. I also had an issue with notification doubling. If I have an active notification on my phone, like for listening to music or something, it tended to appear on the watch. The thing is, it appeared several times. I’ve had the same notification listed like three times for some reason. The first one appeared immediately, while the other two later on. The bottom line is, the notification system needs work, that’s for sure. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> I would have also appreciated some more customization options here. The watch doesn’t really allow you to do much with the home screen pages. The watch faces that you have access to are also somewhat limited, You can tweak some of them, but it would be great if the watch allowed us to do more. This very much feels like a software that is in early stages, while the general performance is good and the watch is stable, many features are still missing. I do hope Huawei is working on improving things, as the software side of things is really holding their wearables back. </p>
<p> I had some connection issues with non-Huawei devices </p>
<p> Now, the Huawei Health app also tended to disconnect while I was using the Huawei Watch Fit with a OnePlus phone. That’s due to Android itself, it seems, not OnePlus in particular. Locking the app in the background, and removing any battery-saving restrictions didn’t help. Such issues were not present when paired to the Huawei P30 Pro, though. That is something that Huawei needs to find a way around, as many people will want to use this thing with smartphones that don’t come from Huawei. </p>
<p> There are 96 workout modes available on the watch </p>
<p> On the fitness side of things, this watch is actually really well-equipped. That is to be expected, considering that its name implies it’s a fitness wearable. Huawei did a really good job not only including various fitness-oriented functions on this watch, but combining them with the software. In that regard, the software is good, really good, the complete opposite to notifications. So, let's see what the watch offers, in terms of fitness. </p>

<p> This watch comes with 12 kinds of animated quick-workouts, as Huawei calls them. Some of those are: full-body stretch, ab ripper, exercise at work, and so on. On top of that, there are 44 standard movement demonstrations included. That’s not all, though. The company included 96 workout modes on this watch, and that’s more than you’ll find on most watches out there, if not more than you’ll find on all of them. </p>
<p> A heart rate sensor is also included </p>
<p> I, of course, couldn’t have tested all of those workouts. I did, however, try out the running and biking aspects, and everything worked fine. The results were close to those offered on Wear OS and Tizen watches I’ve used, so it’s all good in that regard. The watch does have a heart-rate sensor on the bottom, and it can keep track of your heart-rate 24/7. It is also equipped with Oxygen Saturation Detection (SpO2). </p>
<p> Huawei also included a special feature for women, as the watch can keep track of your menstruation cycles and estimate ovulation date. That’s not all, as the watch acts as a sleep tracker as well, thanks to Huawei TruSleep 2.0. It will not only track your sleep habits, and analyze them, but also provide advice on how to improve your sleep quality. Sleep tracking was a bit of a hit and miss in my testing, but that was the case on every single smartwatch and fitness tracker I’ve used, so… there you have it. </p>
<p> If you’re getting stressed out often, well, this watch can keep track of that too. The Huawei TruRelax technology is included, for an all-day stress tracking. The Huawei Watch Fit will also provide you with suggestions in form of breathing exercises, which should help you relax. All in all, this watch is extremely well-equipped in the fitness department. </p>
<p> The battery lasts for over a week, even with heavier use </p>
<p> All smartwatches from Huawei that I’ve used in the last year or so offer stellar battery life. The Huawei Watch Fit is no different. Well, its battery life is worse than something you’d get with the Huawei Watch GT 2 or GT 2 Pro, but it’s still amazing. The company touts a 10-day battery life with the Huawei Watch Fit, well, I managed to squeeze out 9 days out of it. Do note that I have been using almost everything the watch has to offer, though, so those results are still great. Most smartwatches these days offer 1-2 days of battery life, so… this is above and beyond of what others offer. </p>
<p> I’m primarily thinking of Wear OS, Tizen, and Apple watches. Pretty much every single one of those watches offer 1 or 2 days of battery life with regular use. The Huawei Watch Fit can monitor everything and offer days of battery life with no issue. Once it’s running low on battery, you’ll need to reach for a proprietary charger that comes with it. I would have preferred a wireless charger, to be quite honest, but you can’t ask for that at this price tag. The included charger works well enough, I’ve experienced no issues. </p>
<p> It's a great fitness tracker which doubles as a smartwatch </p>
<p> So… is this the Huawei Watch Fit worth $110, or the equivalent where you may live? Well, yes, if you’re looking for a hybrid between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker, and you’re not bothered by the notification-related issues I’ve talked about. In every other way, this smartwatch is really great. It offers stellar battery life, a ton of fitness-related features, a really good display, and a solid build. Even if you’re more in the market for a smartwatch, that doesn’t necessarily look like a watch, this may be a good choice. </p>

<p> Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro Leak Promises Some Astounding Battery Life </p>
<p> In the world of smartwatches battery life is usually king, and the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro seems to take that very seriously if the information from this new leak is accurate. </p>
<p> According to a report from Wareable (which was spotted on Turkish site HuaweiAilesi), the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro promises some really astounding battery life. While not unheard of and there are other smartwatches out there have long-lasting batteries, it is kind of uncommon. </p>
<p> Most smartwatches last for a couple of days. While some can kick that out to nearly an entire work week. Not the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro. As Huawei is apparently looking to beat a week. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro may have a 2-week battery life </p>
<p> Think about this for a moment. A smartwatch that will last on a single charge for up to two weeks. That's what consumers are apparently getting with the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro. </p>
<p> Don't take that to mean that everyone will always get two weeks of battery life though. Battery life is bound to vary from user to user. Because not everyone will use the watch the same way or as often with the biggest battery draining settings and features. </p>
<p> You could for example leave the watch off the charger the until the battery dies even if you only wear it every other day. That would likely extend the battery life beyond two weeks. Since it would just be sitting there for half that time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What the leak doesn't mention is whether or not users would have to compromise on anything to get that. Usually longer-lasting batteries require engaging a special "battery mode." And the same could be true here. </p>
<p> Stylish as ever, Huawei seems to deliver a sleek design </p>
<p> Huawei's smartwatches have always had great designs. Dating back to its very first Wear OS watch (back when it was called Android Wear), Huawei's offering was heralded as one of the best looking to date. </p>
<p> It followed that up with each new watch having a style and design that was just as sleek. Things don't appear to have changed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In the leaked promo image the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro has sleek and slender curves on what appears to be its either stainless steel or brushed aluminum case. It also comes with a black silicone strap. </p>
<p> Though you'll probably be able to select from various color options for the strap and the case prior to purchasing. Huawei is expected to announce this device officially at IFA this week. </p>

<p> The Best Look You'll Get At Huawei's Watch GT 2 Pro Before Launch </p>
<p> Huawei's Watch GT 2 Pro should be getting an official announcement soon, but until then these leaked images (via WinFuture) are likely the best images anyone will see of the watch until that announcement. </p>
<p> High-res images are about all that's left of the smartwatch that hasn't been leaked in recent days. Earlier this week there was a leaked image of the watch that showed a little bit of its design, but more importantly it had information about battery life. </p>
<p> According to that leak, Huawei is claiming the Watch GT 2 Pro will have a really long-lasting battery. Longer than most smartwatches typically get on a single charge. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro comes in "several" colors </p>
<p> Based on the leak by WinFuture, the watch will have several color options available to consumers. </p>
<p> The images show there's going to be a black model, and what looks like a brown model. Note these are the colors of the straps, and not the watch case. The watch case will reportedly be stainless steel and will also have several color options, however none of those are shown in the images. </p>
<p> It also looks like the straps will be interchangeable. It would be more of a shock if they weren't, since most smartwatches do allow you to swap the straps out these days. And it's a feature that's been present on smartwatches for a while. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So, it would be kind of strange if Huawei didn't add this capability in. All that aside, there's also a chance that Huawei could offer more than just two color options for the straps. It may not be possible to see these however until the company officially unveils the Watch GT 2 Pro. </p>
<p> The first watch in this series with wireless charging, all for €280 </p>
<p> This is going to be the first watch in this series that comes with wireless charging capabilities. Something which still isn't prominent among smartwatches, though Huawei won't be the only one to offer such a feature when this watch is released. </p>
<p> Huawei is rumored to charge €280 for the device in Europe. No US pricing has been released of course because the ban is still in place on Huawei's products. So getting one of these officially through Huawei isn't going to be possible. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That being said it's not impossible for these to pop up on third party retailers like Amazon or eBay. Though there's no telling what the prices would be at that point. </p>

<p> Huawei / Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro Review: Titanium Smartwatch With Great Battery Life </p>
<p> Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro Review: Titanium Smartwatch With Great Battery Life </p>
<p> Huawei used the most premium materials to make the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro, and it shows. </p>
<p> Huawei supplied us with a review unit of the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro, but didn’t have a say in our opinion, nor did they see this review before you. We’ve been using the device for a couple of weeks before forming an opinion. </p>
<p> Huawei had released quite a few smartwatches in the last year or so. I’ve personally reviewed both the Huawei Watch GT 2 and GT 2e this year, both of which are quite compelling watches. Well, Huawei also released the Watch GT 2 Pro variant, the watch that we’ll be taking a look at in this article. The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro is quite probably the most premium watch the company made, at least when it comes to its build materials. We’ll talk more about that soon. </p>
<p> Other than that, the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro does remind me a lot of its predecessor. The software did not change all that much here, so the experience was quite familiar. The Huawei Watch GT 2 still offers amazing battery life, as you’ll find out in the review, and that is still one of its main selling points. This smartwatch is not without its issues, though, it actually has some of the problems that plagued its predecessors. That being said, let’s dive in. </p>
<p> Design-wise, this is one of the most premium smartwatches in the market </p>
<p> As I mentioned in the introduction, the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro is the most premium smartwatch this company ever made, at least if we consider the materials used here. So, Huawei decided to combine titanium with both ceramic and sapphire glass. Needless to say, these are really premium choices. The watch’s frame is made out of titanium, while you’ll find ceramic at the bottom of the device. The sapphire glass is placed on top of the display, and also on top of the heart rate sensor. In other words, it's also located at the bottom of this watch. That glass is supposed to protect both the display and heart rate sensor from scratches, as it’s more durable than Gorilla Glass. It is also supposed to enable the heart rate sensor to be even more accurate. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The physical buttons are very clicky </p>
<p> The watch comes with two physical buttons on the right, the same as its predecessors. These buttons are even more clicky this time around, and quite loud for what they are… which is not a bad thing at all. Considering their placement, chances that you are hit them by mistake often are very low. The watch is not too thick, nor is it too large, at least for men. Its display is flat, though its edges are curved, which is also a good thing when using the watch, as it doesn’t cut into your finger. The variant I reviewed came with a silicone strap called “Black Fluoroelastomer Strap”, while it also comes in a variant with a “Gray Brown Leather Strap”. Two color variants are available, Night Black and Nebula Gray. The one you can see in the images below is the latter. </p>
<p> At the bottom of this smartwatch, you’ll notice a heart rate sensor that is surrounded by ceramic. That material feels so good against the skin, even though it’s more slippery than the plastic Huawei used on previous smartwatches. That is not as important, though, as the watch will be still on your wrist thanks to its strap. The watch weighs 52 grams, without the strap, so it’s not heavy at all… even though it has a bit of heft to it. All in all, Huawei did an excellent job here. It did not reinvent the wheel when it comes to the design, but the watch feels sturdy, looks great, and the materials used are top-notch. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The display is vivid, and more than sharp enough </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro features a 1.39-inch AMOLED display with a 454 x 454 resolution. That display is touch sensitive, and it is flat. The display is a perfect size, and it’s actually quite vibrant. It may even be the same panel Huawei used on previous watches, I can’t tell the difference, as they all look really great. Even the viewing angles on this display are good. The best of all, this display does get quite bright outdoors, so using it under direct sunlight is not an issue either. </p>
<p> This display is also sharp enough for you to read everything you need. I never had to squint, or anything of the sort, nor did I ever thought to myself “I wish the display was sharper”. It’s plenty sharp for its size, for everything that you’ll use it for. Considering that the sapphire glass is placed on top of this display, it should handle scratches really well. That was an issue on previous watches, as I managed to scratch their display easily, even though I was really careful. I’m not sure what Huawei used for protection on those watches, though. I did not try scratching this display, but I didn't do it by accident either. True sapphire glass is difficult to scratch in everyday situations. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Smooth performance affected by lackluster software </p>
<p> The general performance of the watch is really good. It is fueled by the Kirin A1 SoC, the same as the GT 2 and GT 2e, and that’s a good thing. This processor is plenty powerful to let you do whatever you want with the watch, and yet it’s quite efficient as well. So, you may feel a stutter here and there, but you’ll never feel like the watch is laggy or anything of the sort. You can access every part of its software without an issue. Speaking of which, the software performance, well, that’s a slightly different story. </p>
<p> First and foremost, I have to say that Huawei improved touch responsiveness here. I have not experienced many accidental presses while using the watch, not nearly as much as on its predecessors. It did happen once or twice, but that’s perfectly normal. So as far as that is concerned, we’re all good. The watch’s software does have some issues, and most of them are still related to notifications, as was the case with its predecessors. </p>
<p> The notification system needs work, and is the main problem </p>
<p> Don’t get me wrong, you’ll still get all your notifications, but you still can’t dismiss them one by one without tapping on every single one beforehand. You still have to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the notifications list to dismiss them all, which can be a chore. Responding to notifications via your watch is also something you can’t do, unfortunately. What probably bothers me most of all, though, is the fact that notifications are not synced up with watch notifications. By that I mean you cannot dismiss a notification on your watch, and see that mirrored on your phone… or the other way around. That is one big issue for me personally. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Another thing that is a bit annoying when it comes to notifications, is the fact there’s no indication you have a notification on this smartwatch’s watch face, any of them, really. At least not from the ones I’ve tried out. In order to see if there are any notifications that you’ve missed, you have to swipe up in order to open the list. It would be nice of Huawei if it included some sort of a dot, or whatever else to indicate there are unread notifications in the queue. The bottom line is, the company has to improve how notifications work on this watch, in general. </p>
<p> Huawei needs to find way to keep 'Health' app active at all times, on all Android devices </p>
<p> Speaking of software, connectivity with the phone’s Health app is also not the best. The Huawei Health is the app you’ll need to download in order to get this watch up and running. The app itself is quite good, but for some reason, the watch tends to lose connection to it from time to time. That is due to the way Android OS works, probably. I’ve tried locking the app in multitasking, and remove it from the ‘battery optimization’ list, but that didn’t help. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once a day, or once every two days, it gets disconnected. Once that happens, the watch can’t pull some information from the phone, such as weather info. The same happens with music. If the connection is not there, I can’t see what song is playing on one of my phone’s music apps via my watch, I have to fire up the Health app again in order to get that info. In some cases, the connection ends up being terminated completely, and the notifications stop arriving as well. </p>
<p> So, as you can see, the vast majority of issues when it comes to this watch are software related, and most of them belong in the software department. That is quite unfortunate, but it’s also something that Huawei can fix with updates. This smartwatch is so great in so many other ways, it would be a shame if the software doesn’t improve. </p>
<p> Stellar battery life </p>
<p> The battery life on this smartwatch is amazing, to say the least. While Wear OS and Tizen OS smartwatches can offer 1-2 days of battery life on regular use, this watch can keep the lights on for about two weeks. Your mileage may vary, of course, depending on how many of the watch’s features you’re using. I was able to get very close to two weeks, as I placed the watch on a charger when it was at 5-percent. That was at a 13-day mark, so it could have lasted 14, technically. I used the continuous heart rate monitoring for the vast majority of the time, and the same goes for stress monitoring. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> I used it to control music on my phone, to read notifications, and for some light fitness activities. I’m not much of a fitness buff, but I did use it for running and biking. The watch handled all that with ease, and provided me with plenty of battery life. I love what Huawei watches can offer in the battery life department. It allows me to completely forget about a charger, pretty much. If I plan to go away for the weekend, or something of the sort, the watch charger is the last thing on my mind. Sure, packing an extra charger may not be a problem for most of you, but the less I carry with me, the better, and considering how many devices I have to charge… this is a blessing. </p>
<p> Wireless charging is finally on board </p>
<p> Speaking of battery life, the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro is the first smartwatch in the series to offer wireless charging. The watch comes with a charging dock, which works exactly as you expect. It’s not large, it’s not angled, which is fine by me. The smaller the dock, the better. Huawei claims that you can get 10 hours of usage with 5 minutes of wireless charging. There’s no way I could have tested that, but it seems about right. This is not the fastest wireless charging around, but considering how small that battery is, the watch charges fairly fast. Besides, even if you had to charge it for hours, it lasts for two weeks, so, that’s a tradeoff many would agree to. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are tons of fitness options with 100 workout modes </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro is a fitness-oriented watch, needless to say. Pretty much every watch in the series is. Therefore, it comes with a ton of fitness-oriented content / features. This watch can monitor your heart rate, blood oxygen saturation levels, and it can use that data to estimate your VO2Max levels. Those of you who don’t know, such readings are supposed to represent your base fitness level. </p>
<p> The watch comes with 100 workout mode, and over 10 of those are running exercise variants. The watch can remind you to do your workouts. Workout modes include hiking, mountain biking, indoor running, outdoor running, skiing, driving range, snowboarding, triathlon, and tons more… we really can’t list all of them here. This watch will cover the vast majority of exercises out there, pretty much. </p>
<p> I haven’t had the chance to try out many of them, but I did test the biking one. I've also tried running… even though that’s not my thing. I honestly can’t say how accurate are running readings. That’s not something I usually do, so I don’t have anything to compare it to. The biking was quite accurate, and worked extremely well. I also have to note that the watch does a really good job when it comes to counting steps, that’s something its predecessor had issues with… well, this watch does not. </p>
<p> The watch will auto-detect you're exercising </p>
<p> It’s also worth noting that the watch can automatically ask you whether you’d like to fire up a workout session, based on your movement. If you’re running, and you forgot to fire up the exercise, the watch will start recording everything and ask you if you’d like to fire it up… after about 10 minutes or so. If you decline, it’ll stop, if you accept, you’ll have the record of your exercise even before you confirmed you want to record it. GPS is also a part of the package, by the way… and the watch can monitor your sleep and stress levels as well. </p>
<p> You can make calls using this watch, easily </p>
<p> Who would want to make calls on a watch? Many people say that the experience is crappy, and you look ridiculous while doing it. The experience part is true, on most watches, not on the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro. Taking calls on this thing was actually quite delightful. Its speaker is loud enough for you to hear everything, while those microphones that Huawei included are quite good. I haven’t had a single complaint, which is the first time it happened with a smartwatch I’ve used. </p>
<p> Now, for the second part, yes, you’ll still look ridiculous to most people. If you’re a fan of sci-fi aka a bit geeky, and chances are most of you are (as you’re reading this), then you’ll actually enjoy it. Besides, who cares what people think, they’re just jealous of you and your cool phone watch. Jokes aside, if you want to use this thing as a phone on your wrist, you totally can do that. Well, you can as long as you connect it to your phone. </p>
<p> If not for the software issues, it would be an amazing watch… this way, it's just really good </p>
<p> So, is the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro worth recommending? Well, if you don’t mind some of its software quirks, yes, sure. The watch is extremely well-equipped with fitness modes, and its build is top-notch. The battery life is insane, and one of the best aspects of the Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro. The display is also really good, while wireless charging is finally included. To top it all off, you can actually take calls using this watch, and not be frustrated with the experience. The only downside are those software issues, most of which have been around for a while now. If only Huawei fixed those, this watch would certainly be able to compete with pretty much anything out there. </p>

<p> Android News / Hands-On With The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro, A Watch Made Out Of Titanium </p>
<p> Hands-On With The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro, A Watch Made Out Of Titanium </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro got announced yesterday, during the Huawei Developers Conference (HDC). Well, a review sample of the device arrived to the office today. We decided to share our initial thoughts, and some hands-on images of the Huawei GT 2 Pro. </p>
<p> This is the company’s flagship smartwatch at this point. It is one of the more interesting watches the company released, at least from the hardware standpoint. Why? Well, Huawei used titanium, ceramic, and sapphire glass in its build. </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro hands-on images show its titanium, sapphire & ceramic build materials </p>
<p> The watch’s frame is made out of titanium, which is a higher quality material compared to stainless steel and aluminum. It’s tougher and more durable, and that is, of course, something you want your watch to be. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sapphire is included over the heart rate sensor on the back, and also on the front. That is great news for scratch resistance, as sapphire glass is more resistant to scratches than any iteration of Gorilla Glass. Thanks to that material, the heart rate sensor is expected to be more accurate as well. </p>
<p> And the third premium build material that we mentioned is ceramic. The back of the watch is made out of ceramic. That material definitely offers a nice feel to the touch, and it doesn’t slide as much as regular, shiny plastic. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All in all, this is a premium smartwatch Huawei released, at least when it comes to its build materials. I’ve been using it for a short time now, but I’m quite impressed when it comes to the design. </p>
<p> The watch also looks really nice in general, quite modern. It can be both classy and sporty, depending on what you need. You can also easily replace its band, to fit your needs at the time. </p>
<p> This is the ‘Night Black’ variant of the device, with a silicone strap </p>
<p> The model we received is called “Night Black” and the wristband type is listed as “Black Fluoroelastomer Strap”. In other words, this watch combines black and gray colors in its build, while the strap is made out of silicone, it seems. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The strap is very comfortable, as are most silicone straps I’ve used. It seems to be well-made, and it’s a bit thicker than most other silicone straps I’ve used, which is a good thing. </p>
<p> The device has two physical buttons on its right-hand side. One is a home button, while the other is configurable. Those buttons are quite clicky, and louder than the ones on the Watch GT 2 and GT 2e. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There is also a speaker at the bottom right side of the watch, and microphones are also included in the mix. You can use this watch for phone calls, though you’ll have to wait for our full review to find out how good of an experience that is. </p>
<p> The software is similar to the one on the Huawei Watch GT 2 and GT 2e, though the touch sensitivity is a bit better on this watch. I’ve also noticed some display improvements, as colors seem to be a bit more saturated. That could be just an initial impression, we’ll see. </p>
<p> This smartwatch also comes with a wireless charging stand. That is not something that was offered with the GT 2 and GT 2e. That wireless charging pad is made out of plastic, but it feels well-made. </p>

<p> Android News / Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro Unveiled With Wireless Charging & Titanium Body </p>
<p> Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro Unveiled With Wireless Charging & Titanium Body </p>
<p> Huawei has announced its most prominent smartwatch to date, the Watch GT 2 Pro. This smartwatch got announced during the company’s HDC (Huawei Developer Conference) today. </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro did leak several times in the last couple of weeks. The information that leaked was mostly accurate. This smartwatch does offer wireless charging, and its design leaks were also accurate. </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro comes with a titanium body, and offers 2-week battery life </p>
<p> The watch is made out of metal (titanium), and it comes with a silicone strap. It is the very first ‘GT’ smartwatch from Huawei to offer wireless charging, and it also sports a circular body and display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The watch is also supposed to offer a 2-week battery life with regular usage. From what we’ve seen from the first and second-gen GT watches, that is quite possible. </p>
<p> This smartwatch comes with over 100 workout modes to choose from. It also caters to a diverse range of extreme sports, leisure activities, water sports, ball games, and snow sports. It does come with automatic workout detection. </p>
<p> A heart rate sensor is included on this watch, and the company’s Huawei TruSeen 4.0+ heart rate monitoring technology combines with a 6-in-1 LED lens and sapphire glass back to provide more accurate monitoring. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It can also monitor your stress levels, and it comes with SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) monitoring too. The watch comes in Night Black for Sport Edition, and Nebula Gray for Classic Edition variants. </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch GT 2 Pro features a 1.39-inch 454 x 454 AMOLED display. It measures 46.7 x 46.7 x 11.4mm, and weighs 52 grams (without the strap). </p>
<p> It supports both Android and iOS </p>
<p> This smartwatch supports Android 4.4 or later, while it is also compatible with iOS 9.0 or later. It is also 5 ATM rated for water and dust resistance, which is to be expected here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Bluetooth 5.1 is included in the package, as is GPS. The watch does have a speaker built in, and the same goes for microphones as well, so you can take calls with this watch if you want. </p>
<p> This smartwatch is actually a great combination of classy and sporty in terms of the design. You change the watch’s look quite a bit by including a different band on it, depending on your preference. </p>
<p> We still do not know how much will the watch cost, but the company is expected to announce price tags shortly. </p>

<p> Huawei & ZTE Patent Appeal Dismissed by the UK Supreme Court </p>
<p> The UK Supreme Court today, dismissed two appeals filed by Chinese telecom equipment manufacturers Huawei and ZTE. These appeals concerned two patent infringement cases brought by Unwired Planet International and Conversant Wireless. </p>
<p> The cases concern the licensing of crucial mobile technologies and are related to Standard Essential Patents (SEPs). A SEP ensures that fair prices are maintained and customers benefit from the technology or patent. </p>
<p> Holders of SEPs can't withhold the technology. Instead, SEP holders, mandated by law, license their technology to third parties. </p>

<p> In 2013, Unwired Planet International brought the first case against Huawei. The intellectual property company alleged that Huawei infringed on 5 UK patents belonging to Unwired Planet. </p>
<p> Incidentally, Unwired Planet International had acquired these patents from the Swedish telecom giant, Ericsson. Previously, the English court ruled that two of Unwired Planet's patents were valid. The court had also ruled that Unwired's license terms were fair and legally enforceable. </p>
<p> On the other hand, Conversant Wireless brought forth its legal action case against both, Huawei and ZTE. Conversant Wireless alleged that Huawei and ZTE infringed on four of its UK patents. Conversant acquired these patents from the Finnish telecom major, Nokia. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Incidentally, these patents cover 3G, 4G, and 5G mobile service technologies. The patents also cover other yet-to-be-developed mobile service technologies. </p>
<p> Britain's Supreme Court has upheld previous decisions while quashing the appeals from Huawei and ZTE. The Supreme Court judgment makes it mandatory for companies like Huawei and ZTE to procure global licenses from SEP holders for the complete portfolio. </p>
<p> UK Supreme Court Dismissed Huawei & ZTE Appeals </p>
<p> In their appeals, the Chinese telecom majors argued that the UK courts did not have jurisdiction over foreign patents. Huawei and ZTE based the whole appeal on the argument that the UK Supreme Court could not arbitrate and determine the validity of foreign global patents. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, the UK Supreme court quashed the argument. The Court stated that it has jurisdiction under an international patent framework. As per the trial Judge, the mobile industry has already agreed upon this international patent framework. </p>
<p> Consequently, Huawei and ZTE will have to sign licensing agreements with Unwired Planet International and Conversant Wireless. In case the telecom companies fail to acquire these licenses, they will be subject to injunctions. These potential injunctions will severely limit their access to the UK market. </p>
<p> However, there is another significant consequence of this judgment. The UK Courts can now arbitrate global patent cases. </p>
<p> As such, the impact of this judgment is far-reaching. Telecom manufacturers will need to acquire global licenses for the complete portfolio of a SEP holder. Also, the manufacturers cannot legally insist that the SEP holder proves their patents in every jurisdiction globally. </p>

<p> Android News / Hulu + Live TV: Price, Supported Devices, Channels, Cloud DVR & More </p>
<p> Hulu + Live TV: Price, Supported Devices, Channels, Cloud DVR & More </p>
<p> Hulu has been around for many years, but what's new is the + Live TV portion of the service. Hulu + Live TV is the company's streaming Live TV service, it offers over 65 channels for only $54.99 per month. </p>
<p> Much like YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV was designed as a way for users to cut the cord from traditional cable companies, but still be able to watch their favorite shows on cable TV. The Live TV streaming service is in addition to the Hulu library, which has grown to be quite large over the last decade or so. Which arguably makes it one of the better options out there for streaming TV. </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> What is Hulu + Live TV </p>
<p> Hulu + Live TV is exactly what it sounds. It's Hulu, along with the streaming Live TV service that we all want. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The service was announced in May 2016. Launching in Beta on May 3, 2017, originally called "Hulu with Live TV" then changed to "Hulu + Live TV". At launch, it came with 50 channels for users to stream, and included five OTA channels – ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and The CW – for most markets. </p>
<p> Initially it was priced at $39.99, making it very competitive with YouTube TV at the time, which was $35. In December 2019, Hulu upped the price to $54.99 per month. This was after it continued to add more channels. And it now has 72 channels. </p>
<p> Hulu + Live TV has just under three million subscribers, according to the latest estimates. Which puts it at the second biggest streaming Live TV service in the country. </p>
<p> How much does Hulu + Live TV Cost? </p>
<p> Hulu + Live TV costs you $54.99 per month currently, for the base subscription. This comes with all of the channels listed below (current count is around 72). It also includes the entire Hulu on-demand library, which has over 10,000 titles. Mostly from networks owned by Disney, NBCUniversal and some from ViacomCBS. Essentially, you get the ad-supported version of Hulu included with the Live TV service. </p>
<p> What Add-ons are available? </p>
<p> There are some add-ons available for Hulu + Live TV as well. You can add STARZ for $8.99 per month, Cinemax for $9.99 per month, Showtime for $10.99 per month and HBO MAX for $14.99 per month. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additionally, you can upgrade your cloud DVR service from only 50 hours to 200 hours for $10 per month. And you can upgrade to unlimited simultaneous screens for $10 per month. Or you can bundle the enhanced cloud DVR and unlimited screens together for $15 per month. </p>
<p> Finally, there are two more add-ons that are available. There's an Entertainment Add-On and an Espanol Add-on that will bring you additional channels. The Entertainment Add-on brings American Heroes Channel, CNBC World, Cooking Channel, Destination America, Discovery Family, Discovery Life, DIY Network, FYI, LMN, and Science for $7.99 per month. While the Espanol Add-on brings you content from CNN en Español, Discovery en Español, Discovery Familia, ESPN Deportes, History Channel en Español, and Universo for $4.99 per month. </p>
<p> There are plenty of options available with Hulu + Live TV, and plenty of ways to add more content to your Hulu subscription. But it can get expensive pretty quick. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Can I bundle it with Disney+ </p>
<p> Hulu is majority-owned by Disney, so it makes sense that you'd be able to bundle Disney's streaming services together, and you can. You can bundle Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ for $12.99 per month. That includes the ad-supported version of Hulu. </p>
<p> To bundle Hulu + Live TV, Disney+ and ESPN+, that'll cost you $61.99. Basically $7 for adding Disney+ and ESPN+, that makes ESPN+ free, essentially. Since Disney+ is $6.99 and ESPN+ is $4.99. This is a really good bundle and worth signing up for. </p>
<p> What channels are included? </p>
<p> As of October 2020, Hulu + Live TV has 72 channels available in its base subscription plan. They are listed below. </p>
<p> What premium channels are available? </p>
<p> Hulu + Live TV does allow you to subscribe to a few premium channels within your subscription as well. These include STARZ, SHOWTIME, Cinemax and HBO MAX. These can also be subscribed to independently, but subscribing through Hulu, makes it easier to pause or unsubscribe completely. These also work with TV logins. Just look for the option to login with Hulu Live TV in each of these premium network apps, and you'll be good to go. </p>
<p> What devices are supported? </p>
<p> Hulu + Live TV can be watched in the browser on your laptop or desktop computer. As well as on most devices that have regular Hulu available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These include Amazon Echo, Echo Show, Fire TV, Fire Tablets, Android, Android TV, Chromecast, Apple TV, iOS, NVIDIA SHIELD, Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Roku, as well as the following smart TV brands: Hisense, Samsung, Sony and VIZIO. </p>
<p> Currently, you can watch Hulu + Live TV on Chromecast with Google TV, but it does integrate with the "Live" tab on Google TV yet. That is reserved for YouTube TV only right now. </p>
<p> So it is available on virtually every platform that you can think of. Allowing you to watch TV virtually anywhere. </p>
<p> What features are included? </p>
<p> Hulu + Live TV is not quite as feature-rich as some of the other streaming Live TV services on the market. But it does have a few features that help to set it apart. Of course, that is likely why it is cheaper than a lot of its competitors. These features include Cloud DVR, multiple users, unlimited simultaneous screens, enhanced playback and much more. </p>
<p> Enhanced Cloud DVR </p>
<p> Like most other streaming Live TV services, Hulu also has its own cloud DVR. </p>
<p> Included with the base plan for $55/month, you will be able to record 50 hours of content. Hulu does have an upgrade available that will get you 20 hours of storage for $9.99/month. That's pretty much the industry standard, and not the exception (YouTube TV is the exception). </p>
<p> The 50 hours that everyone gets, may not seem like a lot. But keep in mind that you do also have access to Hulu's massive on-demand library. So you likely won't be recording as much content as you would on FuboTV or YouTube TV. </p>
<p> You will be able to access everything that you have recorded by going to "My Stuff" within the Hulu app. This is also where you'll find anything that you have bookmarked or saved to watch later on. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that what you record will be able to fast-forward and rewind. But things that are available on-demand or live TV, you won't be able to fast-forward or rewind. </p>
<p> Unlimited Screens </p>
<p> One of the features of live TV services that most people don't talk about, is the simultaneous streams. Most of them are capped at around two or three streams, including Hulu + Live TV. </p>
<p> Hulu only allows two simultaneous streams for watching Live TV. However, you can upgrade it to unlimited. But, the "Unlimited screens" upgrade does have a big asterisk next to it. For $9.99/month, you can upgrade to unlimited screens and that allows for unlimited TVs, but you are still limited to three mobile devices. Those mobile devices include tablets and smartphones. </p>
<p> For most people, the two screens should be plenty, but having the option to upgrade to unlimited is a really nice feature to have. Even if you do need to pay $10/month for it. </p>
<p> Multiple users </p>
<p> Much like any other streaming service, Hulu also allows for up to six users per account. Now, these do not work like YouTube TV, where each user has their own login. You'd be using the same login, and you click on your profile. </p>
<p> Each profile has their content tailored to their preferences and interests, as expected. There are some unique parental controls available too. Where subscribers can create profiles that will restrict viewing to specific content, and they can block certain types of programs. There is also an option to limit searches to only return viewing options that meet their specific requirements. </p>
<p> It's better than nothing, but offering up the ability for each user to have their own login would be better, and more secure. As you're not sharing passwords. </p>
<p> Enhanced Playback </p>
<p> Hulu has some enhanced playback features available too. Viewers are able to rewind most live channels to the beginning of the show or movie currently running. This is in contrast with other services that only allow you to rewind to when you started, or fast-forward til you are live. Unless it is a show that you have recorded or are recording. </p>
<p> Additionally Hulu ad-free subscribers have the ability to download movies and shows to watch while on the go. Even if you don't have mobile data or WiFi available. This is not available for Live TV because, well it needs to connect to something to get the Live content. </p>
<p> Can I watch Hulu + Live TV when I'm not at home? </p>
<p> Yes, unlike most cable companies, Hulu does allow you to continue to watch Live TV when you are not at home. </p>
<p> So if you're going to be gone when the Super Bowl is on, you can watch it on your phone, on your laptop, or anywhere else, even if it is not at your home. </p>
<p> If you are outside of your market – say for example you live in Chicago and are visiting family in Atlanta – you will still be able to watch Live TV. The only caveat is that you won't get your locals. You will get the locals for the channels in the market you are currently in. </p>
<p> Is it available in 4K? </p>
<p> Hulu as well as its Live TV counter-part, streams in 720p, 1080p and 4K UHD. Unfortunately, most streaming live TV channels do not broadcast in 4K. But you will get either 720p or 1080p depending on the channel. Most channels do 1080p now, so you'll get a really good looking stream here. </p>
<p> As far as non-live TV content, the majority of the newer content is filmed in 4K and there is even support for Dolby Vision on a lot of these titles. </p>
<p> Is there a free trial available? </p>
<p> Hulu offers a seven-day free trial for all of its plans. So you can check out a free trial of Hulu + Live TV and see if it's worth it before paying any money. </p>
<p> If you cancel before the seven days are up, you won't be charged. But if you fail to cancel before the seven days are up, then you'll be charged for your first month of service. </p>
<p> Is Hulu + Live TV worth it? </p>
<p> Hulu + Live TV is perhaps the best value for streaming Live TV. And that is largely due to its vast on-demand library that it has been building up for over a decade. Most of its competitors have only a fraction of the content that Hulu does. So even if you don't opt for the Live TV option, you can get Hulu and have plenty of content to watch, with new episodes landing daily and weekly. </p>
<p> At $54.99 per month, Hulu + Live TV is also far cheaper than some of the other services out there. FuboTV, YouTube TV and AT&T TV NOW are all priced at $64.99 per month now. Sure they have more channels, but not that many more. And they also don't have that vast Hulu library of on-demand content available. That makes Hulu + Live TV a pretty impressive option. And it'll continue to add more channels in the coming months. However, fingers crossed that it doesn't see as many price increases as other services have recently. </p>

<p> Huawei Sees Sanctions As An Opportunity To Grow, Show Strength </p>
<p> Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei and President of Consumer Business Group in Europe Walter Ji took to the virtual stage for IFA 2020 to highlight the company's role in Europe. And also reportedly to pronounce its fighting spirit, amid ongoing US sanctions. </p>
<p> The 26-minute long speech primarily showcased Mr. Ji, who took the opportunity to highlight Huawei's historical role in Europe. Not only does the company directly employ 14,000 workers in the region. It also has 200,000 more employees across 23 research sites, Mr. Ji noted. And it is the fifth-largest research and development investor in the EU as of 2019. </p>
<p> For 2020, the company has expanded on that via its offline presence, the executive pointed out. And it plans to expand more via demo stores in several regions of the continent. That includes France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Germany, and the UK. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei isn't ready to quit yet, IFA 2020 keynote indicates </p>
<p> Huawei's Ren Zhengfei reiterated the importance of those investments. The chief executive summarized R&D efforts as employing more than 90,000 workers. </p>
<p> The CEO says that's more than would ever be seen with "Wester" companies. He also highlighted that the company is only going to grow, as it's been pulling in new staff across every metric of its business. That's as opposed to backing down from increasing US-imposed sanctions. </p>
<p> Perhaps as importantly, both Huawei executives claimed that Huawei's difficulties have given it an advantage. Namely, those have led to more "heroes" at the company. In fact, the company continues to see all of its workers as heroes, according to Mr. Zhengfei. And the company is planning to react accordingly, with regards to the sanctions. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Specifically, Huawei indicates that it won't be laying off any of its 'heroes', anytime soon. Instead, now is the time for it to continue its growth trajectory, the executives indicated. </p>
<p> Where is Huawei still growing? </p>
<p> Huawei has, for the past several months, reported growth almost unanimously. That's despite sanctions preventing it from forming new chips partnerships and from embedding itself more deeply in several global 5G roll-outs. But the primary focus for the company right now, according to reports, is apps. </p>
<p> Mr. Ji noted that Huawei is adding around 5,000 apps per month to its AppGallery, which Huawei says is the third-largest app marketplace globally. The company has, the executive says, a dedicated team working to bring those apps over from Google Play Store. The team is utilizing the Petal Search engine to determine how that's happening, with the focus on the most popular of the apps. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That focus, Mr. Ji concludes, is a key to helping Huawei remain a leader in the European market. As are its focuses on AI, IoT, VR, and next-gen connectivity. </p>

<p> How To Improve Battery Life On The OnePlus 8 Pro </p>
<p> Battery life on the OnePlus 8 Pro is actually not too bad, even at QHD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. In fact, in our review, we found that we were able to get atleast a full day of use and around five to six hours of screen on time. But for some, it still may not be enough. </p>
<p> Luckily, there are some ways that you can improve the battery life on the OnePlus 8 Pro and get even more juice out of this phone on a single charge. </p>
<p> Switch to dark mode </p>
<p> OnePlus offers a number of settings for customizing your smartphone, in Oxygen OS. One of those settings includes dark mode. Which is a system-wide dark mode and it looks amazing. In fact, with the OnePlus 8 series, it debuted Dark Mode 2.0, which is even better. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> By turning on dark mode, you're going to be able to really improve your battery life, because the OnePlus 8 Pro uses an AMOLED display. And the reason why darker colors save battery more, is because OLED displays light up each pixel individually. Meaning that a dark display is going to use a lot less juice than a white display. The difference between dark mode and light mode, is actually pretty astounding. </p>
<p> In our testing, we were able to get another hour or two of screen on time by switching to dark mode. Of course, your results are going to vary, as we all use our phones differently. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Change the screen resolution & refresh rate </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 Pro has a Quad HD+ display, with a refresh rate of 120Hz. Now out of the box, it will be set to QHD+ and 120Hz. Which is going to give you a really great looking display on your new smartphone. Unfortunately, it is also going to drain your battery faster. </p>
<p> Fortunately, OnePlus has options in the Display Settings for changing the resolution and refresh rate. Now you can't drop down to 90Hz on the OnePlus 8 Pro, only from 120Hz to 60Hz. So the better option here is going to be to drop the resolution down to FHD+. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Going from QHD+ to FHD+, you won't notice much of a difference. But you will notice a difference in battery life. We dropped the resolution down to FHD+ after we finished the review, and were getting way better battery life. At least another two to three hours of screen on time. This varied from day to day, based on how we used the device. But it was a big change to the battery life here. </p>
<p> Optimize battery saver settings to your liking </p>
<p> The next step to save some battery life, is going to be to optimize your battery saver settings. </p>
<p> Now we don't mean turn battery saver on all the time. As that will essentially make your smartphone a dumb phone. But make sure it turns on when it hits 20% or possibly 15% of battery. That way you can get through the rest of your day. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the OnePlus 8 Pro, you can also set a schedule based on your routine, to turn on battery saver. So it will turn on if you are likely to run out of battery before your next usual charge. Say if you normally plug in your phone around 11PM every night, and you're at 15% at about 7PM, the phone will automatically turn on battery saver mode, as you're likely to run out before 11PM. It's a really cool feature actually. </p>
<p> Battery Saver doesn't need to be on all of the time, but it is a really great way to keep your phone running longer, between charges. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Turn off Motion Graphics Smoothing </p>
<p> This should be off by default, but make sure you turn Motion Graphics Smoothing off. This is going to eat up a lot of juice on your OnePlus 8 Pro. And this is because it is going to be smoothing everything that it sees in videos. And hence, use more power and more battery. </p>
<p> It's also not really good, so it's good that it is off by default. It's like the motion smoothing that is on most TVs that we all immediately turn off. But now, on your smartphone for some reason. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Wrap Up </p>
<p> Battery life is pretty decent on the OnePlus 8 Pro. But the company does have a way for you to get more juice pretty quickly. The Warp Charge 30T charger that is included in the box. It'll fully charge your OnePlus 8 Pro in a little over an hour. Or charge to 50% in just 30 minutes. That is pretty great, and better than using battery saver. But if you don't have your charger with you, these tips will also work. </p>

<p> How To Install Android 11 Beta 1 On Google Pixel Smartphones </p>
<p> The first beta for Android 11 is now rolling out. And installing the Android 11 Beta is super simple. Though there are a few steps you need to do before you can enjoy the next version of Android. </p>
<p> We are going to walk you through how to install the Android 11 Beta on your smartphone. But first things first, this only works with Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. Any of those phones will work with Android 11 Beta right now. </p>
<p> How to Install Android 11 Beta on your Google Pixel smartphone </p>
<p> You'll need to head to the Android Beta website and enroll your device. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and you'll see the devices on your account that are eligible. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> After you have opted into the Android 11 Beta, you will get an OTA on your smartphone in the next few hours. It usually is much sooner than that, but sometimes it can take a few hours. </p>
<p> You can now head to your phone. Go into Settings and check for a system update. Or wait for the notification that you have an update available. </p>
<p> Once it shows up, click on the "Download & Install" button at the bottom of the page. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This update is going to take some time to download. The first beta comes in at 1.72GB in size. Which means it's going to take close to an hour to install. </p>
<p> After it has downloaded, it will then reboot and you'll be on Android 11. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Keep in mind that it will take longer than usual to reboot your phone, because it is rebuilding the cache and other things under-the-hood of the device. </p>
<p> How to roll back to Android 10 </p>
<p> Rolling back to Android 10 is super simple. </p>
<p> Just head back to the Android Beta website and opt out of the beta for that specific device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Afterwards, you'll get an update via OTA on your device that will take your phone back to Android 10. So it's actually a downgrade and not an update. But it'll take you back to the stable version of Android 10. </p>
<p> So if you are having issues with the Android 11 Beta, this is a great way to go back without having to boot up adb and throw in a bunch of commands. Luckily, Google has made it super simple to go back to simpler times. The stable version of Android 11 should be out in September. </p>

<p> Investors Remain Skeptical Of BlackBerry Despite Turnaround </p>
<p> Investors are still skeptical of BlackBerry's prospects despite the company's turnaround overseen by Chief Executive Officer John Chen. The industry veteran who took over the then-struggling Canadian tech giant in 2013 managed to reignite some public optimism about the firm's operations in his first year in charge and despite a wide variety of bold moves that steadied its course, including the effective closure of its hardware division, BlackBerry's stock is presently trading at under $10, thus being roughly in line with its late 2014 valuation. The flat share price suggests Mr. Chen's March comments about BlackBerry's turnaround being completed may have been premature or the firm has less room to grow than what the 63-year-old executive initially anticipated. </p>
<p> BlackBerry's efforts to move away from first-party hardware and place a larger focus on the security and enterprise segment, as well as license its name to original design manufacturers such as TCL Communication, all managed to control its overall decline; while even its latest financial report showed falling revenues, the company's operations are actually growing at an 18-percent annual rate without its legacy mobile business being accounted for. Moving forward, the Waterloo-based technology firm is set to pursue new B2B partnerships with other major names in the industry such as Samsung and continue winding down any efforts to compete in the consumer electronics segment on its own. </p>
<p> The recently launched BlackBerry KEY2 manufactured by TCL received largely positive responses from both critics and consumers alike and is widely expected to outsell its 2017 predecessor created as part of the same product partnership which was already internally labeled a success. In the meantime, Mr. Chen's focus is turning toward various software and services, especially those aimed at the Internet of Things field and autonomous vehicles in particular. Even if successful, that strategy likely won't generate major returns until well into the next decade, which may explain the continued stagnation of BlackBerry's stock, according to some analysts. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / It Looks Like Lenovo Will Make A Gamepad For The Legion Phone </p>
<p> It Looks Like Lenovo Will Make A Gamepad For The Legion Phone </p>
<p> The Legion phone from Lenovo will come with its own gamepad accessory. At least by the looks of a new image that's been shared on Weibo that depicts the phone alongside a handful of accessories specifically for it. </p>
<p> The device, which has yet to receive an official unveiling from Lenovo, has been teased over the past several weeks. Whether it's been a key spec or two or just a statement about the phone itself and how it will compare to similar devices. </p>
<p> But this most recent image is the first that's actually shed some light on what kind of experience mobile gamers can expect. At least in terms of additional accessories to enhance the gaming experience. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Legion Phone gamepad will be a dual controller setup </p>
<p> The teaser image shows off quite a bit of the Legion Phone itself as well as accessories to pair with it. These will no doubt be optional, and probably not accessories that will come with the phone as part of a single offering. </p>
<p> When it comes to the gamepad in particular, it'll be a dual controller setup. It doesn't have the same exact design as the Joy Con controllers for the Nintendo Switch, but the two sides of the controller (each one meant for a specific hand) are split up in the same way. </p>
<p> A number of controllers for mobile devices have taken this same approach. Such as the gamepad for the Black Shark 2 Pro, as well as the Razer Junglecat. It's a setup that works because each side can then be locked into place on the right and left sides of the phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This also tends to require a dedicated case, and it looks like there's one of those in the image as well. </p>
<p> There may be a bundle option that comes with everything </p>
<p> This could just be a promotional image to showcase the available accessory options. But it could also be a bundle that consumers will be able to buy. One that comes with every accessory being developed for the phone. </p>
<p> Aside from the gamepad, there appear to be two different cases for the device. One seems like it could be a more standard case while the other appears to have integrated LED lighting. </p>

<p> There also seems to be a pair of earbuds which could be wired or wireless. And, the whole thing is inside of a suitcase-style package. Which would be quite the unboxing experience. </p>

<p> Leaked Renders Show The BlackBerry KEY2 LE From All Sides </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 LE is TCL’s upcoming handset, which will likely arrive later this month, and the phone’s design has just been revealed via new images. If you take a look at the gallery down below, you will be able to see two new images which are actually showing the BlackBerry KEY2 LE from basically all sides, so there’s not much to hide when it comes to the design of this smartphone. </p>
<p> Based on the provided images, the BlackBerry KEY2 LE will resemble the BlackBerry KEY2 quite a bit. The phone will ship with a soft-touch back, at least based on the provided image, while the company’s logo will sit on the back of this phone, along with two cameras. Full QWERTY keyboard will be included on the front side of this phone, while the device will utilize on-screen buttons which will pop up above its keyboard. All physical keys will be located on the right-hand side of this phone, while the phone’s rear-facing cameras will protrude a bit. A fingerprint scanner will be embedded in the space key on the keyboard, while a Type-C port will be located on the bottom of the device, along with the phone’s loudspeaker. A 3.5mm headphone jack will also be a part of the package, and it will sit on the top of the device. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 LE is expected to sport a 4.5-inch 1620 x 1080 display, along with 4GB of RAM and 32GB / 64GB of storage, at least based on rumors that we’ve seen thus far. Android 8.1 Oreo will come pre-installed on the device, along with BlackBerry’s UI, while the Snapdragon 636 64-bit octa-core SoC will fuel this phone. 13 and 5-megapixel cameras are expected to be included on the back of the BlackBerry KEY2 LE, while a 3,000mAh battery will be included on the inside of this phone. TCL had scheduled a press event for August 30, and it seems like the BlackBerry KEY2 LE may be presented at that event. </p>

<p> Google News / Google Chrome / Lenovo C340 & S340 Chromebooks Reinforce Budget Tier Before IFA 2019 </p>
<p> Lenovo C340 & S340 Chromebooks Reinforce Budget Tier Before IFA 2019 </p>
<p> Lenovo is looking to break out no fewer than three new budget-friendly Chromebooks ahead of IFA 2019, including two new models under the C340 branding and one under the S340 branding. </p>
<p> Based on the naming conventions used and size of each model, the devices are follow-ups to last year's "C" and "S" series Chrome OS gadgets, launched around the same time last year. As with those other devices, there are plenty of similarities between the laptops. There are also a significant number of variances between them and plenty of improvements over the above-mentioned C330 or S330 family of gadgets. </p>
<p> Those advances go well beyond the internals too, starting with a newly refined design used in each of these devices. The general shape has been kept the same but with slimmed back bezels and casing compared to the previous series entries, as well as a smoother and more modern, squared-off aesthetic. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Taken in combination, Lenovo could easily have another design win on its hands with this year's releases. </p>
<p> The similarities between the new devices — dubbed the Lenovo Chromebook C340-11, C340-15, and S340-14 –stretch across more than just design language though. </p>
<p> Split between the left and right edges of the frame are two USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 1 ports. Those are included on each of the new Chromebooks, as is the 3.5mm audio combo jack and microSD card reader. Each of the Lenovo-branded gadgets, with the exception of the C340-15, features two more USB 3.1 ports for Type-A USB plugs. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the bottom of each gadget's standard full-size Chrome OS keyboard, two 2W stereo speakers are included and the final consistent external feature between the three is a 720p webcam. </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook C340 converts and comes in two sizes </p>
<p> 00 13 Chromebook C340 11 Sand Pink Rear Facing Left </p>
<p> 00 Lenovo Chromebook C340 11inch Platinum Grey rear left </p>
<p> 01 Lenovo Chromebook C340 11inch Platinum Grey 180 degree </p>
<p> The first of Lenovo's new device series is its C340. That comes as either a Lenovo Chromebook C340-11 or C340-15. The biggest similarities between these two gadgets are going to be in terms of external design language. In terms of pure aesthetics, both are effectively identical in appearance with only minor differences. </p>
<p> In fact, the most obvious differentiator is going to be the size. As suggested by branding, the Lenovo Chromebook C340-11 is an 11.6-inch gadget while the Chromebook C340-15 is a 15-inch device. The former also only comes with up to an HD display panel. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both are built on a hinged design and fit squarely in the 2-in-1 category. That means that they can be used in a tent, stand, tablet, or clamshell configuration as needed. </p>
<p> There are significant differences on the outside that may go unnoticed at first glance, however. While the similarities don't end with design, these are two very different devices. </p>
<p> The most notable variance is that the Lenovo Chromebook C340-11 measures in at 290 x 207.8mm by just over 0.7-inches thick. It weighs 2.6 lbs. That's decidedly smaller than the 14-inch Lenovo Chromebook C340-14. Lenovo has also launched the smaller of its two convertibles in two eye-catching colors to set the gadgets apart too. Those are Platinum Gray and Sand Pink. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the inside, the Lenovo Chromebook C340-11 is powered by up to an Intel Celeron N4000 processor backed by up to a whopping 8GB LPDDR4 RAM. Storage is the standard eMMC type but is available with a capacity up to 65GB. The battery driving that hardware, in all three new Chromebook series, is rated at up to 10-hours between charges. </p>
<p> Lenovo's C340-15 isn't actually that similar to its 11-inch friend </p>
<p> The larger of the Lenovo Chromebook C340 laptops, the new Chromebook C340-15 is also the most powerful of the OEMs new budget Chromebooks appearing ahead of IFA 2019. Available in a Mineral Grey coloration, it also bears the least resemblance to the trio of new budget Lenovo Chromebooks. </p>
<p> Front and center on the C340-15 is its 15.6-inch touchscreen display available with up to an FHD resolution. That's packed into a frame measuring 361.5 x 248.85mm and just under three-quarters of an inch thick. The primary differentiator on the outside, aside from size, is that this device only features a single standard USB Type-A port. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That may be something of a caveat but what's on the inside is a different story entirely. Lenovo is selling its Chromebook C340-15 with up to an eighth-gen Intel Core i3-8130U Processor. That's a chip featuring 4M Cache and clocked at up to 3.40 GHz. Backing up that powerhouse is 4GB DDR4 RAM and up to 128GB storage. </p>
<p> That all makes this a real contender in the world of Chromebooks on both the productivity and entertainment fronts. </p>
<p> The one aspect of the new device that could hold it back, aside from its relatively large size, is its weight. The Lenovo Chromebook C340-15 tips the scales at a fairly high 4.37 lbs. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Chromebook S340-14 is a clamshell laptop with style to spare </p>
<p> 05 07 Chromebook S340 14 Onyx Black Rear Facing Left </p>
<p> 05 08 Chromebook S340 14 Dark Orchid Rear Facing Right </p>
<p> 06 03 Chromebook S340 14 Dark Orchid Front Facing Left </p>
<p> 07 05 Chromebook S340 14 Dark Orchid 180 Degree </p>
<p> The Lenovo Chromebook S340-14 shares most of its characteristics with the Chromebook C340-11. It features the same number of ports, the same processor, and is identical in terms of available storage and memory. It's also a clamshell-style device built on a lay-flat hinge. </p>
<p> Dimensions for the Chromebook S340-14 fall more in line with the Lenovo Chromebook C340-15, however. The gadget weighs in at 3.09 lbs and measures 328.9 x 234.3mm with a thickness of just 0.74-inches. The display panel is closer to that found on its larger counterpart too, measuring 14-inches and with up to an FHD resolution available. </p>
<p> While it may not be the most powerful of the trio of new Lenovo budget laptops to launch ahead of IFA 2019, it is arguably going to be the most stylish. That's because Lenovo is launching the Chromebook S340-14 in both a more reserved Onyx Black and a stunning burgundy color it calls Dark Orchid. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Staggering launches at respectable price points </p>
<p> Following on last year's trend with Lenovo's budget-friendly Chromebooks, the non-convertible S340-14 will be the most affordable of the new models. In fact, at a suggested retail of just under $250, it's priced exactly as its predecessor was. The clamshell-style device will also be among the first of the new Lenovo Chromebooks to land on the market. Lenovo expects to begin selling its Chromebook S340-14 in September. </p>
<p> Conversely, the 11-inch Lenovo Chromebook C340 has gone up by $10 compared to the previous model, landing at just under $290. That will become available for purchase in September too, although the OEM hasn't specified when that will be. So Lenovo could plan to launch the new budget Chromebooks during or after IFA 2019. </p>
<p> Lenovo is launching the last of the three Chromebooks, the Chromebook C340-15, a bit later. Sales on the 15-inch model are expected to kick off in October. That will also be priced to match its more capable mid-range internals at $429.99 to start. </p>

<p> Lenovo Chromebook 10e Is IdeaPad Duet Dressed Up For School </p>
<p> Lenovo has followed up its presence at CES 2020 with the announcement of the Chromebook 10e, a Chrome OS tablet that's similar to the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook in everything but its dressings and its branding. That's according to recent reports detailing the device. Those seem to indicate that all of the internal specs remain the same as over on the IdeaPad Duet Chromebook. </p>
<p> If that's the case, the Lenovo Chromebook 10e will ship in a 10.1-inch form-factor. That display would also feature stylus support with the accessories being sold separately. It'll also have a Mediatek Helio P60T powering things along with up to 4GB LPDDR4 RAM and 128GB storage. </p>
<p> Up to 10-hours of real-world usage and both a front and back camera at 2-megapixels and 8-megapixels, respectively, would be included. But the real selling point would be the packaged-in removable keyboard dock. The biggest change here, for the Chrome OS tablet, is in the fact that there's no touchpad on the keyboard. There is one on that accessory for the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What about design changes for the Lenovo Chromebook 10e? </p>
<p> The biggest changes with the Lenovo Chromebook 10e appear to be external. Aside from the keyboard change, Dragontrail glass has been installed over the screen, rated to stand up to rigorous MIL-STD-810G standards. The exterior takes a deeper gray coloration too. Lenovo coated the tablet-build in a rubbery, grippy material to prevent drops and protect against them. </p>
<p> The idea is to ensure that this Chromebook can withstand the rigors of day-to-day use by school-age children in that environment. So this will probably be one of the strongest designs released this year for a Chromebook. </p>
<p> Lenovo hasn't said whether it is giving its pogo-pin attached keyboard any ruggedization. Typically, education sector Chromebooks feature drip-through keyboards. Those have slots to allow a set amount of liquid to pass through without harming the hardware. But that hasn't been confirmed or rebutted on this particular Chromebook. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> No rating has been supplied either for the external frame. Presumably, that will stand up to the same standards as the device's display. That would make this Chromebook resilient against even drops onto concrete from a fair height, usually about the height of a desk. But Lenovo is being scarce with the details so that may not be the case. </p>
<p> Pricing here is different too and probably availability </p>
<p> In terms of pricing and availability, the Lenovo Chromebook 10e is slated for March. That gives the company plenty of time to roll them off the line and finalize any minor changes. </p>
<p> The company hasn't explicitly stated as much but, generally, Chromebooks aimed at education don't sell in the consumer market. That would mean that most users looking into the device simply won't have access to it. Instead, Lenovo will likely sell its Chromebook 10e through key education vendors aimed directly at school IT departments. However, Lenovo could flip the script and release the device to consumers anyway. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In either case, it expects the Chromebook 10e to cost around $10 less than its Duet-branded counterpart. That places its MSRP price tag at $269 at launch, putting the 10e squarely in the budget category. </p>

<p> Google News / Google Chrome / Lenovo Puts Its Chromebook 3 In An 11-Inch Package With Improvements </p>
<p> Lenovo Puts Its Chromebook 3 In An 11-Inch Package With Improvements </p>
<p> Lenovo has now unveiled a new addition to its Chromebook 3 lineup, bolstering at least a few of the original gadget's specs in a more portable 11-inch package, Chrome Unboxed reports. The improvements start at the Chromebook 3 11's 11.6-inch TN LCD display panel, which has been pushed to 250 nits. </p>
<p> That's up from the 220 nits found on the 14-inch version. And that's been packed into a new dual-tone gray frame too, complete with redesigned texturing on one portion. </p>
<p> The storage is changing here as well. While Lenovo opted to utilize the same RAM — 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, to be exact — that's been bumped to 64GB. The figure represents a doubling of the storage found in the original Chromebook 3 14. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course, the smaller size also equates to a slightly lower weight. The 11-inch Chromebook 3 from Lenovo tips the scales at 2.47 lbs instead of 3.09 lbs. </p>
<p> What else does the Lenovo Chromebook 3 11 bring to the table? </p>
<p> Aside from the changes noted above, everything else with the new Chromebook 3 11 appears to be the same. The company opted to carry forward the lay-flat design, for example. So this isn't a 2-in-1 tablet-like Chromebook but a more traditional clamshell. </p>
<p> Its HD 1366×768 resolution display is coupled with a similarly specced webcam too, at 720p. Below that, surrounding the keyboard, are the same ports and plugs on the original. That means users are getting two USB Type-C (Gen 1, USB 3.1) ports for charging, transfers, and display capabilities. Those are backed by two further standard USB ports from the same generation of USB. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For those who need a little added physical security, the Lenovo Chromebook 3 11 also features a Kensington security lock. </p>
<p> A 3.5mm audio combo jack is present for audio listening or recording and a MicroSD card reader is present. That's just in case 64GB of storage isn't enough to hold all of the user's media — or the available Android and Linux apps and games. Bluetooth 4.2 takes care of wireless audio and accessories. External audio is handled via two 2-watt speakers. </p>
<p> Chrome OS, of course, manages everything under the hood. And the auto-updates for that won't come to an end until June 2026. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Driving all of the processing is an Intel Celeron N4020 chip clocked at up to 2.8GHz over two cores and two threads. The chip can provide a claimed up to 10-hours of battery life on a single charge. </p>
<p> Pricing for this Chromebook is surprisingly well thought out </p>
<p> In terms of pricing and availability, there haven't been any specific regions specified for the Chromebook 3 11 from Lenovo. But pricing is set in a way that's sure to be appealing to anybody looking for a secondary computing device in a portable package. Or for a new laptop for the family. </p>
<p> Lenovo set the bar for the original Chromebook 3 in a 14-inch package at $249. The new 11-inch variant provides the above improvements at around $229 at retail too. So users are paying a slightly lower cost, sacrificing some screen real estate for a better display panel and double the storage space. Lenovo is selling the Chrome OS gadget via its official store site now. </p>

<p> Specs Leak For 3 Freshly-Teased Budget Lenovo Chromebooks </p>
<p> Lenovo has three new devices on the way for its ‘C’ and ‘S’ series budget Chromebook line, dubbed the Lenovo Chromebook C340-11, Chromebook C340-15, and Chromebook S340-14. These won't be a small upgrade from the previous Chromebook C330 and S330 devices. </p>
<p> Based on newly leaked specs spotted after the company posted a new teaser for the devices though, the company is going much further to differentiate this time around too. </p>
<p> As with last year's entries, there are some similarities between the new models. Each utilizes plastics in the casing and comes in 32GB or 64GB storage options coupled with 4GB LPDDR4 2400MHz RAM to start. All but the C340-15 is listed with up to 8GB RAM. Intel chips are at the center of the hardware in each. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Every one of the newly leaked devices shows a 720p webcam set just above the display, with touchscreens available across the board — although not standard in the Lenovo Chromebook S340-14. Along that same vein, each is rated at up to 10-hours of battery life. </p>
<p> The Chromebook S340-14 is a clamshell that should be business-ready </p>
<p> As might be guessed from the naming conventions used by Lenovo, the two new Chromebook with the 'C' designation are convertible designs. The Chromebook S40-14, while available with a touchscreen option, comes in a lay-flat clamshell package. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That comes in either a deep Dark Orchid hue or an Onyx Black color configuration at just 0.74-inches thick. </p>
<p> In the edges, the Lenovo Chromebook S340-14 comes with a microSD card reader, two USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A standard plugs, and two further Type-C plugs — only one of which is rated for DC-in charging. A 3.5mm audio combo jack is part of the package as well. </p>
<p> Display output via either USB-C port maxes out at a resolution of 3840 x 2160 and a 60Hz refresh rate. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For display technology, Lenovo ships the device with either a 14-inch 1920 x 1080 display — at either 220nits or 250, depending on whether the touch-compatible option is selected — or a 1366 x 768 panel. Non-touch variants are anti-glare displays. </p>
<p> Judging by the fact that Lenovo's 14-inch S340 ships with both a dual-core Intel Celeron Processor and an H1 security chip, it's also likely to be the most compatible with business-specific use cases. </p>
<p> The processor is coupled with an on-chip Intel UHD Graphics 600 unit and is clocked at 1.1GHz base frequency or up to 2.6GHz when under load. An Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 9560 combo chip delivers Bluetooth 4.2 and Wi-Fi 802.11ac to the table. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The 'C' gadgets </p>
<p> The Lenovo Chromebook C340-11 is going to be the closest to the S340-14 in terms of specs and capabilities but comes with a few key differences. </p>
<p> To begin with, it's a 2-in-1 folder on a 360-degree hinge for tent, stand, tablet, or laptop use. That's centered around an 11-inch display at 1366 x 768 resolution, embedded in an aluminum lid for extra durability to handle convertible use. The design is 0.7-inches thin. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Colors listed and shown for the Lenovo's upcoming 11-inch Chromebook are Platinum grey or Sand pink. </p>
<p> The largest and likely the most powerful of the new devices is the Lenovo Chromebook C340-15. That features a choice between an Intel Pentium Gold Processor or eighth-gen Intel Core i3 processor — clocked at 2.3 GHz or 2.2GHz and up to 3.4GHz. Both are backed by a maximum of 4GB RAM in either DDR4-2133 or DDR4-2400 formats, respectively. </p>
<p> Aside from the chipset differences, including the use of an HD Graphics 610 or Intel UHD Graphics 620 chip instead of the 600-series unit, there are also differences in the screen and keyboard technology with the C340-15. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The display used in the Lenovo Chromebook C340-15 is set to be a 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080 panel. The keyboard on this device, conversely, will be the only one to offer optional backlighting. </p>
<p> That will all be packed into a build that's slightly thicker than the Chromebook S340-14 but still respectably-thin at 0.74-inches. The biggest difference can be found in the external features too, with only one USB Type-A Standard port included instead of the two found in the other devices. Only one color option will be available for Lenovo's new 15-inch budget Chromebook, Mineral Grey. </p>
<p> No H1 security chip is listed with either of the two new C-series Lenovo Chromebooks. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pricing and availability </p>
<p> The Lenovo Chromebook C330 and S330 stole the show at last year's IFA 2018 event in Berlin and it's not unlikely the company hopes to do the same at this year's event. With consideration for the leaked specifications, it remains to be seen if there's anything left for the company to do except to set about confirming everything. </p>
<p> Lenovo has not, as of this writing, revealed any details regarding the price for any of the devices. They will undoubtedly be more expensive than the previous devices in the series due to the use of Intel hardware instead of the more affordable MediaTek offerings. The Lenovo Chromebook C330 started out at $279, as compared to the Chromebook S330 at $250. </p>
<p> Availability hasn't been outlined officially either but the leaked pages detailing the devices do show them being built for regions listed as 'North America, Nordics, France, Germany, Netherlands, Australia, and UK Group'. That doesn't necessarily provide confirmation of every region where these will be sold or which models are included. But it does give some base indication of where to expect the new Lenovo Chrome OS laptops. </p>

<p> Google News / Google Chrome / Lenovo Chromebook Duet Review – Setting The Bar For Budget Detachable Chromebooks </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook Duet Review – Setting The Bar For Budget Detachable Chromebooks </p>
<p> The Lenovo Chromebook Duet is easily the best ultra-portable detachable for the money </p>
<p> Rating </p>
<p> Pros </p>
<p> Magnetic keyboard attachment isn't strong enough for comfort </p>
<p> Only a single port -- USB-C </p>
<p> No 3.5mm audio jack </p>
<p> 3.5-hours to charge </p>
<p> Lenovo's recently launched Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a Chrome OS gadget that's really deserving of a full review. That's because not only is it billed as a complete Chromebook package rather than just a tablet with a keyboard. It's also among the most affordable and portable Chromebooks around at just $279 to start. </p>
<p> That puts this Chromebook in a unique category and an interesting position. In effect, it represents an attempt by Lenovo to solve the problem of balancing cost, battery life, performance, and efficiency. For a 10.1-inch tablet-format Chromebook, that's a tall order. But this Chromebook ships with a detachable keyboard and a high-resolution touchscreen with universal stylus support. And that's in addition to the claim that this is a work machine as much as for entertainment. </p>
<p> Summarily, that's going to be a high bar for any computer to meet. And it's one that this device mostly does. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Surprisingly, despite the use of affordable processors, middling RAM, and moderate storage, this is a Chromebook that performs. And it performs while offering a clearer than expected display experience alongside a better-than-expected battery. </p>
<p> After spending some time with this new device, there can really only be one conclusion. The Lenovo Chromebook Duet is hands-down the most smooth-operating Chromebook I've ever used at below $400. Let's take a deeper look at why that is. </p>
<p> The hardware is mostly only held back by its size </p>
<p> Lenovo engineered its Chromebook Duet to be hardy and portable above all else and it shined on those fronts throughout this review. That means its 10.1-inch frame is under 2lbs with the keyboard attached, with just enough bezel to grip. At 0.7-inches with the keyboard attached or 0.3-inches in tablet mode, it's also among the slimmest Chromebooks to date. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course, none of that means it's not great-looking too. In fact, its two-tone back panel, complete with a silver "Lenovo" tag, both looks and feels great. There are no sharp or unexpected edges, even with the rear-facing camera creeping out an extra millimeter or two. And the power buttons are both clicky and tightly fitted enough that they don't protrude much. </p>
<p> Tacking on top-firing dual speakers and dual mics, as well as the right-hand placement of the volume rocker, power button, and USB-C port, this device is just a joy to use as a tablet. And the aluminum, even without the threaded multi-fabric back covering magnetically attached, is grippy enough that drops should be rare. </p>
<p> That backplate does attach firmly too. So there's very little chance that will slip loose or fall off. And the kickstand is extremely solid for its thinness, offering little to no wiggle regardless of the angle chosen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, one major caveat here is that a flat, stable surface is going to be needed for this device to be used in laptop mode. That's not just because this relies on pogo-pins, magnets, and a kickstand to stay upright either. What I found in my review of the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is that those magnets aren't strong enough to hold the laptop attached when lifted while opened. That was the case even when the keyboard was half-supported by my hand. </p>
<p> Summarily, I dropped this keyboard more often than I'd care to admit over a relatively short time and that segment isn't as durable as the rest, dinging easily along the edges. </p>
<p> Another problem with that is that the keyboard will need to be set aside somewhere when the device in tablet mode. That can't simply be reattached backward and flipped around like a 2-in-1 convertible Chromebook or standard detachable. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Finally, the keyboard here is tiny and — at least for me — never really felt comfortable to use. That's not unexpected since the size is a feature with this device. And that's despite that Lenovo did an exceptional job of using all but a few millimeters of the left- and right-hand edges. So it is significantly better than other similarly-sized keyboards I've used. </p>
<p> The top surface of the keyboard is a soft-touch plastic. The travel of the keys is comfortable and the top-to-bottom spacing is too. So it isn't the materials or travel that are causing the issue. But it still feels very cramped. It took more than a week of steady use to really feel natural. </p>
<p> This is simply not a device for those with large hands unless a dedicated after-market keyboard is going to be used. For everybody else, it's usable with a significant amount of practice. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Conversely, the trackpad felt comfortable and was easy to use despite its diminutive stature. </p>
<p> None of the caveats here should really be a dealbreaker or unexpected though. Given the size of this gadget, I really expected a much worse experience. </p>
<p> The specs here don't tell the entire performance story </p>
<p> Under the hood, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is powered by MediaTek's P60T chipset — MT8183. That is, on its face, doesn't sound like great news. However, while that helped keep the cost of the Lenovo Chromebook Duet down, my review showed that it really doesn't drag performance down much at all. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course, performance, like battery life, is subjective. Different tasks are going to have different requirements. And the ARM architecture actually plays to Chrome OS's strengths rather than against it. So this chipset performs much better than might be expected here. </p>
<p> It's also backed up by 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB storage, starting at just $279. The review unit sent by Lenovo bumps capacity up to 128GB and that only costs $20 more. So the value cannot be overstated. </p>
<p> Stepping back to take a look at just how this performs, however, I used this Chromebook for a number of tasks. That includes heavy workload tasks with dozens of pages open while also performing photo edits, conducting research, and undertaking word processing tasks. I also tinkered around with some deeper tasks associated with video processing. But none of those really slowed this Chromebook down. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It goes without saying that the time it takes to process certain things, like large photo files, was extended. But there wasn't any latency or unexpected lag either. And that's not always the case with sub-$300 Chrome OS gadgets. More often than not, Chromebooks at under $400 fall short of being able to accomplish the things this Chromebook can. </p>
<p> That's setting aside the fact that it ran every Android app I could think to run without a hitch too and video streaming, obviously, didn't present any issues. Conversely, if a buyer wanted to run coding programs and write Android apps on this device, it's safe to say they could. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Chromebook Duet will not be downloading Linux to install and run major tools typically used in high-end production. Or at least it won't be doing that as well as a $1000 laptop. But it does perform well above its price — so much so that I'd have expected a cost closer to $400 – $500. </p>
<p> The display flaws here are minor, especially at this device's cost </p>
<p> There are two main caveats to be noted about the Lenovo Chromebook Duet display and both were immediately apparent near the beginning of my review period. First, this is a 16:10 aspect ratio panel. That means that it's really great for viewing websites and multitasking. But it's also non-standard. </p>
<p> In effect, the result is a web browsing experience where more content is shown at any given time. The display also leaves plenty of room extraneous software inclusions — particularly in the browser — which we'll discuss later on. But when it comes to playing back media, there aren't many sites, movies, or tv shows that are offered in the ratio at hand. So letterboxing is a problem, especially in wider-format videos. </p>
<p> Apps also rely on aspect ratios, leading to some apps not quite displaying across the entire panel or being cut off. </p>
<p> Now, that doesn't appear to be a problem for top applications or for the overwhelming majority of videos. Media consumption is still a very enjoyable experience here — with small exceptions such as the one shown in the image above. </p>
<p> And, on the other side of that coin, this screen is not only bright enough for just about any lighting at 400nits. It additionally covers 70% of the color gamut, showing vibrant hues brilliantly. The resolution is higher than just about anything in this price range too. At a resolution of 1,920 by 1,200 pixels, all things considered, this Chromebook offers a truly high-value, high-definition experience. </p>
<p> The audio experience from Lenovo Chromebook Duet is great with a single, obvious exception </p>
<p> Getting the most immediately obvious drawback to the Lenovo Chromebook Duet's audio experience out of the way first, there is no 3.5mm audio jack to be found on this device. That's not a huge deal except that there's only one USB-C port and the company fully expects users to rely on either Bluetooth 4.2 or the included USB-C to 3.5mm adapter. </p>
<p> There's simply no easy way to charge this gadget and utilize the USB-C port for audio at the same time — or any other accessory, for that matter. So, for those who need headphones that are wired, this may not ultimately be the right device. </p>
<p> Setting that aside, the dual speakers included here are well-tuned, with each frequency being well-represented. They're also loud, with audio unhindered by the attached keyboard since they're mounted in the top edge. That's also where users will find two separate far-field mics for using Google Assistant — and any downloaded software — via voice. </p>
<p> Voice chats and calls made on the Lenovo Chromebook Duet came through clearly in either direction during my review, so long as the connection strength is good. </p>
<p> The speakers aren't great either though. It's worth pointing out that while they're better than the average laptop speakers, they also still lack the punch that's often present in bigger or more expensive components. Fortunately, they aren't too tinny as a result of the trade-offs Lenovo has made. But they're not going to be awesome either. </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook Duet nails down software and connections at the budget end </p>
<p> In terms of software, this is a Chromebook. That typically means that there's no extra software to speak of aside from what users download and install. Apps can be installed from the Google Play Store or from the web — for PWAs. Conversely, users can also install Linux applications on modern Chrome OS devices. So there should be a solution to suit just about any need. </p>
<p> Another major feature that's part of that package comes in the form of connectivity. The latest tech isn't included here, likely as a cost-saving measure. So there's no Wi-Fi 6 or Bluetooth 5.1. Instead, Lenovo includes Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 4.2. In both cases, those performed as well as much more expensive Chromebooks I've tested. </p>
<p> But this Chromebook fully supports connection to an Android Smartphone as a way to stay connected. That's in terms of both shared data connectivity, automatic sign-ins, and even messaging — if Google's Messaging app is used. </p>
<p> At the same time, my review of the Lenovo Chromebook Duet showed that software here is not exactly typical. That's because this Chrome OS tablet is designed to function as both a tablet and a laptop. The most noteworthy software tweaks all happen when the included keyboard is disconnected. Once removed, this Chromebook reverts to a more pure tablet mode, complete with gesture navigation. </p>
<p> Google has put a lot of effort into improving Chrome OS on that front over the years. And that shines through perhaps nowhere better than in Chrome itself. </p>
<p> When placed in tablet mode, the small squarish Chrome tabs of the past are left behind for a more Android-like experience. Namely, the tabs are gone and a square-shaped number icon takes its place next to the URL Omnibox. Tapping that icon reveals full-sized thumbnails of each tab and a plus button for opening new tabs. Pinned tabs are kept as small square icons. </p>
<p> That makes Chrome much more touch-friendly and this Chromebook much more productive when placed in tablet mode. And it isn't a feature that's seen on many other Chrome OS gadgets. The UI follows a similar tact, morphing into a more touch-friendly interface. It's a very intuitive and smooth experience, even without consideration for how bad the Chrome OS tablet UI used to be. </p>
<p> Another key aspect that differs here is that the Chromebook Duet will receive updates for no fewer than eight years. That's up from the previous standard of four. Of course, the OS still boots up extremely quickly and runs as smoothly as ever. The switch between tablet and laptop modes is instant too. </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook Duet Screen-On time is acceptable even if charging is abysmal </p>
<p> It goes without saying that any battery test is highly subjective, even where extensive testing has been done to find an average. So, it also goes without saying that the results of my review for the Lenovo Chromebook Duet won't necessarily be typical. </p>
<p> I kept the screen brightness turned up to around 60-percent for my test. That was almost bright enough for direct sunlight but not quite. The display was more than bright enough for a brightly lit room at 40-percent so the battery life for users staying indoors could easily be much better. </p>
<p> I also used this Chromebook for a variety of tasks, chiefly associated with this review and others as well as article writing. But that doesn't mean I didn't test the battery, in part, under media-consumption circumstances. This is, after all, designed to work for both ends of the use case spectrum. </p>
<p> Bearing that in mind, this Chromebook was utilized for work tasks with more than 24 constantly open tabs and cycling tabs in addition to that. I also used this for both online and offline photo editing purposes. That segment of my battery test drained at the battery for approximately 4-hours and 34-minutes. The camera was in use for around 20-minutes of that. </p>
<p> Conversely, I only watched videos, played Android games, and listened to music services for around an hour-and-a-half during the battery test segment. That's in addition to around 40-minutes where the device was sitting doing no work whatsoever. </p>
<p> The net result of that test fell well-short of the advertised use time — 10-hours. I only saw around 6-hours and 44-minutes in total on-time. That's with 40-minutes of screen-off time. </p>
<p> As noted above, with more realistic screen brightness and more browsing than actual work, that time is going to increase. So my on-time isn't necessarily typical. And it's worth noting that this Chromebook performed better than a large majority of those I've had the opportunity to test in real-world circumstances. </p>
<p> Charging was much less impressive. In fact, it took around three-and-a-half hours to fill the battery completely. That's a fairly serious wait time between charges and worth taking note of for anybody looking to use this device as a portable work machine. </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook Duet's 8MP camera is only hampered by Chrome OS </p>
<p> With a price tag of under $300, not even a dedicated camera can be expected to offer a great photo or video experience. But a quick review of the cameras found on the Lenovo Chromebook Duet proves that it doesn't have to be the case. </p>
<p> That's because, unlike most other Chromebooks, Lenovo incorporated genuinely decent hardware here. The front-facing camera bumps forward from most competing to 2-megapixels from 1-megapixel. That's the standard found in just about every Chromebook with few exceptions and it makes an obvious difference. Video chats and quick selfies are clearer and better-detailed than was expected. </p>
<p> The real showstopper is the rear-mounted 8-megapixel snapper. The only thing holding that camera back from greatness is, in fact, Chrome OS itself. </p>
<p> Now, Google has made a number of improvements to the Chromebook camera software over the years. That includes the addition of square and portrait modes, at the very least. But it hasn't come quite far enough yet. As shown in our sample gallery via Flickr, the software results in a slower-than-average snap, the loss of some detail, lack of HDR-driven clarity or contrast, and any number of other minor issues. </p>
<p> Bearing that in mind, Lenovo's included snapper does perform a whole lot better than most competing Chromebooks. Color capture feels consistent and accurate. Audio capture does too, in video shooting modes, thanks to the multi-mic layout mentioned earlier. </p>
<p> That also means these cameras could get better if Google improves the camera software further. But this simply isn't going to be a great dedicated camera replacement in the meantime. </p>
<p> Is Lenovo Chromebook Duet worth the asking price </p>
<p> Lenovo has done a stellar job with its Chromebook Duet, showing under rigorous review that it can compete where it really needs too. Of course, at a size of just 10.1-inches diagonally, there are trade-offs. </p>
<p> A smaller battery is in use than might otherwise have been included. The keyboard can be cramped, especially for users with smaller hands. The kickstand and magnetic keyboard attachment aren't perfect. And, thanks mostly to Chrome OS, the cameras aren't spectacular. </p>
<p> But when it comes to performance, in spite of a budget-friendly processor and low RAM, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet doesn't disappoint. It handily powered through everything I would typically ask of a Chromebook. That includes everything from photo editing and video streaming to a combination of those and other tasks. </p>
<p> Given that I typically use a Chromebook that costs twice as much at retail, that's a truly noteworthy achievement. And it leaves behind the question of whether or not this gadget is worth the money. </p>
<p> Unequivocally, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet — also marketed as the Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Duet — is not only worth every penny. Or at least it does for those who can handle the smaller form factor or who absolutely need portability as a top concern. </p>
<p> This Chromebook absolutely outshines the competition in its price bracket and is easily the highest available value in the small-form tablet-style detachable front for Chrome OS. The Lenovo Chromebook Duet is the new standard in its class. </p>

<p> Lenovo Confirms Legion Specs On Newly Live Pre-Order Page </p>
<p> The Lenovo Legion is going to be the latest gaming smartphone on the market and is scheduled for an unveiling in just a week, but you can already pre-order the device if you live in China. </p>
<p> Pre-order pages for the Legion phone are live on both Lenovo's own webpage as well as jd.com. While this doesn't do much for consumers in the US or other regions outside of China, there's still useful information to be had. </p>
<p> This is because Lenovo lists key details about some of the more important specifications of the Legion. Including the processor, the fast-charging capabilities, and the screen's refresh rate. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo Legion pre-order page confirms key specs </p>
<p> Even though US consumers can't really pre-order the device, the page does still offer up details about the phone. The Legion is confirmed to be coming with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+. </p>
<p> There has been plenty of speculation earlier this year about whether or not Qualcomm was actually making this mobile platform. With rumors popping up that not only Lenovo Legion would be powered by it, but that the ROG Phone 3 would as well. </p>
<p> Lenovo has now confirmed that the Snapdragon 865+ will be powering its first gaming smartphone. So that likely means that consumers can expect the same out of ASUS with the ROG Phone 3. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The pre-order page for the device also lists the specs for the charging technology and the screen refresh rate. </p>
<p> The phone will have a 144Hz screen </p>
<p> In addition to confirming the Snapdragon 865+ mobile platform, Lenovo also confirms the screen refresh rate. </p>
<p> The Legion will come with a 144Hz display. Of course, most mobile games won't even support a refresh rate that fast. But there are sure to be a few outliers who will work to support as quickly as they can. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And if nothing else, it'll still be useful for when scrolling through social or news feeds. Giving you a super smooth scroll with little to no jank or jittery hangups. </p>
<p> Lenovo is also using a 90w fast charge for the device so it gains power quickly. The page doesn't list how big the battery capacity is, but the 90w fast charge will help to ensure it gets enough power for hours more of gaming even if the battery was low to begin with. </p>
<p> Lenovo is scheduled to announce the Legion on July 22. Which is only a week away at this point. If there was ever a time to expect information on a US release in addition to pricing, that would be the time. </p>

<p> Mobile Events News / CES / Lenovo Reveals The First Detachable Budget Chromebook At CES 2020 </p>
<p> Lenovo Reveals The First Detachable Budget Chromebook At CES 2020 </p>
<p> Lenovo has taken to CES 2020 to release the world's first detachable Chromebook in the budget segment with the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook. As its branding suggests, the new gadget falls into Lenovo's affordable lineup at under $300. It's also not the most powerful Chrome OS laptop as a result. But it does bring quite a lot to the table. </p>
<p> In terms of design, the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook is remarkable in that it doesn't necessarily look cheap. The company has given the tablet-style device a dual-tone aluminum build in a silvery-blue and gray finish. That sits within a kick-stand-enhanced casing so that it can be easily used at least partially hands-free. An evenly-spaced but not insubstantial bezel houses the 10.1-inch display. </p>
<p> As mentioned above gadget is detachable. That means that it connects to and disconnects from a keyboard as needed. In this case, that keyboard accessory ships with the device — which weighs under a pound with the keyboard detached. Stylus support is part of the package but those accessories will be sold as an optional device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Under the hood, Lenovo equipped its IdeaPad Duet Chromebook with a respectable octa-core Mediatek chipset. Up to 4GB RAM and 128GB storage back that up. </p>
<p> Not just a first for Lenovo in the budget detachable Chromebook market </p>
<p> The performance of the new Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook should be impressive for the price bracket. But this device isn't just impressive as the first sub-$300 detachable Chrome OS gadget either. </p>
<p> Not only did Lenovo give the tablet an impressive-looking keyboard in a frame that should last for a long time. The company is also holding up a statement on the software side that not many Chrome OS OEMs have ever made if any. Lenovo says it's IdeaPad Duet Chromebook will receive as many 8 years of automatic updates. That means this Chrome OS tablet should last around two years longer than its competitors on that front. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The average Chromebook is given a shelf-life of up to six years after launch as per Google policy. Support for up to eight years means that buyers have just that little bit extra value-added to consider. </p>
<p> Specs </p>
<p> The specs in the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook aren't anything to write home about in but that's not always a bad sign for a Chromebook. That's especially true where portability takes precedence over raw power. The operating system is exceptionally efficient with even low-levels of memory and storage with this Chromebook is respectable, as laid out in the specifications provided by Lenovo. </p>
<p> 430g (w/o keyboard set), 0.94lbs </p>
<p> Materials </p>
<p> Dual-tone design with Aluminum </p>
<p> One-piece Trackpad, 88.5mm x 52mm 18mm key pitch 1.3mm key travel Stand cover with 0-135° free stop </p>
<p> Pricing and availability </p>
<p> Now, Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook isn't slated to hit the market until May 2020. That's just a few months away but there's no exact launch date. Lenovo hasn't said precisely where its budget-friendly detachable Chrome OS tablet will become available as of CES. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pricing will start out at just $279.99, helping the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook squeeze its way into the budget category. But it will certainly go up from there to land at the highest specs available, as listed above. Lenovo hasn't revealed how much the top model will cost just yet. </p>

<p> Lenovo Developing A Foldable Smartphone With Two Hinges: Patent </p>
<p> It seems like Lenovo is planning to enter the foldable smartphone game as well. A new patent from the company surfaced, and it reveals a rather interesting foldable smartphone. </p>
<p> Lenovo submitted this patent back in March 2018 with the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office), and it was published on September 10. The patent was submitted for a “flexible electronic device”. </p>
<p> That very same patent was included in the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Office) global design database. Quite a few sketches were included as well, and you can check them out in the gallery down below. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Letsgodigital also included a couple of its own renders which are based on sketches from the previous design of this phone. That very same phone did surface before, with sharper edges, but Lenovo since updates its design. </p>
<p> Lenovo's foldable smartphone may include two hinges </p>
<p> What’s so interesting about this phone? Well, it comes with two hinges, believe it or not. This is a folding phone with a clamshell design. Considering it has two hinges, it can be folded in two different spots. </p>
<p> To make things even more interesting, not a single one of those two hinges is in the middle of the device. One is located right below the middle of the phone, while the other one sits towards closely below it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This phone also includes a physical fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone. It is possible that Lenovo will update the design, though, and include an in-display fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Its bottom bezel is considerably thicker than the top one </p>
<p> The bottom bezel on the device seems to be considerably thicker than the top one. In any case, this phone will not have extremely thin bezels, that’s for sure, if it ever becomes a reality. </p>
<p> Those two hinges on the device may be quite useful. They will allow you to tilt the phone when it’s on the table, if needed. They will also allow the phone to show you notifications and other info at the top of the display when folded. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo will almost certainly include software for it, as the top part of the display remains visible even when the phone is folded. That leaves the company quite a few options for software features. </p>
<p> We do not know when or if this phone will become a reality, but it seems like Lenovo is working on it. This will be yet another different take on a foldable smartphone. </p>
<p> Samsung and Huawei already showed their foldable smartphones, while Xiaomi and Motorola are expected to do the same in the near future. Lenovo seems to be eager to do the same, but it remains to be seen when will that happen. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/08/lenovo-family-tablets-tab-m7-m8-2019.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485263" filename="lenovo-family-tablets-tab-m7-m8-2019.html">
<p> Lenovo Is Focusing On Family With M-Series Budget Android Tablets </p>
<p> Lenovo is putting its focus on family-ready products leading into this year’s IFA 2019 event and it now has two new Android tablets incoming to drive that point home. </p>
<p> Like the three new Chromebooks that the company is also revealing today, first leaked in late July, these two tablets couldn't be more different from each other. Or at least not while maintaining the familiar M-series branding. The smaller of Lenovo's new tablets, the Tab M7, is a second-generation device while the Tab M8 is an 8-inch tablet with quite a bit more power to bring. </p>
<p> Each also shares plenty of features that bring the focus back around to practical durability and a more premium feel than is often seen at the budget end of the Android tablet spectrum. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are several decisions that Lenovo has made to ensure these tablets are family-friendly. One of those is the introduction of a newly-revamped kid-mode dubbed "Kid’s Mode 3.0." </p>
<p> The software feature now allows parents to give their children their own accounts complete with customizations that are tuned to the child's preferences. Of course, control will be in the hands of parents but that means apps, games, and other media recommendations will be matched on an individualized basis. </p>
<p> The Tab M7 is the family-friendliest of the pair </p>
<p> Lenovo's Tab M7 is the less capable of the two devices. In part, that's because of pricing. But that also doesn't mean Lenovo's cutting corners where one might expect. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For starters, while the tablet won't be winning design awards any time soon, it comes in at just 8.25mm thin. So Lenovo certainly hasn't shirked on the build. The device weighs just slightly more than some smartphones, at 236 grams. Starting at the back, Lenovo built its Tab M7 with a rear panel that's 90-percent metal. </p>
<p> That's accented at the front by a 7-inch, 350-nit LCD panel. The 5-point multitouch screen has a relatively low resolution of 1024 x 600. Thanks to slimmed-back bezels, the gadget has an 82-percent screen-to-body ratio. The display is TÜV Rheinland-certified for reduced blue-light output. </p>
<p> 2-megapixel cameras are included alongside a forward-firing Dolby-enhanced speaker. One sits front and center at the top while the other holds a similar position at the back. Lenovo has kept the 3.5mm audio jack in place with its Tab M7. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo will sell two versions of the Tab M7. </p>
<p> Operating on Android 9 Pie Go Edition, the first is only equipped with Wi-Fi and 3G networking as well as Bluetooth 4.2. That's driven by a MediaTek-built 32-bit quad-core SoC, the MT8321, clocked at 1.3 GHz. Backing up the chip, Lenovo is incorporating 1GB RAM. The undoubtedly pricier version will pack in a quad-core 64-bit MediaTek MT8765B chip clocked at 1.3 GHz and backed by 2GB RAM. </p>
<p> The versions will come with 8GB, 16GB, 32GB of microSD expandable storage — up to 2TB. Configurations with 2GB RAM will ship with standard Android 9 Pie. The battery in either is a 3500mAh capacity unit allowing for up to two weeks of standby and up to 10-hours of use. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo Tab M8 brings more power for those who need it </p>
<p> As noted above, the Lenovo Tab M8 keeps an affordable price point but shifts things even further toward the premium in terms of usability and performance. As the branding suggests, Lenovo Tab M8 is actually comprised of a couple of family-ready 8-inch tablets. This time, those center on entertainment. </p>
<p> Now, some features such as the 350 nit display brightness remain the same and blue-light certifications are intact. The use of metals in the back panel is only slightly better. Lenovo Moved audio output to the side with its larger device to reduce the bezels further. </p>
<p> In almost every other measurable way, the Lenovo Tab is significantly better than its counterpart. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Starting with the display, Lenovo has upgraded to a 10-point multitouch panel in either an HD or FHD configuration with support for a wider portion of the color gamut. </p>
<p> Lenovo left the Tab M7's 2-megapixel snapper above the screen but the primary sensor is rated at a more reasonable 5-megapixels. </p>
<p> A 64-bit processor powers the Android experience here instead of a 32-bit chip. Specifically, that's MediaTek's A22 quad-core chipset clocked at 2.0 GHz. Lenovo is offering both 2GB and 3GB RAM variants. So Android Go is unnecessary on these tablets. Either 16GB or 32GB of microSD expandable storage will be available. </p>

<p> For traditional networking, Lenovo is including a dual-band chip for WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac protocols. To begin with, LTE is supported across a much wider array of global frequency bands than with the Tab M7. That includes some CDMA frequencies this time around too. </p>
<p> The OEM is including Bluetooth 5.0 for better range and signal stability. </p>
<p> Driving all of that, Lenovo has pushed the battery to 5000mAh. That allows up to a claimed 18-hours of web browsing and up to 12-hours of media consumption. </p>

<p> Pricing and availability for the new family-friendly Lenovo tablets </p>
<p> Both the Tab M7 and Tab M8 are 4G LTE-ready via nano-SIM with a full suite of connectivity features such as WiFi Direct, WiFi Display, and the full gamut of location-based equipment from GPS to GLONASS. That's on top of the usual accelerometers and other standard sensors, of course. </p>
<p> Buyers have three color options for the Lenovo Tab M7 variants, including Iron Grey, Platinum Grey, and Onyx Black when those go on sale in October. The more budget-friendly of the two devices, those will start out at $89.99, depending on the version purchased. Prices will almost certainly vary from region to region. </p>
<p> The company's Tab M8 comes in the same colors but without the black configuration and starts out at a suggested retail price of $109.99 for the HD model. The FHD model begins at $50 more with a price tag set at $159.99. The company's offerings have, up until this point, been almost exclusively available in the HD format. </p>
<p> Both of the Tab M8 models will become available at the same time as the Lenovo Tab M7, according to Lenovo. </p>
<p> Exact details regarding retail or online availability haven't been specified just yet. Precisely where the tablets will be made available for purchase is another piece of information that hasn't been provided by the company. The particulars of both should be made clear soon enough for both new M-Series devices via the company's official site. </p>

<p> Mobile Events News / CES / Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook Delivers Performance, Real-World Longevity – CES 2020 </p>
<p> Day one of CES 2020 is underway and Lenovo has now announced another new Chromebook dubbed the Flex 5, slotting neatly into the more power-focused end of the market. The new gadget isn't the most forward-thinking when it comes to design, featuring aluminum only in its top cover. But that cost-reducing feature is offset by key characteristics that should make it a solid choice for users across the board. </p>
<p> Not only is the Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook a 13-inch 2-in-1 laptop weighing in at under three pounds. Lenovo also built its sleek, thin-bezel gadget around a water-resistant backlit keyboard. So this gadget should be relatively easy to use over long periods and as well as in the dark — without concerns that users might spill their drink on it. </p>
<p> Top-firing speakers have been included as well as two USB Type-C ports, one USB standard port, an audio jack, and an SD slot for extra storage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The gadget offers up full universal stylus support complete with pressure sensitivity but it doesn't ship with one. </p>
<p> Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook Is Project Athena Certified </p>
<p> Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook is also among the more powerful devices available, setting aside its entry-level price tag. The company went out of its way to ensure it meets the exacting standards laid out by Intel's Project Athena. That means that the 10-hour battery life should be with real-world use rather than mostly speculative. </p>
<p> It also means users can expect to get the most out of the devices' up to 8GB of DDR4 RAM and up to 128GB of true SSD storage. That's backing up 10th-generation Intel Core chipsets up to an Intel Core i5-10210U. While the IPS touchscreen is only rated at a Full HD resolution, the power on offer for those who might need it makes this an exceptionally high-value device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Specs </p>
<p> For those who need a more direct rundown of the specs, Lenovo has provided at least a few extra details. The performance here, even at the entry-level, should equate to a device that can both get serious work done and allow for a great entertainment experience. But details about the available chipsets at the lower end of the spectrum have not been specified. </p>
<p> Length: 12.2 in (310 mm) Width: 8.4 in (214 mm) Height: 0.67 in (17 mm) </p>
<p> Weight </p>
<p> 2.97lbs; 1.35kg </p>
<p> Pricing and availability </p>
<p> Lenovo hasn't offered up any details regarding availability outside of the North America sales region. But the Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook should become available for purchase as early as late June of this year, following its announcement at CES 2020. </p>
<p> Pricing is fairly affordable too, with consideration for the form factor and performance detailed by the company. Lenovo expects the 13-inch premium Chromebook to start out at an MSRP of just $359.99. </p>

<p> Google News / Google Chrome / Lenovo Set To Raise The Bar With Its Most Powerful Chromebook Ever </p>
<p> Lenovo Set To Raise The Bar With Its Most Powerful Chromebook Ever </p>
<p> Lenovo is getting ready to up its Chromebook game considerably, according to a recently spotted listing on the company's product reference page. The new gadget will actually be a part of Lenovo's Yoga Chromebook line and specifically a member of the Chromebook C630 family but with significant updates to the internal hardware. </p>
<p> Externally, Lenovo doesn't seem to be changing things up at all. So the newest C630 will almost certainly bring the same all-aluminum nearly-matte midnight blue design to bear as its counterparts. That includes the 2-in-1 design, complete with a whisper-quiet keyboard with optional backlighting, slim bezels, and exceptional build quality. </p>
<p> On the inside, the changes will help cement this device's placement among the top ten best Chrome devices that can be purchased — a distinction the Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 has held almost since launch. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To begin with, the new design takes the current top model's i5 processor and briskly tosses it aside for an eighth-gen Intel Core i7-8550U. That's a quad-core eight-thread unit clocked at a base frequency of 1.8GHz but boostable up to 4.0GHz and backed by 8MB cache, for those who need the deeper details. Behind that, Lenovo is including twice the usual memory with 16GB DDR4 2400MHz RAM included too. </p>
<p> The storage with the new device will stay the same, based on the listed specs, at 128GB. The backlit keyboard and 15.6-inch UHD touch IPS 4K display will be standard for the more than twenty countries the laptop will reportedly appear in when it lands. </p>
<p> This is important and not just for Lenovo </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The addition of a standard 4K display panel isn't entirely new for the company since it was available already as an option but the addition of an Intel Core i7 processor may be significant. That's because up until this point there have been very few competitors to offer such powerful hardware in a Chromebook. </p>
<p> Top-level Intel processors are, arguably, overkill with regard to Chrome OS and Chromebooks. The same could be argued for top AMD processors such as those still making their way through the initial phases of development for the platform or with the new trend toward 16GB RAM. </p>
<p> That may not actually be the case anymore as Google's focus has shifted to offering experiences in Linux and Android that will take advantage of the hardware — especially when used for multitasking or for software development. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are already several i7 offerings available including Google's own Pixel Slate, the Pixelbook and presumably the upcoming Pixelbook 2, as well as products sold by HP. Acer launched its own update to the Chromebook Spin 13 lineup in the same direction just a few days ago. </p>
<p> Taken collectively with the discovery of a Lenovo Yoga Chromebook packing the same hardware, everything seems to point to an emerging trend. Summarily, the release of this device could signal a renewed focus on expanding options to include a wider array of devices that are ready for the entire breadth of use case scenarios. </p>
<p> Still technically unofficial </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo's latest addition to its Yoga Chromebook C630 line is still technically unofficial and that means there aren't too many other details to be divulged just yet. There's also no way to know for sure when this will hit shelves or online retail. </p>
<p> No pricing information is included either but it would be reasonable to assume that it will be significantly more expensive than the current top model. That's presently priced at $899.99 — without factoring in ongoing price cuts that can bring the price down to around $650. </p>

<p> Newly-Discovered Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 Could Arrive Soon </p>
<p> Lenovo appears to be readying a replacement for its Chromebook S340, dubbed the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14. That's based on a new report from Chrome Unboxed, which recently spotted several region-specific SKUs tucked away on the company's website. The full details of availability and pricing aren't available there just yet. But each device looks to be a solid entry in the budget Chromebook market. </p>
<p> The biggest changes from that previous Chrome OS laptop and the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 is its processor. It will also ship in two brand new colors, albeit in an almost identical design to the above-mentioned budget Chromebook. Those are said to include Abyss Blue and a Platinum Grey. </p>
<p> Under the hood, the big change is a bump from Intel's N4000 processor in that previous Chromebook to a new Gemini Lake-R CPU. Specifically, that's Intel's dual-core N4020 dual-core processor. At the surface, that's a slight refresh which only offers a moderate boost from a maximum boost clock of 2.6GHz to 2.8GHz. But the chip should be more efficient overall since its significantly newer — by just shy of two years. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So what are those other IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 specs </p>
<p> Taking a deeper look at this 14-inch class Chromebook reveals specs that are almost guaranteed to keep pricing low. To begin with, Lenovo isn't including an FHD resolution on this clamshell-style, touch-optional Chromebook with a lay-flat hinge. Instead, the latter design feature will be optional and things start with an HD-rated 1366×768 screen. </p>
<p> From there, buyers will be able to get up to an FHD 1920×1080 display. Brightness will vary between 220 nits and 250 nits, depending on the model chosen. </p>
<p> Backing up the abovementioned Gemini Lake-R processor, Lenovo is including 4GB of RAM in the US. Elsewhere, up to 8GB of memory will be available and that will be further backed by either 32GB or 64GB storage. Consumers are getting plenty of ports, just in case that isn't enough. Those not only include two USB 3.1 ports and two further USB Type-C ports. There's a MicroSD card reader too, offset by a 3.5mm audio combo jack. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For connectivity, users have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. </p>
<p> The keyboard design here will be familiar too. That's a spill-resistant piece of hardware, likely featuring a spill-through design. Below that, on the underside, there will be two 2-watt stereo speakers. Set above and embedded in the screen's bezel, Lenovo is including a fairly standard 720p webcam. </p>
<p> An end of life date has already been determined here </p>
<p> Now, there aren't presently any price details or specific launch information to be found just yet. But this device should — based on its end-of-life date — arrive sooner than later. Lenovo lists its end-of-life for updates as being set in May 2026. That's when Google will stop providing automatic updates to this Chrome gadget's firmware. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The internal details, conversely, and the apparent recycling of this device's design, could give some indication of intended pricing. The expectation is that this Chromebook will certainly arrive at below the $400 mark. But a price below $350 for the top model isn't out of the question. </p>

<p> Google News / Google Chrome / Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 Review – Not "Bad" But Well Short Of Expectations </p>
<p> Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 Review – Not "Bad" But Well Short Of Expectations </p>
<p> Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 is great on performance but falls utterly flat elsewhere </p>
<p> Dim, low-viewing-angle display effectively ruins the experience </p>
<p> Battery life falls well below 7-hours with moderate use </p>
<p> No touchscreen is a hinderance in some apps </p>
<p> Lay-flat design is made pointless by the display </p>
<p> Audio is almost unbearably tinny beyond web chats </p>
<p> When Lenovo offered up its IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 to Android Headlines for review, I began by tempering my expectations. At just under $250, it isn't a top-tier gadget. It is, in fact, a decidedly budget-focused device. What I did expect, from a company that's well known for it, is a high-value offering with a few caveats. But those caveats, it turns out, limit this device significantly, while where this Chromebook stands out is not where it might be expected to. </p>
<p> When Lenovo launched its IdeaPad 3 Chromebook series, battery life was one of the key talking points. For the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14, that's rated at up to 10-hours. I was never able to use this device for more than 7-hours with even light browsing. The screen is also low-resolution and easily washed out. But that's a topic for later. </p>
<p> Where this device shines is in performance and design. Starting with the latter, that's nothing too out of the ordinary but it's a build that's comfortable to use too. The quality of the build feels great as well. On performance, this IdeaPad-branded Chromebook is not the most powerful device around either. It accomplished all of the tasks I set out to do, without complaint. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But this device really needs to be looked at more closely than general terms allow. There are stark contrasts here that are endemic in the budget-end but more so here, perhaps, than elsewhere. So let's take a closer look at this Chromebook. </p>
<p> The Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 is sleek for its price and well-built </p>
<p> Under review, it's immediately obvious that Lenovo went out of its way with the IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 to build a device that's modern and minimal. Cost, of course, was also a consideration that the company took seriously. The build here doesn't feel like its made of high-quality, high-dollar materials because it isn't. Instead, Lenovo used firm plastics throughout with slightly softer plastics for the keyboard. </p>
<p> That's definitely going to take away from the experience for those who want something more substantial. But it isn't unexpected at this device's price. In fact, it's expected. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Despite being built of plastics, Lenovo did a good job of ensuring the Chromebook itself actually looks and feels solid. It's lightweight at only around 3.08lbs for its 14-inch screen size. It's thicker than many Chromebooks too, at almost three-quarters of an inch. But the sharply beveled edges and slight curve from the back to front go a long way to making that less noticeable. That also makes the device feel more premium. </p>
<p> Thinner-than-expected bezels help there too, as does a solid hinge that leaves almost no wiggle at all. </p>
<p> As seen in the images here, this device is among the very few modern Chromebooks that comes in a lay-flat design with no touchscreen. That makes sharing on-screen content easier. We'll cover the lack of a touchscreen later on but the design isn't at all bad for what it's meant to be. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In terms of ports and plugs, Lenovo includes two USB 3.1 Type-A Gen 1 ports as well as two USB 3.1 Type-C ports. An Audio combo jack and MicroSD card reader are part of the build too. And each of those clicks into place as solidly as could be expected. The keyboard's touchpad follows a similar vein, with solid clicks hinting at a long life to come. That's also smooth and responsive, leading to a better experience than might be expected for the money. </p>
<p> On the keyboard, good key travel — though not the best I've used — provide a similar experience. That's exceptionally comfortable to type on for long sessions even though the key travel does feel a little longer than what I've become accustomed to. The keyboard is also a spill-resistant design. So it definitely has that going for it as well. </p>
<p> The display serves as one of this Chromebook's only real failure points </p>
<p> The display was my biggest pain point when it comes to the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14, under review. That's not without good reason. Lenovo was quite obviously trying to keep the pricing low. But, even at under $250, this display failed to meet my expectations. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Used indoors, under moderate lighting, with the screen turned down to just over half brightness, it isn't terrible. Resolution isn't the issue either. This is a 1366 x 768 220-nits anti-glare 14-inch panel. So it's only going to show pixels up close and that's not going to be a big issue except for those that plan to use this for entertainment. Or for those who are accustomed to and expecting a higher-resolution panel. No. The problems, however, are twofold. </p>
<p> First, the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 has a very narrow viewing angle. Details around the edges of the panel begin to dark immediately when that's not looked at head-on. At just a few degrees off, it's obvious. At just 30- or 40-degrees, that is exacerbated to the point of being nearly unusable. That's unless the brightness is ramped all the way up. And brightness serves as the second caveat for this display too. </p>
<p> Not only does this display not feel nearly bright enough. It certainly isn't bright enough for outdoor use on anything but the most overcast days. Looking at the display head-on with the brightness maxed washes out colors too. Lighter hues become almost indistinguishable from white and black colors all shift to a dark grey tone. It's very difficult to find a balance between the two problems. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All of that, if coming over from a higher-resolution display panel with great contrast and readability, makes for an unenjoyable experience. The fact that the problem seems to go away somewhat at a distance greater than a few feet only makes matters worse. </p>
<p> At just under $250, it's enough to drop this gadget from a four-and-a-half star rating to just over a 3-star rating, almost all on its own. </p>
<p> The performance here was surprisingly good, all things considered </p>
<p> Since the screen isn't great and the build is decidedly budget-minded, one of the few remaining questions is just how this Chrome OS clamshell performs. And, surprisingly enough, the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 was able to accomplish every task I threw its way under review. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It goes without saying that how well it holds to that is going to be something that varies from user to user though. </p>
<p> For my test, as noted in the battery segment here, I primarily used this device for some in-depth research and typing. Light photo editing using Android apps and a web service was also on my agenda. I didn't spend a lot of time playing games because, as might be expected, many of those rely on a touch screen via Android. So many apps simply aren't going to work as a way to test performance. </p>
<p> And Google Stadia isn't much of a way to test things on performance either since all the processing is handled off-site. So I primarily tested with apps. And button controls for those experiences fall well short of even a moderately enjoyable outing. That's thanks to the fact that they're designed to work with Android phones. So a touch screen are all but required for a good experience. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Having said that, while photo processing was notably slower here, by around a second or two per photo it was doable. Typing up some documents and keeping dozens of tabs open and active weren't problem points either. And, thanks to Chrome OS, those types of tasks shouldn't ever become a problem over the life of this Chromebook. </p>
<p> It's not until deeper tasks are attempted that users are going to notice any discrepancy between more pricey gadgets and this one. For example, if users plan to do any kind of development at all, not even Chrome OS will be able to salvage the Intel Celeron N4020 chipset used here. That's a 2-core, 2-thread chip with a standard clock of just 1.1GHz after all. And 32GB of eMMC storage coupled with just 4GB of LPDDR4-2400 RAM isn't going to make things much better. </p>
<p> What all of that extra spec did do, is to ensure that day to day user needs can be met. And this device will easily meet them on that front, so long as users aren't depending on this Chromebook being powerful, flashy, or more than it feasibly can be. Impressively enough, this Chromebook feels like a workhorse for the activities it does do well, albeit not a very powerful one. </p>
<p> The Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 battery isn't great, even if charging is </p>
<p> Typically, when I review the battery in a Chrome OS gadget such as the IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14, I put the battery through its paces by first writing up articles. And by doing other tasks associated with that work. That includes photo editing, some fairly intensive research with dozens of tabs being open and active, and more. Video streaming and other streaming do sometimes factor in as well. But generally, I follow that up with some more entertainment-related tasks. </p>
<p> While hardly scientific, the idea, of course, is to see how the gadget fares with mixed usage. With that said, mixed usage would require a bit more than I was able to accomplish with this device. And that simply didn't happen here because the battery simply didn't last its advertised 10-hours. Instead, under a moderate load, this device lasted just 6-hours and 31-minutes. </p>
<p> As noted in the display segment, that's not because the brightness was turned all the way up either. That would have only made the display approach unusable. So I kept the screen at between 65- to 75-percent of its max brightness. I kept the volume at half of its maximum and I didn't listen to much audio during the battery test either. So it would be difficult to lay the blame for the discrepancy there. </p>
<p> Now, battery life is subjective and just over 6.5-hours may seem reasonable. But this was still 3.5-hours short of the advertised maximum without ever really pushing the underlying hardware. </p>
<p> Lenovo very nearly makes up for that on the charging side of the equation. The 45W USB-C charger fills this battery to full in under one-and-a-half hours. Or more precisely in just a few moments more than 1-hour and 20-minutes. That's quick for any Chromebook and comes close to making up for the shorter-than-expected battery life. But isn't quite quick enough to round out the experience. </p>
<p> Audio is going to be great for video chats and conferencing but not for anything else </p>
<p> Those who may have hoped that this Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 review would take a turn for the better on audio are going to be disappointed. The sole saving grace for this laptop's audio experience is the 3.5mm audio jack. </p>
<p> Now, the single mic performs well enough in a video chat or VoIP call. So that's not an issue here. That also means that, at least in dialogue-heavy content streaming, this should work for video media or podcasts. But the speakers are not only not punchy, they're downright tinny. And that's unfortunate because it is entirely possible for a dual 2-watt speaker array to sound much better than they do here. </p>
<p> In fact, the level of that audio caveat is such that it nearly sounds distorted. Worse still, and taking down the star-rating that I'm comfortable giving this Chromebook further, that starts at a fairly low volume. And that only gets much, much worse at higher volumes. </p>
<p> As noted above, the audio jack does completely resolve the issue. And that means users can get an experience that's beyond acceptable by plugging in headphones or linking up via Bluetooth. The audio experience doesn't have to be terrible. But that also seems to indicate this is as much an issue relating to choice of hardware as software. So users shouldn't expect the experience to improve in the future either. And this device will very obviously not be the choice pick for those who need good sound quality out-of-the-box. </p>
<p> Chrome OS software is as solid as ever with the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 </p>
<p> It doesn't really do to talk about a Chromebook without reminding users of what they'll be getting on the software side. Especially for those who are likely to buy this particular Chromebook. Lenovo's IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 would, with all things considered and with this review to back up the assertion, serve as a decent starter device for anybody getting started with Chrome OS. </p>
<p> To begin with, users should also be aware that this Chromebook goes a step further than most in its bracket. It includes a Google-built security chip H1. That means that things are already going to be more secure than many competitors right out of the box. Lenovo stacked that atop Chrome OS' verified boot, which does a full system check on every startup. And, obviously, Chrome OS is a sandboxed experience. Tabs and apps run in their own partitions, set well apart from others. </p>
<p> With that and Google's walled garden approach, Chrome OS devices are some of the most secure around. The H1 chip ensures on-device data is further encrypted. </p>
<p> Looking past security, this Chromebook comes will full support for Android apps, Linux, and even some Windows-specific software such as Microsoft's office suite. For those who don't want to use Google's G Suite, that's going to be a definite plus. Although most Chromebooks also support the apps. Google also engineered Chromebooks to be multi-user friendly. That means it's easy enough to simply log somebody else in and each user will be given their own space to improve privacy and security. </p>
<p> Google Assistant is built-in as well. That puts AI help right at users' fingertips. Now, that's not necessarily available offline. But with a bit of practice and a quick run-through with Google's tutorials, launched right at the start, working offline is easy too. </p>
<p> Connectivity with the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 </p>
<p> Now, Lenovo didn't include bleeding-edge connection options with this device. The hardware used in the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 wasn't bad during the review, but this remains a budget-friendly gadget. As noted elsewhere in this review, the company started with ports. And it offers an array of those to suit just about any needs. </p>
<p> It packed the frame with two USB-A standard ports, one on both the left- and right-hand edge. It also packed the frame with a USB-C port on each edge. On the right-hand edge, meanwhile, there's also a MicroSD slot and 3.5mm audio jack. The right-hand edge contains a lock slot for those who need one. </p>
<p> Under the hood, connections are afforded via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. But neither of those is next-gen or cutting-edge. Instead, Bluetooth 4.2 is used. Lenovo also built this around the more readily available Wi-Fi 5. That's nothing to write home about. But each is a well-developed technology that's well tested by time. </p>
<p> Neither requires new external hardware to take full advantage of either. That means users won't need to go out and buy the latest Wi-Fi 6 router to have a good experience getting online. Or the latest Bluetooth headphones or accessories to have a worthwhile experience. </p>
<p> Lenovo can do better but this is a decent device for the price </p>
<p> Overall, the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Chromebook 14 holds up well under review. It performs better than a similarly specced Windows machine would, offering users a smooth experience for web chatting, browsing, and even for accomplishing basic photo editing. Browsing, of course, isn't an issue either. </p>
<p> Lenovo did a great job in terms of the keyboard and touchpad experience as well. And there's a lot to love about a sleek, modern, minimalist approach to design. Especially into a comparatively lightweight package. And with build quality taking priority over materials in order to offer a premium-feeling experience on a budget. </p>
<p> But there are also several issues here. To begin with, battery life is acceptable, and charging time is spectacular, relatively speaking. But it doesn't stack up to Lenovo's advertised figures. In fact, I couldn't get through a full workday — although most students and others may easily do so at over 6-hours of moderate use per charge. Secondary to that, this isn't a touchscreen either. So although the keyboard is great for typing, there's no way to use a good number of available Android apps. </p>
<p> More to the point, most of those apps are usable but the experience is terrible without a touch screen. And then there's the screen itself. </p>
<p> While Lenovo's goal was obviously to ensure the price fell below $250 and the experience was still great, it didn't succeed on every front. The display it chose is awful. Lenovo made that plenty bright for indoor use but colors get washed out at the brightest settings. But the display also fails miserably to impress at any viewing angle other than looking at the display directly from the front. </p>
<p> It's almost unusable, at least without distraction, or becoming incredibly annoying. This won't be a great device for sharing the viewing experience with others. That's with the notable exception of viewing from greater than 3-feet, where the viewing angle problem seems to diminish significantly. </p>
<p> So this is not a device for those who need a great display panel. Or for those who need to get coding, audio or video editing, or other heavy tasks done. If a great audio experience is paramount, this absolutely isn't the device to turn to. </p>
<p> Where it does fit is as a budget-first or entry-level device thanks to great performance for what's packed in and a great typing experience. For those who find those caveats to be acceptable or who need a more secure experience than is often on offer at the budget end for Chromebooks, it's going to be a great ultra-portable laptop. </p>

<p> Google News / Google Chrome / Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 Review – The Best Chromebook You Can Buy Under $500 </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 Review – The Best Chromebook You Can Buy Under $500 </p>
<p> The Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 delivers long life, performance, and a design that makes it the best available Chromebook for the money, bar none. </p>
<p> Underwhelming audio lacks bass punch, comes across as tinny </p>
<p> Display could be slightly brighter </p>
<p> When Lenovo launched its Chromebook Flex 5 at CES 2020 and then sent the device for review, I fully expected the device to deliver on most fronts. But at under $425, I also expected a huge variety of drawbacks and caveats. That would account for the price, forcing some buyers to look elsewhere but equating to a fairly enjoyable experience for others. </p>
<p> Now, that wasn't entirely off the mark but, on closer examination, this device rises well above those expectations in most respects. </p>
<p> To begin with, Lenovo built this Chromebook with high-quality materials for a premium feel during use. It also focused efforts on usability in terms of internal specs and its 2-in-1 13-inch design. The gadget is lightweight enough to effectively take advantage of the folding design and tablet mode. But it's sturdy enough to not be uncomfortable taking outside. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company also packed in top-tier Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, plenty of ports, and a backlit, spill-resistant keyboard. The latter piece of hardware is comfortable to use as well. </p>
<p> Put simply, this device surprised me with how very little there was not to love. In fact, that would have remained the case even if this gadget cost closer to $600. Taken as one cohesive device, the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 is arguably the best device around for the money. </p>
<p> So let's take a closer look at where it falls just short and where it stands apart. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are only a couple of noteworthy complaints about the overall hardware </p>
<p> Among the first things that need to be said about the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5, although it made very little difference to me during my review, is that the bottom segment is plastic. The keyboard, lower frame, and touchpad are all comprised of a sturdy but less glamorous PC/ABC material than the all-aluminum lid. </p>
<p> That makes the device more heat resistant and helps with the spill-resistant features of the keyboard. It also doesn't really take away much, given its solid construction and smooth but not "too smooth" texture, from the premium feel of this laptop. </p>
<p> That doesn't mean it's not going to be a caveat for some. The plastic is certainly more flexible than the lid of this device and there is a difference in how it feels in-hand. More importantly, the material is going to be more susceptible to dings and scratches than aluminum would have been. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo mounted that to the display by sturdy aluminum. The hinge is a 2-in-1 design, allowing for laptop, tent, stand, and tablet modes. While there's some flex in the keyboard and lid, there's absolutely no jostling in the hinge. And that hinge seems to hold well in any position, allowing easier use. Especially with the consideration that this one supports stylus input via a separately sold Lenovo digital pen. </p>
<p> So, on the whole, it's a very well designed laptop. And it feels premium to use. And its Graphite Grey coloration ensures that there's not too much discrepancy in color between the lid and keyboard frame. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 is thinner than most Chromebook devices on the market as well, adding to that. It isn't the thinnest by any stretch. But thanks to cleverly designed beveled edges, it certainly feels thinner than it is. At under 3lbs, it measures 12.2 x 8.34-inches and just 0.7-inches thin. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The keyboard itself is backlit, complete with software features to help dim or brighten that. It's also exceedingly comfortable to type on. The keys are a solid material but are soft on the press-through all the way up to the satisfying click. The click-through happens at 1.4mm, which is the key-travel here, and it isn't the quietest I've used. But is quiet enough to not be distracting or annoying. The click-through on the Mylar-coated touchpad is satisfying too. </p>
<p> For privacy- and security-focused users, Lenovo affixed a Kensington Lock slot into the edge. And it packed a physical privacy cover under the lid glass in the above-screen HD 720p webcam too. And it equipped that with a physical privacy cover. That cover moves via a toggle slider just above the camera. And it slips smoothly in and out of place noiselessly, to physically block the camera from seeing anything. </p>
<p> Similarly, there doesn't appear to be any wiggle in the two USB-C ports, single USB-A port, or MicroSD slot. Those worked as well as would be expected, as does the 3.5mm audio jack. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One final caveat to the design here is that the physical buttons are mounted in such a way that they barely protrude at all. And they're squishier than would be expected, given the rest of the build here. The buttons still push through with a slight click. But Lenovo mounted them almost flush with the frame on the Chromebook Flex 5 and, throughout my review, they felt as though they were going to get stuck in the frame itself. </p>
<p> The display here is one of the few aspects that simply felt underwhelming </p>
<p> Lenovo built its Chromebook Flex 5 around a 13.3-inch glossy display panel packed between thinner-than-average bezels. And it enhanced that with built-in support for an optional pen stylus as well as up to 10-point multi-touch support. The display is arguably one of the few components of the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 that felt underwhelming during my review of the gadget though. </p>
<p> And that chiefly comes down to its brightness and its resolution. The resolution makes various UI elements, such as the dock and websites seem smaller than I'd have liked to have seen, for starters. That may or may not be a subjective opinion coming over from a 2K panel on my daily driver Chromebook. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The 1,920 by 1,080 resolution display isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. But it made a difference when it came to day-to-day use for me. And Lenovo likely compounded that with this laptop's 16:9 ratio, which simply isn't the best for web content. </p>
<p> Summarily, users more accustomed to a more high-res panel likely aren't going to appreciate the 1,080p used here. And neither will those who are more accustomed to a slightly taller ratio for work or web tasks. </p>
<p> For under $425, this panel performs well, though. Pixelation is not an issue and clarity is high enough to make up for the issue noted above under almost all circumstances. Media consumption is better too since the 16:9 ratio is still fairly ubiquitous when it comes to video or app content. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One caveat that can't be overlooked though is brightness. While the panel is more than bright enough to utilize indoors or under overcast skies, it isn't great for full daylight. So portability and use on-the-go, while the hardware allows for that, aren't quite as good as they might otherwise be. At just 250 nits, the glossy coating on the display quickly becomes reflective and almost but not quite unusable under direct sunlight. </p>
<p> Under just about any other conditions, that isn't a problem though. So this Chromebook should only really be avoided on that front if use under direct sunlight is going to be a common occurrence. </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 gets the work done and it doesn't struggle to do it </p>
<p> The Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 comes in two distinct variations, with up to an Intel Core i5 chipset. But the company sent the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 sporting an Intel Core i3-10110U for review. Up to 8GB RAM and 128GB storage are available too. But this unit shipped with 4GG DDR4-2666 for memory and 64GB of eMMC 5.1 storage. And, despite having been effectively an entry model, it genuinely excelled on the performance front. </p>
<p> As noted in the battery segment just below, I mostly tapped into the hardware for work-related tasks and Android gaming. On both fronts, even with multiple tabs open, including more than 24 permanently-open tabs, there was never any single instance of lag or latency. Instead, this Chromebook simply handled whatever tasks I threw at it. </p>
<p> That remained the case even when several games were left running in the background while I completed a work-related photo editing task and listened to a podcast on YouTube with all of those tabs still open and periodically being refreshed. </p>
<p> The fact that this device never broke a sweat or slowed down is a testament to the efficiency of the processor in use here but also to the OS itself. We'll cover that momentarily but this Chromebook should easily handle just about any other task well too, as long as a Chromebook can undertake that task. Whether that's light video- or sound-editing, heavier web-based programs, Linux apps, or coding tasks. This Chromebook should be able to manage. </p>
<p> Art-related tasks such as drawing and productivity-focused tasks such as note-taking did nothing to bring the performance down either. </p>
<p> Now, there are undoubtedly some instances with larger projects on any of those fronts that will slow things down. It goes without saying that there are perks to having an Intel Core i5 or i7, even with a Chromebook. </p>
<p> Having more than 4GB of RAM is an obvious advantage too, with regard to multitasking. But this Chromebook offers more than enough for day-to-day users and most who want to get more serious work done. And there's an i5 variant available for a bit more money for those who just want to be sure it will cover their needs. </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 offers you one of the very best battery experiences </p>
<p> As always, battery life is a highly subjective aspect of any device. Depending on how heavy the processes are that a user relies on, as well as screen brightness, volume, keyboard backlighting, and other factors, the experience is going to vary. As such, my battery test during this review of the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 won't necessarily provide a clear picture of how long it will last for anybody else. </p>
<p> For my test of this Chromebook's battery, I kept the brightness of the screen and volume turned up to around 65-percent. On the screen side, that was bright enough for outdoor use on an overcast day. The volume was loud enough to easily hear in a moderately busy environment. In this case, that was a moderately sized home with children running around, playing, watching TV, and using their phones and tablets. </p>
<p> I split this test into five categories — four for actual use and a fifth for charging. Those were work, standby, and entertainment in terms of 'gaming' and media streaming. On a single charge, the bulk of my time was spent on work-related tasks. That typically includes a bit of photo editing, loading dozens of websites per hour for research purposes, listening to music, and word processing tasks. For the purposes of this test, I worked for approximately 4-hours and 26-minutes on a single charge. </p>
<p> Gaming, conversely, was split into two groupings but the bulk of my gaming — this is a Chromebook after all — was via Android apps. I also played Google Stadia for a period but that likely isn't going to impact the battery quite as much as an Android game will. I spent an hour and 24-minutes in games. Video streaming fell in at around an hour and 16-minutes. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5, for my battery test, was on standby for approximately 2-hours and 25-minutes. With only around an hour of that time dedicated solely to screen-off time. </p>
<p> In total, that equates to around 8-hours and 31-minutes of use on a single charge, with another full hour on top from a period of screen-off time. That figure does fall over an hour short of the advertised battery life. But it comes close enough to fall within an acceptable range. </p>
<p> In terms of charging, this Chromebook seemed to do quite well too. In fact, it charged to full in under 2-hours, at just an hour and fifty minutes. That is far better than most Chromebooks I've had the opportunity to test out, in many cases by more than an hour. </p>
<p> So, on top of offering a better-than-average battery life, this device also charges up more quickly. And the obvious end result of that is that users will see less downtime — without the hassle of having to run the device while it's plugged in. </p>
<p> Audio on the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 is, in a word, unimpressive </p>
<p> The final caveat worth noting for the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 is its speakers, which failed to impress on several levels under review. Now, for movies, classical music, and some other media, they perform just fine. </p>
<p> Lenovo chose to include two speakers, each at 2-watts, in the frame bordering the keyboard. It left very little room there, allowing for a more comfortable, larger keyboard. But the speakers both lack bass punch utterly and are poorly positioned for a 2-in-1. </p>
<p> On the first front, the speakers are going to be more than acceptable for some music and video watching. When it comes to voice chatting or those areas they did perform well, they're clear and balanced. But they lack any and all bass punch. In fact, some of the more complex songs I tested for this review revealed no bass sound at all. The tones are still present in songs that focus chiefly on lower registers, of course. But they lack any power and come across as tinny. And that's going to be a problem if that's a primary use of this computer. </p>
<p> As to their positioning, that works well in either tent or clamshell mode. That's because, in those configurations, Lenovo positions them in a way that either directly or acoustically, they point the sound directly at the user. But when the device is placed in tablet mode, the problems with tone representation becomes worse. The audio is, in effect, pushed directly away from the user. That's made worse when placed on a surface in stand or tablet mode because then it's muffled by whatever surface it's placed on. </p>
<p> Audio from the 3.5mm audio jack is far superior but there isn't any specialty hardware included on that front either. So it simply isn't going to be the best experience from a Chromebook, let alone a great one. Not even in this gadget's price bracket. </p>
<p> Audio input, tested via a variety of software applications, is great. The dual-array mics pick up sound well. So this will, overall, be a great device for voice or video chatting. Or, conversely, for using Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Chrome OS shines through in all of its glory here </p>
<p> It goes without saying that the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 includes Chrome OS out of the box. And, as would be expected from an almost walled-garden OS approach, that performed under review for the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 just about identically to any other Chromebook. </p>
<p> Here, the biggest advantage is that an Enterprise, ready Google Security H1 Chip is included in the build. That requires no extra input or interaction from users to work. But it encrypts and protects on-device data just as it would on any business-specific device. </p>
<p> For those who have never used a Chromebook before, Chrome OS is one of the most intuitive operating systems around. Not only does it keep itself up-to-date automatically. Users can sign into any Chromebook and carry their Google Drive files, their apps and software, and system settings with them. I work almost exclusively from Chromebooks, for instance. So conducting this review didn't require a lot of set up time. Just a few minutes of logging in and downloads and this device was ready to use to write things up and perform associated tasks. </p>
<p> That also means that security is at the forefront outside of the chip noted above. System security checkups happen every time the system is booted up. Updates take just a few minutes or down to just a few moments to install. </p>
<p> On the productivity and entertainment fronts. Chromebooks like the Chromebook Flex 5 from Lenovo are compatible with Android apps. The Google Play Store is pre-installed. Linux apps can be downloaded and used with the flip of a toggle in settings. Google Assistant provides all the AI help a user could ask for. All of that means that this device is fully compatible with a plethora of apps such as Microsoft Office, Google Docs, games, and more. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the file system is fully integrated with Google Drive. And adding other cloud storage is fairly straightforward. So a large amount of storage isn't necessarily needed, although there's plenty with this particular Chromebook for those who do want that. </p>
<p> For multi-user use, Chrome OS allows that via a simple click on the sign-in screen and then a straightforward login with a Google account. </p>
<p> Of course, all of that is setting aside a wide assortment of other features. But, summarily, users can expect all of what makes Chromebooks great to perform as expected and without hitch from the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5. </p>
<p> Lenovo includes plenty of ports and plugs, but also the latest in connectivity </p>
<p> For ports and connectivity, Lenovo packed its Chromebook Flex 5 with all of the ports listed above. The company worked to ensure the USB-C ports output display content at UHD resolutions. And those work as expected. But what about other connections? </p>
<p> Well, Lenovo isn't skimping here at all. In fact, while the technology is still young and won't be supported for many users just yet, it even included support for Wi-Fi 6 via an Intel solution. I wasn't able to test that particular technology. But, if it performs as the older protocols do, then that's going to be blistering fast for users who need higher speeds and have compatible hardware. The hardware also supports Wi-Fi 5 and older protocols too. </p>
<p> Bleeding-edge technology effectively ends there since Lenovo opted not to include Bluetooth 5.1. But it did package this with Bluetooth 5.0 and, as expected, that offers a great connective option for both audio and accessories. On audio, Bluetooth 5.0 is nearly lossless. The Chromebook offers more stability and greater range for other accessories, such as a mouse or keyboard. So I was able to easily hook this Chromebook up to an external display and interface at a distance using Bluetooth connectivity. </p>
<p> Of course, because this is Chrome OS, casting out serves as another connectivity option, and that works well. Although that didn't work as well as might be hoped. Blame for that, however, can be placed chiefly on Chrome OS and not on the hardware. </p>
<p> If you're in the market for a mid-range Chromebook, Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 is the one </p>
<p> Now, some of the caveats noted here are to be expected. Lenovo seems to have made a decision to include a PC-material in the lower frame, for instance, chiefly for the purposes of ensuring a lightweight build. But also to ensure spill resistance and keep costs down. A full-aluminum body also isn't necessarily expected at below the $500 or $600 mark. This Chromebook falls well below that price point. </p>
<p> Problems with a 16:9 ratio, 1080p display panel are a good example here. Those are only really going to be caveats for those who are accustomed to a higher-resolution panel. But, at 13-inches, it won't be a big issue even then. Moreover, and more importantly, it's a high enough resolution to offer an HD experience without raising the cost. </p>
<p> Problems with audio are almost ubiquitous across all laptops. So that's not necessarily a "problem" here either. </p>
<p> Where this Chromebook does perform is exactly where it needs to. Under review, the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 is versatile. It performs a wide range of tasks without struggling and there's undoubtedly a lot more to be had. I never managed to push this device to its limits with my day to day use. So, for the overwhelming majority of users, this Chromebook can easily serve as a primary device. </p>
<p> Under the hood, the inclusion of a higher-quality security chip solution and automatic updates solidify that fact. As does the included privacy shutter for the webcam and latest-gen connection options. </p>
<p> On battery life, this is arguably going to be among the very best available gadgets for the price. Or for a much higher cost. 8.5-hours of use on a single charge is, summarily, ludicrous. Especially since I typically see closer to six from a Chromebook. </p>
<p> The build quality, despite the above-mentioned plastics, is top-notch too. This Lenovo laptop is comfortable to use and feels like a much higher-cost laptop. It looks good and is going to withstand quite a lot of abuse. At just shy of $410, it would be completely irresponsible not to recommend the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 for anybody in the market for solid work and play Chromebook for either individual or family use. </p>

<p> Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook Pre-Order Is Now Live At Best Buy </p>
<p> The world's first budget detachable Chromebook, the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook, is now available for pre-order following a brief hiatus in orders. Spotted at Best Buy by Chrome Unboxed, this is actually the second time the device has been put up for presale. It was first put up by the retailer earlier in the week before being marked as 'coming soon'. </p>
<p> The gadget, which features a detachable folio-style keyboard on a 10.1-inch display platform, was originally set to ship by May 11. Now, Best Buy lists the gadget as becoming available as of May 6. Other retailers such as Amazon still have the device listed as 'unavailable'. The detachable laptop comes in at just $299.99. </p>
<p> What is the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook? </p>
<p> Now, being the most affordable detachable, as its IdeaPad branding implies, doesn't mean this device is a slouch. Lenovo first introduced the IdeaPad Duet Chromebook at CES 2020 and packed it with respectable hardware. The tablet-sized Chromebook ships in a dual-tone aluminum build in a silvery-blue and gray finish. Substantial bezels surround the 10.1-inch display, likely to give users a place to grip the gadget when in tablet mode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At the front, Lenovo included a 2-megapixel fixed-focus camera alongside an LED indicator. That's so that users can see when this detachable's 10-hour-rated 7180mAh battery is full or dying. Charging takes place via a single Type-C port. An 8-megapixel auto-focus camera resides at the back for world-facing shots. </p>
<p> That camera hardware isn't best-in-class but it is serviceable. And Lenovo incorporated a dual-array mic and dual speakers to make the experience even better. </p>
<p> The keyboard, meanwhile, has some pretty good specs too. To begin with, it's stand allows for a 0- to 135-degree free stop. Meaning it can be placed at any angle between those. 18mm key pitch and just 1.3mm key travel should allow for a comfortable typing experience. As should this gadget's weight, at just under 1lb. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Under the hood, a MediaTek-built Helio P60T chipset takes the lead. That's an octa-core SoC backed by ARM G72 for graphics and 4GB LPDDR4x RAM. Storage is ample compared to other devices in the price range too at 128GB. </p>
<p> Rounding out the perks, Lenovo has also said its IdeaPad Duet Chromebook will receive 8-years of update support. That's as compared to the 6-years Chromebooks typically see from their launch. </p>
<p> When will your pre-order arrive? </p>
<p> Best Buy's pre-order for the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook doesn't seem to indicate users will be waiting long. Reservations are expected to ship, the site says, by May 20. So, buyers should see their devices arrive within just a couple of weeks. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Conversely, this is the second time Best Buy has listed the device too, as noted above. In fact, the retailer first listed the device this week. And it's not immediately apparent why that is. </p>
<p> The company may simply have listed too early or it may have run out of stock. In the latter case, that could mean that some consumers will still see their devices arrive by May 11. Or it may not arrive until the later date if the initial listing was a site-specific error. errors. </p>

<p> Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook Detachable Is Now Available To Buy </p>
<p> After weeks of pre-order news hinting at its arrival, Lenovo's IdeaPad Duet Chromebook is now finally available to buy. The 10.1-inch detachable laptop was first announced at CES in January and is set to fill a gap in the market for Chrome OS devices. That's because Lenovo isn't this as a Chrome OS tablet. Instead, it's detachable with a case-based kickstand supporting its marketing as a laptop. </p>
<p> That free stop stand can be adjusted from 0- to 135-degrees and the keyboard is also intended to be comfortable, despite its diminutive size. That features a key pitch of 18mm with 1.3mm of key travel. With the case attached, the entire package weighs under a single pound. </p>
<p> The multi-fabric keyboard case, of course, ships with the device. So this is not, although it can be used that way, a tablet device. Instead, it's meant to be an ultra-portable laptop in the same vein as netbooks. But it's also meant to be a productivity powerhouse, with Chrome OS optimizations geared in that direction. That's without losing its multi-purpose entertainment capabilities. The keyboard itself attaches via pogo-pins. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Beyond the keyboard, Lenovo's latest Chromebook is an all-aluminum build. That can be pulled away from the keyboard for use in clamshell, tent, tablet, or stand modes. </p>
<p> Residing between the mid-range and budget markets </p>
<p> The concept behind the design of the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook was that a productivity-ready device can be budget-friendly. For that reason, the company primarily focused on display quality, performance, and universal appeal. </p>
<p> On the latter front, for instance, this device adheres to the Universal Stylus Initiative standards. So any pressure-sensitive stylus that is also compatible with those standards will work on this device. Lenovo does plan to launch one of its own at some point for this gadget. But it isn't ready to divulge the details of that just yet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Under the hood, tucked behind the reduced-bezel 1920 x 1200 resolution, 16:10 aspect ratio display panel, Lenovo is relying on MediaTek for processing. Specifically, that's an octa-core MediaTek-built Helio P60T chipset. That's backed by ARM G72 for graphics and 4GB LPDDR4x RAM. </p>
<p> Packed into the dual-tone Ice Blue and Iron Gray frame, Lenovo also includes dual speakers and a 2-megapixel fixed-focus front-facing camera with an LED indicator. The back houses an 8-megapixel autofocus camera. That's all paired with reasonably powerful speakers and dual microphones. The latter component will help keep video calls clear while also enabling better interaction with Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Looking past the claimed 10-hour battery life — despite this device's size — Lenovo's sole trade-off here seems to be in terms of ports. Only one USB-C port is included and that's used for both charging and audio output. The company includes a USB Type-C to 3.5mm audio jack adapter. But there's no 3.5mm headphone jack here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pricing and availability </p>
<p> Now, there are two price points for the IdeaPad Duet Chromebook from Lenovo. The primary difference, of course, is storage. The first of the two devices start out around $279. That nets buyers 64GB storage. A $20 bump in price doubles that to 128GB of storage. That puts the price at $299. In every other regard, the two Chromebooks are identical. </p>
<p> In terms of availability, this launch is expressly for the North America region. The device is being made available at Walmart, Lenovo's online store, and at Best Buy. It's already available at the latter two. Walmart will carry it "soon." </p>

<p> Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 3 Chromebook Review – For Battery Life On A Budget, This Is It </p>
<p> Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook offers a generally great experience and performance in a capable package that's only slightly flawed, with genuinely brilliant battery life. </p>
<p> $339 </p>
<p> Rating </p>
<p> Pros </p>
<p> Lenovo recently sent out its Flex 3 Chromebook, also marketed as the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 3 Chromebook, for review. And, put bluntly, it was so close to achieving a 5-star rating but just couldn't make the cut. That's not to be mistaken for a total dismissal of this laptop though. There are a lot of things this Chromebook gets right. And it does so in a way that makes it easy to recommend. </p>
<p> Not only does this device offer plenty of power and portability with a full-size keyboard. It delivers on audio in a way that few, even very expensive, Chromebooks do. And it manages to stay running all day long without ever slowing down. The design language is on-point. </p>
<p> Some component choices here are, of course, and without question, questionable. Lenovo truly could have picked a better display panel. And it easily could have opted to build the entire gadget from metal. The build-quality, rolling off the line, could stand to be a bit tighter. A bit more well-put-together. </p>

<p> None of that really drags this laptop down too much. So let's take a deeper look at how the Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook performed under review. There is quite a bit of value to discover and plenty to talk about where it does fall short. It's unlikely to disappoint at any rate, as tested at just $339. </p>
<p> Hardware is a mixed bag for this Chromebook </p>
<p> On the hardware front, Lenovo opted for a half-polycarbonate, half-metal build. That means that there's a rigid, scratch-resistant surface to protect the display panel. But also that there's a lighter, still comfortable build for the lower half of this gadget. Of course, that also means that users who want something a bit higher-end without spending too much money. </p>
<p> With that said, the build isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination. The metal hinges are solidly built and didn't creak or groan under strain during my review of the Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook. The ports are all snug-fitting and snap into place with a satisfying click. The trackpad, while plastic, feels responsive and works just about perfectly. But the keyboard is a weak point. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Not only did the overly-raised keys take some getting used too. Especially coming from a high-end keyboard with only about half the height. The key travel felt like a bit too much. That meant more strain on my fingers over the course of hours upon hours of use. It was very comfortable to use during short, two-to-three-hour bursts. But anything over that, with no real breaks between, became tedious. </p>
<p> Conversely, the design also isn't quite as high-quality when it comes to gaps and flexibility. I noticed that there's a significant gap between the lid and the keyboard frame. That's wider toward the center, viewed from the left-hand or right-hand edge. Additionally, there is what feels like an unnecessary gap at the front in tablet mode. </p>
<p> Now, that latter gap helps keep the audio quality up when in tablet mode too. But it doesn't look particularly appealing. And that's a shame since the rest of the design is stunning, for a gadget in this price range. Particularly in the golden sheen of the almond coloration that this Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook was shipping out in for review. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Otherwise, the design is angular and modern, offering a better aesthetic than might be seen in many other devices at this price. And that helped make this a more enjoyable device to use than it might have otherwise been. </p>
<p> This display is usable & also the biggest caveat for Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook </p>
<p> Now, the Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook display, rated at an HD resolution of 1,366 x 768 pixels and at 11.6-inches, is undeniably this laptop's weak point. It's by far the biggest weak point, in fact. Under indoor conditions, it is crisp and clear despite its resolution. And it's more than bright enough. That remains the case all the way up until this Chromebook is placed under direct sunlight. </p>
<p> When I brought the Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook out into the sun during my review, it was immediately clear it wouldn't be bright enough. It's only just bright enough to use in the shade. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There also isn't much difference between most of the brightness settings. So there's not a whole lot that users are going to be able to do to adapt it for better viewing indoors or out. Making matters somewhat worse is the bezel. That's enormous at well over an inch on each edge. While that makes for easier carrying, particularly in tablet mode, and a bigger keyboard spread, it also makes this device unnecessarily heavier. </p>
<p> The Flex 3 Chromebook weighs in at 2.64lbs. </p>
<p> But that's not the only reason this screen isn't great, either. It also suffers from significant light bleed around all of the edges. That's not nearly as noticeable during day-to-day use. Mostly, it becomes obvious when the edges are displaying a darker color, anything from a dark gray to black. But it's there and it's not a small strip of light bleed either. It flows out into the display area by an inch or two, in fact. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Where this screen does lack, it makes up for that in terms of responsiveness. I never noticed a single instance of latency in touch controls. The only thing Lenovo could potentially have done better on that front is to include stylus support of some kind. Although it's not immediately clear whether or not the processor could have handled that. </p>
<p> The battery life will easily be the best feature for this Chromebook </p>
<p> Performance, as we'll discuss momentarily, is great for Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook. The display is acceptable. Its build is solid. There's a lot to love about this Chromebook. But the best thing about the Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook, revealed throughout my review period, is its battery prowess. </p>
<p> Not only does this Chromebook take just over an hour to charge at 1-hour and 17-minutes. That's around half the time of some competitors and far less compared to others. No, Lenovo also engineered this device to last all day long. With constant use, at the highest screen brightness to maximize drain, this Chromebook lasted for no less than 9-hours, 35-minutes, and 23-seconds. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, battery life is extremely subjective. But, for my test, I used this gadget entirely for work. Of course, that involves word processing in both the backend of a website but also in Google Docs. It also involved dozens of websites being opened at all times. And around half a dozen sites always working. </p>
<p> Additionally, at various points, it involved around an hour-and-a-half of photo editing in Android apps and web apps. For approximately an hour of that period, I was also streaming music. And for around another hour, I was also streaming video. Despite that, it took just over 6-hours to hit 50-percent drained. </p>
<p> All of that is despite working straight through. So, although battery life is subjective, there's a good chance it's going to last quite a lot longer for most users than it did for me. And it was already exceptional. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Performance is right where I'd expect with Chrome OS </p>
<p> As noted in the battery segment, the bulk of my review of the Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook was spent writing. That involves quite a bit more than just typing into a web field, though. It also involves saving and interacting with multiple backups — thanks, WordPress — as well as photo editing. Video streaming, mobile gaming, streamed gaming, music, and other fairly intensive tasks fall under that purview too. </p>
<p> All of that, it goes almost without saying, is undertaken in the context of multitasking too. With dozens of Chrome tabs opened at once and multiple of those working in the background alongside Android apps and other things. It's not necessarily a light load for any computer. </p>
<p> Fortunately, in part due to Chrome OS's nearly over-optimized ecosystem and potentially due to lower screen specs, that's all possible without a single hitch. Even running all of those Chrome tabs doesn't tend to overwhelm a Chromebook as it will in Windows or Mac. </p>
<p> That may or may not come as a shock. Particularly for those who haven't used a Chromebook before. And especially since this Chromebook, priced under $350, is only driven by an Intel Celeron N4020 processor. That's two cores, two threads, at 1.1GHz with a max boost of 2.8GHz. </p>
<p> Behind that, Lenovo includes a UHD-capable Intel Graphics 600 chip. So UHD output is definitely possible. But, more importantly, there's only 4GB of LPDDR4-2400 RAM. And just 64GB of storage. Neither relatively paltry spec managed to become a problem during my review of the Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook, in the least. </p>
<p> Some of the processing, for instance on photo editing, was somewhat slower. The same holds for opening apps, which takes a little longer. But there's no real hang-ups to speak of. It definitely isn't the processor that holds this Chromebook back from either and Editor's Choice award or a 5-star rating. </p>
<p> Connections are the basis for all Chromebooks and Lenovo Flex 3 holds to that </p>
<p> On the connectivity front, the Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook proved more than capable under review. It doesn't, of course, come with the latest connection hardware. For instance, only Bluetooth 4.2 and Wi-Fi 802.11 ac are built-in here. And there's no mobile connectivity either. But the slow-moving nature of connectivity on those fronts means that isn't really too big a deal. Unless those are a necessity. </p>
<p> In fact, I was able to easily pair up a Stadia controller and game for hours without any connection drops or issues. And Bluetooth headphones made that experience all that much better. </p>
<p> For those who need more wired connections, Lenovo also didn't drop the ball. There are no fewer than four USB ports. Two USB-C and two standard A-type USB ports. That's coupled with a 3.5mm audio jack and microSD card reader. As well as a lock slot for more security. </p>
<p> Will support for USB-C display output and the wealth of available cable plugs, there's really not many scenarios — in terms of use cases — that this Chromebook won't slot into with ease. </p>
<p> For the price, these speakers could be a whole lot worse </p>
<p> Now, audio can be almost as subjective as battery life. But, generally-speaking, laptops have terrible speakers, with very few exceptions. So those who need audio that's passable can breathe a sigh of relief. The audio that emanated from Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook during my review wasn't at all 'powerful'. But it was at least balanced and delivered at a decent volume. </p>
<p> In fact, this is easily among the most balanced Chromebooks I've had the pleasure to test on that front. With caveats. </p>
<p> Nobody should expect the speakers, firing from both the left and right at 2W with HD drivers, to move a lot of air. So there won't be any groundbreaking bass or as much depth as might be expected from even a moderately affordable Bluetooth speaker. Or from some budget-friendly headphones. </p>
<p> With that said, in a pinch, these speakers will perform just fine and they're more than clear enough — as are the mics — for video conferencing. </p>
<p> Flex 3 Chromebook is built by Lenovo and powered by Google </p>
<p> Chromebooks — all of them — run an identical suite of software out of the box. And, in every case, also offer up support for almost identical software experiences. There are a few minor differences at the upper-reaches of the spectrum. Particularly when it comes to programming uses. But this isn't really a Chromebook designed for that, although the Lenovo Flex three would probably hold up for some cases based on this review. </p>
<p> But what Chrome OS really means for end-users, is stability. This is one of the most stable operating systems to ever grace this type of hardware. Whether that's in photo editing or browsing the web, with support for Android apps, Linux software, PWAs, and Chrome. </p>
<p> Another piece of that puzzle is the more recently added Google Assistant AI, easily accessed via voice or through clicks and the keyboard. </p>
<p> Better still, users get automatic updates for the next several years. That means security, stacked atop a sandboxed environment, as well as smooth operation. </p>
<p> Should you buy the Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook? </p>
<p> Many Chromebooks in the budget segment are easily defined by their price. And many of the aspects of the Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook, as seen in this review, match up with that. The display isn't the best around and neither is the build materials. The keyboard isn't the most comfortable on the market. </p>
<p> But, digging deeper immediately turns around any misconceptions that might be had based on the initial experience in combination with the cost. At under $350, it's easy to lower expectations too far, especially for those who may be coming over from a less stable operating system. This Chromebook blows away those expectations handily when it comes to overall experience from the audio, battery life, and the performance. </p>
<p> Those aspects that don't stack up quite as well as a more expensive machine may or may not be necessary. In the latter case, this is an easy Chromebook to recommend for all but the most intensive use cases. Whether that's for a Chrome OS veteran or somebody just getting started with the platform. </p>

<p> Beastly Specs Confirmed For Lenovo Legion Gaming Smartphone </p>
<p> The Lenovo Legion gaming smartphone has just stopped by the benchmarking website AnTuTu, revealing a few key details. The smartphone, bearing the model number L79031, scored impressive 648,871 points on AnTuTu tests. </p>
<p> According to the listing, the upcoming gaming phone from Lenovo will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ SoC. The chipset is tipped to launch sometime this month, featuring significant upgrades over the vanilla Snapdragon 865. </p>
<p> We're looking at an overclocked CPU with a maximum frequency of 3.09GHz. The octa-core CPU features a Kyro 585 Prime core operating highest at 3.09GHz, three Kyro 585 Gold cores operating at 2.42GHz, and four power-efficient Kyro 585 Silver cores operating at 1.80Ghz. The Snapdragon 865, on the other hand, has a maximum clock speed of 2.84GHz. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The new chipset incorporates the same Adreno 650 GPU as the Snapdragon 865. However, there's still a significant improvement in GPU performance, which is ideal for a game-centric smartphone. </p>
<p> The upcoming Lenovo smartphone also gets 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512GB UFS 3.1 storage. </p>
<p> The UX score of 100,176 points means AnTuTu believes the display might have a 144Hz refresh rate, which would again make sense for a gaming phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It could be an OLED panel with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 pixels. The AnTuTu listing also reveals that the upcoming Lenovo Legion gaming phone will run Android 10 out of the box. </p>
<p> Lenovo Legion gaming phone posts impressive AnTuTu scores, might launch soon </p>
<p> Lenovo last month confirmed that its Legion gaming smartphone would arrive in July. While the exact launch date is still a mystery, the device keeps popping up on the internet quite often. </p>
<p> Past leaks and rumors suggest the phone to come with two USB Type-C ports, which would help greatly with gaming. An in-display fingerprint reader, a 64-megapixel dual rear-camera setup, a side-facing pop-up selfie camera, and dual speakers are also among expected features. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are some fluctuating reports about this phone's battery capacity and charging speed. While some reports claim a 5,050 mAh battery with 55W fast charging, others speculate a 4,000 mAh battery with 45W or even 90W charging speed. </p>
<p> A 4,000 mAh battery seems a bit low for a gaming smartphone, though. We'll have to wait for more credible reports or the official announcement for confirmation on that. </p>
<p> Lenovo's Legion gaming phone will arrive later this month with 5G connectivity, gamepad accessories, and some kind of liquid cooling technology. It will be pitted directly against the ASUS ROG Phone III, which also likely features the Snapdragon 865+ chipset. The ASUS gaming phone launches on July 22. It'll be interesting to see how the two gaming smartphones fair. </p>

<p> Lenovo Legion Gaming Phone Appears In Certification With Photos </p>
<p> The upcoming Lenovo Legion-branded Android gaming phone has now appeared at China’s CNIPA patent website, complete with a few new details. That listing also happens to hold full-color photos of the handset, pulled down from the site by Pricebaba. The images reveal a design take that's uniquely suited for gamers. </p>
<p> For starters, the entire rear panel appears to be transparent. The images show the handset in a metallic grey color, with what appears to either be a second red variant. Conversely, the images showcase LEDs under the panel that light up through the see-through backing. In the images, the coloration highlights a shuriken-shape at the center of the design </p>
<p> The detail is consistent with the Legion branding, which stretches across the device from the bottom to the fingerprint scanner — set just below its triple-camera array. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Near the right-hand edge at the center of the rear panel, a physical fan is visible. Lenovo's Legion division has included the word "Cool" next to the fan. That hints that the fan is likely integral as part of the device's previously reported "disruptive" cooling solution. </p>
<p> What details does CNIPA give for the Lenovo Legion gaming phone? </p>
<p> Aside from the confirmation of cooling features and a triple-camera array over a transparent backing, there are at least a few other details the patent images reveal. To begin with, the Lenovo Legion gaming phone will feature larger-than-average bezels above and below the display. </p>
<p> That will house a selfie camera and earpiece. But it will also make room for a second USB-C port. One USB-C port is in place at the bottom-center of the handset but there's another in the left-hand edge. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That will undoubtedly be utilized to attach accessories or secondary displays. For instance, it may be used chiefly for the now-expected Lenovo Legion gamepad. That follows recent reports that the company will release such an accessory to compete with other gaming smartphones. It may also be usable with other accessories such as earphones. </p>
<p> With two ports, users will additionally be able to use their handset while charging in two different configurations. Lenovo has already said the Legion gaming phone will feature at least 55W fast charging technology. And that's going to be useful since the rear of the device also denotes a relatively huge 5,050mAh battery is in place here. </p>
<p> The larger-than-average battery will not only be useful to drive a more optimized gaming experience. Rumors have stated that the device will utilize a battery-draining 144Hz refresh rate for the display panel. That's alongside LPDDR5 RAM and the very latest in UFS fast storage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Finally, the under-panel markings note one key discrepancy. Previous reports have confirmed the use of a Snapdragon 865 chipset for this phone. But the unexpected images show designation for the Snapdragon 855 SoC. It's not clear whether that's a misprint or if it points to a deeper problem with prior reports. </p>
<p> When is this phone expected to arrive? </p>
<p> Aside from reports and hints from Lenovo that a powerful, 5G-ready, Legion-branded smartphone will drop "soon," details about its probable launch date are fairly slim. The device has been appearing in reports since at least the middle of December, last year. </p>
<p> Given the current global coronavirus pandemic and its limiting-effect in terms of large gatherings and smartphone demand, Lenovo may choose to hold off on any announcements. Or the company may choose to do a soft-launch in select regions where the market is beginning to rebound — launching later to other regions. If that happens, the company may choose to launch via a virtual announcement. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If Lenovo stages a larger launch event, that's not likely to happen for at least a few months. </p>

<p> Lenovo Legion Launch Date Confirmed; Snapdragon 865 Plus Will Fuel It </p>
<p> Lenovo has confirmed that its ‘Legion’ smartphone will launch on July 22. That will become the company’s new gaming smartphone, and it will be fueled by the all-new Snapdragon 865 Plus. </p>
<p> Both of those facts have been confirmed by the company, by the way. So, the Lenovo Legion will launch on the same day as the ASUS ROG Phone 3. Those two phones will be the very first devices fueled by this new chip. </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 865 Plus was announced yesterday, and it offers a number of gaming-related improvements. The device comes with better overall performance, and better GPU performance, not to mention higher clock speed. </p>

<p> The Lenovo Legion will launch on July 22 in China </p>
<p> The Lenovo Legion launch will take place in China, by the way. The company has also confirmed that the device will offer two 45W ports for fast charging. </p>
<p> The phone will also include a new heat dissipation architecture, and 14 temperature sensors. On top of that, you can expect dual X-axis linear motors, and an additional USB Type-C port on the side. </p>
<p> AnTuTu benchmark confirmed that the phone will feature a fullHD+ (2340 x 1080) display, and it will also offer a 144Hz refresh rate. 270Hz touch sampling rate will also be a part of the package. </p>

<p> This smartphone’s beastly SoC will be backed by a lot of RAM. The Lenovo Legion is said to ship with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and 512GB of UFS 3.1. So, Lenovo is not sparing any expense on components, it seems. </p>
<p> LPDDR5 RAM is the latest-gen RAM for smartphones, the same goes for UFS 3.1 in terms of storage. This smartphone should get certified by TENAA in the near future, and then we’ll get even more information. </p>
<p> TENAA will probably reveal the phone’s final design, as well. The Lenovo Legion is expected to stand apart from regular smartphones in the design department. We expect it to be somewhat flashy. </p>

<p> Lenovo Legion Phone Duel Hands-On And First Impressions </p>
<p> At the end of July Lenovo announced the Legion Phone Duel, its first entry into the gaming smartphone market, and I've now been able to get a little hands-on time with it. </p>
<p> I'll be doing a full gaming review of the device later on once I've had time to properly test it. So expect that in the coming weeks. For now though, I wanted to give some first impressions about the phone. </p>
<p> First things first, the Legion Phone Duel isn't planned for a US release right now. At least not that Lenovo has confirmed. That being said, this is a phone you should hope gets released in the US. If a gaming smartphone is what you're in the market for. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Hands-on with the Legion Phone Duel, a beefy phone with a commanding presence </p>
<p> The first time you set eyes on the Legion Phone Duel, you know it means business. Lenovo designed this phone to give off a commanding presence and to be quite honest, Lenovo succeeded. </p>
<p> It has a very gamer aesthetic to it. There's no disputing that. And should you like to play games competitively, even if only with or against friends, they'll know you take your gaming seriously when you show up with this thing. </p>
<p> Like the ROG Phone series the Legion Phone Duel has RGB lighting on the back in the shape of its logo. Though it's slightly more obvious on the Legion Phone Duel and it actually appears a tad bit brighter. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone is also quite heavy, but it doesn't feel much heavier than the ROG Phone II when in-hand. It does however seem to be a bit thicker. The short of it is this is a big phone. It comes with a loud design and Lenovo is not shy about it in any way. </p>
<p> It's a bit brash in design, but it plays games well </p>
<p> Love it or hate it, the design is what it is and it's not changing. The more important thing though is how it plays games. </p>
<p> So far from the first impressions, Lenovo is bringing the heat. After one or two matches of Gunfight in Call of Duty: Mobile, it's clear that the Legion Phone Duel is prepared to duel anytime, anywhere. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The one thing that I did notice is that it seems to get warmer during gameplay sessions than the ROG Phone II. A phone that's already a year old. It'll take more time playing for longer periods of time than just 10 minutes to get a clearer picture of how it sustains temperature management though. </p>
<p> Based on Lenovo's description and boasting of the cooling tech, it should be very competitive in this area with other devices. But time will tell. </p>
<p> overall, it seems it can handle any games you throw at it. At the cost of slightly rising temperatures of course. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Turbo charging really does mean turbo charging here </p>
<p> When I first took the phone out of the box and powered it up, I realized it was pretty low on battery life. </p>
<p> About 14-percent to be precise. This wouldn't do. I immediately wanted to check out how well it handled Call of Duty: Mobile. But it needed some juice first, so I proceeded to plug it in. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> After about 6 or so minutes on the charger, it went from 14-percent to 50-percent. If this pace kept up I would have a full battery in much less than hour. And I did. When it comes to charging, so far so good here. </p>
<p> It has a pretty cool unboxing experience </p>
<p> I'm not entirely sure if the retail packaging will be the same, but unboxing this beast of a gaming phone was pretty enjoyable. </p>
<p> Lenovo added in some noises that play once the second of the two side flaps of the box is opened. You can hear in the video below. To be clear, the retail box itself is likely to be the same. I'm just not certain if the sounds will be there or if this was just a special thing Lenovo did for press. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Either way, it was a neat little nod to Lenovo's confidence that this is a phone that is ready to perform. And so far, it's performing pretty damn well. </p>

<p> Lenovo Legion Phone Duel Gaming Review – Mobile Gaming At Its Finest </p>
<p> Lenovo is known fairly well for its gaming product line - Legion - and this year it finally entered the mobile gaming market with the Legion Phone Duel. This is its answer to companies like Razer, ASUS and others. It's a device packed to the brim with gaming features, and a device that's impossible to ignore. </p>
<p> A bit heavy to hold for more than a couple of hours </p>
<p> Not sold in the US officially </p>
<p> Lenovo provided us with the Legion phone for the purposes of this review. They did not see the contents of this review before publishing. </p>
<p> Lenovo may not be the king in terms of popularity when it comes to gaming, but the Legion Phone Duel demands your attention. Scratch that. It commands it. </p>
<p> And you should probably oblige. Because this is one hell of a gaming phone that has a lot to offer the consumer looking for this specialized piece of hardware. Gaming phones aren't for everyone. They are however gaining more and more popularity and presence in the mobile market and gaming market these days. </p>
<p> All thanks to the rise in popularity of mobile gaming as a whole. The Lenovo Legion Phone Duel is one of the only new gaming phones from a big recognizable brand to come out so far this year. The other being the ASUS ROG Phone 3. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel, you're letting the world know that you take your mobile gaming seriously. The one downside is that it isn't officially coming to the US. It's not unattainable in the US, you just won't be able to buy it direct from Lenovo, and instead have to deal with third-party resellers. </p>
<p> Let's dig in and take a closer look at why this is such a great device for gaming. And why it's an utter shame that most US consumers won't be able to get their hands on it. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Legion Phone Duel is the perfect phone for streamers </p>
<p> If you play mobile games competitively, or you're a content creator who focuses on games, this is the perfect phone for that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All gaming phones can be used for live streaming. But there's just something about the way that this phone handles it that makes it special. The uniqueness of its design makes it impossible to miss. </p>
<p> You know that it's there, and that sort of makes you want to use it. I am of course referring to the front-facing camera. Normally it's hidden from view. But once you hop in a game, you can open up the Legion Assistant gaming dashboard with a quick downward flick of the finger from the top of the display when in landscape mode. </p>
<p> Off to the right side, you have a series of digital buttons that lend themselves to different features. One of these is labeled "stream mode." Tap that and the motorized front camera slowly lifts itself up. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once Stream Mode is active, there are a few different things you can play with. Such as filters to add to your image (I quite enjoyed these as there were some fun ones). You can also move around your image to find the perfect spot, make it more transparent, and allow the camera to show the background. </p>
<p> It's a neat little feature. And one of the cooler things about the phone. The mechanism seems to work really well too, as the camera lifts up and closes without issue. </p>
<p> The battery life is good, but the real star is the charging time </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> I found the battery life on the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel to be pretty good for what it is. </p>
<p> It's a powerful phone with a lot of hardware and features that can easily drain the battery faster than you'd expect. But throw all that to the side because the battery life isn't what you should be focusing on. What you should be focusing on is the charging time. </p>
<p> Lenovo packaged this phone with a large power adapter to charge the device. It comes in either 65w or 90w depending on the region, and has two USB-C output ports. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is so you can charge the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel in either one of or both of its ports. And trust me, you're going to want to charge the phone with both ports because this is how you get it to charge up blazing fast. </p>
<p> When I say blazing fast I mean blazing fast. Lenovo says that the phone can be charged up to 50-percent in about 10 minutes. IF you're using the dual charging method with both cables being plugged into one of the ports. </p>
<p> For my experiences, I found this to be mostly true. At the end of a ten-minute period, the phone was charged up to 40-percent from a a completely dead battery. I used it till the phone shut off. At the end of 30 minutes exactly, the phone was at 95-percent. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So Lenovo is pretty close to what they're advertising here. And that's actually really awesome because that means you can use the phone for continuous gaming for anywhere between 4 and 7 hours, then charge it almost all the way back up in 30 minutes. </p>
<p> Utilize the Legion Assistant and game settings </p>
<p> Yes the Legion Phone Duel is packed with beefy specs but don't sleep on its software features. </p>
<p> Legion Assistant is the gaming dashboard which gives you access to various feature. This is where you'll find Stream Mode, controller settings, a back recording button, a button for screenshots while playing games and more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While you don't need to use Legion Assistant at all, you should. At least some of the time. It was actually pretty useful while I was playing Call Of Duty: Mobile or Black Desert Mobile. Especially if I was trying to stream and take screenshots. </p>
<p> In fact you'll need to open the Legion Assistant if you want to take a screenshot while in Stream Mode, because the phone's power button is right where the front camera is that pops up. Pressing it will only push the camera back down. This is why Lenovo added a screenshot button into this control panel. </p>
<p> There's also buttons for turning on the vibration, cleaning out the RAM, and enabling/disabling calls and notifications. You can also turn of gestures, lighting and access WhatsApp and Line chat. </p>
<p> There are also slider bars for both the game volume and screen brightness at the bottom of the panel. And a Rampage button which diverts all CPU and GPU resources to your gaming. Lenovo also displays the battery life frames per second, and temperature of the phone's internals here. So it's an all-around useful feature to have. </p>
<p> Legion Realm is the home for all your games </p>
<p> Aside from legion Assistant, there's also the Legion Realm app, which is more or less just a hub for all of your games. Lenovo added a software feature that lets you long-press both ultrasonic triggers to launch into Legion Realm even if you're not in gaming mode. </p>
<p> If you use Legion Realm, this is a quick and nifty way to get to it. Though you could also just keep the app shortcut on the home screen and that was really just as fast for me personally. </p>
<p> There's no easy way to find games that support the vibration feedback </p>
<p> This was one of my pet peeves with this device. The vibration feedback is a big feature that Lenovo advertised quite a bit. </p>
<p> You can turn this on from the Legion Assistant panel, but only if the game you're playing supports it. If it doesn't, you'll just be met with a message that says game not supported. </p>
<p> The problem is that there doesn't appear to be an easy way to identify what games support this feature and what games don't. I've played a handful of games on the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel and none of them allow me to enable the vibration. </p>
<p> Unfortunately this made it impossible to really sample. It's a shame really, because this was one of the more exciting features about the phone and it helps with game immersion. But without knowing which games support it, it's almost useless. </p>
<p> Top-notch performance, as expected </p>
<p> Whether you go for the base model Legion Phone Duel, or the big boy that comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage for games and apps, the phone performs. </p>
<p> Exceptionally too. I used the phone for everything from mobile games to a bit of game streaming through GeForce NOW and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and never once did I run into issues with performance. </p>
<p> It has more than enough power to run all mobile games at max settings. And everything runs very smooth while doing so. The best part is you can keep an eye on your FPS from the Legion Assistant app if you're ever questioning what it might be, or if you're curious to know what it is. </p>
<p> If you want to perform at your best, the Legion Phone Duel is equipped to help you do that. </p>
<p> Probably the best cooling system of any phone so far </p>
<p> Lenovo boasted quite a lot about the Legion Phone Duel and its cooling capabilities. And it seems for a good reason. </p>
<p> The phone definitely gets warm, but only barely enough to notice. After two straight hours of playing Black Desert Mobile without putting the phone down, it never got too hot to hold. </p>
<p> In fact I never noticed it getting warm enough to even be slightly uncomfortable. After that same two hours of constant gaming, display on, with the Rampage mode going, the phone got up to about 105 degrees Fahrenheit/41 degrees Celsius. </p>
<p> This wasn't enough to make the phone feel uncomfortable. I also didn't see performance take a dip at all. Which tells me that Lenovo knew what it was doing with the cooling technology and that it executed things very well. </p>
<p> Clear & immersive sound thanks to Dirac-tuned front speakers </p>
<p> There's nothing that kills the excitement more than bad audio when playing a game. </p>
<p> At least for me. When I'm playing a game I want to be immersed in it as much as I can, and while audio alone isn't going to toss me into the world of the game it certainly helps. </p>
<p> The Legion Phone Duel does this better than most phones out there with front-facing speakers. Are these the best phone speakers on the market? I don't know that I would go that far. </p>
<p> But they are really good, and they make gaming more enjoyable which is the main reason to get the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel. </p>
<p> The ultrasonic triggers are pretty easy to use </p>
<p> Despite appearing as though the triggers are more inward, they're actually reactive near the very corners of the device. </p>
<p> They're pretty easy to use. And you can always adjust them to be more or less sensitive from inside of the Legion Realm app. The default setting for these is at 35-percent. But if that's not quite sensitive enough for you, then you can always change it to be more around 15-percent. </p>
<p> The same can be done if you need them to be less sensitive. Unfortunately it doesn't look like you can save the sensitivity to a profile. So if you prefer it to be different for certain games, you'll have to manually change it every time. </p>
<p> Overall, I was very pleased with how well Lenovo implemented the ultrasonic triggers. They work just as well as I'd hoped they would. </p>
<p> And because my hands are a little smaller my pointer fingers sit very close to the corners of the device. So I was worried I wouldn't be able to use the triggers efficiently. That's not the case as the sensors cover a pretty large area of the edge they're on. </p>
<p> Should you buy the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel? </p>
<p> If you live in the US, it's going to be a little bit harder to come by. Lenovo isn't selling it in the US officially. Though you can find it from third-party sellers. </p>
<p> Since it's not being sold in the US though, you may want to make sure that it'll work with your phone carrier if this will be your main phone. If you live in a region where this is sold officially, then it's a good device to have for your gaming needs. </p>
<p> It's definitely one of the best gaming phones out right now and it checks some really important boxes. Like the cooling, performance, and charging speeds. Everything else is great, but to me they felt more like bonuses as they weren't something I needed to have on a gaming phone. </p>
<p> If you can find the device and it'll work for everything you need, heavily consider it. Because Lenovo knocked this one out of the park. </p>

<p> Lenovo Designs Two New Slider Phones With A Distinctly Moto Twist </p>
<p> Lenovo may be preparing two new smartphones featuring slider-cameras rather than a hole-punch display or notch, based on designs filed with the Chinese National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) and first spotted by Tiger Mobiles. </p>
<p> In both designs, the smartphones appear to be separated between the front and back panels. A mechanism is in place that allows the back panel to be slid upward, revealing selfie cameras. The two designs differ mostly in terms of the number of cameras present in the selfie-shooter array and primary camera. </p>
<p> There are a few subtle differences in terms of the overall design of the devices, with the apparent larger of the two featuring minutely thicker bezels — almost symmetrical around the entire device. That handset appears to have a smoother curve to the back panel too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The smaller gadget with slightly trimmer bezels features a dual-camera snapper on the back while the front side only has a single snapper. On the larger of the two, the rear panel seems to three sensors at the back and dual-selfie-snappers. The front cameras seem to be accompanied by a much wider array of secondary sensors too, possibly indicating it would have advanced face unlocking and AR features that its counterpart wouldn't be capable of utilizing. </p>
<p> New Lenovo 'Z' phones or something else? </p>
<p> Details regarding exactly what sets these sliders apart from others that are already on the market, including those made by Lenovo, aren't immediately clear. The design sketches provided with the patents also seem to indicate that both will apply to future smartphones in lines already released by Lenovo under its own branding. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One thing that is apparent is that these don't line up well with the recently launched Lenovo Z6 Pro design. The biggest difference is that although these do line up with the previously launched Lenovo Z5 and Z5 Pro GT, that smartphone doesn't have a slider camera. </p>
<p> Taking cues from Moto for the Chinese market? </p>
<p> Previous iterations of slider phones from Lenovo have centered around a more traditional oval-shaped camera housing and bump on the rear-panel — typically in a vertical orientation. The new designs, conversely, utilize a round camera hump and even follow Moto's standard squared-off camera layout. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The design itself appears very similar to that found on another series of smartphones made by Lenovo but sold under the "Moto" branding. </p>
<p> Tying in with that, Lenovo's smartphones are generally sold exclusively in the Chinese market. So the aesthetic appearance of the new designs seems to lean toward consolidating the two brands — at least in outward appearance. That could place Lenovo in a better position to compete in its home region, with consideration for the increasingly oversaturated global Android smartphone market — summarily, by narrowing its focus into fewer components and designs. </p>
<p> Setting aside that speculation, both patents could ultimately apply to a single device with elements taken from either design rolled into one. Until Lenovo utilizes the design patents to release new smartphones or a new smartphone, it’s not immediately clear whether that is their intended purpose is. </p>

<p> Lenovo's Entry Into Mobile Gaming Is The Legion Phone Duel </p>
<p> The wait is over for Lenovo's official entry into the gaming smartphone market as the company just announced the Legion Phone Duel. </p>
<p> Its answer to the competition from brands like ASUS and its ROG Phone 3. The Legion Phone Duel is packed to the brim with top-notch hardware. Ready to boost your mobile gaming prowess to untold heights. </p>
<p> That is, if you live in China, or select markets in the EMEA or Asia Pacific. According to Lenovo it has no plans to release the Legion Phone Duel in the US. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Does that mean Lenovo will never release a gaming phone in the US? No, not necessarily. But based on official wording from Lenovo, the US is not a targeted market for this device. For those that live in areas where Lenovo will sell it, you're in for a wild ride. </p>
<p> The Legion Phone Duel is a mobile gamer's dream </p>
<p> Though some of the specs and features were already leaked prior to Lenovo's official announcement, there's something about a confirmation on the device being a powerhouse that just makes it that much more enticing. </p>
<p> The phone is a mobile gamer's dream. It comes with the latest mobile platform from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 865 Plus 5G, as well as 16GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage. There's also a 12GB RAM option that comes with 256GB of storage, probably alongside a lower price point. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It has speakers tuned by Dirac Audio too, which Lenovo says provide some "surprising 3D audio." If the description is accurate then users are likely to have a wonderful mobile gaming experience. </p>
<p> Popularized by ASUS' ROG Phone series, you'll even find touch sensor shoulder buttons for extra control in your games. And all of that will be visible on the 6.59-inch FHD display with a 144Hz refresh rate. </p>
<p> If you're into livestreaming your gameplay, then the Legion Phone Duel is even more perfect. The popup camera on the side was in fact designed with livestreamers in mind. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One of the more interesting features of the phone is the dual vibration engines. So you're basically getting haptic feedback in your mobile games. Though, this likely requires developers to actually utilize that hardware. </p>
<p> Double the cooling, double the batteries, double the fun </p>
<p> When it comes to power, it's not all about performance. Sometimes it's about actual power. Or rather battery power. </p>
<p> Lenovo packed this phone with 5,000mAh of battery life. But it's not one giant battery. It's actually two 2,500mAh-capacity batteries split into the top and bottom sections of the phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As for the cooling, Lenovo used dual liquid-cooling and copper tubes to help dissipate heat better and keep the device cool and comfortable during your gaming sessions. Lenovo boasted about its "disruptive cooling technology" months ago. </p>
<p> So here's hoping it lives up to the hype. One of the main complaints about devices such as the ROG Phone II and other gaming phones is how hot they can get. Lenovo seems to think they've cracked the code with that. </p>
<p> As for the rest of the specs, the Legion Phone Duel is running on Android 10 and comes with dual front-facing stereo speakers, dual SIM slots, and a 64-megapixel rear camera for the main sensor alongside a secondary camera with a 16-megapixel ultrawide sensor. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The side-mounted, popup streamer-ready front-facing camera is a 20-megapixel sensor. So you'll be pretty clear to anyone watching you. It also uses an on-display fingerprint sensor and has two USB C ports. </p>
<p> One on the bottom for when you charge the device normally, and one on the side for when you need to charge the phone while you're playing games. Just like on the ROG Phone II. </p>
<p> The phone will release in July in China, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and select Asia Pacific countries. It will also release in Latin America at a later date, and will come in two colors – Vengeance Red and Blazing Blue. </p>

<p> Lenovo Smart Clock Can Finally Display Your Photos </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Clock can now double as a digital photo frame and display all your photos. </p>
<p> Google and Lenovo announced the new functionality late last week when confirming an update was rolling out to the device. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Clock is a small smart display essentially. Although compared to smart displays, the Smart Clock has been missing some features that are now taken for granted with devices lite this. A prime example being doubling as a photo frame. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google Assistant-powered smart displays have always been able to act as a photo frame. In fact, this is usually one of the main selling points when a company is advertising the product. However, a Lenovo Smart Clock photo frame was never on offer until now. </p>
<p> It was previously thought this might have been a conscious decision. For example, its size, coupled with the fact it’s primarily designed to be a timepiece may have resulted in Google and Lenovo opting to leave out certain features. </p>
<p> Evidently, that was not the case as the Lenovo Smart Clock has now gained the same photo frame support. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Show your own or other peoples’ photos on your Lenovo Smart Clock </p>
<p> Similar to smart displays, those opting to make use of this feature have two primary choices. The first is to give permission to the device to source your Google Photos account. If selected, photos from the user’s Google Photos account will automatically and randomly be displayed. </p>
<p> The second option is to enable the feature but not give it permission to use Google Photos. In this instance, Google will source photos from elsewhere. Turning the photo frame into more of a random gallery frame. </p>
<p> Of course, the feature is optional to begin with. Therefore, those not wanting to see any imagery at all can continue as they were following receipt of the update. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Talk with Assistant for longer </p>
<p> As part of the same update, the Lenovo Smart Clock is gaining a setting to turn on Continued Conversation. Once this is enabled the user will be able to converse longer with Google Assistant without having to continually say “Hey Google” in between responses. </p>
<p> This effectively means Google Assistant will also be listening for longer after a response has been given. After all, that’s how it will pick up the next interaction without being woken. Due to the extended listening period, the new setting is optional. Those that want it in effect can enable it, and those happy to continue as they were, can leave it disabled. </p>
<p> The update arrives organically so there should be nothing for the device owner to do. In most cases, it is likely the update has already arrived. </p>

<p> Lenovo Made An Even Smaller Google Assistant-Powered Smart Clock </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Clock that the company announced last year was very popular. So popular in fact that it is announcing the Lenovo Smart Clock Essential. It's an even smaller smart clock that still has Google Assistant built-in. </p>
<p> This smart clock has a tiny 4-inch display, which makes it great to put into a bedroom or even into the kitchen. Where there may not be a lot of space available. Lenovo is marketing this as the smart clock "made for every room". This display is colored, so it's not just black and white. Though it will only show the time in black and white. </p>
<p> It sports an easy-to-read LED display, which has real-time information displaying. Like the time, the weather and more. It can be viewed from nearly every angle. The brightness on the Lenovo Smart Clock Essential is pretty good, it can get very dim, thanks to the ambient light sensor that is included. It can also get bright enough to read during the day. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the Lenovo Smart Clock Essential, you can still ask Google Assistant all kinds of questions, like how's the weather, or to control your smart home products. There are over 40,000 compatible smart home devices on the market today. You can use Google Assistant routines on the Lenovo Smart Clock Essential as well. </p>
<p> Let's not forget that this is also a smart speaker. Though, it may not be a very good one, since it is pretty small. It is about 3W, so it does work, but don't expect it to be on par with a Sonos speaker, unfortunately. </p>
<p> When can I get this new smart clock? </p>
<p> Lenovo Smart Clock Essential will start at $49.99. And it is expected to be available September 2020. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That puts it at almost half the price of the Lenovo Smart Clock that is also around the same size (a little larger at 5-inches). This makes it pretty inexpensive, and about the same price as a Nest Mini or even an Echo Dot from Amazon. </p>
<p> It should be out in time for the holiday season, where it could also see even better prices. Seeing as the Lenovo Smart Clock does go on sale for around $50-$60 sometimes. This would really make a great gift this holiday season, especially with more and more of us spending more time at home, thanks to the ongoing pandemic. As the Google Assistant can be very helpful for working and schooling from home. </p>

<p> Lenovo's Cute Little Smart Clock Essential Is Now Available </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Clock Essential was announced a few months ago, and now it is available to purchase for $49.99. </p>
<p> This is a smaller version of its popular Smart Clock it announced last year, which makes it great to put in your room next to your bed. </p>
<p> As you can likely tell by the name, the Smart Clock Essential is not a full-blown smart display. Instead, Lenovo paired it down to, well the essentials. It does not sport a color display, instead it is black and white only. Unlike the 2019 Smart Clock Lenovo released. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the screen is just black and white this time around, it does still offer many of the smart display features you'd expect. Including the Google Assistant. So you can still ask the Google Assistant questions, and find out what's on your schedule today, and so forth. It also is a smart speaker still, so you can play music on the Lenovo Smart Clock Essential. Or, if you're looking to have it on your bedside table, use it to play white noise and make you fall asleep. </p>
<p> It's kind of like a Nest Mini, but with a display that can show you the time, and it's the same price too. We'll undoubtedly see it discounted for Black Friday next month. </p>
<p> Where can I buy the Lenovo Smart Clock Essential? </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Clock Essential is available from Lenovo, Walmart and Best Buy today. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As mentioned, it is priced at $49.99, putting it on par with the Nest Mini, and making it the cheapest smart display around – even if it is also the smallest. </p>
<p> It's available in just one color, which has a black front – to make the screen melt into the bezel. And it has a soft gray fabric wrapped around it. Similar to the original Lenovo Smart Clock. </p>

<p> Lenovo Smart Clock Alarm Now More Responsive To The Environment </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Clock is getting an update that allows for greater alarm customization. </p>
<p> The update started rolling out earlier in the week and therefore is likely to have already arrived on some devices. </p>
<p> Along with the alarm clock upgrade, there’s also some other more general improvements. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A more custom alarm for the Lenovo Smart Clock </p>
<p> The latest update was announced by Google who confirmed the inclusion of a new “Impromptu” feature. </p>
<p> Once updated, Impromptu makes the alarm ringtone more “customized to your environment,” according to Google. In other words, depending on certain factors such as time of day and the weather, the ringtone used for the alarm will vary. </p>
<p> Google says the choice of ringtone is determined by one of its machine learning technologies. Specifically, machine learning technology developed by Google’s Magenta open source project. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> More than just a new ringtone </p>
<p> In addition to the new Impromptu feature, the latest update also includes improvements to some existing features. All of which are said to have come about as a direct result of feedback from users. </p>
<p> For example, there’s an improvement to how long the alarm lasts with the options having now been extended to 60 minutes. Another change is the addition of a music recommendation card which is designed to provide quicker and easier access to playlists. A final, but useful improvement is a greater fine-tuning of the smart clock’s automatic brightness feature. </p>
<p> This latest update follows on from an August one that let’s the smart clock double as a digital photo frame. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The little small clock just keeps getting better </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Clock was first announced at CES 2019 and then became available to buy midway through the year. </p>
<p> This is another smart display although its smaller than usual size makes it ideal for small homes or certain rooms within the home, such as the bedroom. </p>
<p> Arguably, it’s more akin to a smart speaker with a display than a smart display. Although however it is classified, it is capable of doing many things thanks thanks to it coming powered by Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the holiday season now in full swing, Google took today’s announcement to highlight the Lenovo Smart Clock can now be picked up at a cheaper price than usual. For example, the Lenovo Smart Clock is now on sale for $49. That’s down from its usual $79 in the U.S. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Clock can be picked up from a number of online retailers, including Best Buy. </p>

<p> Android News / Lenovo Smart Clock Review: Finally A Smart Display For Your Bedroom </p>
<p> Lenovo Smart Clock Review: Finally A Smart Display For Your Bedroom </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Clock is a "cute" little smart display that cuts back on a number of features, but that's not a bad thing in this case. </p>
<p> Lenovo was the first to launch a smart display last year, using the Google Assistant, with the Lenovo Smart Display. In 2019, it's looking to pioneer another form-factor for smart displays. And that's a smaller, more compact smart display that is effectively a clock. Something that can go into your bedroom. The Lenovo Smart Clock does also have a new competitor on the Amazon Alexa side, with the Echo Show 5, so it looks like these smaller "smart clocks" are going to be a big deal in 2019. But is the Lenovo Smart Clock worth your money? Let's find out. </p>
<p> Perfect for a bedside table </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Clock is pretty small, and makes it perfect for sitting on a bedside table at night. It has a 4-inch display, though the bezels are also pretty large. That is for good reason, though. The top bezel has a number of sensors which are used to keep the display from getting overly bright at night. As you don't want your Smart Clock to wake you up at three in the morning. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo knows that many people are going to use this next to their bed, and have included a full-sized USB-A port on the back. This port can actually be used to charge your phone at night. Unfortunately, there's no fast charging here, so you're looking at the "old school" slower charging. But that's not a bad thing, just plug it in before bed and it'll be fully charged when you wake up in eight hours. </p>
<p> This Smart Clock does not have a camera. This was likely done because of the size of the Smart Clock, but also so that customers could put it in their bedroom and never worry about Google and/or Lenovo possibly spying on them. Which is a real concern for many, with the other smart displays on the market. </p>
<p> Lenovo also has a way to turn off the microphone, with a switch on the back of the Smart Clock. It's pretty similar to the switch on the other Lenovo smart displays. This is a good thing to have if you don't want Google Assistant listening for that wake word, or if your TV is triggering the wake word a lot (someone should outlaw those commercials that use "OK Google" – and even "Alexa"). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A Stripped down smart display </p>
<p> Compared to the larger Lenovo Smart Displays, the Smart Clock is missing a lot of functionality. Like a lot. First off, you can't use it as a photo frame, like other smart displays. You do get a number of clock faces that you can choose from on this Smart Clock. There's about ten of them available, and Lenovo says that there are more coming in the next few weeks/months. </p>
<p> To be honest, I didn't miss not being able to see photos on the Smart Clock. Possibly because it was next to my bed, and I really only needed it to show me the current time, weather and any alarms that I have set. It's also a pretty small display, so if you have pictures playing on it, with the time in the corner, it's going to be tough to see the time. So removing this functionality was likely a good move on Lenovo's part. </p>
<p> You also can't play video on the Lenovo Smart Clock. If you ask it to play something on YouTube, it will default to another Smart Display or Android TV that's in your home (on the same WiFi network). Again, this was likely a good move on Lenovo's part, as watching a YouTube video on this low-resolution, 4-inch display, isn't going to be a great experience. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But, you can still play music, podcasts, audiobooks and such. Lenovo has a pretty powerful 6W speaker in the Smart Clock, and it sounds pretty darn good actually. Given its size, we weren't expecting much, in terms of audio quality out of this smart display. And we were pleasantly surprised. Lenovo also has volume buttons located on the top of the Smart Clock, so you don't have to rely on asking Google Assistant to adjust the volume. You can do it manually. </p>
<p> The functionality that is here includes setting alarms pretty easily, turning off notifications (do not disturb), showing you the weather, and playing music. That's really it. But the Google Assistant can still do the usual things that you'd expect it to do. Like giving you the weather, traffic conditions and answering questions. </p>
<p> It's a pretty simple Smart Clock, as far as functionality goes, and that's not a bad thing. To be honest, I did not miss any of the functionality from the larger Lenovo Smart Display, on this Smart Clock. I used it for telling the time, setting alarms, and asking Google how the weather was. That was literally about it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Somewhat familiar experience </p>
<p> If you've used other smart displays, with the Google Assistant, then you're going to know what to expect here. Even though this is running a customized OS, it is very similar to Cast that's on the Lenovo Smart Displays, and Android Things that's on the Google Home Hub. Swipe from right to left and you can set an alarm and see your alarms, swipe again to see the weather. Swipe the opposite way to dim the display – great for when you are going to bed. Swipe down from the top, and you get a few shortcuts like setting an alarm and commands like "Good Morning" and "Play Music". These are great for when you don't want to talk to Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Swiping up from the bottom gives you a few toggles like brightness, volume, do not disturb and then a shortcut to settings. And that's the entire interface. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To change the clock face on the Lenovo Smart Clock, long-press on the clock, and you will be able to change up the clock face, and also customize it – a bit. This is very similar to the way you change clock faces on Wear OS smartwatches. </p>
<p> Not very customizable </p>
<p> The biggest complaint about the Lenovo Smart Clock right now is, the customizability. It's not very customizable at all. Lenovo does have plans to bring more clock faces to the Smart Clock at some point. Though we aren't sure when that will be. Currently, you can slightly customize the clock face that you choose. But it's not much. You can choose to have the clock face go from dark to light, depending on the light in the room. Which isn't very helpful, from a customizability standpoint. </p>
<p> Lenovo could take a Wear OS approach to the home screen too. Allowing users to add different screens to the right of the main clock screen. Instead of only having your alarms and the weather. Users could add things like the traffic conditions for their way to work. Or their calendar for the day/week/month, or something like that. So when they wake up in the morning, they could flip through the cards here and see what's going on – and see how quickly they need to jump out of bed to get to work on time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Most Google Assistant Smart Displays are not very customizable, so this is not a big surprise, but it would still be nice to see a few more options available on the Lenovo Smart Clock. Luckily, we do have some more clock faces coming to the Lenovo Smart Clock in the future, so we may get a bit more customizability in that regard. This is still a first-generation product, in a lot of ways, so some of these things may change in the future. </p>
<p> The best bedside gadget you can buy </p>
<p> When Lenovo announced the Smart Clock at CES back in January, I was very excited to get my hands on one. I already had the Lenovo 8-inch Smart Display and loved it in the kitchen. It's great for bringing up recipes, showing pictures, playing YouTube videos and more. But I wanted one for my bedroom that could work as a clock. Sure, I could do that with the Lenovo Smart Display, but it was rather big, and it also had a camera – there is a shutter for it, but not having one at all would be better. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That's why the Lenovo Smart Clock seemed so perfect. It's pretty small, so it won't be in the way on a bedside table, and it does its job of being a clock pretty well. You can still ask Google to do things, like your morning routine of turning on the lights, playing music and even getting the latest news headlines. But it has a darker screen, which is better for being in your bedroom. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Clock is priced at $79.99. That's $10 less than the new Amazon Echo Show 5, and if you are already invested into the Google Home/Google Assistant ecosystem, this is definitely going to be a better option for you. </p>

<p> Lenovo Smart Display 7: The Best Smart Display Gets Upgraded </p>
<p> Lenovo is announcing a new smart display, which is an upgrade over the Smart Display 8 and 10 that were announced a little over a year ago. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Display 7 is, you guessed it, a 7-inch smart display. It features a design that is similar to the first-generation Amazon Echo Show. With the speaker at the bottom of the device and the display towards the top. </p>
<p> Perhaps more appropriately, Lenovo took the Smart Display 8 and put it in portrait mode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo's Smart Display 7 took some design cues from the Smart Clock </p>
<p> Looking at this Smart Display 7, you can really see some design cues from the Smart Clock that the company announced earlier this year. </p>
<p> It now uses fabric for the bottom section of the smart display. This helps make the audio sound clearer, and also keeps it looking clean. </p>
<p> The backside is still a matte white finish. It does look a bit like plastic, but Lenovo is not talking about the materials being used to design this Smart Display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo also added in an ambient light sensor to the Smart Display 7. It also has much thinner bezels, making the smart display look like it actually belongs in 2019. </p>
<p> Finally, Lenovo also added front-facing left and right speakers for stereo separation. Something that its customers asked for, after the Smart Display 8 and 10 were released with a single speaker on the side. Which didn't offer much separation. </p>
<p> Google Assistant is still running the show </p>
<p> No surprise here, the Lenovo Smart Display 7 still has Google Assistant inside. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With Google Assistant built-in, you're going to be able to use your voice to do things like ask for the weather, or control your smart home devices. And since this has a display, you'll get it in visual form, which is a big upgrade from a Google Home Mini smart speaker. </p>
<p> If you do have smart home products, you can also see those on the screen and interact with them like you would on your phone. For those times that you don't want to use your voice to turn them on or off. </p>
<p> Lenovo is releasing the Smart Display 7 in October </p>
<p> The Smart Display 7 is going to be available starting in October. Lenovo has not yet given a firm date as to when it'll be available though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It'll also cost $129. Which puts it at about twice the price of the Smart Clock, but still below the old Smart Display 8 and 10 (both of which have been discounted pretty heavily recently). </p>

<p> Lenovo Launches Two Photo Frames With Vastly Different Uses – CES 2020 </p>
<p> Lenovo has visited CES 2020 with a wealth of new products this year, including two smart photo frames that bring wildly different approaches to the market. </p>
<p> The first of Lenovo's new gadgets is its Lenovo Smart Frame. Arguably the more interesting of the two gadgets, Smart Frame functions more like a traditional photo or artwork frame. Its primary purpose is to showcase images and artwork. The device comes loaded with a plethora of features and customization options. But it is, at its core, more about displaying stunning imagery than other functionality. </p>
<p> The second device, the Lenovo Smart Tab M10 FHD Plus, is a second-generation device built around Google Assistant. That delivers the full smart home package but with all of the perks of being an Android tablet, building on a similarly-branded product launched by the company late last year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo Smart Frame </p>
<p> Lenovo Smart Frame consists of two primary parts. That's a customizable frame which can easily be rotated into either landscape or portrait mode and a display. For the former, the company packs in a mounting system that is both clutter-free and easy to install. Lenovo designed the mount with cable management built-in so that cords don't become a tangled mess. </p>
<p> The company will also offer the frame in a range of options at various prices to better match the internal decor. That's because the second part of the gadget, its display, is intended to serve as smart home-ready artwork rather than a more standard smart home hub. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Frame comes with a dedicated application and AI to help manage which photos are shown, maximizing the use of screen real estate. The app contains hundreds of art pieces for display too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Better still, Lenovo's digital photo frame features a dedicated color tone sensor. The Smart Frame uses that sensor to adjust the image's brightness to better fit with a given room's ambient lighting, ensuring the photo or artwork always looks its best and most natural in any condition. The included Ambient Mode provides date, time, and weather information over the top of photos, ensuring the photo frame isn't solely aesthetic. </p>
<p> Finally, the company indicates that hand gestures can also be used to control the Lenovo Smart Frame. That includes playback of photo slides or videos that are being shown on the screen. </p>
<p> Snap-on mounting system (rotates portrait & landscape) and organizing cord system Lenovo Smart Tab M10 FHD Plus 2nd Gen with Google Assistant </p>
<p> Lenovo Smart Tab M10 FHD Plus 2nd Gen with Google Assistant is more than a photo frame </p>
<p> Lenovo's second photo frame acts more like a Google Assistant-powered smart home hub. Dubbed the Lenovo Smart Tab M10 FHD Plus, it's a second-generation product and follows closely on the heels of another product recently launched by the company — the Lenovo Smart Tab M8. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In fact, it very nearly mirrors that prior tablet in everything but the size and a few alterations to the processor. There are two RAM variants available with three storage variants. On memory, Lenovo offers either 2GB or 4GB. For storage, the company is giving buyers the option to select 32GB, 64GB, or up to 128GB. </p>
<p> Like many Android tablets, there is a front and rear camera, a plethora of sensors, an SD card slot, a headphone jack, and plenty of Android 9 Pie goodies to spare. The company included two side-firing speakers with Dolby Atmos, a 5000mAh battery, and a 10.3-inch FullHD panel too. But this year's CES launch from Lenovo also functions just like digital photo frames do and can do a whole lot more. </p>
<p> That's because, like the Lenovo Smart Tab M8, this tablet is packed in with a smart-charging dock that attaches via pogo-pins and Google's Ambient Mode for Google Assistant. While there's also a USB-C port for charging, that means this device can serve as both a standard Android tablet and a Google Assistant smart home hub. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The feature means that when users have the Lenovo Smart Tab M10 FHD Plus docked, it more closely resembles a Nest Home Hub than an Android tablet. When it's not being used to access those features, it automatically utilizes Google Photos to act as a digital photo frame when docked. </p>
<p> Length: 9.61 in (244.2 mm) Width: 6.03 in (153.3 mm) Height: 0.32 in (8.15 mm) </p>
<p> Weight </p>
<p> 1.01 lbs. (460 g) </p>
<p> Pricing and availability for the new Lenovo photo frames </p>
<p> Lenovo did not take advantage of CES 2020 to provide an exact launch date yet for either of its new smart home photo frames. It did, however, provide two relatively small windows for homeowners’ who might be considering a purchase. </p>
<p> The first of the two products to land on market will be the Lenovo Smart Tab M10 FHD Plus 2nd Gen with the Google Assistant. Lenovo expects that to become available as early as April. The device absolutely falls into the budget-friendly end of the Android Tablet spectrum. Lenovo expects the MSRP to fall in at $189.99. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> By contrast, the Lenovo Smart Frame will be arriving much later, in August of this year for North American customers. It will also be more expensive due to both its size and functionality. The company expects to sell the framed customizable 21.5-inch panels at a starting cost of $399.00. That price will undoubtedly vary chiefly based on the materials and colors chosen for the frame. </p>

<p> Lenovo's New Tablet Aims To Be An iPad Competitor </p>
<p> Every high-end tablet that comes out now is immediately compared to the iPad Pro. Especially if it's trying to be a desktop replacement. And now Lenovo is joining the fray. </p>
<p> Today, Lenovo debuted two new tablets: the Lenovo Tab P11 Pro and Tab M10 HD (2nd Gen). The latter is more of a kid-friendly tablet for the whole family, while the former is meant to be a laptop or even a desktop replacement. </p>
<p> Lenovo's Tab P11 Pro is going after Chromebook users </p>
<p> With the Lenovo Tab P11 Pro sporting Android, it is definitely going after the Chromebooks out there, which Lenovo also makes. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Tab P11 Pro is a 11.5-inch tablet with a 2560×1600 resolution OLED display. Powered by the Snapdragon 730G, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (there's a 6GB/128GB model too). There is also a micro SD card slot available for expanding storage. Packed inside is a 8400mAh capacity battery that should last you the full day. </p>
<p> Lenovo has also outfitted the Tab P11 Pro with a 8-megapixel camera. Which is at the top when the tablet is in landscape mode. This is the perfect place to put it, now that we are all doing more Zoom, Google Meet and other video calls. The backside does sport a 12-megapixel sensor and a 5-megapixel ultra-wide camera. </p>
<p> There is a Lenovo Keyboard Pack for the Tab P11 Pro, which is what really makes this a laptop replacement. But it will not be sold with the tablet, unfortunately. And we don't have pricing yet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Lenovo Tab P11 Pro is going to be available starting in November for $499. </p>
<p> The Tab M10 HD (2nd Gen) is perfect for kids doing the virtual learning thing </p>
<p> Lenovo is marketing the Tab M10 HD (2nd Gen) as a family tablet, but it's really made for kids. </p>
<p> With the Tab M10 HD (2nd Gen), Lenovo is hyping up Google Kids Space. This is designed to "nurture your kid's curiosity and creativity, inspiring them to explore their interests through thoughtfully curated apps, books and videos." Basically, this is Google's version of Amazon Freetime. And parents can control what content their kids can use with Google FamilyLink. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Lenovo Tab M10 HD (2nd Gen) is coming in three variants. There is the vanilla tablet, and then the Google Assistant model and an Amazon Alexa model. The Amazon Alexa model is not coming to the US. The regular model is going to be priced at $129 starting in September. With the Google Assistant version coming in October. </p>
<p> These new Lenovo tablets are shaping up to be pretty impressive devices, even at these almost rock bottom prices. Considering Samsung's latest starts at $649. </p>

<p> Google News / Google Chrome / Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Is A Powerful AMD Chromebook For Power Users </p>
<p> Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Is A Powerful AMD Chromebook For Power Users </p>
<p> Lenovo has reportedly announced a powerful new AMD-powered ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook Enterprise but its biggest differentiator might be the included “TrackPoint" hardware. For clarity, Lenovo's TrackPoint hardware is a small red nub,. centered on the keyboard. It effectively works as a joystick-like mouse, supplementing the touchpad. </p>
<p> Lenovo has been putting its popular TrackPoint hardware in its ThinkPad devices for years. Mostly because they offer power users a faster way to navigate around the UI without leaving the keyboard. But this marks the first occasion one has been added to a Chromebook. </p>
<p> ThinkPad C13 Yoga is a power-user-ready Chromebook </p>
<p> Now, Lenovo also includes a stylus in the new C13 Yoga Chromebook Enterprise. That's an optional accessory but can be housed in the frame of the laptop. But that should put even more power in users' hands, falling in-line with what's been packed under the hood. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To begin with, Lenovo started with a 13.3-inch FHD IPS display panel for its newest Chromebook. That can be had in touch or non-touch variants. In either case, the weight has been kept to under 3.3lbs and the frame measures just 15.5mm thin. The bezels surrounding that display have been taken down a notch too. Although, Lenovo hasn't specified just how wide they are. </p>
<p> Other optional hardware includes a fingerprint reader and a world-facing camera built into the device. But, in either case, the webcam above the display features a privacy shutter. So users can shut the camera off from the world as needed. </p>
<p> In terms of ports, Lenovo included two USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports as well as two more Type-A USB ports. There's an HDMI 2.0 port as well. Connections are handled by a chip intended to support up to Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Powering Chrome OS, with a Chrome Enterprise Upgrade gearing this laptop toward education and businesses, is a powerhouse from AMD. That's up to an AMD Ryzen 7 3700C processor, in fact. The chip is lower in cost but comparable to something in-between Intel's Core i5 and Core i7 series chips. </p>
<p> When will this become available to purchase? </p>
<p> Lenovo hasn't given an exact date for the ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook Enterprise as of this writing. The company states that it will be ready to buy "shortly" but hasn't pinned down a timeframe. As to pricing, models will start out at a reasonable $579. </p>

<p> Mobile Events News / CES / Lenovo Expands ThinkSmart Office Offerings Ahead Of CES 2020 </p>
<p> Lenovo Expands ThinkSmart Office Offerings Ahead Of CES 2020 </p>
<p> Lenovo is expanding its smart office offerings in the lead-up to CES 2020 with a full suite of ThinkSmart-branded solutions to make workplace communication easier. The biggest of the new announcements is likely the introduction of Lenovo ThinkSmart View. Lenovo designed the brand new product to bring conference-room communications and interaction to an individual level — tying in with other Lenovo and Microsoft Teams solutions. </p>
<p> Lenovo also introduced a new solution dubbed ThinkSmart Hub 700, iterating on its conference room lineup to suit large-scale communications. That's in addition to the introduction of Zoom Rooms bundle kits to serve as scaleable solutions for small, medium or large meeting spaces. </p>
<p> Although Lenovo hasn't provided specific details, at least some of those solutions also integrate with ThinkSmart Manager. Intended to bring the solutions together, the Manager serves as a central control point for the standalone devices for IT departments. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo designed ThinkSmart View to make office communications easier with privacy built-in </p>
<p> As noted above, this year's announcements from Lenovo for businesses kick off with the Lenovo ThinkSmart View. The device closely resembles Lenovo's Smart Display but with its speakers offset to the side rather than below its touchscreen. It is also tailor-made to deliver less distracting, more productive business communications and has a deep focus on security, privacy, and business integration. </p>
<p> Lenovo ships ThinkSmart View with an 8-inch touchscreen, set next to a full range speaker with two passive radiators. A built-in camera, and dual mics are part of the build too. Lenovo is equipping the camera with a privacy shutter and the mics can be readily muted at the flip of a switch. Bluetooth allows for a more distraction-free workplace via pairing with headsets, whether in a large open office or at home. </p>
<p> More importantly, the gadget integrates with Microsoft Teams. That means the Google Assistant-enabled device is ready to connect to a PC and the cloud. That means that the device is fully integrated in the workplace. But it also enables primary communications to be more traditionally separated, freeing up the PC and monitor for work to be done. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ThinkSmart Hub 700 </p>
<p> Details on the new Lenovo ThinkSmart Hub 700 are slimmer. The company says that the latest entry serves as a turnkey solution for larger conference spaces. It packs in a moveable display for touch-based control and single-touch meeting starts. That integration also makes content sharing possible via that display panel and integration with Microsoft Teams. </p>
<p> Moreover, the newest entry in the ThinkSmart Hub line packs in Dolby Audio via four speakers. That's matched by four 360-degree microphone arrays for easier command of the audio space in larger areas with more participangs. </p>
<p> Specs </p>
<p> Specifications for the new ThinkSmart View, ThinkPad X1 ANC Bluetooth headset, and other gadgets haven't been provided. However, Lenovo has presented some deeper details about its Smart Tab M10 FHD Plus, set to be bundled with ThinkSmart kits and central to the design of the ThinkSmart View. That gadget is detailed below for those looking for deeper specs. </p>
<p> WiFi: 802.11ac (2×2), Bluetooth BLE 4.2 </p>
<p> Pricing and availability </p>
<p> Lenovo ThinkSmart View is currently expected to become available this month, as per this pre-CES 2020 announcement. It will start out at $349 or buyers can pick it up bundled with a ThinkPad X1 ANC Bluetooth headset for $100 more. </p>
<p> Lenovo expects ThinkSmart Hub 700 to be available in the same timeframe with pricing unspecified but available on request. ThinkSmart Tiny kits and ThinkSmart Manager are available now, following a similar path in terms of the pricing. The former is available via Maverick AV Solutions in the US, Canada and select European and Asian countries. ThinkSmart manager is available from Lenovo with a year's subscription included on select purchases. </p>

<p> Google News / Google Chrome / Lenovo Sacrificing Entry-Level Yoga Chromebook C630 In Favor Of 4K Models [Updated] </p>
<p> Lenovo Sacrificing Entry-Level Yoga Chromebook C630 In Favor Of 4K Models [Updated] </p>
<p> Update: Lenovo has reached out to various sources to clarify that the withdrawn designation for the 1080p variant of its Yoga Chromebook C630 in the US and Canada is temporary and that Chromebook will be back in stock "very soon." </p>
<p> Lenovo seems to be looking to limit the availability of the FHD variants of its Yoga Chromebook C630 in the US and Canada by driving sales of the 4K version by withdrawing the 1080p configuration from those markets. That's based on chat conversations captured by one Reddit user which were picked up by the media, alongside evidence found on Lenovo's official Product Specifications Reference (PSREF) pages. </p>
<p> While the chat informed a user that Lenovo would no longer be selling the more budget-friendly configurations of its premium Chrome OS laptop in the US and Canada, the listing effectively confirms that. On the PSREF site, both models associated with the 1080p display and regions in question — 81JX0004US and 81JX0007UX — are shown in red. The reference provided at the bottom of the listing shows indicates that means they are being withdrawn from the region and will be added to Lenovo's "Withdrawn Products section" in the near future. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The devices are still listed in the two regions as being available with a 4K 3840 x 2160 display configuration and all that entails. The 1080p variant is also set to remain available in other regions where the gadget has launched but will no longer be made available in the US and Canada. </p>
<p> What's behind the decision? </p>
<p> For the time being, there are and will be some FHD Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 laptops still available at various locations — and that will likely remain the case for regional retailers where supplies remain. Best Buy, for example, still has one on sale that doesn't feature the standard backlit keyboard in place on other variants, so this is only affecting direct sales for the time being. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's no clear indication as to why sales would be brought to an end for the two devices either since offering buyers more choice and variety would typically be considered a way to bolster sales. It may be that the Chrome OS gadget simply didn't sell well in the two regions in the now delisted configuration or the OEM may be looking to revamp sales of its 4K variant by removing a product. If the 1080p version is cannibalizing on the sales of the 4K offering, it might make sense to limit the latter's availability. </p>
<p> Lenovo hasn't put forward any reasoning for the move beyond listing the device as "temporarily unavailable" at each region's respective online shop. </p>
<p> What's left? </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What that means for buyers in the US is that they'll only have access to the 4K variation of the device that landed near the beginning of February. That's the most powerful version of the Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 launched so far, touting an eight-generation quad-core Intel Core i5-8250U with a base clock of 1.6GHz and a turbo boost of up to 3.4GHz with a 6MB cache. </p>
<p> Behind the top-tier processor, the gadget also ships with 8GB DDR4 2400MHz memory and storage at 128GB. An Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620 chip for handling visuals is part of that package as well, making the configuration that's still available — starting at $899 — one of the most high-performance Chromebooks at well below the cost of a comparable Pixelbook. </p>
<p> As with its lower-resolution counterpart, that's a 15.6-inch IPS panel on a 2-in-1 platform with a 360-degree hinge. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For battery life, conservative usage will allow for up to 10-hours on a single charge with a full charge taking right around an hour and a half. </p>
<p> A backlit keyboard is standard on the most performance-ready Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 too. Two USB 3.1 Type-C ports, as well as a single USB 3.1 standard USB port, Kensington lock slot, micro SD card reader, and 3.5mm headphone jack, are part of the package alongside two well-tuned stereo speakers can be found on the bottom. That's all packed into an all-metal midnight blue frame. </p>

<p> Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab & Smart Tab M8 Bridge The Smart Home Hub Gap </p>
<p> Lenovo is looking to bridge the gap between Android tablets and smart home hubs with no fewer than two new devices at this year's IFA 2019. Those are the Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab and the Smart Tab M8. Both of the devices in question are, at their heart, Android tablets. Because Lenovo takes advantage of Google Assistant's Ambient Mode, each can also effectively serve as a smart home hub. </p>
<p> Now, there are several similarities between these two tablets. To begin with, each is equipped with dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and Bluetooth 4.2 as well as a SIM slot for LTE connectivity. The latter connective technology is optional on both the Lenovo Smart Tab M8 and Yoga-branded Smart Tab. That's via Nano SIM card in the M8 as compared to the Micro SIM used in the Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab. </p>
<p> Each includes the sensors one would expect in a mobile-compatible device with cameras. Both keep the ever-popular 3.5mm headphone jack too but, minor similarities aside, almost nothing about these devices is the same. From the design to the internal specs, these tablets are intended for entirely different uses well worth a deep dive. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Yoga Smart Tab </p>
<p> Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab </p>
<p> Lenovo's Yoga Smart Tab is the more dramatic of the two in terms of design language and usability features. As its name implies, it'll also to be the more expensive of the two. To begin with, this tablet is equipped with an octa-core Snapdragon 439 SoC. That's four cores at 2 GHz and four more at 1.45 GHz. </p>
<p> 3GB of memory and 32GB storage can be found backing up the processor here in one configuration. Another bumps things up to 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage. Storage is expandable via microSD card up to 256GB. Irrespective of the storage and memory options chosen, Lenovo's tablet is powered by a 7,000mAh battery. Charged via USB Type-C 2.0, that allows for a claimed up to ten hours of battery life with video playback or 11 hours of web browsing. </p>
<p> Where things really get interesting with the Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab is in the exterior design. All of that hardware and a 10.1-inch FHD 10-point multitouch display is packed into a uniquely-shaped Iron Grey shell. That's got an ingress protection rating of IP52 against dust and liquids. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Above the panel, rated at a brightness of 320 nits, an 86-degree wide-angle 5-megapixel fixed-focus camera is included. Lenovo included an 8-megapixel snapper is on the back but it's the lower portion of the frame where things get interesting. That bulges out in a circular shape — when viewed from the side — because of two 2-watt Dobly Atmos-optimized JBL speakers. </p>
<p> Around the back, there's a kickstand. That can be folded in for handheld use or folded out into either a low- or high-angle stand configuration. It can also be folded all the way out so that it's center hold can be used to hang the device up. </p>
<p> The kickstand is where this device really shines. With the push of a button and thanks to three 3 embedded mics allowing for 360-degree far-field voice recognition, this tablet can be put down anywhere and used as a Google Assistant-powered smart display. That includes all of the same functionality that might be expected from a traditional smart display from media playback to smart home control. </p>

<p> Lenovo Smart Tab M8 </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Tab M8 comes packed with similar features to its Yoga-branded counterpart. It does that in a package that's only slightly less capable, at least on paper. </p>
<p> To begin with, it's smart home hub experience is powered by far-field voice recognition with two high-performance MEMS microphones instead of a triple array. It's two Dolby Atmos-optimized speakers are side-mounted and not specified as being built by JBL. </p>
<p> Internally, Lenovo equipped the Smart Tab M8 with a more affordable chipset too. That's the MediaTek A22 Tab processor, a quad-core 2 GHz unit. Backing that up, Lenovo includes 2GB memory and just 16GB or 32GB of storage. The latter metric is expandable via microSD card too but only up to 128GB this time. A 5,000mAh battery drives everything, charged via Micro USB. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All of that is packed under a less impressive 8-inch HD 10-point multitouch display panel with a brightness rating of 350 nits. The front and rear cameras have been scaled back to 2-megapixels and 5-megapixels, respectively. There's no IP rating listed for the hardware. </p>
<p> The biggest difference between the two Lenovo hybrid tablets, however, might be in how they approach the smart hub functionality. The Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab essentially acts as a tablet that can be placed anywhere and used as a smart home hub. Lenovo's Smart Tab M8 has a decidedly more stationary design. </p>
<p> That's because it's smart home capabilities kick in when it's placed on a charging dock that's included in the box. The design decision comparatively reduces the portability of the device since it's going to be inconvenient to lug a charging dock around. So although LTE variants will remain usable outside of the home, it will chiefly work as a tablet with a more standard Google Assistant experience under those circumstances. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Counter to that possible caveat, buyers will have more choices when it comes to the coloration of the device. Lenovo plans to make the Smart Tab M8 available in both Onyx Black and Platinum Grey. </p>
<p> Pricing and availability </p>
<p> Specifics about regional availability for Lenovo's latest Android tablets haven't been provided just yet. But there will be Russia and Japan-specific SKUs for the Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab tablet. That's according to Lenovo's press materials concerning pre-installed applications. </p>
<p> For pricing, Lenovo has kept costs surprisingly low. The most expensive of the two devices, the Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab, will start out at just $249.99. Lenovo plans to begin making units of the more portable gadget available starting at some point this month. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company will take a bit longer preparing the Lenovo Smart Tab M8, with sales set to start around a month later in October. The Smart Tab M8 will be much less expensive at just $119.99, making buying the Lenovo-built hybrid smart home hub and tablet more feasible across a wider audience. </p>

<p> Lenovo "Yoga X" Is An Android Tablet, Auxiliary Display Hybrid </p>
<p> Lenovo may be working on a new Android tablet — the "Yoga X" — that doubles as a hybrid auxiliary display. That's based on a recent leak shared by Evan Blass via his Patreon page, attributed to Android developer Till Kottmann. </p>
<p> The leak in question doesn't give away too many details, only pointing out that the Lenovo "Yoga X" is an 'Android Tablet/Aux Display Hybrid'. Mr. Blass shared that along with a wireframe image of the gadget. The image itself is fairly standard for an Android tablet but with a few noteworthy differences. </p>
<p> It has a relatively run-of-the-mill shape with a thicker top bezel — held in landscape mode — to house a front-facing camera. The bottom bezel is similarly sized but is offset by what appears to be a rounded segment along the bottom. Presumably, that's going to be part of a built-in stand for this device since it's meant to be used as an auxiliary display too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Volume rockers and a power button are tucked along the right-hand edge. Again, that's when held in landscape orientation, with the buttons arranged near the bottom on that edge. </p>
<p> Lenovo is no stranger to hybrid Android tablets </p>
<p> At IFA 2019, Lenovo unveiled the Yoga Smart Tab and this new hybrid Android tablet follows in a similar vein. Namely, that former device serves two purposes, both as a tablet and as a Google Home ecosystem smart home hub. The Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab is similarly shaped too, complete with a rounded segment and a stand. </p>
<p> The key difference here would be that this tablet presumably features some novel input options so that it can be used as an auxiliary display. In all likeliness, that includes either a micro HDMI or HDMI input. But Lenovo could just as easily utilize USB-C for that purpose too. With the proper cables, that would allow any number of devices to link up, from PlayStations and Nintendo Switch consoles to laptops. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Will this ever release and when? </p>
<p> What isn't immediately clear is whether or not this is an older design that Lenovo has since abandoned or if it plans to launch the "Lenovo Yoga X" at some point in the future. Lenovo hasn't revealed any details at all about a device bearing this branding or functionality. Leaks haven't been prevalent either. So it seems likely that this device is still a long way out if it ever releases at all. </p>

<p> Lenovo On The Offensive, Z6 Pro Aims At 100MP Photos </p>
<p> Lenovo’s upcoming flagship, the Z6 Pro, will not only include a 48-megapixel camera on the back, but it will be able to capture 100-megapixel images. This information comes from the company’s Vice President and General Manager, as he shared a couple of images showing the phone’s features. </p>
<p> The device will be fueled by the Snapdragon 855 64-bit octa-core processor, and even a part of the phone’s back side has been shared by the company. As you can see in the provided image down below, the phone will include four cameras on the back, and at the moment, we only know that one of those cameras will be a 48-megapixel sensor, the rest of them are still a mystery. </p>
<p> Those four cameras will be vertically-aligned, as you can see, and three of them will protrude on the back, as one will be separated below them. An LED flash will be placed next to the phone’s cameras, along with a “Hyper Video” branding, which suggests some interesting video-taking capabilities, or at least it seems like it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The device will be made out of metal and glass, and its back side will be curved. The volume up, volume down, and power buttons are located on the right-hand side of the device, which is also shown in an image down below. The phone will probably arrive in a number of color variants, and we get to see some sort of red color here, dark red, which looks quite interesting. </p>
<p> The phone is also rumored to sport a tiny waterdrop notch on the front, and a 90-percent screen-to-body ratio. The Lenovo Z6 Pro will also sport an in-display fingerprint scanner if rumors are to be believed, and that is probably accurate, as the fingerprint scanner is not located on the phone’s back, nor is it included on the side. </p>
<p> One of Lenovo’s executives posted a screenshot of this device’s network icons on Weibo (Chinese social network), and thus pretty much confirmed that the phone will support 5G connectivity. We’re still not sure if Lenovo plans to release both 4G and 5G variants of this device, but we’ll find out soon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The device is also rumored to sport plenty of RAM, up to 12GB, though it remains to be seen how accurate that info is. We do know that this phone will become official on April 23, though, as Lenovo did confirm that recently. The phone will be announced in China, and it remains to be seen where else will it be available, but this handset may become Lenovo’s first global 5G handset at some point, maybe under a different name, though. </p>
<p> If you’re confused by the Z6 Pro branding, well, you’re probably not the only one. At first, it may seem a logical solution for a flagship name due to the “Pro” addition to it, but if you consider that the Lenovo Z5 Pro was a mid-range phone, well… it’s odd. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Z5 Pro was announced back in November last year with the Snapdragon 710 64-bit octa-core processor, and it did sport some rather interesting features, including a pop-up camera, but it was a mid-range device, no doubt about that, so it’s quite strange Lenovo did not opt for a different name for this new device, but there you have it. </p>

<p> Lenovo Z6 Pro Launched With Monstruous Specs, Safe Design </p>
<p> Lenovo has announced its new flagship, the Lenovo Z6 Pro. The company has been teasing this phone for a couple of weeks now, and it’s not finally here, with all the bells and whistles you’d expect out of a modern smartphone. </p>
<p> It’s an eye-catcher, that’s for sure </p>
<p> The phone is made out of metal and glass, as you can see, and its bezels are pretty much non-existent. Lenovo used a 17-layer 3D coating on the gradient back of this phone. The phone’s “chin” is barely there, as it is razor-thin, at least based on the provided renders, while a tiny dewdrop notch is also a part of the package. That notch houses the phone’s front-facing camera, and an earpiece is placed above it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All the physical keys sit on the right-hand side of this phone, while the device’s back side is curved, as on pretty much every flagship out there. This handset includes four cameras on the back, and we’ll talk about them in a minute. Those four cameras are vertically aligned, though only three of them protrude on the back. An LED flash is also included here, in case you were wondering. </p>
<p> It is also worth noting that this phone does include a 3.5mm headphone jack, and that port is placed at the bottom of the phone, along with a Type-C USB port, and the phone’s loudspeaker. Speaking of audio, the device does include Dolby Atmos support. </p>
<p> A beast in the spec department </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Lenovo Z6 Pro is fueled by the Snapdragon 855 64-bit octa-core processor, Qualcomm’s most powerful mobile chip. The phone also includes liquid cooling with 5mm reinforced copper tube and a larger heat dissipation area. </p>
<p> In addition to the Snapdragon 855, Lenovo includes 6GB, 8GB, and 12GB of RAM in this phone, depending on what variant you opt to get. The 6GB and 8GB RAM models are available with 128GB and 256GB of storage, while the 12GB option comes with 512GB of storage. All variants support microSD expansion up to 512GB. </p>
<p> The phone features a 6.39-inch fullHD+ (2340 x 1080) AMOLED display, with HDR10 and DCI-P3 support. Android 9 Pie comes pre-installed on the phone, along with ZUI 11 Android overlay, while a 4,000mAh battery is included in the package as well. That battery supports 27W fast wired charging, and Lenovo claims that you can get two hours of gaming out of this phone with only 15 minutes of charging. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> 48-megapixel (f/1.8 aperture, PDAF), 16-megapixel (125-degree wide-angle lens, f/2.2 aperture), 8-megapixel (telephoto camera, f/2.4 aperture), and 2-megapixel (“Super Video” camera, f/1.8 aperture, 2.9um pixel size, OIS) are included on the back of this phone, along with a ToF (Time of Flight) sensor) A 32-megapixel camera (f/2.0 aperture) sits on the phone’s front side, while this device comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner. To be more precise, it includes a sixth-generation in-display fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Two SIM card slots are also a part of the Lenovo Z6 Pro, and we’re looking at a hybrid setup here with two nano SIM card slots, one of which can be used for storage expansion purposes. The phone measures 157.5 x 74.6 x 8.65mm, and weighs 185 grams. </p>
<p> It’s more affordable than most of the competition </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Lenovo Z6 Pro has been announced in Black and Blue color variants. The phone’s 6GB RAM model with 128GB of storage is priced at 2,899 Yuan ($430) in China. The 8GB RAM model with 128GB of storage costs 2,999 Yuan ($446), while a variant with the same amount of RAM and 256GB of storage is priced at 3,799 Yuan ($565). </p>
<p> The most powerful Lenovo Z6 Pro model with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage costs 4,999 Yuan ($744). The phone will go on sale in China from April 29, while Lenovo still did not release any info regarding its global availability. </p>

<p> Lenovo Z6 Coming This Month With A Gimmicky Camera </p>
<p> Chinese tech firm Lenovo recently announced that it will officially launch its upcoming flagship smartphone, the Lenovo Z6 Pro, in an event that will take place in Beijing on April 23. The company previously showed off the handset at Mobile World Congress in late February, although it only provided limited information about the device itself. </p>
<p> However, recent teasers from the handset maker supplied details about some of the key selling points of the Lenovo Z6 Pro. According to the firm, the smartphone will feature the Snapdragon 855 chipset from Qualcomm. While this processor puts the Z6 Pro at par with other flagship smartphones from rival manufacturers, using the most powerful SoC available from Qualcomm suggests a massive boost in performance compared to the Z5 Pro that Lenovo launched late last year. Despite the similarity in the names of the two devices, the Z5 Pro targeted the upper mid-range smartphone market and featured the mid-tier Snapdragon 710 chipset. </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 855 chipset also allows the Lenovo Z6 Pro to feature 5G connectivity, with the inclusion of the Snapdragon X50 modem. However, like other manufacturers, it is possible that Lenovo may launch a non-5G model of the handset, which may sell at a cheaper price point. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo also detailed the camera features of the Z6 Pro. One of them, called the HyperVision camera feature, may allow the handset to capture images with a resolution of 100-megapixels. It is not yet clear how the smartphone can shoot 100-megapixel photographs, although it is possible that the device may use software algorithms rather than specialized image sensors to achieve this effect. </p>
<p> Moreover, the camera of the Z6 Pro also offers features like night mode, image stabilization, and super slow-motion video recording, and it is likely that one of the imaging modules of the smartphone ships with an ultra-wide-angle lens. Meanwhile, the Hyper Video functionality allows for faster transmission of video, likely over 5G networks. </p>
<p> Lenovo also showed off an image of the handset’s rear panel, which revealed that the camera of the handset is located at the upper left corner of the back panel and beside the shooter is the LED flash. The image provided by the handset maker further confirms that the Z6 Pro will not be a rebrand of the Z5 Pro GT that the company announced in December 2018. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Aside from the features already detailed by Lenovo in earlier teasers, recent teasers show that the Z6 Pro will feature wireless charging. Given the design of its predecessor, it is likely that the Z6 Pro will feature a display with no bezels, notch, or display cutouts. To achieve this design, the smartphone may use a sliding mechanism that holds the front-facing camera, and the device may also feature an in-display fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> More information about the specifications, pricing, and availability of the handset will become available as Lenovo officially launches the Z6 Pro on April 23. It is interesting to see if Lenovo will offer 5G and non-5G variants of the device, given that not all consumers will have access to 5G networks in the foreseeable future. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / LG Adds Support To Its TVs For Gaming-Driven NVIDIA 30 Series GPUs </p>
<p> LG Adds Support To Its TVs For Gaming-Driven NVIDIA 30 Series GPUs </p>
<p> LG and NVIDIA are making history within the gaming industry today. Earlier this morning NVIDIA announced its new 30 series GPUs. </p>
<p> Which bring some truly advanced performance and features to PC gaming. LG followed that up by announcing that its 2020 lineup of 8K OLED TVs (which are already great for gaming) will support the NVIDIA 30 series GPUs. </p>
<p> Obviously, to make the most of this new support, you'll need a new 30 series GPU. You'll also need one of the TVs that support them. LG says that all of its 8K OLED TVs have this support. So you'll have a few options. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That being said, LG's 8K OLED TVs are a bit pricey. The good news is that the 30 series GPU are a little less pricey. Especially when you compare them to the costs of the 20 series in addition to how much of an improvement the 30 series cards are. </p>
<p> In short, it should be an investment that's worth it if you love gaming. </p>
<p> LG 8K gaming will probably require a 3090 GPU from NVIDIA </p>
<p> Though you can certainly get into the 30 series cards for $499, the price of the GeForce RTX 3070 GPU, 8K gaming is probably going to require better performance. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Which means you'd need the GeForce RTX 3090 GPU to support the kind of power that an 8K game would need. On top of that you'll need plenty of RAM. So pairing that all together isn't going to be a super affordable purchase when you factor in the costs of LG's latest TVs. </p>
<p> Still, if you have the money to build a beast of a PC with all of this hardware, an LG 8K OLED TV seems like it might be the way to go. </p>
<p> Support will reach its full potential later this year </p>
<p> Once you've got one of these new TVs and a 30 series GPU in-hand, you can set everything up right away. Then start enjoying the benefits of the performance upgrade that NVIDIA's new cards will offer. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Such as G-Sync support, Variable Refresh Rate, ultra-fast response rate, and Auto Low Latency Mode. The full potential of LG's added 30 series GPU support though is coming later this year. Because features like HDMI Display Stream Compression will be available through a firmware update. And LG says that's coming later in 2020. </p>
<p> It doesn't mention when, but there are only four months left in the year. So the wait won't be that long to begin with. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2020/08/lg-flexible-display-real-world-sid-2020.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485333" filename="lg-flexible-display-real-world-sid-2020.html">
<p> LG Unrolls Real-World-Geared Flexible Display Ambitions At SID 2020 </p>
<p> LG Display, the company's display unit, is at the SID 2020 conference with no fewer than four flexible display concepts. That includes full- and medium-sized panels that unroll and stretch. But it reportedly also includes transparent displays and new takes on how folding screens might be used. </p>
<p> Now, not every concept on display is new. In fact, it could easily be argued that none of them are. LG has touted unrolling flexible television panels for years. The same can be said of its transparent display panels. And folding displays are already a hot item in the mobile world at the very least. But the new designs are all very clearly aimed at pushing the industry directly forward. </p>
<p> What is LG showing off at SID 2020? </p>
<p> Some of the best LG flexible display-related technology at this year's SID 2020 event is seen in the "Unlimited Design Freedom Zone," LG's future-forward segment. As noted above, that's not all entirely new. But the company is showing off a newly-updated version of its rollable TVs, this time in a 65-inch form factor. That rolls down from a box that's presumably mounted on the consumer's wall. And it can roll back out to get it out of the way when it's not needed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That same technology is being used in a much smaller, 12-inch panel too. That's because LG is looking to push the new flexible display tech shown at SID 2020 into a much wider diversity of use cases. For instance, the smaller panels could be put on in-car infotainment offerings or included as part of a professional desktop setup. </p>
<p> Next up, transparent displays are nothing new for LG either. But the company is now reportedly looking more closely at real-world usability for the technology. That includes everything from smart mirrors and windows to furniture. For instance, the panels could be placed instead of glass on a wardrobe or hutch. </p>
<p> Last but not least, LG showcased a 13.3-inch foldable laptop-tablet hybrid. The dual-use device follows a similar vein to current folding smartphones but scales everything up to a size and design that would be better suited for productivity or other applications. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Will any of these concepts come to the real-world market? </p>
<p> SID 2020 serves as a great place to showcase new concepts centered around display technologies and designs. But, in this case, it may be safe to say these designs are more likely than others to crop up in real-world products. As noted above, LG has already made quite a lot of headway in terms of showcasing the technology in a plethora of products. So this is obviously something it is pouring significant time and resources into. </p>
<p> With that said, these are still effectively concept showcases. And that means that the news should be taken with a grain of salt. Because LG may decide never to release any of this for buyers to pick up. </p>

<p> Tech News / IOT News / LG Innotek Unveils World's Smallest Bluetooth Module, Aimed At IoT </p>
<p> LG Innotek Unveils World's Smallest Bluetooth Module, Aimed At IoT </p>
<p> LG Innotek has announced a new Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module for IoT that also happens to be the smallest ever made. Measuring 6mm x 4mm, the new module measures in at just 75-percent of the size of the previous model. </p>
<p> Despite the reduction in size, the component OEM notes that the new chip actually boasts a 30-percent increase in performance over existing products. The significant improvement is the result of the company's differentiated RF signal design technology. Because of that technology, LG was able to pack more than 20 components into the diminutive space. That includes communication chips, resistors, inductors, and more. </p>
<p> Perhaps more importantly, LG Innotek claims that the reduction in size actually eliminates signal interference too. Even with obstacles between a smartphone and the IoT device, communication performance improvements hold. That means less signal degradation for end-users. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company's integrated technology helps on that front too. Typically, OEMs place the antenna outside of the module. Here, LG designed the antenna to cover the module itself. So the area covered and communication performance are maximized. </p>
<p> This new module will bolster LG's position in the IoT market </p>
<p> As hinted above, this module isn't designed for smartphones themselves though. Instead, LG Innotek says that it plans to piggyback on this innovation. Specifically, in a bid to accelerate its "foray into the global IoT communication module market." </p>
<p> In fact, LG Innotek claims that its plan is to "quickly dominate" that market. And it's promoting the new chip to that end in Europe, the US, Japan, China, and Taiwan to that end. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The chip utilizes low-power technology to enable more room for developers and manufacturers to work with across the board. That's from smart lighting, home audio, and healthcare, all the way through to automobiles and combination Wi-Fi Bluetooth modules in home appliances. </p>
<p> This isn't the first time LG Innotek has been at the forefront of bleeding-edge technology </p>
<p> This LG division is no stranger to pushing the boundaries on bleeding-edge technology. From cutting-edge camera technology to IoT, the company has historically taken an aggressive approach to technology advancement. So it's not entirely surprising LG Innotek has managed to create the world's smallest Bluetooth LE IoT module. </p>

<p> LG K31 Gives The Low-End US Budget Smartphone Market A Boost </p>
<p> LG has a new device dubbed the K31, available for just $119, and built around a moderately-sized 5.78-inch display panel, reports say. That's a capable but not brilliant HD+ touchscreen, rated at a resolution of 720 x 1,520. And the cameras aren't necessarily going to be best in class either. The dual-array system is comprised of a 13-megapixel primary lens and a 5-megapixel wide-angle shooter. </p>
<p> Around the front, there's a droplet-style notch with a 5-megapixel selfie camera. </p>
<p> None of that means this won't be a great device in its bracket either though. For instance, LG ensured that the LG K31 is MIL-STD 810G compliant. And that means this will actually be one of the most rugged gadgets in its segment, with ample drop and shock protection. There's a 3.5mm headphone jack as well. And that's further accented by the inclusion of a dedicated Google Assistant key in the edge — accompanying the usual volume and power keys. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Last but not least, this will be one of the few handsets in its price range to offer a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. That's a capacitive scanner rather than the latest tech. But it's something that a significant number of smartphones at this price simply don't offer. </p>
<p> LG K31 is a straightforward budget handset with budget specs </p>
<p> In terms of under-the-hood power and other specs, LG K31 is a device that matches its pricing. It's powered by a MediaTek SoC, for starters. That's not necessarily a bad thing since the MediaTek Helio P22 should prove a capable chipset. Even if it is backed by just 2GB RAM and 17GB of usable storage from its 32GB storage overall. </p>
<p> There's no mention on the site or at retailers of any microSD card support either. So this really will be a phone best used by those just getting starting with phones. Or for those who need a burner device for whatever reason. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course, the 3,000mAh battery should also be more than usable since this phone won't be running the most intensive apps. So users who really need something that doesn't cost a lot should have a good experience on that front. And here, that's charged via micro-USB rather than the now-almost-ubiquitous USB-C. </p>
<p> Availability </p>
<p> Now, the LG K31 can be found online unlocked or bought directly from Spectrum Mobile outright for $119. With the latter MVNO, users can also snag the gadget for pocket change. The carrier is offering the gadget for just $5 per month over the course of 24 months. There, it's available in just one color. That's silver, in a design that harkens back to older LGs rather than stepping toward its latest design language. </p>

<p> Upcoming LG K52 With Punch-hole Display Spotted In Leaked Render </p>
<p> Last month, LG launched the entry-level LG K31 smartphone for $149.99 in the US. The company also seems to be working on even more budget smartphones under the K-series. The newly leaked press render shows the unannounced LG K52 smartphone in Blue and White color options. </p>
<p> The purported render comes from Evan Blass. Apart from showcasing the phone in two color options, no information is revealed about the LG K52 smartphone. While the Blue color LG K52 comes with a matching frame, the White color variant features a chrome frame. </p>
<p> Leaked render offers first look at the LG K52 smartphone </p>
<p> The LG K52 name first popped up when the company trademarked a bunch of LG K-series smartphones in November last year. From the render, the device is confirmed to sport a punch-hole display. The LG Q70 launched by Verizon in the US is the first smartphone from the company to come with a punch-hole display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Speaking of the LG K52, it might come with a polycarbonate body to keep the costs low. It will most likely be running on Android 10 out of the box with the custom LG UX UI on the top. On the rear, it comes with a large rectangular camera modular placed on the top left corner. </p>
<p> Comes with a quad-camera setup on the rear </p>
<p> From the render, the device looks to feature a quad-camera setup on the rear along with a huge LED flash. While the power button is placed on the right edge, the volume rocker can be spotted on the left edge. The curved edges on the rear should make the device comfortable to hold. </p>
<p> As seen on the other K-series smartphones, the upcoming K52 might also come with a Mediatek chipset. However, the Snapdragon chipset will make it a competitive offering in its price range. There is no information about the RAM and storage options of this device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> From the date mentioned on the screen, the company should be making an official announcement very soon. Just last week, LG launched its most affordable 5G smartphone in the form of LG Q92 5G. It comes packed with Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G 5G Mobile Platform, which also powers the LG Velvet 5G. </p>
<p> The LG Q92 5G is currently available in its home country South Korea. As seen on the leaked LG K52 render, the Q92 5G also sports a punch-hole display. The variant with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage is priced at KRW 4,00,000 (approx. $337). </p>

<p> LG Wing Kills The Headphone Jack, But Not Really… </p>
<p> LG has announced its new, odd smartphone today, the LG Wing. That is probably the oddest smartphone LG announced in the last 5 years, and maybe ever. We’ve talked about the LG Wing extensively already, and are here to focus on one thing, the headphone jack. </p>
<p> So, the LG Wing has a headphone jack? Well, no, it does not. LG users are used to headphone jacks at this point, so this may come as a shock. Does this mean that LG is planning to ditch headphone jacks altogether? Well, that would be yet another no. </p>
<p> The company is planning to keep including headphone jacks on its devices, at least for the time being. The LG Wing is an exception. This is a new form factor, and the company had to make some compromises along the way. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The LG Wing does not include a headphone jack because of the battery </p>
<p> If you’re wondering why the headphone jack is not included, well… LG needed more space for the battery here. As you probably already know, the LG Wing has two displays, and one of them is huge. </p>
<p> The main panel on the device measures 6.8 inches. In other words, the company wanted to include a decently-sized battery inside this phone, and it included a 4,000mAh unit. In order to do that, though, LG needed to make more space inside the device, hence the removal of the headphone jack. </p>
<p> So, just to be clear, upcoming LG phones, at least the ones that are expected to launch this year and in the near future, will have a headphone jack. The LG Wing is just an exception, and you can’t really blame LG on this one. The LG Wing is the first-of-a-kind smartphone, and there have to be some changes to its design. This new form factor required LG to make a slightly different approach. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Better battery life is probably a good reason for the removal of the headphone jack, right? </p>
<p> We’re sure that the LG Wing users will appreciate the larger battery inside the phone. What good are two displays if your smartphone plans on dying in the middle of the day, right? Well, that’s probably what LG was thinking when putting this phone together. The LG Wing still has a Type-C USB port that you can plug a dongle in, or you can simply use wireless headphones, which is what more and more people are doing anyway. </p>
<p> LG has been one of the main forces fighting the removal of the headphone jack from smartphones. While Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus, Apple… and other main players in the industry did it, LG said no, and kept the headphone jack. As already mentioned, LG users are used to it at this point, and LG has also been one of the companies that have been putting more focus on the audio department in general over the years. The LG V series devices were regularly phones with the best DACs in the industry, so it’s no wonder LG decided to keep the headphone jack intact. </p>
<p> The company is still focused on the audio experience, of course, but not as much as it was before. That is understandable when it comes to the LG Wing, though, this is not supposed to be an audio-focused device, at all. It will be interesting to see how many people will be interested in buying this smartphone. It is a new type of a device altogether, and an odd one at that. </p>

<p> Android News / LG Might Not Launch Smartphone With The Flagship Snapdragon 875 SoC </p>
<p> LG Might Not Launch Smartphone With The Flagship Snapdragon 875 SoC </p>
<p> LG might altogether skip launching the smartphone with the upcoming Snapdragon 875 SoC in 2021, according to a new report. The company skipped launching the flagship G-series smartphone in the first half of 2020. Instead, it launched the LG V60 ThinQ powered by the flagship Snapdragon 865 SoC. </p>
<p> Looks like it will be the only flagship smartphone from LG this year. As per the source, the company hasn't placed an order for the next-gen flagship chipset from Qualcomm. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 875 SoC will be unveiled in the first week of December as the successor to the current-gen Snapdragon 865. </p>
<p> LG to skip using the upcoming Snapdragon 875 SoC </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 875-powered smartphones from brands like Samsung and Xiaomi will be hitting the markets in the first quarter of 2021. Instead of launching a flagship smartphone, LG might be eyeing a new mid-range smartphone as the successor to the LG Velvet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> LG even placed a large order for the Snapdragon 775 SoC. To date, Qualcomm hasn't revealed any details about this new mid-range chipset. Likely, it will be the successor to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G. LG Velvet, the most popular LG smartphone launched in 2020, comes powered by the Snapdragon 765G SoC. </p>
<p> The company even used the same mid-range chipset in LG Wing, the world's first 5G swivel smartphone. With flagship smartphones starting at over $1,000, LG is targetting the sub $600 segment. At $599, LG Velvet is one of the best mid-range smartphones. </p>
<p> No flagship smartphone from LG in 2021? </p>
<p> Unlike the competition, LG Velvet comes with a premium-looking design and flagship-grade build quality. Moreover, the device also supports 5G making it future-proof. In 2021, the successor to the LG Velvet is rumored to feature the unannounced Snapdragon 775 SoC. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 7-series chipsets are very much capable of offering a smooth experience for most of the users. While 2020 marked the end of the flagship G-series, there could be no new V-series from LG starting 2021. </p>
<p> However, there will be more concept smartphones coming from LG under its newly announced "Explore Project." While LG Wing is the first product under this project, the company also teased the second product to come with an extendable display. Meanwhile, the company should continue launching decent mid-range 5G smartphones to increase its market share. </p>
<p> The recent reports revealed the company's global smartphone market share to be less than 1 percent. As per the company's shift in strategy, the mid-range smartphones will likely be the key for the company to have any competitive edge. </p>

<p> LG Officially Introduces PuriCare Wearable Air Purifier Face Mask </p>
<p> Basking an opportunity, LG has officially announced its portable battery-powered air purifier mask. It is called LG PuriCare wearable air purifier Face mask. </p>
<p> This LG PuriCare wearable air purifier face mask uses a pair of replaceable H13 HEPA filters air filters and has three-speed fans. The product uses a similar air filter as seen in other LG's air purifier products. </p>
<p> Moreover, the recent coronavirus pandemic situation has given rise to the use of a face mask. And this seems to a perfect scenario to grab the opportunity. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, the company mentioned nothing related to COVID-19 while introducing the LG PuriCare wearable air purifier face mask. But, let's face it, it heavily implies that the product is a response to the current situation. </p>
<p> What the company has stated is that it is made to replace the home-worn masks which some people wear. Besides, it has been build as an alternative to disposable masks. </p>
<p> The air purifier mask can fit in your face just like a normal mask. In fact, it has been designed in a way that it can be worn on the face for long hours. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The LG PuriCare wearable air purifier face mask alerts users to replace the filters </p>
<p> Well, talk about smart, this LG PuriCare wearable air purifier face mask comes with a case. The case comes with ultraviolet LED lights meant to purify the mask. Moreover, this alerts the users to replace the filters when needed to maintain proper hygiene. </p>
<p> The air mask comes with an 820 mAh battery, which is touted to last up to 8 hours. There are two modes to operate the mask, i.e. Low mode and High mode. </p>
<p> Basically, if you set the LG PuriCare mask on low mode, it will give you a runtime of 8 hours. While when setting in high mode, the runtime goes down to 2 hours. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The LG face mask has a built-in "respiratory sensor" that will detect how fast your breath. It also detects its volume and based on that adjusts the fan speed. </p>
<p> As already mentioned, LG has refrained from using COVID-19 or anything related to it during the launch. So, there are still some doubts about whether this product can be used in the current situation or not. </p>
<p> If you are interested in getting one LG PuriCare mask, then we have sad news. LG did not reveal a release date for this product and also did not mention the price at which it will be launched. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, one thing is clear that this LG PuriCare wearable air purifier face mask will be available to buy in Q4 of 2020 in select markets. </p>

<p> LG Q92 5G Specs Leak In Almost Full Detail From Google Play Console </p>
<p> Specs of an upcoming LG mid-range handset dubbed the Q92 5G may no longer be a mystery since details about the device are now the subject of a leak via the Google Play Console. The console is typically used by developers for publishing apps and games. But in this case, it reveals nearly complete specs for the unreleased gadget as well as one image. </p>
<p> The image only shows the front of the device, which features somewhat oversized bezels. Those aren't uniform either, with the top and 'chin' bezels being slightly wider. There's also a punch-hole camera. LG set that dead-center at the top for this design. </p>
<p> There's also an indentation in one of the edges, possibly housing the power button and a fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So what are the LG Q92 5G specs this reveals? </p>
<p> The first spec worth noting seems to confirm previous trademarks from LG. And it's fairly obvious from the branding too. This phone will have 5G support out-of-the-box. </p>
<p> Those trademarks were listed as for an LG Q92 5G, shown with model designation "LM-Q920N_128G." The model designation there matches the one here too. The Google Play Console lists the device as "LM-Q920N." The "128G" in the trademark listing was and is expected to indicate the phone will have 128GB storage. </p>
<p> Setting that aside, there's quite a lot to learn about specs from this leak of the LG Q92 5G too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> First, LG has packed the device in question with 6GB RAM. That's backing up a capable Snapdragon 765G processor running Android 10. Qualcomm's Adreno 620 GPU is in use behind that, handling graphics. </p>
<p> So, aside from RAM, this phone almost aligns with the LG Velvet. Or at least it does on everything but the screen, based on what's known so far. </p>
<p> Based on the screen resolution and pixel density shown, that's expected to come in at right around 6-inches. Resolution is listed at Full HD+ (2400 x 1080), with a pixel density of 420 pixels-per-inch. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This should arrive sooner than later </p>
<p> The combination of this new LG device leaking via the Google Play Console, trademarks, and certifications seems to indicate that it will arrive soon. Or, at the very least, be announced officially in the near future. </p>

<p> LG Q92 5G Specs & Images Leak, May Launch Later This Month </p>
<p> LG is preparing to launch a new affordable 5G smartphone called LG Q92 5G soon. A Google Play Console listing last month revealed a lot about this handset. Now, ahead of an impending launch, more details about it have surfaced on the Korean social media platform Naver Cafe. The new leak also includes an image of the new LG smartphone, revealing its design and color options. </p>
<p> The poster, which was first spotted by MySmartPrice, reveals the LG Q92 5G's mid-range specs. The handset features a big 6.7-inch Full HD+ punch-hole display of 2400 x 1080 pixels resolution. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, coupled with Adreno 620 GPU, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. The device reportedly features an overclocked version of this powerful mid-range SoC, offering a ten percent increase in graphics performance. </p>
<p> The LG Q92 5G gets a quad-camera array on the back in a quite unusual setup. The four cameras include a 48-megapixel primary camera, 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, 5-megapixel depth sensor, and a 2-megapixel portrait camera. The punch-hole cutout on the display houses a 32-megapixel front-facing camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A 4,000 mAh battery fuels this device with LG promising fast charging support to quickly replenish battery juice. The LG Q92 5G is MIL-STD 810G compliant, so it should comfortably survive some dust and occasional water splashes. </p>
<p> LG has included a side-mounted fingerprint sensor on this device. The poster also mentions LG Pay, so NFC support appears likely. The device gets AI-powered dual stereo speakers. The LG Q92 5G has dimensions of 166.54 x 77.3 x 8.49 mm and weighs 193 grams. It will run Android 10 at launch. </p>
<p> The latest LG Q92 5G leak shows the device in three shiny colors, white, blue, and red. The device looks tall with rounded corners and quite thick bezels around the display, particularly at the top and the bottom. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> LG may launch the Q92 5G later this month </p>
<p> LG has yet to announce a launch date for the Q92 5G. However, with the device starting to appear online more frequently, we suspect an official introduction may not be too far off. </p>
<p> Rumors have it that the South Korean company will announce its new affordable 5G smartphone next Friday, on August 21. The device will be available to preorder in the domestic market starting that day, with general sales beginning a week later on August 28. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As for its pricing, the phone will reportedly sell in South Korea for a retail price of KRW 545,000 (roughly $460). That price tag will make it a nice proposition if LG launches this device in the US. We'll have to wait for confirmation on that. </p>

<p> Upcoming LG Rollable Smartphone Envisioned By Concept Designer </p>
<p> A concept designer has envisioned a rollable smartphone that LG is planning to launch. As some of you know by now, LG is planning to release a rollable smartphone in H1 2021. </p>
<p> The company teased this smartphone during the LG Wing announcement, a couple of days ago. Before that happened, a well-known display analyst said that the phone will launch in H1 2021. </p>
<p> This concept shows a rollable smartphone from LG, following a teaser the company released </p>
<p> That being said, this concept design comes from Ben Geskin. He shared it via Twitter, as a reaction to LG’s teaser. He posted a single image, which shows the device in both rolled out, and regular state. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When the display is not rolled out, the phone looks like a regular smartphone, When it is, you get a tablet, essentially. Now, the real-life rollable smartphone from LG probably won’t have a display that extends to double its size. That’s just a guess, though. </p>
<p> This concept design shows a phone that contains a display camera hole. That hole is pill-shaped, and it hosts two selfie cameras. The phone does include a curved display, and it extends to the right. </p>
<p> The bezels on this concept device are quite thin. The real-life handset will probably have thin bezels as well. We’re also expecting to see a large display on this phone, even when it’s not rolled out. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You’ll notice that all the phone’s physical buttons are placed on the right. The volume up and down buttons sit above the power / lock key. They do seem angled towards the back, as the phone’s display is curved quite a bit. </p>
<p> A real product may look considerably different </p>
<p> The real-life smartphone may look considerably different than this, by the way. This is not a leak or anything of the sort. The designer just got inspired, probably be some design patents and whatnot. </p>
<p> The LG Wing basically ushered in a new form factor for smartphones. It comes with two displays, but you can swivel the first one, to reveal the second one. That way you can watch a YouTube video on the first one, in a landscape mode, while typing comments on the vertical one. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This phone does open possibilities for some interesting use cases, and some people seem to be interested. Others are very negative towards it. It remains to be seen how many units will LG be able to sell. </p>
<p> This rollable smartphone that LG is expected to announce will become the world’s first rollable smartphone. We doubt someone will release such a device before LG, but we’ll see. </p>

<p> LG Teased Its Rollable Smartphone, And You Probably Missed It </p>
<p> LG teased its upcoming smartphone with a rollable display, and you probably missed it. This happened during the LG Wing announcement yesterday, actually. </p>
<p> LG teased its first smartphone with rollable display via a short video clip </p>
<p> This teaser was spotted by a Twitter user, who shared a short clip of it. It’s included below this paragraph, and if you take a look at it, it’ll be obvious what LG is teasing here. As you can see, a display pulls out of the phone’s body here, even though it’s very subtle. </p>
<p> This is quite probably the company’s second ‘Explorer Device’. LG launched its Explorer program with the LG Wing, and it already seems to be teasing the second device that will be a part of that program. </p>
<p> The whole point of this program is to innovate, release new devices with new form factors, and so on. This rollable device is not unexpected, as we’ve already seen several patents that LG submitted over time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A well-known analyst, Ross Young, did say that the company’s first rollable smartphone is coming in H1 2021. Therefore, we won’t have to wait that long to see this phone. </p>
<p> This handset is allegedly codenamed ‘Project B’ </p>
<p> LG’s rollable smartphone is allegedly codenamed ‘Project B’, by the way. The phone will feature a display made by BOE, and it will be an OLED display. Speaking of which, the LG Wing display was also made by BOE, according to Mr. Young. </p>
<p> LG’s first rollable display is expected to expand from 6.8 to 7.4-inches, if rumors are to be believed. We do not know what exactly will the device look at, though, at least not yet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Considering that this phone is expected to arrive in the first half of next year, we’ll probably see some leaks in the coming months. LG seems to be back to its old ways, innovation, and odd-looking devices. </p>
<p> That’s certainly not a bad thing. The initial reactions to the LG Wing seem to be positive, and more such devices certainly couldn’t hurt the industry. We need more phones that will excite us, not just regular old slabs of glass and metal. </p>
<p> The LG Wing certainly is one such phone, which comes with two displays, and the first one swivels. You can essentially use that large display in a landscape form, while the bottom one remains in a vertical form. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are a number of different use cases for such displays, and we do believe that LG will come up with many more. It will be interesting to see how well will the LG Wing sell, but as already mentioned, the initial reactions are quite positive. </p>

<p> Android News / Android Phones / LG Stylo 6 Review – A Stylus-Enhanced Budget Phone That's Not For Everybody </p>
<p> LG Stylo 6 Review – A Stylus-Enhanced Budget Phone That's Not For Everybody </p>
<p> LG's Stylo 6 is a great device for those who want a stylus and a big screen with a great design but isn't going to be for everybody. </p>
<p> Thicker-than-average, uneven bezels steal from the premium build </p>
<p> Software and features are rich but bloated </p>
<p> General performance is inconsistent, obnoxious </p>
<p> This battery dies far too quickly for its size and the components it powers </p>
<p> Inconsistent Camera </p>
<p> Placing the LG Stylo 6 under the microscope of review reveals a smartphone that's equal parts enjoyable and budget-minded. </p>
<p> It doesn't have the best camera in its bracket. Despite being positioned as a stylus-touting budget answer to top-dollar smartphones, its stylus isn't quite the marvel found in Samsung's Galaxy Note series. The overall performance of this handset can, under the strain of multitasking or heavy apps, leave a lot to be desired. And its battery life is, summarily, mediocre at best. </p>
<p> Priced at just under $220, this handset brings plenty of caveats with it to the table. And not all of those are going to be firmware fixable. With that said, this phone is also far from being the worst available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> LG's design language with the Stylo 6 is top-notch, despite being built of plastics. The frame-housed stylus is beyond usable, with hand-rejection that worked almost perfectly in testing. While the camera sensor here is only rated at 13-megapixels, it performs admirably under the right circumstances. </p>
<p> For features, this phone is absolutely loaded compared to other devices that are similarly priced. Those are presented to the user via a display that doesn't outperform but certainly doesn't underperform either. And the battery charges up more quickly than most other devices I've tested in the price bracket. </p>
<p> So let's take a closer look at where this phone stands up to hold its own and where it all falls apart. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> LG's Stylo 6 hardware highlights confusing decisions packed under a laudable design </p>
<p> Now, we could discuss at length the fact that the LG Stylo 6 does not have the best hardware on the market. It's a budget-friendly device that feels like plastic because it is. And it comes with a stylus that embeds in the frame but that's made of very cheap metal. </p>
<p> More importantly, the LG Stylo 6 stylus, much to my annoyance throughout my review, is embedded via a spring-loaded mechanism. It doesn't quite sit flush. But that's a topic we'll cover later on. </p>
<p> In fact, that's going to be my biggest hardware-related complaint by far. The stylus is too easy to get out by accident but not at all easy to get back in. The latter problem is because it locks into place and only goes in one way but rotates freely. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In terms of aesthetics, though, this phone is absolutely gorgeous. LG sent the White variant of its device for review. But it's also available in other colors such as Mirror Black and Titan Gray. The White hue is incredibly similar to the white utilized for Samsung's Galaxy Note 10+. It delivers an incandescent glow that shifts almost like a holograph with shifts in light, offset by a flat white on the rear-facing fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> That latter component is accented by a modern-looking horizontal three-camera array. </p>
<p> The edges have a silvery sheen and are smooth to the touch. So, aside from feeling plasticky, it has a great in-hand feel too. And the plastics serve to make this device harder to outright crack and break — although scratches are more likely. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In fact, the in-hand feel is one of the redeeming graces of this phone's hardware. It doesn't look or feel too cheap, even if it is made of plastic. The buttons, ports, and speaker grille are smooth, with no sharp edges to be found. And the ports fit snugly, snapping into place with a click that all but guarantees long life. </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner here is easily among the slowest I've ever laid hands on though. That could come down to how slow this phone is to turn on and operate smoothly but, again, that's another topic we'll cover momentarily. It's obnoxious how slowly the fingerprint scanner works, taking what feels like more than a second to unlock — slower than just entering a PIN in some cases. </p>
<p> This display is wonderful for the price but not the bezels </p>
<p> The display on the LG Stylo 6 performed well beyond what could be called "adequate" throughout my review. That's with the exceptions we'll cover in the performance segment below. But, summarily, that comes down to the fact that it's a 6.8-inch Full HD+ display at 2460 x 1080 pixels. So the pixel density is actually quite good. Albeit not as good as it possibly could be for the price. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On a partly cloudy day, indoors, or under other optimal viewing conditions, it's also plenty bright. When performance doesn't dip, the display exceptionally responsive and enjoyable to interact with. </p>
<p> The waterdrop notch used by the company will serve as a pain point for some but didn't show any issues during my test. In fact, it surprisingly didn't show any pixel darkening either, which has been a common problem around punch holes and notches in some other handsets. Particularly in this price range. But there are a couple of "but"s here too. </p>
<p> To begin with, when performance dips, this phone's screen becomes all but unusable. In those cases, it can sometimes fail to respond at all. And the bezels surrounding the panel are unusually thick. So much so that a combination of the bottom and top bezels could easily have housed the camera without the need for a notch. And that would have only made this phone slightly less symmetrical. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That, taken as a whole, completely clashes with the expectations set by the rear panel and edges' more premium design. </p>
<p> LG Stylo 6 software and features are extensive </p>
<p> Now, we're just one segment away from discussing this smartphone's biggest drawback. But, under review, it became fairly obvious that at least part of the issues facing the LG Stylo 6 stems from its software. And, more directly, that's the overabundance of specialty settings, features, and pre-installed apps. Many of which can't be removed. </p>
<p> This phone, for all intents and purposes, has almost every feature users could possibly want to mimic the Galaxy Note series. Aside from the cameras, which we'll discuss in detail later. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But those Note-like features are tucked into the main Settings behind navigation, display, drawer, pen, and other options. Users can, for instance, move between modern gesture-based navigation or use the standard buttons. For others who might need a more accessibility-friendly option, that's there too. And users can also turn back on the app drawer in settings even though that's turned off by default. </p>
<p> The pen enables similar pop-up navigation — as shown in the image above — to the Note series too. This is a very productivity-focused device, in that sense. And those features typically work smoothly, without latency, lag, or related problems. </p>
<p> The big drawback to the LG Stylo 6 pen, is the pen itself. While Samsung's S Pen utilizes a specialty display technology for pressure-sensitive inputs and pin-point accuracy, this pen does not. Looking more closely at it, it's a fiber-based capacitive stylus, just slimmed down to a finer point. </p>
<p> That helps keep the device affordable and is still useful. But the pen isn't necessarily any more enjoyable to use than an aftermarket slim stylus on any other smartphone. </p>
<p> Looking past that, there's even a dedicated gaming mode on this phone. That's in place alongside the plethora of useful features found in Android 10. But only partially makes up for the fact that this phone comes loaded with a ton of bloatware. </p>
<p> My review unit for the LG Stylo 6 was a Boost Mobile variant. And it comes loaded with automatically-refreshing tiles for no fewer than 8 applications. </p>
<p> Those prompt users to download extra software and are easy to accidentally tap. Additionally, this phone comes with dozens of pre-installed apps. And those stem from Facebook to Pandora, Tidal, TikTok, and the full suite of Amazon apps to a wealth of LG specific and Boost-specific apps. It's a jarring experience that undoubtedly contributes to this phone's performance problems. </p>
<p> The inconsistent performance will hopefully be fixed later on </p>
<p> As highlighted in the software segment of this review, LG Stylo 6 is utterly bogged down by features and software. Unfortunately, that shines through on performance too. But perhaps not in quite the way that one would expect. Here, it's just inconsistent. </p>
<p> That is, at least in part, down to LG's decision to use a cheaper MediaTek Helio P35 processor. It also coupled that with a meager 3GB RAM. Conversely, 64GB of storage should be more than enough. But the 4,000mAh battery doesn't quite live up to expectations either, as noted in the dedicated battery section below. </p>
<p> Looking more closely at the performance from that hardware, the problems were noticeable right from the start. This phone took well over a full minute to boot up on the first startup. For a smartphone, that's exceptionally bad. Subsequent startups didn't improve matters by more than a few seconds. </p>
<p> In games, once the system adds them automatically to the gaming mode, there seems to be almost no lag or latency. But in even non-intensive apps — outside of gaming mode — don't perform well. Especially with multi-tasking but, again, it's inconsistent. Sometimes apps just start stuttering and other times they become visually distorted with latency and a lack of responsiveness to match. </p>
<p> The issues seem most prominent while background activities are accessing web services or anything connectivity-related. Even simply loading multiple Chrome pages causes minor issues. But all of those minor issues add up, making for one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a budget phone — setting aside how well it seems to do in even moderately intensive games. </p>
<p> The low number of camera features and inconsistent shots belie a phone that's all budget-friendly </p>
<p> On the camera front, LG didn't fail entirely with the Stylo 6 under review. In fact, where the hardware performs well, it performs much better than expected. With that said, we'll start here by taking a look at where it doesn't do all that well. </p>
<p> To begin with, the camera in the LG Stylo 6 is powered by a triple-array 13-megapixel shooter. That's a 13-megapixel sensor, 5-megapixel wide-angle sensor, and a 5-megapixel depth camera. There's a 13-megapixel snapper at the front. The megapixel count here is much lower than competitors, right out of the gate. And that has a tendency to show through in some shots. </p>
<p> There's also no major suite of underlying camera software. AR stickers are present and an AI-driven automatic scene mode is as well. There's a couple of features — a panoramic and "Flash Jump-Cut" as well as a "YouTube Live" camera — in the "More" segment. But there is no night mode. There are no fancy extras in editing tools. And there's not a whole lot by way of extra features over top of that. </p>
<p> Despite the lack of extras here, I found the camera software, particularly after initial startup, to be almost unbearably slow. Autofocus speeds up slightly with use but is slow to start with too. As with almost everything on this phone, things just take a lot more time to accomplish. </p>
<p> Looking at the quality of photos themselves, as shown in our sample gallery via Flickr, results vary. On the one hand, this camera can capture great details and blurs background subjects well. Under optimal lighting, even it's maximum 4x zoom doesn't perform poorly. But things fall apart as soon as any complexity is mixed in, especially where selecting manual focal points are concerned. </p>
<p> Introducing mixed lighting or manually focusing reveals that this camera does not do a good job of adjusting for lighting. Photos can too easily be too dark or too washed out. Lens bloom appears even when direct backlighting isn't present. In shots that are very brightly lit, the color accuracy can and sometimes will go out the window. The result, when that happens, is difficulty discerning between background and foreground objects in a shot. </p>
<p> No night mode or software to compensate for shots taken at night means that no amount of adjusting or refocusing will capture detail under low-light circumstances. </p>
<p> Now, when this phone did perform well, it was well above what I expected for a phone that often sells for under $200. But that hardly makes up for the inconsistencies. In fact, as often as not, I found myself not wanting to pick up the LG Stylo 6 during this review for photos. And that's simply because the quality was so unpredictable. </p>
<p> That may or may not be fixed with software later on. The shots that do turn out well all but prove this is a software issue and not a hardware problem. But this is a budget phone. So it shouldn't be counted on. </p>
<p> LG Stylo 6 is just not brilliant on battery life </p>
<p> The LG Stylo 6 only took an hour and 45 minutes to fill up any time it died during my review. And an hour gets the capacity pushed as much as 71-percent full. Breaking that down, that means that the LG Stylo 6 fills up at a rate of just over a percent per minute. That's not bad at all for the charging side of things. </p>
<p> But that's just about the only positive thing to say about the battery life with this handset. Or at least it is aside from the fact that this phone can go for hours and hours without losing capacity. In fact, more than 26 hours of standby drained just over 8 percent. So, at the very least, this phone should be just fine under circumstances where long standby is needed. </p>
<p> Having said that, this phone dies consistently with two to three percent of the battery showing as "remaining." It never made it to one-percent during my testing. </p>
<p> And the phone doesn't last all that long under load either. While my battery test saw this phone left on standby for 26-hours and 48-minutes, it only lasted with screen-on for around six hours. And very little of that time was spent doing anything intensive. I spent three-and-a-half hours just browsing the web, using the camera, making calls and text messaging. Most of that was browsing the web and text messaging. </p>
<p> Conversely, I spent just 50-minutes streaming video and only an hour and 43-minutes in a game. And that game — at least for the battery test — was just a puzzle title. </p>
<p> So the battery here really should have lasted longer. </p>
<p> Now, the screen's brightness was turned up entirely, for the battery test. But flagships I have tested with similarly-sized batteries have lasted hours longer. And that's annoying since this phone utilizes "energy-efficient" components. It isn't being powered by the same top-tier power-hungry internals as those other devices. </p>
<p> Audio with the LG Stylo 6 is surprisingly good for the price & could be this phone's saving grace </p>
<p> The audio performance delivered by the LG Stylo 6 was better than expected, especially given my disappointment with a good portion of the rest of the device. Tones are well balanced, although somewhat muddier than might be hoped in the lower registers. But, throughout my review, I never felt the need to take advantage of the 3.5mm audio jack included along the bottom edge of the LG Stylo 6. </p>
<p> And that's saying something since that hasn't been the case with other smartphones in this price bracket. </p>
<p> Now, that's not to say it's a perfect experience by any stretch of the imagination. While punchier than other handsets, with good representation across most of the auditory spectrum, the headphone port is going to offer the best experience by far. Once hooked up, that provides deep sound with a great experience in terms of tonal response. In fact, with the right pair of headphones, thanks to support for DTS:X 3D Surround, the sound here is going to be better than most budget handsets. </p>
<p> Bluetooth works as well as expected too, making audio a true highlight for this phone. </p>
<p> There weren't any complaints to be had in terms of call quality or mic input either. That's either via the earpiece or speakerphone. Earpiece audio wasn't quite as clear as a flagship but it was well above par for the course. </p>
<p> Connectivity was on par with mid-rangers but nothing special </p>
<p> Typically, I test devices on Google Fi's network — leased from Sprint, T-Mobile, and US Cellular. For the LG Stylo 6, the company shipped the phone pre-activated on Boost Mobile, so that was used for this review. And on that front, this phone didn't disappoint. As noted above, call quality was clear. </p>
<p> Connections were also at least as strong as any other smartphone I've used in this price bracket in terms of mobile data. Text messages and MMS came through as expected too. As is almost always the case with carrier-locked phones, I didn't see any discrepancies in performance of the network. Or at least no unexpected disconnections or calls being dropped. </p>
<p> In the US, LG Stylo 6 is also available for Metro by T-Mobile, T-Mobile, Cricket Wireless, and Sprint. </p>
<p> T0 Buy? </p>
<p> Now, it's fair to say that the LG Stylo 6 — given a two-star rating above — falls in closer to 2.5 stars than to just two. It's also fair to say that, in terms of display size, the inclusion of a stylus, and audio quality, this is one of the best phones around for the money. </p>
<p> That's all looking past the fact that, in terms of being a phone, this device lived up to expectations. </p>
<p> But, unfortunately, those aspects of a device aren't necessarily what make a phone great. And that's why this phone was given such a low review score. Where performance matters, this phone didn't always quite live up to what would be desired at nearly $220. </p>
<p> The camera, for starters, doesn't always perform as well as its megapixel size indicates. Not even under optimal lighting. The performance in multi-tasking or even basic tasks, conversely, sometimes felt slow beyond what could be called bearable. And that became apparent immediately upon starting the phone up. </p>
<p> There are plenty of phones that just perform much better in this price bracket. And, at this point, solid performance on that front feels like a core feature that any smartphone should match. There are plenty of more powerful phones with longer-lasting batteries. </p>
<p> For the areas where this phone does shine, it does though. LG obviously put a lot of effort in for users who really need a stylus in this price bracket. Hand-rejection for this gadget has improved immensely since the last "Stylo" offering. And the company has refined its stylus quite a bit, even if it hasn't improved the underlying technology. </p>
<p> For those who crave a better audio experience without spending flagship money, it stands up well there too. </p>
<p> And, for quick charging, this phone will be difficult to beat at its price. Just as it would be to find a solid entry with a bigger screen or a more beautiful exterior without spending more money. On those fronts, LG has absolutely nailed it with the LG Stylo 6. </p>

<p> Spread Your Wings (& Your Wallet) For LG's Upcoming Wing Phone </p>
<p> LG's upcoming crazy concept 'Wing' phone is going to come with a larger price tag. If new information is accurate </p>
<p> That's the price you pay for a device with such a unique and wild feature. Look no further than devices like the original Galaxy Fold and other non-traditional smartphones for examples. </p>
<p> All-in-all, LG's Wing phone is going to command a higher price because it's different. The cost is also an estimation based on a report from XDA Developers. Though it will still be plenty cheaper than what Samsung is asking for its Galaxy Fold and Galaxy Z Flip. However that probably doesn't surprise anyone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> LG's upcoming Wing phone will cost "around" $1,000 </p>
<p> LG hasn't necessarily been at the top of the heap with its smartphones lately. But that hasn't stopped it from producing new devices year after year. </p>
<p> With the Wing, it's getting back to a time where LG was a little more known for developing some wilder devices with more unique features. In this case, a phone with a secondary screen that flips outwards to the side. Forming a T shape like in the image above. </p>
<p> If you want this feature, you're likely going to be paying around $1,000 USD. As that's the price tag rumored in the report. That is quite a lot. But as mentioned before it's still a lot less than what you'd get with something like the Galaxy Fold. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Granted the two devices are in different camps, but they do somewhat fill a similar role. Which is giving users more screen space (when they want it) to interact with apps and features. They just do it in a different way. </p>
<p> All that said, around $1,000 is not the same as $1,000. So there is still a small chance that the cost could be a little lower or a little higher. Consider the $1,000 price tag as more of a general starting point for now. </p>
<p> The phone will reportedly go on sale this Fall </p>
<p> In addition to the cost, the rumor also mentions that LG will launch the phone soon. Sometime this Fall in fact. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> No specific dates were given, but the Fall isn't too far off and starts around the second week of September. So a launch could be sooner rather than later, and not more than three months away. </p>
<p> It's also reportedly going to be supported by Verizon Wireless. So this could be a phone that the carrier will sell directly. Though LG is likely to offer unlocked models of it as well through its own store and other retail partners. </p>

<p> LG TONE Free Self-Cleaning Wireless Earbuds Make Their US Debut </p>
<p> Last month LG officially unveiled its TONE Free FN6 self-cleaning true wireless earbuds, and starting today they're officially making their debut in the US. </p>
<p> Which means US consumers can now actually buy them. LG set itself apart from the competition when it announced its self-cleaning earbuds last month. But they weren't yet available as the company stated they wouldn't be releasing until July. </p>
<p> LG also left out any mention of cost. And wouldn't you know it, the TONE Free FN6 are surprisingly affordable. Especially for a pair of true wireless earbuds that can be stored in a self-cleaning case. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The LG TONE Free FN6 are available in the US today for $150 </p>
<p> When it comes to price, there are certainly less expensive true wireless earbuds. Razer's Hammerhead True Wireless come to mind if you're looking for a gaming-focused pair. </p>
<p> But there are also plenty of pairs that cost more. Google's new Pixel Buds would be a good example here, retailing for $180. For $150, LG is giving consumers a pair of true wireless earbuds that likely come with good sound quality, but also come with decent battery life and a case that cleans the earbuds. </p>
<p> In this day and age, self-cleaning earbuds are something that LG figures consumers will highly value. And it may be right. As reported last month, the earbuds will come in two colors – matte black and gloss white. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Get yours from LG and LG-authorized retailers </p>
<p> If you're wondering where you can buy yourself a pair, you have a few options. </p>
<p> LG says that the TONE Free FN6 will be available from its own online store. But they'll also be available from LG-authorized retailers at the the above-mentioned price. LG doesn't mention who those retailers would be. </p>
<p> Chances are though you'll find them on Amazon, perhaps Best Buy, and other larger retailers that carry LG consumer electronics in the audio category. Earlier version of the TONE Free are already available on Amazon. So the FN6 will probably show up there too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> LG's TONE Free FN6 aren't the company's first pair of true wireless earbuds. They are however the first pair that come with premium meridian audio technology. Not to mention the UVnano self-cleaning case that LG says kills 99.9-percent of germs. </p>
<p> The world is already a dirty enough place right now. So there's no reason why consumers shouldn't have the option to use a product that lets them be just a little bit cleaner. On a related note, if you already use a UV phone sanitizer, then these earbuds are probably perfect for you. </p>

<p> LG Velvet 4G Goes Official With Two-Year-Old Snapdragon 845 SoC </p>
<p> The LG Velvet is the first smartphone to feature LG's new design language. The company has now listed the LG Velvet 4G on its German website without making any formal announcement. </p>
<p> Compared to the 5G variant, the LG Velvet 4G uses the exact same hardware apart from the processor. Even the design looks similar with the raindrop camera setup on the rear and symmetrical curves. </p>
<p> The LG Velvet 4G comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 </p>
<p> We also expect the 4G variant to feature the same premium build quality. As for the mobile platform, the new LG Velvet 4G features a two-year-old Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 Mobile Platform built on the 10nm FinFET process. In comparison, the Velvet 5G is equipped with the Snapdragon 765G 5G Mobile Platform built on the more advanced 7nm EUV process. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, the Snapdragon 845 Mobile Platform, which was used in the LG G7 ThinQ series, is still a decent performer for a mid-range smartphone. The decision not to go with the last-gen Snapdragon 855 Mobile Platform could be to subsidize the overall pricing. </p>
<p> LG revamped its smartphone lineup and introduced a new smartphone lineup that emphasizes design over specifications. The new LG Velvet 4G also comes with the same 6.8-inch POLED display with Full HD+ (2340 by 1080 pixels) resolution sand 20:9 aspect ratio. </p>
<p> The variant listed on the website packs 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. It also supports storage expansion using the MicroSD card slot. On the rear, it sports triple camera setup featuring a 48-megapixel primary camera, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and a 5-megapixel depth camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It is listed on the company's German website </p>
<p> For selfies, there is a 16-megapixel camera placed inside the waterdrop notch. In terms of output, the Spectra 355 ISP from the Snapdragon 765G might outperform the Spectra 280 ISP from the Snapdragon 845. </p>
<p> It's powered by a 4,300mAh-capacity battery and supports Quick Charge 3.0 and 9W wireless charging. Just like the 5G variant, there is also a 3.5mm headphone jack on the LG Velvet 4G. </p>
<p> The device measures 167.08 x 74.0 x 7.85 mm and weighs 180 grams. It comes in Aurora Silver and Black color options. Looks like the Aurora Red and Pink White colorways are exclusive to the 5G variant. Additionally, it also comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner and stereo speaker setup. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We also expect the 4G variant to also support accessories like Dual Screen cover and Stylus pen. It is also water and dust resistant with the IP68 certification and is also MIL-STD-810G certified for its durability. On the connectivity front, the device supports 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5, GPS, NFC, and USB Type-C port. </p>
<p> While the 5G variant costs €650, the new 4G variant will retail for €499. With the 4G variant, the company is expected to target the markets with no 5G coverage. </p>

<p> LG's Dual Screen Contraption Survives Durability Tests </p>
<p> A new durability test video has popped up on the JerryRigEverything YouTube channel. This time around, Zack managed to get his hands on LG’s dual screen contraption, which managed to survive durability tests. </p>
<p> LG’s dual screen contraption did manage to survive durability tests </p>
<p> We’re talking about the LG Velvet here, of course, and its second screen case. Zack durability-tested the LG Velvet first, and then spent some time with its secondary display. </p>
<p> The LG Velvet is made out of metal and glass. When it comes to the scratch test, the results are exactly what you’d expect. The phone’s display starts scratching with a level six pick, while deeper grooves are visible with a level seven pick. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That’s what you’d expect out of a phone whose display is protected by modern Gorilla Glass. We’re not sure what iteration is it, but it does a good job here, that’s for sure. </p>
<p> Gorilla Glass protects the back side of the phone as well. The camera lenses are also well-protected, and are not prone to scratching. The phone’s frame is made out of metal, which is something Zack proved in the video. </p>
<p> The phone’s display managed to last 25 seconds under the direct flame before pixels shut down. It did recover a little bit afterwards, but not all the way. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner didn’t do such a good job, but that’s because of Zack’s fingers. They’re quite rough around the edges, and it’s very hard for a phone to scan a fingerprint scanner in such situations. </p>
<p> The phone did not snap in half, but… </p>
<p> When it comes to the bend test, the phone did not snap. The display did pop out a little bit, as the phone did flex. However, when you stop bending it, it reverts back to its original state. </p>
<p> Following the LG Velvet durability tests, he did scratch up the case a little bit. That case is made out of plastic, so… it is what it is. He also did a quick disassembly of the two displays. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All in all, the LG Velvet did not exactly pass these tests with flying colors, but it did pass them. It did not snap, or anything of the sort. It did bend a bit too much, but that’s because it’s extremely thin. </p>
<p> The case that can be bought, which contains the second display, may be useful to some people. Having two displays on your at all times can come in handy, that’s for sure. The LG Velvet is also considerably more affordable than the Microsoft Surface, and foldable devices. So, it could be a neat alternative. </p>

<p> LG Velvet Review: Pressing Restart </p>
<p> The LG Velvet earns some style points with its design "restart" and even more points with its much lower price, compared to the competition. </p>
<p> LG sent us a review unit of the European variant of the Velvet to use in the US. This review was done without a SIM card in the device, since European phones don’t typically work on US carrier networks. So when it comes to the battery life, take that with a grain of salt. </p>
<p> At the time of writing this review, the Velvet is on Android 10, with the June 1, 2020 security patch. </p>
<p> The LG Velvet marks a departure from the company's old design, and introduces an entirely new design language, and a new set of selling points for LG. </p>
<p> LG had always been in the spec game, putting out smartphones with the best specs. It was first to do QHD on a smartphone, it was one of the first to do a 3000mAh capacity battery in a smartphone, and so on. But with the LG Velvet, the company is looking to focus less on specs and more on features, usability and the design of the phone. And that in-turn, knocks the price down a bit. </p>
<p> The LG Velvet is available in Europe now for around €649, it is coming to the US this summer for $599. Making it a whole lot cheaper than most other smartphones available in the US. </p>

<p> The best looking LG smartphone in years </p>
<p> LG has changed up its design before, but it was mostly still a variation of what it started back with the Optimus G2 many years ago. It moved from plastic to leather, to aluminum and then to glass. But the design mostly looked the same. And it wasn't all that interesting. Especially when you had some pretty incredibly designed phones from Samsung and OnePlus in the US, as well as Xiaomi, Huawei, HONOR, Vivo and others in other markets. </p>
<p> But with the Velvet, LG went to the drawing board and started from scratch. Creating a phone that looks absolutely stunning. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Velvet is also the first truly curved phone that the company has created. And it's about time. </p>
<p> Velvet has a curved backside and curved display, that melt into this metal chassis. And it looks incredible. The back is very clean, on our gray model here, the LG logo is towards the bottom and in black. So it doesn't really stand out. There is a teardrop style camera on the left side of the phone. With the biggest camera at the top, and they get smaller from there, going down to the flash. Only one camera has a bump, which is the main sensor at the very top. And it's no where near as big as what Samsung has been doing lately. So when you have it on a table, it doesn't wobble when you're typing on it. </p>
<p> It's this attention to detail that many feel LG has lacked in recent years. But it is available here on the Velvet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The front of the phone doesn't immediately scream "premium", though, since there is a tear drop notch for the front-facing camera too. </p>
<p> Most of the time, I don't spend a lot of time on the design of a phone, because the majority people slap it in a case. But the Velvet is different. It is a phone that you're going to want to show off. </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 765 is fast enough </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 765 is a step down from the Snapdragon 865 that you'll find in almost every smartphone released this year. But that doesn't mean it's bad, not by any means. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It is slower, though I will admit, it's not noticeably slower. I've been using it side-by-side with the OnePlus 8 Pro which sports a Snapdragon 865 and I haven't noticed a huge drop in speed. But one thing you will notice, is with the battery life. It'll be better as it is not powering a more power-hungry chipset. </p>
<p> For LG, by using a less powerful Snapdragon 765, they are able to sell this phone for less. Hence why this is under $800, while other Snapdragon 865 smartphones are over $999 or more (except for the OnePlus 8 series). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For most users, the Snapdragon 765 and 6GB of RAM is going to be more than enough. Would we like a faster processor and more RAM? Of course. But for everyday tasks, it gets the job done. If you are one that does a lot of gaming on your smartphone, though, you may not be happy with the performance here. </p>
<p> Battery life is great </p>
<p> As mentioned above, the Snapdragon 765 will allow for better battery life. And we got some great numbers out of our unit here. But as we mentioned in the disclaimer, the LG Velvet was used for this review without a SIM card in it, since this is the European model being used in the US. So the battery life numbers down below are a bit skewed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, you should be able to get around six hours of on screen time out of this phone without any problems. We could get close to eight hours on a charge, but again that's without LTE or 5G being used. </p>
<p> It's a 4300mAh capacity battery, so it's not huge, but it is big enough to get the job done. </p>
<p> This display is not ready for 2020 </p>
<p> LG is one of the only smartphone makers that has yet to jump on the high refresh rate train so far. The LG V60 ThinQ 5G that it released earlier this year was a 60Hz panel, but it had that huge 5000mAh capacity battery that made battery life almost comical. And now the Velvet has a 6.8-inch FHD+ display that is also still 60Hz. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For most people, that won't be a big deal, but if you're coming from a 90Hz or 120Hz phone, you are going to notice the difference – like we have. </p>
<p> It's a good looking display, since it's an OLED and LG definitely knows OLED. And even at 2460×1080, it is plenty sharp. However, having that higher refresh rate would really be nice here. </p>
<p> The notch for the camera doesn't really get in the way either. Though, at this point, we are all pretty used to the notch or hole punch on phones anyways. </p>
<p> Basically, the TL;DR here is that this is a good display, but not a great display. Our only major complaint is that it is still 60Hz. </p>
<p> LG software is finally not a pain to use </p>
<p> If you go back and look at our previous reviews of LG phones, you'll notice that the software is always a pain point for us. And we're not alone. This is an issue with just about everyone that reviews an LG device. </p>
<p> It looks like LG finally heard us though, as the Velvet has some new software, and as we've found in our review, it's not terrible. </p>
<p> The Google Feed is now built into the launcher. Which makes you almost want to use the stock launcher. But LG still can't figure out how to keep the app drawer sorting alphabetical or by your own customized sorting. Any time you download an app, it automatically adds it to the last page of the drawer. Instead of where it belongs alphabetically. So you need to sort it again every time you download a new app. It's an issue that LG has had for years, and likely won't be fixed anytime soon. </p>
<p> Now, this is not the full overhaul that we kind of wish LG would do – and is long overdue at this point – but there are some changes here that make the software a joy to use. </p>
<p> LG UX 9.1 absolutely flies on this hardware, which is not a big surprise, considering the Snapdragon 765G is a 2.4GHz chipset. That's definitely no slouch. And LG has been working at making the software a lot more lightweight in recent years. Making it smoother on lesser hardware too. </p>
<p> But, the elephant is still in the room. And that's updates. LG isn't great with updates, as we've mentioned in other reviews, but hopefully it'll be different with the Velvet. LG doesn't typically send out updates to its phones. Many of its phones have not been updated to Android 10 and it's been out for over a year already. We are hopeful that LG has turned over a new leaf when it comes to software updates though, after the restart it did on the design for the Velvet. </p>
<p> Dual display continues to improve, but not perfect </p>
<p> LG Velvet does come with the dual display attachment. Something that LG has been pushing since the LG V50 ThinQ it released last year. LG has continued to refine the experience, and getting more apps on-board to work with the dual display definitely does help. But it's still not perfect. </p>
<p> For the most part, the dual display is great for multi-tasking. Being able to watch a video on one screen and then text or browse the web on the other is insanely useful. But it's not something I use all of the time. </p>
<p> It's also really great for Google Maps, and Gmail. Both of which can spread out across the two screens. Though the hinge gets in the way, making it not look as elegant as it could. But for the most part, it's pretty useful. </p>
<p> I wouldn't recommend buying the LG Velvet for the dual display though, after this review. And that's because it's not a great selling point. The better selling point is definitely the price, as well as 5G and even the design. </p>
<p> Cameras are somewhat disappointing </p>
<p> LG has had a pretty good history with cameras in recent years, but the Velvet's cameras are somewhat disappoint. But it seems like its the post-processing here that is at fault. The primary camera – which is a 48-megapixel sensor – does a lot of over-sharpening. Which just leaves us with some pretty bad looking photos. </p>
<p> And in portrait mode, the colors are just way off. On top of that it doesn't really pick out the subject in the foreground all that well. Which is even worse, when you consider the fact that there is a depth sensor in this triple-camera setup. And it is basically useless, since it isn't doing depth correctly. </p>
<p> The ultra-wide sensor isn't too bad. It actually performs better than the main sensor in some instances. </p>
<p> Now, this can be easily fixed with software updates. But as we've seen in the past, LG isn't great with software updates. It may send them out, it may not. Fingers crossed that it is able to send out some updates that will adjust the post-processing of the camera. And get rid of the over-sharpening, fix the portrait mode problems and such. </p>
<p> The camera is usable, but there are better options out there for the same price. </p>
<p> Should I buy the LG Velvet? </p>
<p> At $599, the LG Velvet is a very compelling smartphone in the US market. There's not a lot of phones in the sub-$600 price range right now, so there's less competition for LG. And even less in that price range that offer 5G. Not to mention the fact that this is one of the best looking smartphones LG has put out in years – literally. </p>
<p> LG Velvet offers a big, beautiful display, as well as great battery life, 5G connectivity and a decent camera setup, as we've found in this review. It checks a lot of the boxes, including the price. So yes, if you want a 5G smartphone, then the Velvet is worth buying. </p>
<p> It's coming to AT&T first, and then it'll come to T-Mobile and Verizon later this summer. </p>

<p> LG V50 ThinQ & Earlier Flagships Updating To Velvet UI Soon </p>
<p> The LG V50 ThinQ and older flagships will now be updated to the namesake UI from the company's Velvet-branded smartphone. That's according to a recently-reported announcement made by the company. In fact, the LG V50 ThinQ is already being updated with Velvet UI right now. The rollout will follow the same path as any OTA update. </p>
<p> So users should be seeing the changes landing sooner than later before the LG Velvet even lands in the US. </p>
<p> LG will also be updating a swath of other top devices to the new UI for five other Android 10 flagships from the past. That includes the LG G8 ThinQ, V50S ThinQ, V40 ThinQ, V35 ThinQ, and G7 ThinQ. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Why is LG Velvet UI so popular? </p>
<p> According to LG, the biggest changes from this update for the V50 ThinQ and other flagships will include alterations to aesthetics. That includes the volume adjustment UI and other theming differences. It doesn't go into too much detail. But it does say that includes the ability to adjust notification bar color settings. And also the appearance of pop-up windows during calls. </p>
<p> The general theme of the UI itself, as its branding implies, is to create a smoother interface that's also cleaner, easier to read, and more convenient. </p>
<p> Why is LG updating these handsets now? </p>
<p> Now, there's no set timeline in place for older handsets here. But that doesn't make this update any less important. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> LG indicates that the reason for its Velvet UI push actually comes back to consumers. The Android overlay has, the company says, been "acclaimed for its high convenience." And it wants to bring that convenience to its other customers. The acclaim itself has come directly from the collected opinions posted to customer contact channels. So this is coming as the direct result of customer feedback. </p>
<p> In effect, LG customers have responded well to the new interface. And that's happened so much so that LG feels it's appropriate to leave behind and replace the UI already found on older handsets. </p>
<p> That's undoubtedly good news for LG consumers since it highlights a willingness by the company to not just listen. But also to respond appropriately to what its fans want. </p>

<p> You Won't Be Buying An Unlocked LG Velvet </p>
<p> LG announced yesterday that the Velvet was coming to the US for just $599. And now we're learning that the LG Velvet won't be available as an unlocked device in the US. </p>
<p> Instead, you'll only be able to get it as an AT&T, T-Mobile or Verizon variant. With the later two coming later this summer. As AT&T is the only one that is selling it for now. In what looks like a timed exclusive. </p>
<p> LG rarely does unlocked phones </p>
<p> Unlike other smartphone makers, LG hasn't really embraced the unlocked smartphone market. It mostly only sells its phones through carriers, in the US at least. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now there are some of their low-end and mid-range smartphones that are sold unlocked in the US, through Amazon or Best Buy. But when it comes to their more mainstream smartphones, they are typically only available in carrier variants. </p>
<p> For example, the LG V60 ThinQ 5G was only available as a carrier variant as well. For Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T here in the US. </p>
<p> Of course, this is a bit different in other countries, like Europe for example. Where most people are only buying unlocked phones, and aren't going straight to their carrier for a new phone. Part of the reason for this is because the US is still a very carrier-centric market. Where most people do buy their phones directly from their carriers. And LG has great relationships with all of the US carriers, and don't want to hinder that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> LG Velvet is a great value device </p>
<p> The LG Velvet is already a really great value smartphone from the company, at $599. However, if it were unlocked, it would be an even better value. Imagine being able to buy an unlocked LG Velvet and taking it to whatever carrier you want? Well, all you can do is imagine. </p>
<p> The Velvet sports a 6.8-inch FHD+ display, with the Snapdragon 765G chipset, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage inside. There is also a pretty decently sized 4300mAh capacity battery inside that should keep it running all day long. Especially since that display is a 60Hz panel and not a 90Hz or 120Hz. </p>
<p> On top of that, this is a 5G smartphone. It does support Sub-6 and not mmWave, yet. There is a Verizon version coming later this year that will support mmWave though. And for $599, this is one of the best 5G devices that you can pick up right now. </p>

<p> The LG Velvet Lands In The US This Week, For Only $599 </p>
<p> LG has just announced that the Velvet is going to be available in the US starting this week, for a pretty competitive price of just $599. </p>
<p> AT&T will start selling the device tomorrow, July 22. While T-Mobile and Verizon will sell it later this summer. LG is making a mmWave model specific to Verizon, and if it's anything like the Galaxy S20 and OnePlus 8 that has mmWave, it will likely have some changes too. </p>
<p> The LG Velvet will come in Aurora Gray, Aurora Silver, Aurora Red and Pink White, when it makes its US debut. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At $599, the LG Velvet is a very compelling smartphone </p>
<p> The Velvet isn't really a high-end device from LG, but more of a premium mid-ranger that also sports 5G connectivity. And coming in at $599, is going to make it a pretty impressive smartphone to pick up. Primarily because most other smartphones are priced above $999. </p>
<p> Internally, the Velvet has the Snapdragon 765G chipset running the show. With 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage inside. There is also a micro SD card slot available for those that need some extra space. On top of that, there is also a headphone jack here. Something we really don't see in 2020. It also sports a 6.8-inch FHD+ 60Hz display, which should do well with battery life. </p>
<p> There is also a triple-camera setup on the back. With a 48-megapixel main sensor that has a f/1.8 aperture. There's also a 8-megapixel ultra wide sensor with f/2.2 aperture and then a 5-megapixel depth sensor included. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is all powered by a 4300mAh capacity battery that should get you through the day, no problem. We've been working on our review of the Velvet and found that it definitely lasts the whole day and then some. </p>
<p> This price likely doesn't include the dual display attachment. Which is available for the LG Velvet, but we'll have to wait and see what happens when the phone goes on sale tomorrow at AT&T. With the LG V60 ThinQ 5G, the device came with the dual display attachment at some carriers and not at others. Likely to keep the price down. Hopefully carriers will offer the choice of having it come with or without the attachment at the carriers. </p>
<p> It's one of the more exciting LG smartphones that has come out in recent memory. With a new striking design, that offers a really great look. With a 2.5D back panel and a curved front display. </p>

<p> LG Will Be Next To Launch An Affordable 5G Smartphone </p>
<p> The LG Velvet 5G launched earlier this year is one of the best mid-range 5G smartphones in the market. During the earnings call, the LG mentioned it will launch an affordable 5G phone by the end of this year. </p>
<p> With the upcoming mass-market 5G smartphones, LG is trying to get the early mover advantage in the markets like the US and South Korea. The company is also working closely with chipset makers for offering best-in-class experience even on the affordable devices. </p>
<p> Affordable LG phone with 5G support in the works </p>
<p> While the LG Velvet 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G 5G Mobile Platform, LG recently launched the Velvet 4G with the two-year-old Snapdragon 845 Mobile Platform. Based on the rumors, the company is also working on a new Velvet smartphone featuring the latest Snapdragon 690 5G Mobile Platform. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Moreover, the trademarked names from LG also hint it might soon launch a 5G smartphone under the Q-series. The LG Q92 5G and Q9 2020 5G could be the first affordable 5G smartphones from LG. LG also acknowledges that 5G iPhones will rapidly increase 5G adoption. This might also work in the company's favor as it's been preparing for 5G smartphones for a while. </p>
<p> However, LG is yet to reveal any timeline for the launch of these new Q-series smartphone. Even the Snapdragon 765G-powered LG Velvet is only available in the US, Korea, and a few European markets. The company might soon launch it in other key markets with 5G infrastructure. </p>
<p> LG's smartphone business has reported solid growth in Q2 2020 </p>
<p> Talking about its smartphone business, the sales in Q2 2020 have seen a 31.1 percent quarter-on-quarter growth. However, it is still running at a loss. While the mobile division recorded KRW 1.3 trillion in sales, the operating loss is at KRW 206.5 billion. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> LG is also restructuring its mobile division to be more competitive and improve profitability. It is also expanding the ODM business to help reach its goal. Hopefully, LG could turn its smartphone business profitable if it continues to register similar growth in the coming quarters. </p>
<p> The new LG Velvet smartphones will undoubtedly play a significant role in this turnaround. With flagship smartphones crossing $1000 mark, the company is targetting the sub $600 smartphone market with the LG Velvet 5G. The carrier subsidies will further decrease the upfront cost while buying a new 5G smartphone. </p>
<p> While LG considers North America and Korea as its key markets, it will be expanding sales capabilities in LATAM, Europe, and a few other countries. </p>

<p> LG Wing U.S. Warranty Covers An Extra Year – For Free </p>
<p> Every LG Wing 5G sold in the U.S. will come with an extended, two-year warranty at no extra cost. The Korean company confirmed the move over the weekend. In doing so, LG is continuing its long-running Second Year Promise program. Or better said: it will continue it once the LG Wing 5G is released stateside. </p>
<p> Meaning U.S. models will ship with a limited warranty coverage that starts after the original manufacturer's warranty is up. The only catch is that you'll need to register your LG Wing 5G. Within 90 days of your purchase, to be more specific. </p>
<p> Fortunately, the online registration process takes just a few minutes. Following the sign-up, the second-year coverage will automatically kick in after 12 months. And if you end up needing it, you'll simply have to file a claim directly with LG before getting your replacement device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That replacement can theoretically be refurbished, but you might also end up with a brand-new device. Either way, this extra peace of mind won't cost you extra, like it would with most other smartphones. Of course, the extended warranty exists to insure you against production defects. It won't help you if you accidentally smash your dual-screen handset. Then again, nothing (that doesn't cost extra) would. </p>
<p> LG Wing gives American consumers a taste of EU warranty protections </p>
<p> As for replacements covered under the Second Year Promise extenstion, there are no premiums, deductibles, or even shipping charges to fear. If you're eligible for a replacement, you'll get it – at the manufacturer's expense. </p>
<p> LG has a long track record of extending its smartphone warranties in the United States. At least in the flagship price range. In fact, the Second Year Promise program is pretty much a unique selling point of its stateside flagships. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This practice officially started with the V30 line three and a half years ago. Of course, if you're looking to buy the LG Wing 5G in the EU, you're already guaranteed a 24-year warranty by law. We're still waiting for the invisible hand of the market to become more consumer-friendly in the U.S, however. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the Wing 5G is poised to be one of the more curious smartphones that will hit the store shelves this fall. Speaking of which, expect this dual-screen gadget to become available for purchase by early November. We're still waiting for its official U.S. pricing details, but if the Korean market is any indication, LG is planning to ask a pretty penny for the Wing 5G. </p>

<p> LG Wing Announced: The Coolest Android Smartphone Of 2020 </p>
<p> Forget about folding phones, swiveling phones is the next big thing. As LG announces its Wing smartphone, which is part of its new Explorer Project. </p>
<p> The crazy and weird LG is back. After being more of a conservative smartphone company the last few years, LG is back making some interesting devices, with the Wing. </p>
<p> While other companies are doing folding phones, LG is going down a different path. Making that main display swivel into landscape mode and giving you a 1:1 aspect ratio display underneath. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> LG Wing Specs </p>
<p> Screen size </p>
<p> 6.8-inch OLED FullVision Display 3.9-inch OLED Display </p>
<p> Breaking the mold </p>
<p> LG is looking to break the mold of what a smartphone can be, with the Wing. For years now, smartphones have mostly looked the same. Coming in a candy-bar shape, now they are starting to become taller, with much taller aspect ratios. But LG wants to change that look entirely. And that's where Wing comes in. </p>
<p> Sure it is still a candy bar-shaped phone, but it can do a lot more. And it's building on LG's history with multi-screen experiences. Which actually started way back with the V10 back in 2015. That's actually still a popular LG phone among many content creators, even five years later. </p>
<p> What's really unique about the Wing, is that now you have a "grip" for holding onto your phone while you are watching a video in YouTube. Or even while you record video using the rear cameras. With the display swiveled, you are able to record in landscape mode, while holding your phone in portrait mode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Other use cases for this are mostly with multi-window. And unlike a certain competitor, LG decided to use Android's own multi-window experience on the Wing. So it works just like it should, with almost every single app supported. This means you can use it while driving, with the main screen on Google Maps or Waze, and the smaller display for music playback, or even to make a call. </p>
<p> A new way to create content on your smartphone </p>
<p> Most content creators are creating content on their smartphones, because mobile cameras are just that good now. And the LG Wing is really leaning into that. Giving you endless ways to capture content with the triple-camera system on the back. </p>
<p> There is a 64-megapixel main sensor with a f/1.8 aperture. Along with two ultra-wide angle cameras. There is the 13-megapixel ultra-wide, with a f/1.9 aperture and a 117-degree field-of-view. Finally, there is a 12-megapixel ultra-wide angle with the hexa motion sensors and a f/2.2 aperture. This has a 120-degree field-of-view, and is dedicated to being used in gimbal mode. The reason for a second ultra-wide sensor, is because it is rectangle and the orientation is turned. This is so you can record when the screen is in swivel mode, in landscape. Since the back doesn't swivel, just the top. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, about that Gimbal Mode. LG thought that making the Wing have a built-in Gimbal would be epic, and we have to agree. So with the Wing, you can record super smooth videos, and have gimbal-like control. It's like having the DJI OM4 in your pocket, and inside your phone. You'll be able to pan, tilt and follow easily, while using the one-handed UI. It uses the hexa motion sensors and a triple-axis stabilization, to make it all super stable. The axes are also locked for smooth, straight shots of a single angle. </p>
<p> There is also dual video recording available, and you can choose how you record and save it. Whether that is in two separate files, side-by-side or even picture-in-picture. Giving you even more possibilities for recording on the Wing. </p>
<p> On the front, there is a 32-megapixel front-facing sensor. And LG finally, went with a pop-up camera there. Instead of using a notch. And it's about time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When can I buy it? </p>
<p> In typical LG fashion, the company did not share any pricing or availability, unfortunately. We do know that it is going to be available fairly soon, and available on carriers. Which is actually rather surprising. Considering the fact that carriers don't typically get too excited about selling wild phones like this. Because they won't be able to move them in the numbers they would like to. </p>
<p> Pricing is likely not going to be super low, but with the Snapdragon 765G inside, it might be cheaper than you'd think. </p>

<p> The LG Wing Has The Most Interesting Phone Camera You'll Ever Use </p>
<p> LG today has officially announced the Wing, and it carries the most interesting smartphone camera you'll ever use. </p>
<p> It's packed full of features that you won't find anywhere else. And that sort of versatility is what's going to set the LG Wing and its camera apart from other phone cameras on the market. </p>
<p> Of course the main thing that differentiates the LG Wing from other phones is its swiveling secondary display. And it's precisely that which makes the camera such a unique feature of the phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The LG Wing camera has a gimbal mode </p>
<p> People use their smartphone cameras for just about everything these days. </p>
<p> And that becomes more and more prominent the better that cameras get. The LG Wing won't necessarily have the best of cameras on the market. But the images that it produces won't necessarily be bad either. </p>
<p> Good or bad, what's going to help the phone stand out to consumers are its additional, unique features. Like the gimbal mode. When this is engaged, the secondary screen does a few things. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It delivers a one-handed UI so you can hold and use the phone with a single hand while you're shooting video. Like you would a gimbal. </p>
<p> The sensors then work to adjust slightly as you move, allowing the main display that's in landscape mode to stay as stable as possible. The secondary display even has joystick controls for panning, tilting, and following your subjects. </p>
<p> A big part of how this all works is the hexa-motion sensors and the triple-axis stabilization. Which LG says ensures all your shots are stable so you can end up with some pretty good looking video. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's even a lock mode you can turn on that allows for smooth shots at single angles. As it locks all three axes in place. </p>
<p> Dual video recording will be perfect for creators </p>
<p> Another interesting feature baked into this device is the dual video recording. </p>
<p> After you swivel out the secondary display, you can use a secondary dedicated ultrawide camera for video footage while the front camera records you at the same time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This enables a truly unique experience where your viewers can see you as well as what you're shooting. All without having multiple devices to do it. The main display will also split the front camera and back camera footage so each has half of the screen. </p>
<p> That way you can see both and make sure everything is always in frame. </p>
<p> Dual video recording can also display the front camera and back camera footage in a picture-in-picture view. And when you're done recording it can save the files in three different ways – As separate files, side by side, or picture-in-picture. </p>

<p> Naturally, you can use the phone just like a regular smartphone camera. But why would you when it has all these additional capabilities. </p>

<p> The Wing Is Here & LG Has Something To Say About Its Durability </p>
<p> One of the biggest questions likely to be raised about the newly launched LG Wing comes down to the durability of such a novel device. That's because, as its name implies, this isn't a straightforward candy bar-shaped phone. Instead, it's a two-display device with one of those full-sized panels slotted onto a swivel. When swung up, that swivel opens up a new experience for end-users. </p>
<p> One display sites horizontally while the other sits vertically. So users can use the lower screen similar to a mouse or access both screens within the same app. Or they can access an app that's better horizontally — such as a video app — and a vertical app — such as a messaging app — at the same time. </p>
<p> In effect, the phone can take on whatever orientation depending on users' needs, without removing the potential for deeper multitasking. But also that there's a new potential weak point being introduced. The LG Wing will also introduce LG users to another, more long-standing potential weak point. Namely, it comes with a pop-up camera as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So just how is durability with the LG Wing? </p>
<p> The final verdict on durability will likely remain a mystery until device testers can run the LG Wing through its paces. But, based on LG's own internal testing, it should pass with flying colors. </p>
<p> According to LG, the LG Wing can withstand up to 200,000 hinge rotations. That's equal to around 100 rotations on a daily basis over the course of five years. </p>
<p> And LG Wing can also handle as many as 60,000 camera pops. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> …But how durable is that really? </p>
<p> That should equate to a long life in terms of durability for the LG Wing. But that's going to largely depend on how often each of those features is used. If a user is opening and rotating the screen on the LG Wing every time they lift their phone, the overall life is likely to be much less. Especially since many users check their phone a lot more than 100 times per day. </p>
<p> Just in case something does go wrong though, LG is also extending an "LG Second Year promise" with this handset. Namely, buyers can enjoy the same coverage they get from the first year manufacturer's warranty. And that'll carry over that the second year too. </p>

<p> LG Wing Hands-On: Weird & Cool At The Same Time </p>
<p> Earlier this week, LG took the wraps off of its coolest and weirdest new phone, the Wing. And today a few days later, we have the LG Wing here for a hands-on preview of what to expect with this crazy new smartphone. </p>
<p> LG hasn't jumped into the foldable scene just yet. It has put bets on a dual-screen experience, via a case on its past few flagship smartphones. And now it's giving us a screen that swivels into landscape mode. This is the first device of the Explorer Project, which is basically a new project that LG has for exploring new use-cases for smartphones. In fact, there is another Explorer device launching later this year. </p>
<p> On the surface, it's an interesting looking device, but is it worth jumping on the bandwagon? Let's find out. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Before we jump into our thoughts and impressions, it's important to note that this is a preview and not a review. This unit is not final, meaning that there might be some software changes and optimizations before it ships to consumers later this year. So keep that in mind here. </p>
<p> LG Wing: Hardware </p>
<p> The hardware on the LG Wing feels pretty good, for this hands-on preview. </p>
<p> It's the same hardware you'd expect from LG, honestly. It feels like you're holding a thicker V60 or even a Velvet. Of course, the Wing has to be thicker, because it does have that second screen and the swivel mechanism inside. But it's not overly thick, or even as thick as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2. It's actually manageable. And I can fit this in my pocket with ease. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The swivel of the main display is actually really easy to do, even with one hand. Which is something I was worried about. After seeing some of the demos, I thought that the swivel might be a bit tougher. But it's super easy to swivel that main display whenever you want. Whether you're walking down the street and want to reply to a text message while you are using Google Maps to navigate, or want to use the second screen for something else. </p>
<p> Thankfully, even with all of this new tech built into the LG Wing, LG did not give us a huge camera bump, like a few certain Samsung smartphones. It's pretty manageable actually. Though, we don't have a crazy 108-megapixel sensor included here, which does take up a good amount of space. </p>
<p> Perhaps the best part of this hardware, is that there is no hole-punch or notch on the Wing. Instead, LG has gone the pop-up selfie route here. As expected, it does close when it feels that it is being dropped, to protect the camera. Like we've seen with other phones using a pop-up selfie camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There is a 4,000mAh capacity battery inside, that can charge at up to 25W wired. There is a 25W charger included in the box too. We can't talk about battery life yet, since we've only had it a few hours and this is not final software. But I have good hopes for this one. Yes, it's running two displays, but the main display is a FHD+ display and not QHD+. So it should run nicely all day long. More in the full review, of course. </p>
<p> LG Wing: Software </p>
<p> With the addition of a swivel display on the LG Wing, the company did need to make some software changes, to give us the most out of this smartphone. And the changes are mostly good. </p>
<p> So now when you swivel the display, it does open up a new launcher, which looks a lot like the launcher on LG's TVs. No surprise there. But there are only a few apps that show up on that scrolling dock on the main display. But that can be changed. You can swipe up to get into the app drawer and then drag apps into the dock, like you would normally. By default, it has Asphalt, Gallery, Camera, YouTube and Google Maps listed there. All apps that LG thinks you'd use with the main screen rotated. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It works pretty good, the only real complaint I have here is that when you swivel the display, the "Swivel Home" as it's called, is pretty slow to show up. As you can see in the video below. I'm hoping this is something that LG can work on and optimize before the phone goes on sale. Because currently, it's painfully slow. But this is where I stress that this is not final software yet. </p>
<p> The camera software seems to be better optimized than the Swivel Home, and I can actually see myself using this a lot in Gimbal Mode. If we are ever allowed to go back to trade shows. As it means that I don't need to carry around the DJI OM4. Now obviously, not everyone needs a gimbal for their smartphone. But it is nice to have it available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Unfortunately, LG doesn't allow you to use every mode in swivel mode for the camera. For example, you can't take a regular old picture with the controls on the smaller 1:1 aspect ratio display, and using the larger 6.8-inch screen as your gigantic viewfinder. That's one thing I hope LG changes. </p>
<p> LG Wing: Full review coming soon </p>
<p> As mentioned, this is not a full review of the LG Wing. That's impossible to do in only a few hours, not to mention this is not a final review unit. We should have more on the LG Wing very soon. However, LG has not announced a release date just yet, so it might be a little while. </p>
<p> The LG Wing has left a good taste in our mouths. And we can't wait to take a deeper dive into this smartphone and see what exactly it has to offer. </p>

<p> LG Wing Shown In Action, The Swiveling Phone Is Coming: Video </p>
<p> The LG Wing is definitely one of the oddest phones we’ve seen this year, it’s a swiveling phone which just surfaced in a video (embedded below the article). This video shows the phone in action, and it’s hard to deny it’s interesting. </p>
<p> The LG Wing hands-on video shows the phone’s swiveling action </p>
<p> Reactions to this video have been really interesting, as many people seem baffled by this design. Some are quite interested, though. So, when closed, this phone looks like your regular smartphone, but thicker. </p>
<p> You can “open it up” by pushing the front to the left, at which point the front portion of the phone will go into landscape mode. That will create two displays for you to use, one vertical, and one horizontal. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When it first surfaced, the phone had a mapping system running on it, just to show one of its use scenarios. Truth be said, yes, it could be useful in that particular case. We cannot think of many more, unless the software is especially adapted to the device. </p>
<p> I’m sure that LG’s software will be adapted, but the device should be able to take advantage of third-party apps in a special way as well. We’ll see how will all this work once the phone gets announced. </p>
<p> This video shows that this phone is considerably different than everything else in the market </p>
<p> This hands-on video is very short, it has a duration of only 8 seconds, but it shows the LG Wing swivel action perfectly. You’re basically getting two phones here, but in a much different way than with foldable devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This phone is coming as part of the ‘Explorer Project’ that LG announced. When fully open, the device creates a ‘T’ shape, pretty much. The phone does look interesting, that is hard to deny. </p>
<p> The LG Wing is a perfect device for grabbing attention, and that’s probably what LG needs at the moment. We’ll see if the company will make this phone widely available, and what will the reactions be once it gets fully announced. </p>
<p> We do not really know much about the device, to be quite honest. The LG Wing price tag did surface recently. According to ETNews, the phone’s price tag is set at KRW 1.09 million ($918), while the cost calculated after the “value-added tax rate reflected in the factory price” comes down to KRW 1.91 million ($1,608). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In other words, this phone will not exactly be cheap, not at all. In fact, it will be quite expensive. Considering its new, odd form factor, it’s hard to imagine this phone flying off the shelves. </p>
<p> LG is probably not expecting it to. As already mentioned, this phone will probably manage to grab attention, and that will probably be enough for LG. It sure is different, that’s hard to deny. The LG Wing will be fully announced on September 14. </p>

From typing comments while watching a video, to playing a game while having a map on a separate display. </p>
<p> The third video features Lewis from Unbox Therapy. LG basically hired Lewis to unbox the LG Wing, though not as he would every other phone. He does pull it out of the box, but doesn’t really spend too much time actually using it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The device’s retail box swivels as well </p>
<p> The video is embedded below, and it has a duration of about 5 minutes. You’ll notice a rather interesting packaging here, as it swivels, just like the LG Wing does. LG really went the extra mile for this. </p>
<p> In this video, Lewis basically narrates one of LG’s promo videos in which various features and functions of the LG Wing are. You’ll see the device in action on the screen the whole time. So this is a perfect video to learn more about the functions of the LG Wing. </p>
<p> The last video has a duration of three minutes, and it is basically a long ad for the phone. It will tell you more about the swiveling action of the phone, and answer some questions you may have. It talks about the device’s design for the most part. Check out that video below. </p>

<p> LG Wing Price Revealed, To Go On Sale Starting October In Korea </p>
<p> It is been a while since every tech enthusiast is excited about a product, i.e. LG Wing. And now, the price and release date of the LG Wing is finally disclosed by the company itself. </p>
<p> Earlier this month, via an online video event, LG unveiled the first smartphone under its "Explorer Project", the LG Wing. It made all heads turned with its swivel motion, that forms a letter 'T'. </p>
<p> Interestingly, LG Wing's swivel design is not just a gimmick. It holds tons of exciting features adapted for the new and awkward swing motion of the display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For starters, you can easily watch a YouTube video on the horizontal screen and have the controls of the video on the bottom screen. </p>
<p> Then, it can be used to use two apps at the same time. For instance, you can watch a video and read an article related to it at the bottom display. </p>
<p> Well, this is just one of the many things that you can do with the possibilities that LG Wing gives. Besides, the LG Wing also comes with a gimbal mode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It lets you control its triple camera setup, with controls snapped from the gimbal. This is one feature that is quite interesting and is most apt for the design of the LG Wing. </p>
<p> LG Wing to go on sale first in South Korea, followed by North America and Europe </p>
<p> As per the official information, the LG Wing will go for sale in South Korea first. Later this will be followed by key markets like North America and Europe. </p>
<p> Moreover, the price of the device is also now revealed. It is priced at 1,098,900 won, which is $943 in the US. It might sound a bit costly considering it packs a Snapdragon 765G and not the SD 865 chipset. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additonally, as a part of the launch offer in October, LG will offer a 70% discount on the replacement cost of the screen of the main and second screen. However, the damage is to be done within two years. </p>
<p> LG's official source reads this LG wing price tag as the lowest price among the other deformable smartphones launched this year in the domestic market. </p>
<p> But if we factor in that the other 'deformable' phones that came in the market, i.e. the Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Galaxy Z Flip, both are Snapdragon 865 flagships. So, no comparisons there. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Whatever the case maybe, the phone looks promising and it might be just what LG needed to bring back to the competitive world of smartphones. </p>

<p> New Renders Showcase LG Wing 5G In Two Color Options </p>
<p> LG has officially confirmed it will unveil the LG Wing 5G smartphone on September 14. As seen in the teaser images and leaked videos, the device comes in a unique T-shaped dual-screen form factor. Now, the new renders of the upcoming LG Wing 5G finally showcase the back of the device and color options. </p>
<p> With the large rectangular camera housing on the top left corner, the device looks quite similar to the recently launched Samsung Galaxy Note 20. It features triple camera sensors along with an LED flash on the rear. As of now, there is no information about the specifics of these camera sensors. </p>
<p> Upcoming LG Wing 5G will be available in two color options </p>
<p> Furthermore, the camera sensors on the LG Wing 5G are comparatively bigger than the Velvet 5G. The LG Wing 5G comes with a gradient design and will be available in two color options. They look the same as the Pink White and Aurora Gray colors of the LG Velvet 5G. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There is a SIM card slot on the left edge of the metallic frame. Unlike conventional smartphones, the LG Wing 5G sports a 4-inch square display underneath the large main display. Instead of eyeing for a commercial launch to reach a wider audience, the company has confirmed that the phone will be launched under the new Explorer Project. </p>
<p> It will be powered by Snapdragon 765G 5G mobile platform </p>
<p> As of now, there is no confirmation over the availability of the device outside of South Korea. Recently, AT&T launched a new version of the LG Velvet 5G powered by the all-new MediaTek Dimensity 1000C chipset. </p>
<p> However, the Qualcomm Snapdragon logo on the image confirms the LG Wing 5G will be powered by a Snapdragon 5G mobile platform. Based on the previous leaks, the device will come powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G SoC. This is the same chipset that also powers the international variant of the LG Velvet 5G. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The reports from South Korea also suggest the LG Wing 5G could be launched at just KRW 1.09 million (approx. $916). Unlike Samsung, LG is yet to launch a foldable smartphone. Moreover, it's been offering the Dual Screen case with its flagship smartphones from the last couple of years. </p>
<p> With the LG Wing 5G, the company also has to work on the UI front to offer a seamless experience. Compared to foldable smartphones, the LG Wing with the swivel screen should be as durable as the regular smartphones. </p>

<p> LG Wing Specifications </p>
<p> LG has announced a rather odd smartphone today, a smartphone that swivels. The name of that phone is the LG Wing, and we’re here to take a closer look at its specifications. We’ve already covered the initial launch of the device. </p>
<p> The LG Wing is one of the oddest smartphones we’ve seen this year… and ever, to be quite honest. The phone comes with two displays, and you can move the top one out of the way, by rotating it by 90 degrees. </p>
<p> The LG Wing specifications are quite powerful, though mostly not flagship-grade </p>
<p> That way, you get a t-shaped smartphone, with two displays. That being said, the LG Wing includes a 6.8-inch fullHD+ (2460 x 1080) main display. That is a P-OLED FullVision display, and it offers a 20.5:9 aspect ratio. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The second display, located underneath the main one, measures 3.9 inches. That is a 1240 x 1080 G-OLED panel, with an aspect ratio of 1.15:1. The main display offers a ppi of 395, while the secondary has 419 ppi. </p>
<p> The device is fueled by the Snapdragon 765G 64-bit octa-core SoC. That is still one of Qualcomm’s best mid-range processors, and it comes support 5G. It comes with the Snapdragon X52 5G Modem-RF system. </p>
<p> The LG Wing includes 8GB of RAM and 256GB of expandable storage. You can expand this phone’s storage by an extra 2TB via a microSD card. That is the only variant of the phone, by the way. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A 4,000mAh battery is also included in the package. Speaking of which, the LG Wing supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4.0 tech, and it also comes with wireless charging. </p>
<p> Android 10 comes pre-installed, with LG’s software on top of it. The phone includes three cameras on the back, and a single camera on its front side. </p>
<p> The phone features three rear-facing cameras, two of which are ultra-wide </p>
<p> A 64-megapixel main camera (f/1.8 aperture, 78-degree FoV, 0.8um pixel size) is backed by a 13-megapixel ultra-wide unit (f/1.9 aperture, 117-degree FoV, 1.0um pixel size). A third camera on the back is a 12-megapixel unit, and that is also an ultra-wide camera, though this one comes with bigger pixels. It offers an f/2.2 aperture lens, 120-degree FoV, and 1.4um pixel size. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A 32-megapixel (pop-up) camera with an f/1.9 aperture, 79.6-degree FoV, and 0.8um pixel size can be found on the phone’s front side. So, the device comes with four cameras overall. </p>
<p> The phone is also equipped with Bluetooth 5.1, and an NFC chip. A Type-C USB port is placed at the bottom of the device, and this is a USB 3.1 Gen 1 compatible port, by the way. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac is also a part of the package, and the same goes for an in-display fingerprint scanner. The LG Wing includes an optical in-display fingerprint scanner, by the way. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone also supports dual recording, and offers a Hexa motion stabilizer. The LG 3D Sound Engine is a part of the picture as well. The phone measures 169.5 x 74.5 x 10.9mm, and weighs 260 grams. It comes in Aurora Gray and Illusion Sky color variants. </p>

<p> LG Wing Teardown Shows How The Hinge Movement Works </p>
<p> LG Wing is definitely one of the coolest smartphones out this year. The LG Wing teardown shows the hinge behind this unique rotating dual-display design. </p>
<p> LG has never shied away from radical ideas and designs and the LG Wing is no exception. The phone has barely been with reviewers for a couple of days now and reviews are going to start trickling in soon. However, today we get to take a sneak peek inside this cool gadget as Zack Nelson does an LG Wing teardown on his YouTube channel – JerryRigEverything. </p>
<p> Teardown reveals, hinge, riveted plates, hydraulic damper, flexible ribbon cable, and more… </p>
<p> LG has a cool video on its website showing an animation of the hinge. That video reminded me of the really cool hinge Microsoft debuted on the original Surface Book back in 2015. But I digress. It's exciting to see the actual innards of this device on Zack's video. The engineering that has gone into creating the hinge to ensure smooth rotation is simply put; phenomenal. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The engineers have taken the flexible ribbon cable through a circular hole in a corner of the PCB (aka printed circuit board) to connect the rotating display panel. LG claims that this hinge mechanism can easily withstand 200,00 cycles so it will be a while before users encounter issues even if you open and close the phone more than 100 times a day! </p>
<p> It's easy for mechanical hinges to hit this cycle count but to have a flexible ribbon cable do the same is amazing. There is a double lock, dual springs, hydraulic damper, all on a two riveted plates which pivot around that hole through which the flexible ribbon cable is passed through. All of this engineering is so that each time you rotate the screen and close it back that action is smooth, stable and requires uniform force. </p>
<p> LG Wing teardown: Moving parts means no IP rating </p>
<p> There are downsides to all of this great mechanical wizardry. If you are looking for water resistance or an IP rating of any kind, you will not find it here because there are quite a few moving parts. Although to help with an occasional splash or rain shower LG has coated the internals with a water-repellant coating which is a bonus. On the plus side, this should be a great device for watching videos, playing games, and taking videos with its gimbal motion. </p>

<p> LG Wing Pre-Orders Open At Verizon On October 1 </p>
<p> Verizon will be the first carrier to offer the LG Wing, and pre-orders open on October 1. </p>
<p> Today, Verizon announced that it would be the first to offer the LG Wing, in the US. And pre-orders are opening on Thursday. The device will be shipping two weeks later on October 15. </p>
<p> The LG Wing does support Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network, so you can stream 4K movies and download games super quick, while on the go. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As far as pricing goes, the LG Wing will cost $999.99 at Verizon. Or you can finance it for $41.66 per month for 24 months. </p>
<p> Verizon is also offering up a few ways for you to get the LG Wing virtually for free. For instance, you can get $750 towards the LG Wing when you add a line on select Unlimited plans, and trade-in a device. You can also get up to $250 on a Verizon eGift card when purchasing the Wing and porting-in a number to Verizon. Finally, you can get up to $500 if you're an existing customer, and purchase the Wing with eligible trade-in and on a select Unlimited plan. </p>
<p> What is the LG Wing? </p>
<p> The LG Wing is a brand new form-factor from the company. Which has a large 6.8-inch screen that swivels into landscape mode. And still offers you a 3.9-inch 1:1 aspect ratio for doing other things on your phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's a pretty interesting device from LG, to be quite honest. And at $999, it's one of the more interesting phones at that price point. </p>
<p> With the LG Wing, you're getting the Snapdragon 765G chipset inside, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. So it's not quite the fastest smartphone on the market, but pretty close. </p>
<p> The LG Wing is a pretty great device for content creators too. Because it has a built-in gimbal, which is going to allow for some really smooth shots, while moving around. Without needing to carry something like the DJI OM4 with you to get those shots. Of course, LG has always offered up a really incredible camera experience on their smartphones. One might say that they are underrated in that area. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's a device that will garner attention from anyone that sees it. It's not often that a smartphone has a screen that can swivel out and be used in landscape while also giving you a sort of "handle" to hold the phone. </p>
<p> Remember, pre-orders for the LG Wing open at Verizon on Thursday. </p>

<p> Grab LG Wing Stock Wallpapers From Here </p>
<p> LG took the wraps off one of its innovative products, the LG Wing, last month. The device had all sorts of nitty-gritty to catch the attention of tech enthusiasts across the globe. </p>
<p> With its swivel design, LG showed the world that there is always a different way to get those two displays at work. Besides, the hinge-mechanism of the swivel design on LG Wing is pretty sturdy. </p>
<p> Moreover, the company was also able to showcase the actual case scenario of using the swivel mode. Basically, you can watch a YouTube video on the horizontal screen when swiveled-open and have the controls at the bottom. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can play supported games to have maps and other in-game details at the bottom of the screen and play an uninterrupted game on the horizontal screen and that to upside down. </p>
<p> LG implemented a gimbal mode for the camera app, which literally gets you gimbal motion of your LG Wing phone. You can pan, move left-right, and brings real gimbal-like controls. </p>
<p> Though this is achieved via software and not of any hardware, it is cool to have on a phone. For complete coverage of our hands-on review of the LG Wing, you can head over here. </p>

<p> LG & Xerox Have Something In Common, Both Were Hacked Via Ransomware </p>
<p> LG and Xerox have now both been the victim of ransomware attacks perpetrated by bad actors at Maze. That's based on a recent report compiled by ZDNet, detailing the "Maze gang's" hacking endeavors. </p>
<p> Now, the attacks themselves took place back in June. But today, both LG and Xerox appear to have failed to meet the demands of the ransomware. The group has historically breached corporate networks and stolen sensitive files, encrypted the data, and then demanded a ransom. If the first ransom demand fails, it then turns to create a dedicated 'leak page' on its website. That website is used as a threat behind a second demand for ransom. </p>
<p> This week, Maze operators published no less than 50.2GB from LG's internal network and no less than 25.8GB from Xerox. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Why did the ransomware result in published LG and Xerox details? </p>
<p> Neither LG nor Xerox appears prepared to discuss the incident but the group behind the attack reportedly informed ZDNet last month that it had skipped the ransom step for LG. That decision, the group says, was made for several reasons. Not least of all, Maze claims, LG's "clients are socially significant" and it didn't want to 'create disruption'. So, instead, it simply pulled out the LG data. </p>
<p> For Xerox, the details are less clear and Maze operatives aren't discussing the matter. </p>
<p> What was stolen and published and why is this a bigger problem for LG? </p>
<p> In terms of what was stolen, at first glance, LG seems to have gotten off lightly. That's because the data that was obtained by ZDNet appears to mostly be related to source code. Specifically, source code for closed-source firmware associated with LG phones, tablets, and other devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For Xerox, conversely, the Maze gang stole and published data tied to customer support for the company. That included sensitive information tied to Xerox employees and could potentially include data on customers. The full extent has not been entirely explored as of this writing, although no customer data has been found just yet. </p>
<p> But LG has also reportedly been the victim of a second hacking attempt. That hacking effort yielded far more damaging results. The unidentified hackers took advantage of an old server vulnerability to gain access to LG America's R&D center. And that's being sold on a hacking forum for between $10,000 and $13,000. Given LG's current push to innovate and retake market share in the mobile industry, that could prove far more problematic. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/08/linux-kernel-update-old-chromebooks-pixel-acer-asus-dell-lenovo-toshiba.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485268" filename="linux-kernel-update-old-chromebooks-pixel-acer-asus-dell-lenovo-toshiba.html">
<p> Your Older Chromebook, Chromebox, Or Chromebase Will Run Linux Soon </p>
<p> The ability to use Linux on a Chromebook is going to be the norm from this year forward but now at least eight much older devices are gaining that capability too. Code changes associated with the change were first spotted under the 'KernelNext' project codename earlier this year. But that change is now rolling out to no fewer than eight devices. </p>
<p> Among Chrome OS gadgets receiving the update are three Chromebox PCs, one Chromebase all-in-one, and four Chromebooks. The first and likely biggest of those updates is already shipping now for Google's Pixel Chromebook. Acer's C670 Chromebook 11 and Chromebook 15 — codenamed Paine and Yuna — as well as Dell's Chromebook 13 7310 and Toshiba's Chromebook 2 — codenamed Lulu and Gandof will see the update soon too. </p>
<p> For alternative Chrome OS hardware, Acer's Chromebox CXI2, the ASUS Chromebox CN62, and the Lenovo ThinkCentre Chromebox — Rikku, Guadu, and Tidus — are included in the list. Finally, Acer's Chromebase 24 — codenamed Buddy — rounds out the list. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Users will need to be on a Beta Channel of Chrome for this update. That's easy enough to accomplish for those that don't mind a few bugs. It should appear on the Stable Channel by Chrome OS 77 and no later than Chrome OS 78 by most accounts. </p>
<p> What does the incoming update do? </p>
<p> As the KernelNext designation implies, the underlying alterations are associated with updating the Linux kernel for some Chrome OS hardware. That is, at least in part, what makes the codenames here so pertinent. The commonality among those gadgets can be found in their Broadwell-based boards. That is what separates at least some of them, from other devices with the same branding. </p>
<p> The update to the kernel will also change the codename found in the build information listed on the Chromebooks themselves too. After the update, the addition of "-kernelnext" to the end of the model designation should make it easier to tell whether or not the device in question has been updated. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That can be found in Settings under the "About Chrome OS" section found at the left-hand side of the page. </p>
<p> The update should arrive over the air just like any other. Once the kernel has updated, users on those Chromebooks, Chromeboxes, or Chromebase can access, download, and install Linux apps. </p>
<p> Since the update appears to be experimental, two flag settings will need to be activated first. The process for doing that is straightforward. The flags menu itself can be found by navigating to the 'chrome://flags' URL in Chrome. Users need to search for "Enable VMs on experimental kernels" and "Enables VM support on devices running experimental kernel versions" via the on-page search tool. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Using the drop-down menu to switch both of the settings from "Default" to "Enabled" before restarting will turn on Linux. The settings for that can then be found in the Settings application. </p>
<p> The advantages of running Linux on a Chromebook </p>
<p> Presently, the ability to run Linux apps on Chrome OS is an imperfect feature. That's because there are still plenty of caveats such as not being able to record input audio. There are also plenty of benefits to being able to run the Linux apps on a Chromebook. </p>
<p> Among the most prominent positives associated with the apps is Google's recent decision to push the platform for developers. As of I/O 2019, as hinted above, all new Chromebooks are going to have access to Linux apps primarily for that reason. That all started with the ability to run Android Studio via Linux, meaning that Chrome OS users can now develop experiences for the world's most popular mobile OS. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Aside from development, Linux enables users to access a much wider variety of creative tools and productivity suites. There are already a ton of those available in the form of web apps or Android. But the change can, with a short learning curve, open up the possibilities much wider too. </p>

<p> These Headphones From LucidSound Are Perfect For Your PS5 </p>
<p> If you're picking up a PS5 this holiday season you probably want to consider a headset as well, and this new one from LucidSound just might be the perfect fit. </p>
<p> The LS15P is the latest headset from LucidSound and is designed specifically for the PS5, but it will also work with PS4, PC, and mobile devices. Giving this headset some versatility, something which really can't be overstated as to how valuable that makes the headset. </p>
<p> It's also fairly affordable at $99. So you won't break the bank picking it up over some of the other options. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The LucidSound LS15P may not take advantage of the PS5 3D audio </p>
<p> Since this was designed for the PS5, this is likely to be a pretty good headset for use with the PS5. It's not overly expensive, it comes from a decent brand, and it has some pretty good features. </p>
<p> The one thing that isn't clarified though is whether or not this headset takes advantage of the system's 3D audio. One of the big features of the PS5 is the 3D audio, and Sony has confirmed that you won't need it's Pulse 3D wireless headset to use it. </p>
<p> It did not however list which headsets would be compatible. So unfortunately it seems like it's up to the third-party brands to mention that. Something which LucidSound does not confirm in the details about the LS15P. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> 3D audio aside, the LS15P still offers useful features like a battery life of up to 15 hours, a detachable mic with mic monitoring so you can hear how you sound when you use it, and three EQ modes. </p>
<p> The LS15P is also lightweight and flexible so it should hold up durability-wise. It also comes with all the familiar features from other LucidSound headsets. Like the on-ear controls for game and chat volume, mute toggles and more. </p>
<p> LucidSound also makes one for the Xbox Series X|S </p>
<p> Going for the Xbox this generation? Maybe you're getting both consoles but you already have a headset for the PS5 and you just need one for the Xbox Series X|S. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Good news, then. Because LucidSound made a model designed for the Xbox Series X|S as well. The LS15X is the same headset with the same features. The difference being is that it's compatible with the Xbox Series X, the Xbox Series S, and the Xbox One series consoles. </p>
<p> The LS15X will run you $99, and can be picked up from LucidSound as well as through retail partners like Amazon. Right now though, it appears that only LucidSound's own website has the LS15P and LS15X for sale. Amazon however does have other LucidSound options for console and PC. </p>

<p> Many AmazonBasics Products Reported As Dangerous But Not Recalled </p>
<p> Many AmazonBasics products have had reports of being dangerous but the company has decided not to recall them. As reported by CNN, many items have had reports of melting, exploding or bursting into flames. </p>
<p> This is the last thing Amazon needs after reports of unused Alexa hacks surfacing back in August. The company would much rather shift focus onto its new FAA-approved drone delivery program. </p>
<p> The most worrying element of this story is that Amazon, thus far, has not decided to recall the products. Some of these incidents go back to 2017 making this an even more concerning piece of news. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> AmazonBasics products reported as dangerous </p>
<p> Back in 2017, a housefire in Wethersfield, Connecticut was put down to a USB charging cord produced by Amazon. It was part of the AmazonBasics range which first launched in 2009 and now offers more than 5,000 products. </p>
<p> The aim of the AmazonBasics is to source and produce products at a similar or higher quality and lower price point compared to competitors. </p>
<p> The range itself has been extremely successful. Many of its items have become bestsellers almost overnight due to their low prices. During the pandemic, this success has soared further as more and more people have stayed at home. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, over recent years many reviews have expressed concerns about the safety of these products. Since 2016, at least 1,500 reviews, covering more than 70 items, have described products exploding, catching on fire, smoking, melting, causing electrical malfunctions. </p>
<p> These reviews do only represent a small fraction of the overall purchases of the products. Fires related to consumer electrics are also not unique to Amazon products as well. However, this is a big worry for the company. </p>
<p> Amazon slow to recall any dangerous products </p>
<p> Engineers interviewed on the topic said that products such as these should rarely pose any sort of danger. Of the products complained about, 30 had three or more reviews of this type and remain on sale today. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Just 11 of the products concerned are no longer for sale at the time of publication. This number is expected to increase as this story gains more traction. </p>
<p> Amazon's communication of this issue has also come in for criticism. As complaints and reviews of this nature mounted the company provided little or no information to consumers about how it handled the issues. </p>
<p> A number of horror stories have been found with regards to AmazonBasics products. These include USB cords resting into flames with a toddler in the vicinity and surge protector turned into a "blowtorch". </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> AmazonBasics products tested </p>
<p> As part of the investigation, a series of dangerous products were tested. They found that a USB cord was too burned to determine what had gone wrong. </p>
<p> However, testing the microwave revealed some issues. Engineers found that the design of the panel covering the heating device inside the microwave could result in the machine catching on fire. </p>
<p> Michael Pecht, an engineering professor, concluded that "there's a risk in using this machine for sure". Amazon has not commented on whether the microwave has had any improvement made to it. Although the retailer did say that "safety was a top priority". </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon has come under scrutiny in the past for allowing third-party sellers to distribute dangerous products. However, having this pressure piled onto themselves brings with it bigger concerns. </p>
<p> The investigation found that you could explain some of these reports through user error or other external factors. However, the number of reports suggests there were some fundamental flaws in the products themselves. </p>
<p> In theory, reviews using words like "fire" and "hazard" should automatically prompt the retailer to take action. The company, however, declined to provide specific details of thresholds for a review to take place. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> By law, Amazon must immediately report "potentially hazardous" items to the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). This is so the agency can determine whether an official recall is necessary. </p>
<p> Amazon losing consumers' trust </p>
<p> Issues such as this may have the result of losing their customers trust. Especially if Amazon continues to sell potentially dangerous products. </p>
<p> These reviews tend to only represent about 1 or 2 per cent of all reviews on the products. However, the overall numbers still hold quite of a lot of concerns for Amazon and many feel they should have taken more action. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon has declined to comment as to why certain products have been removed from the website after investigation and which ones have not. This lack of communication and notification to customers is what worries them the most. </p>
<p> How this effects Amazon going forward will be interesting. After this news has surfaced the company will likely have to respond publicly in order to maintain public trust. Just how they go about this will be worth taking note of. </p>

<p> MediaTek Seeks US Permission For Supplying Chipsets To Huawei </p>
<p> Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek has now filed an application to seek permission from the US government to supply chipsets to Huawei for its devices. </p>
<p> Well, the trade ban imposed by the US government on Huawei is nothing new, only if you are not living under a rock. The trade ban imposed last year on allegations that it sells user data to the Chinese Jinping government. </p>
<p> Huawei has denied all the allegations as of now. But the US government is in no mood to let loose the Chinese smartphone giant without proper scrutiny. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In fact, it is taking all the steps possible to rise hurdles in the path of business for Huawei. However, fortunately for Huawei, the US government eased off a bit by granting a TGL to conduct limited business with U.S. companies. </p>
<p> TGL means a temporary general license that allows Huawei to perform business on a limited scale with companies in the US. Moreover, the US also banned all its suppliers to sell chipsets to Huawei. </p>
<p> This ease has expired last month, and the restrictions on Huawei has not gotten tighter. Notably, the parties who wish to conduct business with Huawei have to submit license applications. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> TSMC has stopped taking orders for new chips from Huawei </p>
<p> Now a report by Reuters confirms that MediaTek has filed a license application. This permission will allow MediaTek to supply chipsets to Huawei. </p>
<p> Besides, if MediaTek gets approval, it can continue supplying chipsets with Huawei even after September 15. For the unaware, new U.S. regulations take effect on September 15th. </p>
<p> TSMC is the manufacturer of Kirin chipsets, which powers Huawei devices. However, before the new regulations that curb the potential loopholes in the previous rule come into effect, it has already stopped taking orders from Huawei. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Meanwhile, as per the application, MediaTek stated that it has filed for permission with the U.S. side under the new rules. This is pretty important for MediaTek. Because it has stopped taking orders from new orders from Huawei. </p>
<p> The revised rules would require all companies to gain a special license for any transaction with Huawei. So, the application seems in tandem to what it has applied for. </p>
<p> Note that Huawei's upcoming Mate 40 series devices will be the last flagship phone from the OEM to sport the Kirin chipset. The device is expected to officially unveil in the IFA 2020 next month. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So, a lot is riding for MediaTek on this application. And if this application gets rejected, the Taiwanese chipmaker will suffer severe consequences. We will wait on that and see for further developments in this regard. </p>

<p> Meet The Huawei Mate 40 Pro; Design, Specs & Price Leaked </p>
<p> A ton of Huawei Mate 40 Pro information leaked. The phone appeared in renders from a reliable source, along with specifications. The phone’s special edition variant also surfaced in a real-life image, while the Mate 40 Pro+ retail packaging also appeared. </p>
<p> Most of this information comes from WinFuture, so that’s where we’ll start. The source actually shared the renders mentioned in the first paragraph, and the specs as well. </p>
<p> The Huawei Mate 40 Pro design got revealed, along with a ton more information </p>
<p> As you can see in the images provided below this paragraph, the Huawei Mate 40 Pro will be made out of metal and glass. Or so it seems based on these images. The phone will include a curved display, and a pill-shaped display camera hole. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the back, you’ll notice a circular camera module, which does look different than anything else in the market. Huawei’s branding is also placed back there, along with Leica branding as well. </p>
<p> The source mentions that the phone features a 6.76-inch 2772 x 1344 OLED display. That comes down to 456 PPI, for those of you who are wondering. This will also be a high refresh rate display, we just don’t know if it will be a 90Hz or 120Hz panel. </p>
<p> An in-display fingerprint scanner will be included, an optical one. The Kirin 9000 will fuel the phone, and it will include eight cores. Four of them will use the ARM Cortex-A55 architecture, while the other four will use the ARM Cortex-A77. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The all-new Kirin 9000 will fuel this phone </p>
<p> In terms of the GPU, the Kirin 9000 will use the ARM Mali-G78. This chip will support 5G, by the way, it will probably support only Sub 6 5G, though. The EU version of this phone will include 8GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 flash storage. Other variants may include up to 12GB of RAM. The source also confirms that the Mate 40 RS and Pro+ models are also coming. </p>
<p> The device will include a new camera system that combines laser and optical autofocus. It will also include a temperature sensor for more accurate colors. The main camera on the phone will be a 50-megapixel unit with an f/1.9 aperture and OIS. </p>
<p> A 20-megapixel ultra-wide camera will also be included (f/1.8 aperture), as well as a 12-megapixel periscope camera with an f/3.4 aperture. This camera will offer a 5x optical zoom, it seems. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A 13-megapixel front-facing camera will also be a part of the package. Along with it, the company will include a “3D sensor”. This seems to be included so that the phone can recognize gestures, or something of the sort. </p>
<p> 65W fast charging will also be supported here </p>
<p> A 4,400mAh battery will power this phone, and you will be able to recharge it by using the company’s 65W fast charging. Android 10 will come pre-installed on the device, without Google services. </p>
<p> Bluetooth 5.2 will be supported, as will WiFi 6. The phone will measure 162.9 x 75.5 x 9.1mm, and weigh 212 grams. The device will ship in black and silver color options, at least in Europe. Roland Quandt has also mentioned that the Huawei Mate 40 Pro will cost around €1,100 in Europe. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, in the image below this paragraph, you can see the Huawei Mate 40 RS Porsche Design handset. As you can see, it will offer a different design on the back, compared to the regular unit. </p>
<p> And finally, the Huawei Mate 40 Pro+ retail packaging also surfaced. You can see the box in the images below, while not much info is provided. It does say that the device will include 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, though. It also mentions the ‘Ceramic Black’ color, so Huawei will use ceramic here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Microsoft Deep-Dives On Windows Partnership For Galaxy Note 20, Tab S7 </p>
<p> Microsoft Deep-Dives On Windows Partnership For Galaxy Note 20, Tab S7 </p>
<p> Microsoft took to its official Windows blog today to detail some of the deep integrations coming between the PC platform and Samsung's new Galaxy Note 20 and Tab S7 devices. Focusing simultaneously on 'work' and 'play' the incoming features center around productivity on both fronts. </p>
<p> Not only does the partnership ensure seamless cloud gaming on either the new flagships or flagship tablets. It also allows for a more traditional productivity experience than Samsung's new Wireless DeX does. Microsoft and Samsung are doing more than just automatic file syncing, shared app access, and similar features. So Windows users are definitely going to want to check out the new Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and Tab S7 series. </p>
<p> Samsung Note 20, Tab S7 integration with Microsoft Windows runs deep </p>
<p> The fruits of this partnership are the result of an over-year-long partnership and work between the two companies in question. So, as might be expected, the integration of the two platforms is deeper than just a few notification features or basic file sharing. However, both of those aspects are a big part of what the integration does. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To begin with, Microsoft points that out by reminding users that they can log into a Samsung device and tap the "Link to Windows" Quick Settings Tile in the notification shade to bridge the two gadgets. From there, they can link up the Windows platform's "Your Phone" app and gain immediate access to calls notifications, photos, and messages without ever picking up their phone. All of that is available directly on their PC. </p>
<p> But with the new Note- and Tab-branded Samsung gadgets, that goes quite a bit further. Users can also access PC-side copies of their mobile apps, picking up conversations, and more, directly from where they left off. The feature opens up the apps in their own windows in the UI and, with a right-click, can even be added as shortcuts for quick access later on. </p>
<p> That lets users utilize the same apps on their phones and computer for a more versatile and coherent experience. Additionally, it prevents a break in the workflow that could be caused by switching apps. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And that integration continues further still with deeper integration between the devices and Microsoft 365 apps. Now, users can sync their notes automatically between Samsung Notes, OneNote, and Outlook. That includes seamless transitions between mobile device and PC, with better drag-and-drop functionality, note-taking, and more. </p>
<p> Outlook will additionally be integrating Play My Emails functionality into the new Galaxy gadgets. That's on top of integrating with Galaxy Watch 3 via a new smartwatch app. Microsoft is making the integrations work with OneDrive Personal Vault too. So all of that is protected and secure, across all platforms. </p>
<p> It's the features, as much as anything, that makes the pricing worth it </p>
<p> Samsung announced its new Galaxy Note 20 5G series and its new Galaxy Tab S7 series today. And both sets of devices are decidedly not budget gadgets. The former costs anywhere from $999 to $1299. The tablets can cost upwards of $849. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Integration with Windows effectively allows users to move seamlessly between their smartphone and a PC, and then back again. All without losing access to apps, conversations, video chats, files, and more in either direction. Microsoft also highlighted the above-mentioned seamless cloud gaming experience via Xbox Game Pass. </p>
<p> So these may not be the least expensive gadgets around. But with productivity features and gaming stacked into the mix, the cost is going to be well worth it for a significant number of users. </p>

<p> Microsoft Surface Duo Could Go On Sale By The End Of August </p>
<p> Back in October 2019, Microsoft unveiled the Android-powered Surface Duo foldable device. To recall, it was announced to be made available in Holiday 2020. </p>
<p> According to a tweet from Zac Bowden, the Microsoft Surface Duo has already entered production and will reportedly go on sale in the week of August 24. </p>
<p> The recent listings on the FCC and Bluetooth SIG websites suggested the device might come out early. However, there is no official confirmation yet from the Redmond giant. It is expected that the company might start accepting pre-orders in the next couple of weeks. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Surface Duo production reportedly started </p>
<p> We are also yet to know the complete specifications of Microsoft's first-ever foldable device. Unlike the Samsung Galaxy Fold or Moto Razr, the Surface Duo doesn't actually sport a foldable display. </p>
<p> At its press event in New York City last year, the company mentioned the Surface Duo will sport two separate 5.6-inch AMOLED displays with a resolution of 1800 by 1350 pixels each. </p>
<p> These two displays are connected by a 360-degree hinge, which will allow the device to be folded inwards or outwards. It comes powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Mobile Platform and packs 6GB of RAM. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The foldable will be available in 64GB and 256GB storage variants. In terms of optics, the Surface Duo comes equipped with a single 11MP camera that acts as both the front and rear camera. </p>
<p> With two AMOLED displays and a flagship chipset, the device only features a 3,460mAh-capacity battery. It might not even last a single day with a full charge. </p>
<p> Microsoft is yet to reveal the complete specifications </p>
<p> Hopefully the company makes a few changes like bigger battery capacity and newer chipset with the final version. The Surface Duo will run on Android 10 with Microsoft Launcher UI by default. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once Android 11 goes public, we can expect Microsoft to bring the latest Android version for better compatibility with dual-screen apps. </p>
<p> Recently, Microsoft announced that it will be supporting Google's Android dual-screen developer API. We can expect the popular Microsoft apps to take advantage of the dual screens from day one. </p>
<p> The company should be revealing the complete details before the Microsoft Surface Duo goes on sale. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Last year, the company also demoed the Project xCloud (Xbox cloud gaming service) on the Surface Duo. When playing games, one of the two displays can be used just for controls. </p>
<p> Alongside the Surface Duo, Microsoft also showcased the Windows-powered Surface Neo with much bigger displays. As per the leaks, the Surface Neo will likely make its debut in early 2021. </p>

<p> Android News / Android TV / Own The Incredible Mi TV LUX OLED Transparent Edition, Under $7,200 </p>
<p> Own The Incredible Mi TV LUX OLED Transparent Edition, Under $7,200 </p>
<p> Xiaomi has now released a Transparent Edition of its Mi TV LUX OLED and it costs just under $7,200. The company may not be the first to introduce a see-through TV at all. But the announcement does make the company the first in the world to mass-produce transparent television. And it's packed with features too. </p>
<p> One of the most prominent features of the new television is its custom-built MIUI build for TV. The Android-based OS centers its user interface around a Home page, Settings, and My App. But it's also designed to take full advantage of the transparent screen. That includes an Always-On display mode that lets users customize the images and text what's shown when the TV is not in use. </p>
<p> Advanced audio features are packed in as well, complete with support for Dolby Atmos. The AI-powered experience can detect which type of content is on display and adapt the audio to suit, Xiaomi says. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What are the specs with this television? </p>
<p> Now, Xiaomi engineered its Mi TV LUX OLED Transparent Edition to sit on a round speaker base stand with a millimeter-grade finish meant to resemble 'a compact disc'. The TV itself is only 5.7mm thin, making it a perfect addition to any future-forward entertainment system. </p>
<p> In terms of specifications, Xiaomi says the 55-inch display has a static contrast ratio of 150000:1 and "infinite dynamic contrast ratio." </p>
<p> That includes leveraging support for 93-percent of the DCI-P3 color spectrum. So this TV can offer vivid and realistic hues across the board, as well as deep, rich blacks. Xiaomi decided to bring that to life with a 10-bit panel rated for displaying 1.07 billion colors. That color spectrum actually goes well beyond what users will be able to perceive. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Beyond color, the refresh rate with this television isn't at all bad, either. In fact, that's rated at 120Hz with 120Hz MEMC technology. Response times will be perfect for gamers too, at 1ms according to Xiaomi. </p>
<p> Underpinning all of that and Xiaomi's AI Master Smart Engine is a custom MediaTek 9650 chipset. That drives over 20 algorithms for optimizing the experience and 5 use-case scenario optimizations. </p>
<p> When will this transparent Xiaomi Mi TV become available? </p>
<p> Unlike some competitors, Xiaomi isn't making anybody wait for this television to arrive. And it isn't just for the enterprise space, either. The Mi TV LUX OLED Transparent Edition will officially go on sale starting on the morning of August 16. More directly, at 10:00 AM. Pricing isn't exorbitant either. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The tech giant says that pricing will be set at 49,999 Chinese Yuan. By current exchange rates, that's right around $7,198.24. </p>
<p> For the novelty, that's not all that expensive. Samsung's 85-inch Class Q900TS Series LED 8K UHD Smart TV costs $9,999.99 from Best Buy. An AI-powered Xiaomi smart TV that's transparent, at 55-inches, with a wealth of other features, any price under that should be a real bargain. </p>

<p> Moto E7 Listing Reveals Full Specifications, Launch Imminent </p>
<p> Motorola is yet to officially announce the affordable Moto E7 smartphone. However, the device has been in the leaks for a while now. The Moto E7 listing is now spotted on a retail website revealing the design and specifications. </p>
<p> Since the Moto E7 Plus is already available in a few markets, the vanilla Moto E7 might soon make its debut. But as of now, there is no official confirmation from Motorola about the launch of this device. From the images, the Moto E7 seems to carry relatively thicker bezels all around the display. </p>
<p> Moto E7 Full Specifications </p>
<p> It sports a 6.2-inch waterdrop notch display with HD+ (1520 x 720 pixels) resolution and 19:9 aspect ratio. While there is no information about the processor, it will likely come powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile platform. Since the Moto E7 Plus comes with the Snapdragon 460 processor, the Moto E7 might also feature a Snapdragon 4-series processor. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The base variant of the Moto E7 comes packed with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. There will also be a MicroSD card slot for further expansion of storage on this device. As of now, there is no information about the existence of other storage options. </p>
<p> Comes with a dual-camera setup on the rear </p>
<p> It will be running on the last year's Android 10 out of the box. Unlike many other budget smartphones, Motorola smartphones will offer close to stock Android experience with no bloatware apps. While this is true for the unlocked variants, the carrier-locked phones might have bloatware installed. </p>
<p> The device comes packed with a 3,550mAh battery. It is rated to give up to 17 hours of talk time and lasts up to 17 hours on standby. Furthermore, the company is still sticking with the MicroUSB port for charging. Speaking of the cameras, the device sports a dual-camera setup on the back. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It sports a 13MP primary camera, a 2MP depth camera, and an LED flash. For selfies, the Moto E7 comes equipped with a 5MP front-facing camera. The Moto dimple on the rear also comes embedded with a fingerprint scanner. Both the power button and volume rocker are placed on the right edge of the device. </p>
<p> Interestingly, there is no dedicated button for triggering Google Assistant. Even the recently launched Moto E7 Plus came with a Google Assistant button. The previous leaks revealed the Moto E7 to cost CAD 189 (approx. $143) in Canada. Stay tuned for the official launch announcement to know the exact pricing of this device. </p>

<p> Moto E7 Plus With 48MP Dual Cameras Launched In Brazil For $282 </p>
<p> Motorola has officially launched the Moto E7 Plus smartphone in Brazil. It is the company's latest smartphone in the affordable E-series lineup. The new Moto E7 Plus was launched alongside the Moto G9 Plus and Moto G9 Play smartphones. </p>
<p> While there are also leaks about the Moto E7, the company is yet to officially unveil it. The Moto E7 Plus comes with a plastic unibody design featuring curved edges and rounded corners. It will be available in Navy Blue and Amber Bronze color options. </p>
<p> Moto E7 Plus Full Specifications </p>
<p> The 6.5-inch MaxVision LCD display on the front offers HD+ resolution and 20:9 aspect ratio. Though there are visible bezels, the ultra-wide display still looks decent for a budget smartphone. It comes powered by the 11nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 mobile platform launched in January this year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The chipset comes packed with Kryo 240 CPU and Adreno 610 GPU. It comes only in a single storage variant sporting 4GB of LPDDR4x RAM and 64GB of internal storage. However, the users can further expand the storage using the hybrid SIM card slot. </p>
<p> The dual-camera setup features a 48MP primary sensor with f/1.7 aperture and a 2MP depth sensor with f/2.4 aperture. For selfies, there is an 8MP front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture. Just below the square camera module on the rear, there is a circular fingerprint scanner integrated into the Moto dimple. </p>
<p> Comes with a MicroUSB port for charging </p>
<p> Besides, the device also supports face unlock for biometric authentication. The Moto E7 Plus is kept powered on by a 5,000mAh battery, which the company claims to last more than two days. However, there only a 10W power adapter to charge this massive battery. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Moreover, the company is still using the MicroUSB for charging this device. It measures 165.2 x 75.7 x 9.2 mm and weighs 200 grams. Connectivity options include 4G VoLTE, dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, 3.5mm audio jack, and a MicroUSB port. </p>
<p> The device runs on Android 10 out of the box. Compared to other budget Android smartphones, the Moto devices offer bloatware-free and ad-free experience. Even the UI of the device looks close to stock Android UI. </p>
<p> Both the power button and volume rocker are placed on the right edge. Additionally, there is also a dedicated button got triggering Google Assistant. The availability of the Moto E7 Plus smartphone is currently limited to Brazil where it costs BRL 1499 (approx. $282). The device could make its international debut in the coming weeks. Stay tuned! </p>

<p> Moto G8 Announced With Revamped Cameras, Design </p>
<p> Lenovo-owned Motorola has now announced the follow-up to last year's Moto-branded mid-ranger with the arrival of the Moto G8. This time around, the design of the device has been changed significantly in terms of camera placement. That highlights what appears to be the biggest step forward from the Moto G7, while the rest of the design is fairly familiar. </p>
<p> The back panel on the Moto G8 no longer houses a circular camera array. Instead, Moto has moved the cameras to a vertical array configuration, with the primary 16-megapixel "fast-focusing" snapper set apart from other sensors. The LED flash is offset to the right of that, set above and to the left of the Moto logo. </p>
<p> The build is "water-repellant" but does not feature an IP rating or deeper water and dust resistance. A single loudspeaker remains at the center of the audio experience. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Moto's secondary cameras are less well-defined as of this announcement. The entire array is AI-managed and capable even in low light, according to the company. But the secondary cameras are an ultra-wide-angle lens and a Macro Vision camera. </p>
<p> In the former case, the company says that the lens will fit in four-times the content in-frame as the 78-degree primary camera. The Macro Vision lens gets shots that are five-times closer than the standard snapper. </p>
<p> That design change carries over to the front of the gadget. Moto has abandoned the water-drop notch in favor of a hole-punch design for the display panel. The company hasn't provided any details about that camera's specifications. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Moto G8 delivers more than a familiar design with revamped cameras </p>
<p> Aside from the camera system and overall device design changes, Moto has followed suit on its previous iterations in the Moto G series. That starts with a respectable 4,000mAh battery. The company hasn't defined charge times for that but it does indicate that it's designed to allow for up to 40-hours of usage. </p>
<p> The battery supplies power to an octa-core Qualcomm-built Snapdragon 665 SoC, centered around AI processing. That allows for better performance, camera capabilities, and security. Behind that, Moto supplies 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. The latter figure is expandable via SD Card up to 512GB, leaving plenty of space for apps and media. </p>
<p> The hardware enables two software features from the familiar Moto Experiences to a new Moto Gametime. The latter software is newer and, as its name suggests, is geared at mobile gaming. Specifically, it blocks interruptions and bolsters performance in gaming. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All of that resides in an Android 10 firmware environment. As with prior Moto gadgets, that's an almost stock bloat-free variant of the OS, resented to the user via a 6.4-inch HD+ Max Vision display. </p>
<p> Specs </p>
<p> Specifications for the Moto G8 have not been fully laid out just yet. But, for those who want a closer look at what has been revealed, those are compiled here for easier viewing. </p>
<p> Pricing and availability </p>
<p> Moto hasn't provided any details about the pricing of the Moto G8, available in blue and white hues, at all. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Moto G8 hasn't been announced for the US for the new phones either. That's a step away from previous launches of its G series from the Lenovo-owned company. For now, the device is also only launching in Brazil as of today. Other regions will be seeing a roll out in sales over 'the coming weeks'. Specifically, that will be in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Australia. </p>

<p> Moto G8 Power Lite Branding Confirmed In Thailand </p>
<p> A brand new budget-friendly device from Lenovo-owned Moto brand, dubbed the Moto G8 Power Lite, is set to launch at some point in the near future. That's based on a recent report stemming from a recent listing on Thailand's NBTC certification website. The listing shows the device with the model number XT2055-1 but also specifically with the Moto G8 Power Lite model designation. </p>
<p> Not much information is made available on this device. But it does confirm at least a couple of details. For starters, this is a 4G LTE phone. It will work with GSM and WCMDA networks. The Moto G8 Power Lite is set to be produced in the United States. </p>
<p> What's the point of the Moto G8 Power Lite </p>
<p> Now, it's also previously been revealed in an FCC listing that this device model number packs a 5,000mAh battery. That's hardly surprising since the purpose of the "Power" branding is to designate devices that have better battery life. In fact, Lenovo's Moto G7 Power currently occupies that position on the Android Headlines top budget devices list — expressly for its battery life. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company has already revealed some information about the Moto G8 Power though and that should give some indication as to what this device is. </p>
<p> The Moto G8 Power is an Android 10 handset. It comes in a 6.4-inch fullHD+ display format with a 5,000mAh battery. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 665, a 64-bit octa-core processor, will power that device. Lenovo is backing that SoC up with a healthy but not stellar 4GB of RAM. 64GB of storage will provide an adequate amount of space for apps and media. </p>
<p> That's alongside a few novelty features such as Dolby-tuned stereo speakers. Rumors have implicated a 25-megapixel selfie snapper, coupled with a 16-megapixel and 2-megapixel dual rear camera. 18W fast charging may also be a part of the package so that the device will be quick to charge within its price bracket, even if it isn't the fastest due to its battery capacity. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Judging by the "Lite" branding, the Moto G8 Power Lite will be a similar device but the specs will be drawn back. So it will likely arrive with a less powerful processor, less RAM, and less storage. That's not necessarily guaranteed since Lenovo could ultimately only choose to cut any of those corners in any combination. But this will undoubtedly be a lesser, more affordable variant. </p>
<p> When exactly will this phone arrive? </p>
<p> The expected launch timeline for the new budget-friendlier Moto G8 Power variant was initially thought to be around March. But that was also reportedly directly tied in with the now-canceled MWC 2020 global mobile event. </p>
<p> The world's biggest mobile event takes place in Barcelona near the end of February. But GSMA called off the event over global concerns centering around the coronavirus outbreak. Several major vendors and companies such as MediaTek and Intel pulled out of the event well ahead of the cancellation as well. That undoubtedly impacted GSMA's decision to call the whole thing off for this year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That doesn't necessarily mean Lenovo will choose a different launch timeframe for its Motos. But it could, considering the fact that it's lost the world's largest mobile event as a platform for that announcement. </p>

<p> Grab The Moto G Power Android Smartphone For Only $220 </p>
<p> Amazon has the Moto G Power Android smartphone on sale right now for only $219. This smartphone was already pretty cheap at $249, but now it's even cheaper. And a pretty good buy for those that need a new smartphone. </p>
<p> The Moto G Power is a mid-range smartphone, with a 6.4-inch FHD+ display. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage on-board. Making it a really good option for those that need something cheap, but still very capable. </p>
<p> So where does the "power" part of this phone come into play? The battery. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Motorola outfitted the Moto G Power with a huge, 5,000mAh capacity battery. That's the same size battery that is in the Galaxy S20 Ultra. But at literally, a fraction of the price. </p>
<p> With this giant 5,000mAh capacity battery, the somewhat small-ish 6.4-inch screen and the Snapdragon 665 chipset inside, this phone is going to last days on a charge. And we literally mean that. In our review, we found it could last three full days of heavy usage and still have a bit of juice left over. That is fairly impressive, and much better than most flagship smartphones. </p>
<p> Now you are sacrificing a few things here. Like the camera. This camera setup is fine, but it won't blow you away. Motorola has a 16-megapixel main sensor, 8-megapixel ultra-wide and then a 2-megapixel macro. You'll never use that macro lens, if we're being honest. At only two megapixels, and at that distance, it's just going to look awful. But the 16-megapixel main sensor should be more than capable. Providing us with some decent shots. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Moto G Power is an unlocked smartphone, and it will work on AT&T and T-Mobile. No Verizon support here. Nor any support for 5G, which to be fair, isn't an issue right now. </p>
<p> You can pick up the Moto G Power from Amazon today in this sale by clicking here. </p>

<p> Moto G Power, Stylus Are Now Available To Buy </p>
<p> Buyers in the US can now pick up the Moto G Power and Moto G Stylus, each priced at under $300 from Amazon. The devices, launched in mid-February, are the latest addition to the Lenovo-owned brand's mid-range offerings. Each delivers a differing focal point for consumers, as the branding implied. </p>
<p> The Moto G Power is a device intended for users who need a bit more battery power. That's at the expense of camera hardware and storage space. But buyers can pick up the handset in Smoke Black for just $249.99. Conversely, the Moto G Stylus packs in better components on those front in a blue-tinted Mystic Indigo for just $299.99. </p>
<p> As for carriers, the listings note that the phones will each work with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Boost, Cricket, and Metro. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What do the Moto G Stylus and Power bring to the table? </p>
<p> As hinted at above, both of these Moto-branded handsets are going to effectively deliver the same core specifications. But there are a few differences worth noting and reflected in the pricing. </p>
<p> The Moto G Power will be the more budget-friendly of the two. That's chiefly down to the camera components in use, storage, and battery size. The Moto G Stylus packs in a 48-megapixel primary snapper and an 18-megapixel wide-angle snapper. But the Moto G Power comes with a more wallet-savvy 16-megapixel primary lens and an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera. </p>
<p> Both handsets pack a 2-megapixel macro lens at the back as well, completing the three-camera array, complete with a Time of Flight sensor for better depth and focus. Around the front of the gadget, buried in a punch-hole display, each packs a 6-megapixel selfie shooter. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For battery, the Moto G Power delivers 1000mAh more than its counterpart at 5000mAh total capacity. That should enable it to last significantly longer in day-to-day use, aided by 10W fast charging. That comes at the expense of storage, rated at just 64GB compared to the Moto G Stylus at 128GB. </p>
<p> That's essentially where the differences end, however. Each of the two devices features a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Max Vision display panel. Stereo Dolby-tuned speakers and a 3.5mm headphone jack round out the external package. </p>
<p> Behind the splash-resistant build, 4GB RAM help drive Android on an octa-core Snapdragon 665 SoC, clocked at 2.0GHz. Gameplay on that chipset is assisted further by a new Moto Gametime feature meant to tighten things up and stop interruptions. Both phones should play the best available apps and games with no issues. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The final perk, available only to buyers of the Moto G Stylus is a handy frame-docked stylus for taking notes, art, or more. </p>
<p> Where else can these smartphones be purchased? </p>
<p> Now, the company has indicated that the Moto G Power will also be available starting today at Verizon, U.S. Cellular, Consumer Cellular, Google Fi, Republic Wireless, and Xfinity Mobile. The handset will be sold outside of Amazon at Best Buy, B&H Photo, and Walmart. </p>
<p> For the Moto G Stylus, the company says it is selling the device at the same retailers. Service providers, including Verizon, Metro by T-Mobile, Google Fi, Republic Wireless, and Ting, will carry the pricier handset too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pricing will remain the same at each retailer and carrier. </p>

<p> You Can Pick Up The Motorola Edge Android Smartphone For $499 </p>
<p> Amazon has the Motorola Edge on sale for just $499 right now. That's $200 off of its regular price, and brings it back to its all-time low, last seen last month. </p>
<p> The Edge is a very capable, unlocked smartphone from Motorola. It also supports 5G on AT&T and T-Mobile's network. It does Sub-6 5G and not mmWave, unfortunately. </p>
<p> Essentially, the Motorola Edge is a slightly watered-down version of the Motorola Edge+ that launched along side it. Though it does come with a 6.7-inch "edge" display. This is a FHD+ 90Hz display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It is also powered by a Snapdragon 765 chipset, 6GB of RAM and a 4500mAh capacity battery. Which should keep it running all day long without much of an issue. </p>
<p> Motorola has also outfitted the Edge with 256GB of internal storage and a triple-camera setup. That includes a 64-megapixel sensor as the main sensor. Instead of the 108-megapixel sensor found in the Edge+. </p>
<p> The Motorola Edge is going to be available unlocked and it will work on all of the US carriers. However, this is a 5G smartphone and it won't work on Verizon's 5G network. If you want the Motorola Edge on Verizon 5G, then you'll need to pony up the extra cash to get the Edge+ as that one does support mmWave 5G. And that's what Verizon is using right now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is a pretty decent smartphone for those that are looking for a new 5G smartphone, or even just a new smartphone in general, that won't cost an arm and a leg. You're getting some pretty incredible performance here, as well as a big display and a large battery inside. So you shouldn't need to worry about running out of battery. Especially considering the lower-resolution display and slower chipset. </p>

<p> Motorola Unveils Moto G9 Plus With The Same SoC As The Pixel 4a </p>
<p> The Motorola Moto G9 Plus is now official. The phone has been officially announced in Brazil, of all places. The phone was recently listed by Orange Slovakia, which revealed all of its details. Well, this announcement confirms that listing was spot on. </p>
<p> As you can see in the provided images, the phone comes with really thin bezels. Its bottom bezel is a hair thicker than the rest, while a display camera hole is placed in the top-left corner. The phone’s corners are rounded, and the same goes for the display corners. </p>
<p> Motorola’s logo is placed on the back of the device, while the power / lock button is on the right, and it doubles as a fingerprint scanner. A separate physical key is located on the left. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are four cameras on the back of this phone. They’re all located in a camera module in the top-left corner of the phone’s back. An LED flash sits there as well, and the camera module does protrude a bit. </p>
<p> The Motorola Moto G9 Plus includes a large, flat display with HDR10 support </p>
<p> The back side of the phone is curved towards the edges. The phone features a flat display, by the way. Speaking of which, this phone sports a 6.8-inch fullHD+ (2400 x 1080) MaxVision LCD panel with HDR10 support. </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 730G 64-bit octa-core SoC fuels the phone, that is the same SoC that is included in the Pixel 4a. The phone also includes 4GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB of expandable storage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A 5,000mAh battery is also a part of the package, and it does support fast charging. 30W fast wired charging is included, while wireless charging is not supported here. </p>
<p> There are four cameras included on the back of the device </p>
<p> A 64-megapixel main camera (f/1.8 aperture) is backed by an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera (118-degree FoV, f/2.2 aperture), 2-megapixel macro unit (f/2.2 aperture), and a 2-megapixel depth sensor (f/2.2 aperture). </p>
<p> A 16-megapixel selfie camera is also a part of the package (f/2.0 aperture). The Motorola Moto G9 Plus is splash resistant (P2i coating), and it does include an NFC chip. Bluetooth 5.0 is also supported by the phone and a Type-C port is placed at the bottom of the device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are two SIM card slots included here, and this is a hybrid setup. You can either utilize two SIM cards, or one SIM card in combination with a microSD card. </p>
<p> The phone measures 170 x 78.1 x 9.7mm, and weighs 223 grams. It comes in Indigo Blue and Rose Gold color variants. The Motorola Moto G9 Plus is priced at 2499 Brazilian real ($469), and available in Brazil only at the moment. The device may reach other markets at some point, we still don’t have any information on that. </p>

<p> No unlocked variants, carrier locked </p>
<p> Night Mode only works great under optimal conditions and camera zoom is terrible </p>
<p> Lots of carrier bloatware </p>
<p> Charging feels slow, even at 15W </p>
<p> The Motorola One 5G is a next-generation mobile device poised to take its place near the top of the pile in the mid-range smartphone world. And that's not just because of the pricing either, at well under $500. There are a few caveats at its price, of course. But the Motorola One 5G is a phone that can and does do just about everything very well, under review. </p>
<p> Whether I needed to snap a quick photo or wanted to play a game, and even if I wanted to do some fairly extensive photo editing, this phone just performs. And the hardware powering that is coupled with a great display panel that sticks it out at a 90Hz refresh rate. All of that, so that it can take on its competition in the often-overcrowded mid-range without backing down. </p>
<p> Let's take a closer look at how this phone performs in real-world use. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The hardware here is heavier than expected but pretty </p>
<p> Now, the Motorola One 5G is a gorgeous-looking smartphone. In Oxford Blue, the handset has a cross-hatch-like pattern when viewed up-close. But that ultimately only serves to inject different hues under different lighting, as shown in the images above and below. </p>
<p> Of course, this smartphone feels great in-hand, if a bit heavier and bulkier than might be desired if this were a top-tier handset. But its aesthetics really speak for themselves, even in images. And the plastics used in the body and frame are grippier than glass but still have a glass-like smoothness. </p>
<p> The biggest drawback to the materials used, though, is how staticky this device can be. By that, I mean it attracts dust and other particulates like nobody's business. Although the glass does seem to get dirty more often than other phones too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Small touches in the design from this device are nice too. Such as the use of a dual-LED-fueled lightbar for the rear flash, a ring LED around the macro camera, and a power-button-embedded fingerprint scanner. None of the ports are wobbly or loose. And each button has a more solid click-through than might be expected. </p>
<p> The above-mentioned fingerprint scanner is among the quickest I've had the pleasure to use, as well. </p>
<p> In terms of hardware quality and looks, aside from its ability to gather unwanted motes that make it look less-than-pristine, the Motorola One 5G is a great phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The display with Motorola One 5G is very good for the price </p>
<p> The bezels surrounding the display on the Motorola One 5G were a frequent annoyance during my review. They aren't necessarily overly large. And they aren't placed in such a way as to result in accidental taps. They fall somewhere between a budget device and a bezel-free flagship. And the two moderately-sized camera punch-holes aren't necessarily bad either. </p>
<p> No. The problem with the bezels on this phone is that they feel mismatched with the display itself. They serve as a near-constant reminder that this isn't a flagship phone. More succinctly, that's because the display itself doesn't look or feel like a budget-minded mid-ranger at all. </p>
<p> Although — like the rest of the phone — the display attracts dust and smudges like a magnet, the display technology is top-notch. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That, in itself, is an anomaly. The Motorola One 5G only packs a 6.7-inch Full HD+ panel. And that's an LCD screen with a cinematic-friendly 21:9 aspect ratio. Despite all of that, the screen is bright and crisp, looking as close as is possible for an LCD panel to look to an AMOLED panel. And the 90Hz refresh rate doesn't hurt either since that's significantly better than what most mid-range and budget smartphones ship with. </p>
<p> In terms of responsiveness, I didn't notice any input latency at all with this panel. </p>
<p> So how's the battery life? </p>
<p> As we'll discuss momentarily, using the Motorola One 5G during this review meant using a device that was constantly looking for a signal. That's not necessarily bad since it's circumstantial. But it does mean this battery test can't be taken at anything like face value. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In fact, the battery life I experienced because of that was much worse than what most users should see. Especially since I kept the display brightness maxed out and volume up. But, again, it may not be better at all, even if you turn on battery saving measures. Other 5G devices I've tested have drained much more quickly than might be expected. At least when connected to 5G. </p>
<p> Setting all of that aside, I saw a fairly staggering 8-hours and 25-minutes of screen-on time from the Motorola One 5G during my review. That was predominantly utilized for movie and music streaming or playback — for downloads, on the latter. But that was also around 2-hours of browsing, emails, and chatting. And just short of 2-hours for dedicated gaming. With 20-minutes set aside for taking photos. </p>
<p> The charging side is not so great. This phone only took around 45-minutes to reach half-filled. But it takes over 2-hours to fill completely from drained. That's despite that Motorola includes 15W charging for the 5,000mAh battery. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Audio quality stands apart but not by much </p>
<p> Those who love audio are going to love the Motorola One 5G. Not only does this phone pack Bluetooth 5.1 for those who don't use wired headphones. This Motorola still comes with a 3.5mm audio jack. </p>
<p> Audio through those works as would be expected but is made even better by Moto Audio — found in the Settings app under "Sound." </p>
<p> With Moto Audio, users can fine-tune their listening experience with presets. Both for their headphones and their smartphone's speaker. The equalization for each can also be fine-tuned at an entirely another level. That includes bass boosting as well as boosting for treble, vocals, or a flat tuning. The automatic setting will work best for most users. But the options are there for those who want them too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With regard to the built-in speakers, audio via the earpiece speaker is clear. So my app-based web calls came through great, at any rate. However, that speaker is only used for those applications rather than in stereo with the bottom-firing speaker. </p>
<p> As a result, anybody could be forgiven for thinking the audio experience here is going to be awful. Most smartphones are, and that only gets worse with single-speaker arrangements. But that isn't the case at all here. </p>
<p> The speaker in the Motorola One 5G performs on a single output component as well as almost every flagship I've ever tested. And that's saying quite a lot. Sound is balanced with bass being well-represented — if not pounding because that just doesn't happen with smartphones. This phone leaves tinny audio behind for the majority of its competitors to deal with. </p>
<p> Of course, it's also possible to adjust volumes across individual apps or synchronize vibrations with the ringtones. And audio out through the Motorola One 5G mics for this review was on-point. </p>
<p> Performance from Motorola One 5G is exactly what you want </p>
<p> The hardware packed inside the Motorola One 5G is some of the most powerful around. In fact, it's only a step or two down — compared to newer chipsets — being a flagship. So it should come as no surprise that I didn't experience any latency or lag at all in apps while reviewing the Motorola One 5G. </p>
<p> In fact, the one area where some issues could potentially crop up is in multitasking. Especially with less RAM here than is found in a majority of competitors in the price bracket. But I never found that to be the case during my tests. </p>
<p> The sole area of contention appeared when I used some of the most intensive apps around — for photo editing. And that was just a longer wait between finalization and image processing. Otherwise, this phone is going to perform as well as any other counterpart that isn't a flagship. Particularly for users who are fed up paying almost or over $1000 for a smartphone. </p>
<p> This one is going to come very close to matching the top-level standards on performance those phones can deliver. </p>
<p> Cameras are something Motorola has always done well and this is no exception </p>
<p> One area where Motorola smartphones have almost always excelled is on the camera front. The Motorola One 5G proved, under a thorough review of its shooting modes, that it's no exception to that rule. Motorola is still on top of its game on this front. </p>
<p> That is, with one noteworthy exception highlighted in our Motorola One 5G Flickr album. That is, of course, night mode. For whatever reason, this phone has a night mode but that only appears to work under lighting conditions where the naked eye can make out details. In darker conditions, pixelation and other problems become a problem. Blurring, in particular. And even more so when a tripod isn't used. </p>
<p> When a tripod is used, night shots are as crisp as any other phone I've put through a review. Up to a point. Taking shots of the night sky with this phone, even under decent twilight lighting, is not great by any stretch of the imagination. </p>
<p> Zoom shots fall into a similar category, becoming too easily blurred with pixelation starting at just 2-times zoom. </p>
<p> But elsewhere, the Flickr gallery speaks for itself, highlighting the great hardware Motorola packed into this phone — led by a 48-megapixel snapper. Selfies aren't half-bad either, thanks to the quad pixel tech utilized in the dual 16-megapixel front snapper. </p>
<p> Connections are unfortunately limited with Motorola One 5G </p>
<p> Now, this particular phone isn't necessarily unique in the Motorola line-up. In fact, it's very nearly the same gadget as the Motorola Moto G 5G+. One key difference here, however, is just how limited this particular handset is. In fact, the model of Motorola One 5G under review here is only available with one carrier. That's AT&T. There's no unlocked variant. </p>
<p> Other carriers will have their own model. There will even be a Verizon-specific UW model to catch the fastest 5G in the nation. But that also marks the return of a trend toward carrier-specific devices. And that's really no good for anybody who needs a device in the price bracket. </p>
<p> Not only does it cause quite a bit of confusion for buyers. It means I wasn't able to actually test the 5G on this handset. The carrier I utilize for testing is Google Fi. It has access to T-Mobile and US Cellular bands. But not to AT&T, leaving me with only WiFi for this review. </p>
<p> Setting aside that connectivity caveat for this series — and it's one that prevented a top rating here — the connections here should work just fine. </p>
<p> Dual-band WiFi and Bluetooth 5.1 worked like a charm. So, if 5G is as well-thought-out as those, this phone is going to be one of the best next-gen networking handsets around. Or at least that's locked to a carrier with no option to bypass that restriction. </p>
<p> Bloatware is unusual on a Motorola but not the One 5G, unfortunately </p>
<p> There is at least one other major Motorola One 5G issue I noticed during this review. Or at least one other that related to connectivity. And that's bloatware stemming chiefly from this phone's position as an AT&T carrier device. </p>
<p> Summarily, Motorola traditionally installs a minimal number of apps on its handsets at any price. But this device is one of the few exceptions to that. Not only does it come with standard Moto fare, which isn't more than a couple of apps. It also packs in a ton of AT&T-specific and -partner services. </p>
<p> A total of 24 extra apps are in the box ranging from Panera Bread to AT&T-associated news and theater apps. </p>
<p> Most of those can be uninstalled right out-of-the-box. But it's unappealing, to say the least, anytime a carrier forces partner apps onto a phone that would typically be closer to an Android One Program device. </p>
<p> In terms of software features, what users get at the system-level is near-stock Android 10. Complete with dark mode, Digital Wellbeing, and gestures. All of that, and Motorola's gaming and driving modes, work smoothly and without lag. So, generally, it's a great experience aside from the extras that almost no user actually wants on their mobile device. </p>
<p> The included extras such as double-tap features on the power button, theming, and adaptive performance enhancements help offset that. But not by a whole lot. </p>
<p> You probably won't regret buying this phone </p>
<p> Motorola One 5G is a smartphone that really only falls short of an Editor's Choice award in three key areas. First, it's a carrier-specific device. That means it's going to be limiting in terms of who can use it, to begin with. But it also means that there are potentially going to be big software and subsequently performance differences between carrier versions. </p>
<p> The second area it falls just short in is the materials used. Although it feels great in-hand, the Motorola One 5G simply got too dirty and smudgy too quickly under review. That made taking photos a real pain but, more importantly, is going to mar the beauty of the device for anybody who cares about that. And the design here is actually very good. So that's a bigger deal than it might be with some other devices. </p>
<p> Finally, Motorola utterly misses the mark when it comes to the Night Mode on the camera. Although the feature works extremely well on a tripod — at least for shots that are partially lit — that falls apart in darker shots. And it seems to not work at all for taking pictures of darker scenes such as the sky or a night landscape. Low-light shots were just too pixelated when taken by hand too, and probably will be for all but the steadiest hands. </p>
<p> In other words, this phone comes close to nailing down and cementing a position as a top-ten mid-ranger. And it misses the mark on just a very few points. So it seems incredibly unlikely this phone will disappoint anybody who might be considering it for their next smartphone. </p>

<p> Motorola Razr 5G Will Become Available In Europe In Less Than A Week </p>
<p> The Motorola Razr 5G will become available for purchase in Europe in less than a week. This information comes from Roland Quandt, a well-known tipster. He said that the phone is launching in Europe on September 14. </p>
<p> That is in only four days, at this point. Do note that we still do not know when will it launch in the US, at least not exactly. The official information says it’s coming “this fall”, nothing more than that. </p>
<p> It is good to hear that it won’t be a Verizon exclusive this time around, though. The Motorola Razr 5G will be available from Amazon, Best Buy, B&H Photo, and Motorola directly. It will cost $1,399, unlocked. </p>

<p> The Motorola Razr 5G will become available in Europe on September 14, but we still don’t know its price tag </p>
<p> Before it comes to the US, the phone will become available in Europe. We still do not know its European price tag, but it’ll probably be around €1,399. </p>
<p> Motorola still did not release any official information regarding the phone’s availability in Europe, nor its price tag. So, take this information with a grain of salt, as per usual. Roland Quand is extremely accurate with the information he shares, though. </p>
<p> The Motorola Razr 5G was announced yesterday. The phone is exactly what we expected, as not only its design leaked, but its specifications, in great detail. That being said, this phone does resemble its predecessor in terms of the design. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Motorola made a number of improvements, though, so this phone should be considerably more durable. The device features an improved hinge, and it is still reminiscent of the original Motorola Razr. </p>
<p> The phone offers a much more powerful SoC, and various other improvements </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 765G 64-bit octa-core SoC fuels this phone, and it’s a considerable improvement over the Motorola Razr’s processor. The phone also comes with two OLED displays. </p>
<p> The one on the outside is a 6.2-inch pOLED panel, while the one on the outside is a 2.7-inch gOLED display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone includes 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 256GB of storage. Android 10 comes pre-installed, and a 2,800mAh battery is also included. That battery supports 15W wired charging. </p>
<p> A regular nano SIM card slot is paired with an eSIM card here. The phone is water repellent, and it sports a 48-megapixel main camera. A 20-megapixel front-facing camera is also included. </p>
<p> It is worth noting that this phone will also become available in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific, in selected countries. </p>

<p> Special Edition 'Montblanc' Motorola Razr 5G Is Coming </p>
<p> Motorola seems to have partnered with Montblanc to release a special edition Razr 5G handset. This information comes from GizmoChina, who spotted an image of the retail packaging of this device, on the company’s website. </p>
<p> Motorola seems to have partnered with Montblacn for a special edition Razr 5G </p>
<p> As you can see, both Motorola’s and Montblanc’s logos are on the box, as it the Razr 5G branding. This retail box seems to be slated for the Chinese market, as there are Chinese letters on it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Montblanc, for those of you who don’t know, is a German company. The company sells a wide variety of products, and those are luxury products. It is selling watches, bags, headphones, and so on. </p>
<p> As already mentioned, the retail box of the device is listed on Lenovo’s website, but that’s pretty much it. No additional information was given alongside this listing, as the company is obviously teasing the launch. </p>
<p> This pretty much confirms that the Motorola Razr 5G Montblanc edition will be available in China. We’re not sure about other markets, though. Montblanc is a German company, but it remains to be seen if Motorola will decide to sell this product elsewhere. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This variant of the phone will be more expensive than the regular model, of course </p>
<p> The regular Motorola Razr 5G is priced at CNY12,499 in China, which translates to $1,832. Well, this special edition model will cost more, that’s for sure. We’re not sure how much more, but it’s likely to break the $2,000 barrier in the country. </p>
<p> This variant of the device will likely come with a slightly different design, with Montblanc’s logo. You may even get some additional goodies in the retail box, some Montblanc goodies. </p>
<p> On top of that, we’re also expecting some software-related changes. By that, we don’t mean system-level changes, but simply some added Montblanc-related content. Such as wallpapers and whatnot. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Motorola Razr 5G is the company’s brand new foldable. It’s a successor to the Motorola Razr foldable that arrived last year. The device is more compelling than its predecessor, that’s for sure. Motorola did improve this year’s model in a number of ways. </p>
<p> The Motorola Razr 5G is still extremely expensive, though. This device is definitely not for everyone, even if you can afford it. Foldable smartphones are still in their infancy, but the Motorola Razr 5G is one of the few worth buying… though that’s up for discussion at their current price tags. </p>
<p> We’ll probably see many more foldable smartphones in the years to come. Samsung seems to be committed to delivering them, and the same goes for Lenovo / Motorola. </p>

<p> As per the website, the latest budget smartphone is called or rather codenamed Motorola Kiev. The phone will come with Qualcomm Snapdragon 690 chipset. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Interestingly, it will be a 5G enabled smartphone, which is nice to see. It is good to see that 5G is soon going to become the new normal as the future rests in 5G. </p>
<p> Notably, Motorola Kiev will come with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. On top of that, there will be a dedicated microSD card slot for further storage expansion. </p>
<p> The display will be an OLED panel with FHD resolution and will be equipped with HDR support. No high refresh rate here, because it will sport a 60Hz refresh rate display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Motorola Kiev's display size is not known at the moment. However, it is expected that it will come with a notch or punch-hole for the selfie camera. </p>
<p> It is rumored to pack a triple-camera setup with 48MP primary lens </p>
<p> Coming to probably the most important aspect of smartphones lately, the cameras. The phone is rumored to equip a triple-camera setup. </p>
<p> The primary lens would be the 48MP Samsung GM1 primary sensor, with an 8MP Samsung S5K4H7 sensor with a telephoto lens, and a 2MP OmniVision OV02B10. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For selfies, the phone will pack a 16MP OmniVision OV16A1Q sensor. The camera module looks capable, but we will have to test it out in the real-world environment. </p>
<p> Sadly though, as reported, it will be running on Android 10, even though Android 11 is out already. The phone will also house features like NFC and will come in two variants with model number XT2113-2 and XT2113-3, respectively. </p>
<p> There is no information on when this smartphone will be out for the masses. We will keep our eyes on the lookout for any further developments in this regard. </p>

<p> Nanoleaf's Smart Lights Now Come In A Triangle Shape </p>
<p> Nanoleaf's smart lights have long been the talk of every technology-enthusiast and decorator. Now the company is announcing a new line of products based on one simple shape – the triangle. </p>
<p> They are the second set of shapes in Nanoleaf's Nanoleaf Shapes series, which began this past March with its Hexagon series. Nanoleaf envisions the full line to feature a variety of different shapes all capable of being connected together. </p>
<p> Nanoleaf's CEO and founder, Gimmy Chu, shared his excitement about the new design: "With the addition of Triangles and Mini Triangles, we're allowing users to explore and combine lighting shapes like never before," he said. "Bringing together smart technology and thoughtful design, the Shapes Line leads the Smart Decor category for a lighting experience that truly has no limits." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Nanoleaf's new Connect+ technology will make the new shapes even easier to connect with support for Hexagons and more. </p>
<p> The latest in smart lights </p>
<p> LEDs have been identified as the future of lighting and are quickly replacing more conventional types of lighting such as incandescent bulbs or florescent lights. </p>
<p> It has been noted that LEDs are both energy-efficient and affordable due to their 14-year lifespan. Nanoleaf is taking LEDs a step forward by promising beautiful design on top of that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both new shapes feature a snap-on mounting system to make their setup and installation even more flexible. </p>
<p> Each smart lighting panel comes with Nanoleaf's standard array of features including Screen Mirror, touch-enabled experiences, and Rhythm Music Sync. Each panel is capable 16 million different shades of color. </p>
<p> The panels are fully controllable from the Nanoleaf app on your phone as well as the Nanoleaf remote. They also support Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Homekit, and Samsung SmartThings. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Worldwide expansion </p>
<p> Nanoleaf began in 2012 and has quickly become one of the nation's leading startups in innovative LED lighting and design. Its first products were released on Kickstarter. </p>
<p> Nanoleaf is based in Toronto, Ontario. However, in the past several years they have expanded their offices to Europe to become a global enterprise. Nanoleaf's smart lights have been seen in North America, Europe, and the far reaches of Asia. </p>
<p> As for its newest product offering, the Triangles and Mini Triangles will be available from their website as well as Home Depot, Best Buy, and several other outlets. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The complete kits cost $199 for the full-sized triangles and $119 for the smaller size. Additionally, expansion packs are $59 and $119 for the two types, respectively. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / NBC Is Launching Peacock On Multiple Google Platforms This Summer </p>
<p> NBC Is Launching Peacock On Multiple Google Platforms This Summer </p>
<p> NBC is gearing up for a full launch of its Peacock streaming service this Summer, and today the network has confirmed it will be available on multiple Google platforms on day one. </p>
<p> This means it will officially be launching for people using these platforms the same day it launches for iOS and Apple TV. </p>
<p> After Peacock launches, it'll cost $5 or $10 a month depending on the plan that customers choose. It'll also be free for a time to give users the ability to check things out first. In all it won't cost a dime until October. Giving users a four-month window. Think of it like an extended trial period. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> NBC will launch Peacock on Google Chromecast, Android, and Android TV day one </p>
<p> Peacock will officially be launching on July 15 and when it does, it'll be available on the major platforms that Google has under its belt, including Chromecast, Android, and Android TV. </p>
<p> Android and Android TV users will be reaping benefits. As they will be able to use Peacock between July 15 and October 15 completely free. </p>
<p> This will be for the Peacock Premium plans. As NBC also plans to launch a Peacock free tier that will come with the same general amount of content, but a little bit less. It'll also have ads. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For Peacock Premium, users will eventually have to choose between the $5 and $10 Premium options. These are only separated by one having ads and the other being ad-free. When it comes to actual content, both will have the same stuff available for viewing, and obviously more available than the free tier. </p>
<p> Peacock will be the exclusive service for a couple of top shows </p>
<p> Peacock Premium won't be free to Android users forever. But fans of some of NBC's top shows may not care that they'll have to eventually pony up. </p>
<p> NBC is the network for top shows like The Office and Parks and Recreation. Both are currently available to stream on Netflix. But both services will also be leaving Netflix sometime in 2021 when the contract to stream those two shows ends. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Which means NBC will have something to draw in viewers. And viewers who are not yet subscribers of Peacock will have a reason to consider paying money to check it out. Or at the very least deal with ads while subscribing to the free tier option. </p>
<p> If you're looking forward to testing Peacock for yourself, you can do so via the Android app in just a matter of weeks at no cost. </p>

<p> Netflix No Longer Offers Free Trials In The US </p>
<p> Netflix is no longer offering free trials to new subscribers in the US. The streaming juggernaut has new plans in place to try and attract potential subscribers. "We're looking at different marketing promotions in the US to attract new members and give them a great Netflix experience," a company spokesperson told Variety. </p>
<p> Netflix already has a free portal that offers a select number of movies and episodes anyone can watch without needing a subscription. This portal was launched earlier in August. The company also recently started offering some educational content on YouTube for free. With its free trial offer coming to an end in the US, Netflix may now come up with some other forms of content sampling as well. These experiments will likely continue into next year. </p>
<p> This move isn't entirely new though. Netflix began phasing out free trial offers globally some two years back. Starting in Mexico, the company has pulled the plug on this promotional offer in several other countries since then. The US is the latest victim of this strategic change, with the offer ending earlier this month. Meanwhile, it continues to offer limited-time free trials to new subscribers in some countries such as South Korea. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Netflix ends free trials in the US </p>
<p> Netflix, which is nearing 200 million subscribers globally, previously offered up to 30 days of free trials to new subscribers in the US. Users were not charged a single penny during this period and they could cancel the subscription any time. However, the company is no longer offering this generosity stateside. </p>
<p> A Netflix help page touts the company's "no contracts, no cancellation fees, and no commitments" policy to lure new subscribers. "You have the freedom to change your plan or cancel online at any time if you decide Netflix isn't for you." </p>
<p> Interestingly, the help page doesn't point users to Netflix's existing free services for content sampling. "Our plans give you access to our full catalog of TV shows and movies. Choose a plan that works for you and sign up for Netflix!" </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Netflix isn't the only streaming service to cease free-trial promotions in the US. Disney+ also ended its free trial subscriptions in June this year. Amazon continues to offer a month's worth of free watching to new Prime subscribers. WarnerMedia's HBO Max currently offers a seven-day free trial. ViacomCBS's CBS All Access and Showtime services also offer varying week-long free trial periods and so do Hulu's ad-supported, ad-free, and Hulu + Live TV services. </p>

<p> Connect The New Chromecast With Google TV To The Web Via Ethernet </p>
<p> When Google announced the new Chromecast with Google TV, there were a couple of things that it didn't include and one of them was an ethernet adapter. </p>
<p> The other was official support for the Stadia app. The latter is still not available and Google hasn't confirmed when it will be available to download directly from the Play Store. The former however, is another story entirely. </p>
<p> Spotted by Android Police, Google is now selling an ethernet adapter for the new Chromecast with Google TV. It's available from the Google Store directly, but this seems to be the only place where you can buy it. At least for the moment. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In time, it will probably be available through some of Google's retail partners. For instance, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart all sell the new Chromecast with Google TV, but not the ethernet adapter. </p>
<p> The ethernet adapter for the new Chromecast with Google TV is $20 </p>
<p> While Google may be your only source for this accessory, you're probably going to need it when Google finally pushes out support for Stadia. </p>
<p> And if you want to snag it you'll be paying $20 for it. The good news is that you can pick it up from Google right now and it's in stock. So there's no waiting list or anything like that. If you pick it up, you have a few different options for shipping. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Keep in mind though that the earliest it will show up on your doorstep appears to be the end of next week. And that's with the expedited shipping option that costs an additional $16. </p>
<p> If you go that route then you can get it as early as October 22. But if you go with just the standard shipping option, you're looking at waiting a little longer as Google says it would show up on or around October 28. There are also options to get it between October 25 and October 28, and between October 23 and October 25. </p>
<p> It only comes in one color </p>
<p> Though it probably won't deter anyone from buying it, the ethernet adapter only comes in one color. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> White. If you go with the Chromecast in Snow, then the adapter will match. But you can't buy the adapter in the other two colors nor is there any indication that Google will make it possible to do so. </p>
<p> Worth noting however is that the adapter is more than likely going to be out of sight completely the entire time. So whether it matches your new Chromecast or not is basically irrelevant. Because you won't see it anyways. </p>

<p> Android News / Android TV / The New Chromecast With Google TV Is The Go-Anywhere Google TV </p>
<p> The New Chromecast With Google TV Is The Go-Anywhere Google TV </p>
<p> The new Chromecast with Google TV is the go-anywhere Google TV that you may have always wanted. Or at least thought about. </p>
<p> A Google TV device that's just as easy to pack up and take with you as it is to sit back and enjoy the delights it presents to you on the screen. </p>
<p> The new Chromecast with Google TV was first discovered months ago and was featured in a series of leaks. And some consumers were even able to get their hands on it as early as last week. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So there wasn't really much left to learn about the device. </p>
<p> The new Chromecast with Google TV as 8GB of storage and a voice remote </p>
<p> This Chromecast is unlike any other that Google has released. For one it has Google TV onboard. This is Google's rebrand of Android TV, and will be the new name for the technology going forward. It also comes with 8GB of internal storage and a voice remote. </p>
<p> Something which hasn't ever been the case with other Chromecast devices. Of course the reason it comes with the internal storage and the remote are because it has Google TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The voice remote is there to interact with its features. Meanwhile the storage is there to allow the installation of applications and games. </p>
<p> With the remote you can control and navigate the user interface, of course. But it also has two app buttons that let you launch right into YouTube or Netflix. It's also a Chromecast so you can still stream stuff to it from your phone if you want to. </p>
<p> It costs $49.99 and comes in three colors </p>
<p> For a retail cost of $49.99, this new Chromecast is quite the deal. It's not quite as expensive as the Chromecast Ultra (which has no Google TV but it does support 4K UHD streaming), but it does come with the remote and it does a lot more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So the price makes this a pretty great value for what you're getting. It also comes in three different colors. Which are Snow, Sky, and Sunrise, and the device is being sold through the Google Store as well as at various retail partners. </p>
<p> Such as Walmart, where users were able to find it being sold early last week. Since these were on sale at Walmart early, you can likely already buy them elsewhere. If you're eager to get your hands on one, now is the time. </p>
<p> Though these aren't necessarily going to be hard to find. So you may not need to rush out and get one. In fact you may not need to go out and get one at all as you can just buy them online. </p>

<p> New Facebook Tabbed News Feed Coming For Some Android Users </p>
<p> Facebook has begun testing a new feature, namely a tabbed news feed, rolling it out to some Android users. As first spotted on Twitter, the new tabbed news feed will allow Facebook users to sort their post based on visibility. </p>
<p> This all comes in the midst of a very busy few weeks and months for the company. Most recently Messenger has received a revamp, coming with a fresh look and a redesign. </p>
<p> Additionally, the company has faced a number of issues regarding the 2020 U.S. election. Facebook has banned political advertising as well as limiting the actions of some it is users when talking about this topic. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Never to be outdone the developers have also been working on this new feature. The idea is to give users more control over what they see and what they want to see in their news feed going forwards. </p>
<p> Facebook testing a tabbed news feed for users </p>
<p> One can never criticize Facebook for resting on its laurels when it comes to the app’s experience. It has been described as 'bloated' in the past but the company is always looking for ways to improve user experience on its apps. </p>
<p> This new feature aims to make feed exploring more comfortable, as reported by XDA Developers. The idea of a tabbed news feed gives users greater freedom in what they see on their feed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As the above screenshot shows users will be able to sort posts based on Most Recent, Most Relevant, and Already Seen. </p>
<p> Most recent will sort posts in chronological order. Whilst the current default, Most Relevant, which sorts posts based on what we are most likely to want to see. </p>
<p> Finally, there is some confusion over what Already Seen will achieve. It will certainly filter out posts you have already come across. However, it is currently unclear as to whether it will sort posts into chronological order as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The new feature is currently in being tested internally by Facebook and not yet live to the public. The likelihood is that it will first become available through A/B testing. </p>
<p> Like with most of these things it is unclear as to who will receive the feature for testing. It is also unknown how long the testing process will go on for. </p>
<p> However, on the whole, this feature looks to be a positive one. Often one of the problems with the Facebook app is a bloated and boring news feed. Being able to have more choice over what you receive there can only be positive. </p>

<p> New Patent Reveals LG Device With OLED Rollable Display </p>
<p> LG has announced the first 4K rollable smart TV at CES 2020 for $60,000. Earlier reports hinted LG is working on bringing the same rollable display technology to the form factor of a mobile device. The same is now confirmed by its latest patent approved by the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office). </p>
<p> The patent documents described it as an electronic device with a rollable OLED display. However, this is not the first time the company has patented a device with a flexible display. Previously, it has patented foldable smartphones with in-folding and tri-fold designs. </p>
<p> LG patents rollable display device with a stylus </p>
<p> Additionally, this new patent also shows both the hardware and software-based features of the device. Speaking of the device, it comes in a rectangular housing to securely store the rollable display. There is a transparent window on the housing that could use the retracted display to show notifications and other alerts. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It also sports two dedicated hardware buttons to roll-in or roll-out the display. Moreover, the user can manually roll out the display by simply pulling out of the housing. As per the description, the company will be using an OLED panel for the rollable display. </p>
<p> LG also seems to be working on software features like auto-scaling to adjust the content preview based on the rolled out screen size. Notably, the device also supports stylus input. There is a cut-out on the side of the device for storing the stylus. The company currently offers a stylus with the mid-range LG Stylo series. </p>
<p> There is only a single camera sensor </p>
<p> The only camera sensor on this device is placed on the main housing. Unlike its South Korean counterpart, LG is yet to launch a foldable smartphone. It remains to be seen if the rollable device will become the company's first smartphone with a flexible display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the company also decided to experiment with new form factors under the newly launched "Explorer Project." The first device to launch under this project is the LG Wing. It comes with a swiveling dual-display design featuring a 6.8-inch main display and a 3.9-inch secondary display. </p>
<p> During the LG Wing launch event, the company also teased an expandable display smartphone with a slide-out mechanism. This could become the second device in the Explorer Project. </p>
<p> Going by past announcements, the company might showcase its new rollable device at the upcoming CES 2021. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the event will go online-only for next year. </p>

<p> There's A Boatload Of New Ubisoft Games Coming To Stadia </p>
<p> Ubisoft has been a big supporter of Stadia since the beginning, and that's good news for Ubisoft fans because a whole slew of new games from the publisher are on their way. </p>
<p> Some of these games are new titles and some of them are older titles that have been out for a year or more. But all of them are from Ubisoft's biggest franchises including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Watch Dogs, and Ghost Recon. Of the new Ubisoft games coming to Stadia, the first one to land will be Watch Dogs: Legion. Which is launching for the platform on October 29. </p>
<p> New Ubisoft games on Stadia are a healthy mix of old and new </p>
<p> Players shouldn't be expecting 30+ games here. As Ubisoft isn't releasing its entire back catalog of game titles from the last 20+ years. It is however releasing ten new games between next week and the next few months. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As noted above the first title to land on Stadia out of the new ones that were announced will be Watch Dogs: Legion. </p>
<p> After that, players will get to jump into Assassin's Creed Valhalla. This is launching on Stadia day and date with other platforms on November 10. So anyone who pre-orders should be able to play around the same time as everyone else on launch day. </p>
<p> The only other game on the list which has a confirmed release date is Far Cry 6. Which will be launching on Stadia on February 18 of 2021. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Hopefully you really like Assassin's Creed </p>
<p> Assassin's Creed Valhalla isn't the only AC game that's on its way. Assassin's Creed Odyssey is already available of course, but in addition to that and Valhalla, Ubisoft is bringing three more games from the franchise. </p>
<p> This includes Assassin's Creed Origins, the title released before Odyssey, as well as Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Assassin's Creed Unity. </p>
<p> Players will also have access to Watch Dogs and Watch Dogs 2, Far Cry 5, Far Cry New Dawn, and Ghost Recon Wildlands. None of those games have release dates though. So if you're hoping to play them on Stadia anytime soon, you may not get the chance. Not for a little while at least. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Uplay+ will also be available on Stadia at some point in the future. Though there is no confirmed date yet, this service will be an add-on and offer up a much larger library of Ubisoft games for players. None of which players will have to buy because they'll be part of the Uplay+ subscription cost. Whatever that ends up being. </p>

<p> NFL RedZone Is Appearing On YouTube TV For Some </p>
<p> Some YouTube TV subscribers are seeing NFL RedZone appear in their channel listings. Which means that YouTube TV is about to add that – and a few other channels – to its lineup. </p>
<p> YouTube TV hasn't yet announced the news, but that should be coming at any moment now. It could even come later today. </p>
<p> This part of a new "Sports Plus" package for YouTube TV </p>
<p> A number of people on reddit have noticed a new "Sports Plus" package appearing on YouTube TV, and now we are seeing some of these channels on their site. So there is a new package coming, we just need to know how much it'll cost and when it'll be available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Apparently, part of this package will include NFL Network, NFL RedZone, Fox College Sports, GOLTV, MAVTV, Stadium, and TVG. Which are some channels that die-hard sports fans have been begging Google to add to YouTube TV for many years now. </p>
<p> What's interesting is that every network except NFL Network says "Included with Sports Plus", which hopefully means that everyone gets the NFL Network. Regardless of whether they subscribed to the new Sports Plus package or not. </p>
<p> And it looks like this is all coming just in time for Football season – which, surprisingly, has not yet been cancelled. Fingers crossed that doesn't change. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This might be the start of YouTube TV offering a la carte channels, like Sling TV </p>
<p> Since YouTube TV raised its prices a few months ago, many have been asking Google to add packages for YouTube TV. While it's nice to have one package with all the channels available, for some people, they don't need those channels and don't want to pay $65 per month. </p>
<p> Sling TV does something similar. Where you can get your core channels in the Blue or Orange package for $30 per month – or both for $45 per month. And then you can add on packages for between $5 and $20. Giving you mostly only the channels you want. </p>
<p> With this new Sports Plus package that is coming, it looks like YouTube TV might be doing just that. And it's a long time coming. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Hopefully Google announces this sooner rather than later. As we do have more sports starting up in just a few weeks, with the NFL and College Football (some conferences have cancelled but not all). As that is going to make living in quarantine a bit easier this fall, for everyone that is missing sports right now. </p>

<p> Woot has the Ninja Foodi AG300 4-in-1 Indoor Grill on sale for only $112.99 right now. Normally, this indoor grill will go for at least $170. So this is a pretty decent deal for this Ninja Foodi. </p>
<p> The grill that sears, sizzles, and air fry crisps. Indoor grill and air fryer </p>
<p> 500F air circulates around food for amazing Surround searing, while the 500F high-density grill grate creates char-grilled marks and flavors. </p>

<p> It is also virtually smoke free, which makes it great for using it indoors, as it is not going to set off any smoke alarms. It's going to allow you to cook more healthily, while also making some really great foods. That's always a great thing, as we look to lose the Quarantine-15. </p>
<p> This particular model of the Ninja Foodi Indoor Grill does not have the integrated smart probe. So it won't be able to automatically check the temperature of the food you're cooking. That is saved for the "pro" version of the indoor grill. And it's also usually about $50 more. It might be worth it to grab it for some people. </p>

<p> It appears that users with the NVIDIA SHIELD TV are seeing no ads on their devices, while other Android TV devices are seeing the new ads, we mentioned yesterday. </p>
<p> Many users on Reddit, as well as myself, are noticing that the new Android TV ads – the highlights at the top of the home screen – are not appearing on NVIDIA SHIELD TV devices. </p>
<p> This is even after making sure that the Android TV Home app has been updated, which is what triggers the changes. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> NVIDIA SHIELD TV has been exempt from the ads </p>
<p> This makes it look like those with the NVIDIA SHIELD TV are exempt from seeing these ads. </p>
<p> It's a bit surprising that it is not rolling out to the NVIDIA SHIELD TV just yet. But that doesn't mean it won't in the future. </p>
<p> NVIDIA has gotten preferential treatment for its SHIELD TV in the past. For example, it got Amazon Prime Video while other Android TV devices did not. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That's definitely good news for NVIDIA SHIELD TV users, but don't be too excited, as it is likely coming to your device pretty soon. </p>
<p> NVIDIA had no comment on the matter, which means that either they don't know why the ads haven't appeared yet, or they just aren't ready to announce anything yet. </p>
<p> What are "Highlights" on Android TV? </p>
<p> Google started rolling out new ads to Android TV, which are referred to as "Highlights". </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The ads are actually not that intrusive, and I don't even mind them myself. They are at the top of the home screen on your Android TV device, and show off a show or movie that is available on an Android TV app. For example, some of the ads I saw included Moana on Disney+. Which you can tap on it to start watching it, particularly if the app is installed already. </p>
<p> They really just sit there in the background, without any audio or video playing. Which is nice. </p>
<p> So for most people, the Highlights really aren't going to bother them. But these are still ads on your TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We knew that ads were coming at some point. Let's face it, Google is an ad company, and makes more than 90% of its revenue from ads. So it was only a matter of time. But these ads are at least tasteful, which is a really good thing. As it means people are more likely to interact with them. </p>

<p> Android News / Android TV / NVIDIA SHIELD TV Upgraded To 8.2 With 4K AI Upscaler Improvements </p>
<p> NVIDIA SHIELD TV Upgraded To 8.2 With 4K AI Upscaler Improvements </p>
<p> The NVIDIA SHIELD TV is getting its latest upgrade today with notable new features like improvements to the AI upscaler and more. </p>
<p> The AI upscaler feature for the SHIELD TV already supported 4K for 30fps. But today it's getting a little bump. And it won't be just for streaming media like TV and movies. No, NVIDIA is expanding this to games, too. </p>
<p> So rejoice gamers, because this upgraded version of the software eventually applies to your units as well (though, with one caveat). NVIDIA says the 8.2 upgrade should already be hitting devices. If your unit hasn't received the update notification yet, it might be worth checking manually to see if you can pull it down from the servers. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> NVIDIA SHIELD TV 4K AI upscaler now supports 60 fps and more </p>
<p> One of the biggest improvements in today's update is with the 4K AI upscaler. </p>
<p> Prior to the update today, it only supported 4K on HD content. It also only supported 30fps. Not anymore though. NVIDIA is bumping up the support to 60 fps and on more than just HD media. As it supports a number of resolutions as low as 360p all the way up to 1440p. </p>
<p> In regards to the gamers, the improvements to the upscaler are included for games via GeForce NOW. Which now supports Chromebooks by the way. This will be a big boost to how GeForce NOW looks and feels. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Especially if you play via hardware that can really take advantage of these better visuals. Because GeForce NOW will soon finally support 4K visuals at 60 frames per second via upscaling. The one caveat is that this in particular isn't part of today's upgrade. </p>
<p> GeForce NOW upscaling will be included in a software update next month </p>
<p> The GeForce NOW support for the AI upscaling is part of an update that is designed just for cloud gaming. And that update actually comes out next month. </p>
<p> As of right now, NVIDIA hasn't unveiled the exact timing of the update. It's just known to be hitting sometime in September. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Moving back to the SHIELD TV for media, today's update also brings two new customization options for the remote. Namely the long press and double press actions. Lastly there are a few more improvements being added in this update. </p>
<p> SHIELD TV now supports frame rate matching, native SMBv3, IR, and CEC volume control. This update should be hitting all versions of the NVIDIA SHIELD TV. </p>

<p> Official Android TV vs TV Boxes Powered by Android </p>
<p> If you’re new to watching TV through an Android device, then it is important to understand the difference between official Android TV and TV boxes powered by Android. </p>
<p> You see, not all TV boxes powered by Android are equal. While some come running on a platform that’s been optimized for the TV, others don’t. </p>
<p> This might not seem like a huge difference at first, but it is. The way you engage with a device can impact the entire experience. </p>
<p> What is official Android TV? </p>
<p> Android TV is an actual product. It’s a Google product. Google first launched Android TV back in 2014 and since then it has been used by many companies to offer hardware devices directly to the public. </p>
<p> For example, you can not only buy players powered by Android TV, but also TVs with Android TV-built-in. Even more recently, Android TV has expanded to new product categories, such as soundbars. Yes, you can now buy a soundbar with a streaming device built-in. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Put simply, Android TV is a version of Android released by Google that’s been specifically designed to work on the TV. It is Android for the TV and devices carrying the official "Android TV" badge are Google certified devices. </p>
<p> Official Android TV also comes with a wealth of features that you might not get elsewhere. These include the dedicated Android TV home screen, Google Assistant built-in, picture-in-picture (PiP), to name a few. </p>
<p> What are TV boxes powered by Android? </p>
<p> TV boxes powered by Android are often referred to as “Android TV boxes” and this is where the confusion is. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Yes, there are actual official Android TV boxes, but there are also boxes that are not official Android TV boxes. This is in spite of them being for your TV and powered by Android. </p>
<p> The reason is TV boxes powered by Android run on a different version of Android then the one used on official Android TV products. </p>
<p> This not only means the name is different, but the actual user experience is different as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> TV boxes powered by Android are also often referred to as “Kodi boxes.” </p>
<p> What are the benefits of official Android TV? </p>
<p> The most obvious benefit of official Android TV is the user experience. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google has optimized Android TV to run on the TV. This is an important distinction. An even easier way to understand the difference is that official Android TV is optimized for use with remote control presses. </p>
<p> This is in contrast to Android mobile and its emphasis on touches. For example, you tap on apps with Android mobile, but you press buttons on a remote for Android TV. </p>
<p> Due to this difference all the apps compatible with Android TV devices have to be optimized in the same way. These apps need to work with remote presses, and utilize an interface that’s easier to see and navigate from a distance. Unlike a smartphone were things can be smaller and just tapped on. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Another of the main benefits of official Android TV is the consistency of the product and experience. Regardless of whether you actually like Android TV or not, it is a highly consistent platform. </p>
<p> Google has set rules in place that mean device makers have to produce a certain Android TV experience. One that looks a certain way, acts a certain way, is a certain way. </p>
<p> There are some deviations to this rule. For example, companies are able to do smaller tweaks, like what's seen with the NVIDIA SHIELD. Then there are also operators who employ more of a while label version of Android TV and then impose their own interface on top of. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Regardless of these deviations, Android TV is consistent at its core. </p>
<p> What are the benefits of TV boxes powered by Android? </p>
<p> One of the clear benefits with TV boxes powered by Android is the freedom. Official Android TV is a restricted platform, TV boxes powered by Android are not bound by the same restrictions. </p>
<p> This is most obviously seen in the degree of apps that are available. Right now, Google claims there’s more than 5,000 apps available to download on the official Android TV. </p>
<p> While that’s a number suitable for most average users, it’s nothing compared to how many apps are available through the Google Play Store in general. </p>
<p> As TV boxes powered by Android are not bound by Google’s TV restrictions, the number of apps available is far greater. The comparison is almost pointless as it is likely official Android TV will never support as many apps as you can download on TV boxes powered by Android. </p>
<p> The freedom point extends well beyond apps as well. For example, device makers are also free to customize the experience to their liking. By the same token, so can the user, if they know what they are doing. </p>
<p> Overall, the version of Android used on these TV boxes is akin to the open source version of Android. It’s open and that means there's a world of possibilities available. </p>
<p> Another of the advantages of TV boxes powered by Android is that they tend to be much cheaper than official Android TV devices. This is not always the case as you can get some expensive TV boxes powered by Android TV as well. </p>
<p> Generally speaking, the majority of official Android TV devices are priced higher than the entry-level segment. There are some entry-level official Android TV products, just not many at all. </p>
<p> In contrast, you can buy a TV box powered by Android for really cheap. More to the point, you have a choice of products at the same cheap price point to select from. </p>
<p> What are the issues with Android TV? </p>
<p> As discussed in the last section, one of the major issues with Android TV is the level of app support. Now, this is a problem Google has been slowly remedying and app support has grown over the last few years considerably. </p>
<p> But that’s not the same as where the app support could and should be. </p>
<p> While it is unlikely you’ll have an issue downloading most of the major streaming or live TV streaming apps, that’s not true for every major streaming or live TV streaming app. AT&T TV and Apple TV are just two prime examples. </p>
<p> In fact, while Prime Video is now available on Android TV, that’s a recent development. Prime Video is still not available on all Android TV devices. </p>
<p> Another fairly major problem with Android TV is the updates. Android in general has always suffered a fragmentation issue and Android TV has followed in the same footsteps. </p>
<p> Some brands, like NVIDIA, are extremely good and reliable for regular updates, but others are less so. Buying an Android TV device with an expected level of frequent updates will depend highly on the brand you select. </p>
<p> Even if you opt for one of the more reliable brands, there’s still the issue of aging Android versions. Right now Android mobile is operating at an Android 10 level. In contrast, the newest Android TV devices launching currently run on Android 9 Pie. </p>
<p> Again, due to the updating situation, many existing Android TV devices are running much older versions. </p>
<p> Competing platforms such as tvOS, Fire TV and Roku OS do not suffer in the same respect. </p>
<p> What are the issues with TV boxes powered by Android? </p>
<p> There’s a few issues when it comes to TV boxes powered by Android. </p>
<p> The first is consistency and reliability. While the freedom offered by TV boxes powered by Android can be seen as a good thing, it can also be seen as a bad thing. </p>
<p> Device makers can largely make any experience they want and sometimes, they are not the best experience. Let alone the best experience for the TV. </p>
<p> For example, interfaces can be more clunky and this can lead to a less than ideal TV experience. Likewise, while the level of available apps is greater than official Android TV, there’s no guarantee an app you download will have been optimized for Android TV. </p>
<p> So the reliability and consistency, and especially when it comes to navigation, not only extends to the interface, but also some apps as well. </p>
<p> Another possible cause for concern with TV boxes powered by Android is the updates. While official Android TV devices have their own update problems, buying a TV box powered by Android is not a solution to that problem. </p>
<p> Once again you are at the mercy of the device maker and considering these are sold as cheap products to begin with, there probably should not be a great expectation on future updates. </p>
<p> More to the point, as this is not an official Android TV you’re unlikely to get updates that add the same level of optimized functionality. </p>
<p> Popular official Android TV devices </p>
<p> Compared to TV boxes powered by Android, there's not a lot of choice when it comes to dedicated official Android TV devices. </p>
<p> Below you'll find two of the most popular official Android TV players you can buy today. </p>
<p> NVIDIA SHIELD TV </p>
<p> Arguably, the NVIDIA SHIELD TV is the most poplar Android TV device around. </p>
<p> Either way, it is certainly the most powerful thanks to the use of the company's own Tegra X1 SoC. The all-new NVIDIA SHIELD TV and SHIELD TV Pro utilize a newer + version of the Tegra X1. </p>
<p> This makes them even more powerful than previous models and capable of supporting new features, such as AI-enhanced upscaling. </p>
<p> This also happens to be one of the more expensive Android TV devices in circulation. Pricing currently starts at $149.99 in the U.S. with the price rising to $$199 if you want the Pro version. </p>
<p> The NVIDIA SHIELD TV is available to buy from various retailers including Amazon. </p>
<p> To find out more about the NVIDIA SHIELD TV, read our full review. </p>
<p> Xiaomi Mi Box S </p>
<p> To be honest, the Xiaomi Mi Box is not in the same league as the SHIELD TV, but then again, it's not designed to be. </p>
<p> Instead, the Xiaomi Mi Box is designed as an affordable 4K streaming device. </p>
<p> To put the price gulf into perspective, while the SHIELD TV starts at $150, the Mi Box S is priced around $60. This inevitably makes the Mi Box a more accessible device to more people. </p>
<p> You can pick the Xiaomi Mi Box S up from a number of online retailers including Amazon. </p>
<p> To find our more about the Xiaomi Mi Box S, read our full review. </p>
<p> Popular TV boxes powered by Android </p>
<p> When it comes to TV boxes powered by Android TV, there's a lot to choose from. There's also no absolute ranking when it comes to which devices are the best. This is probably a result of the wide selection and how varied the user experience and features can be. </p>
<p> For example, below is just two examples of popular TV boxes powered by Android. One at a higher price point, and one at the lower end. </p>
<p> Beelink GT King </p>
<p> Almost immediately, it is clear to see just how different a TV box powered by Android TV can be. TV box makers sometimes go out of their way to make their's look different and the Beelink GT King is no exception. </p>
<p> Besides the design, this is also a fairly high spec TV box compared to official Android TV. For example, with the Beelink GT King you get 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. Those figures even put the new SHIELD TV to shame. Although the processor in use here is the Amlogic S922X. The use of Amlogic processors in TV boxes powered by Android is fairly common. </p>
<p> Some of the additional features include Android 9 Pie, a voice-activated remote, 4K at 60fps and Bluetooth 4.1. </p>
<p> The Beelink GT King currently costs around $125 and can be picked up from a number of retailers including Amazon. </p>
<p> H96 MAX </p>
<p> While the Beelink GT King is a fairly expensive device, that's not to say you have to spend over $100 on a TV box powered by Android. In fact, most are priced well below $100 and this includes the H96 MAX. </p>
<p> In spite of the considerably lower price, the H96 MAX is another device that comes packing the specs. For example, you once again are looking at 4GB RAM, 64GB storage and Android 9 Pie. Good luck finding those specs on an official Android TV device, let alone one that you can currently buy for around $50. </p>
<p> Some of the other notable features include 4K, Bluetooth 4.0, USB 3.0, and a Rockchip RK3318 processor. </p>
<p> The H96 MAX is available to buy from a number of online retailers including Amazon. </p>
<p> Official Android TV vs TV boxes powered by Android </p>
<p> If you came here looking for a definitive answer on which is the better solution for you, that's a decision you'll have to make on your own. </p>
<p> The truth is, both have their distinct benefits and also their own selection of problems. </p>
<p> Official Android TV is just that. It’s Google’s official Android version for the TV. You can expect an as reliable experience as possible and the TV experience Google wants Android users to have. </p>
<p> However, you are limiting yourself in terms of the apps you can download, and the things you can do with a device. </p>
<p> In contrast, if you want the ultimate freedom that Android offers, and the option to do what you want with a device, then TV boxes powered by Android are likely to be the better option for you. </p>
<p> That is, as long as you don’t mind a less visually attractive interface or some user experience obstacles along the way. </p>

<p> Official Galaxy Tab S7+ Wallpapers Are Now Available For Download </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+ launch in just about a few weeks from now. Ahead of that, the official wallpapers for the Galaxy Tab S7+ are now available for download. </p>
<p> Samsung has created a series of colorful wallpapers with an abstract design for its upcoming flagship Android tablet. The folks over at SamMobile have been able to get hold of twelve of the new high-definition wallpapers. All of them feature the same abstract design but with different color schemes. </p>
<p> You can take a look at a select few in the gallery below. If the design appeals to you, you can hit the source link below to download the wallpapers in full size. It is a 76MB ZIP archive containing the twelve Galaxy Tab S7+ wallpapers in a resolution of 2800 by 2800 pixels. We advise not to download the wallpapers from the gallery itself. Those images have been compressed, thus degrading their quality. </p>

<p> Galaxy Tab S7+ wallpapers available ahead of August 5 launch </p>
<p> Samsung has a Galaxy Unpacked virtual event scheduled for August 5, 2020. This is where the company is expected to take wraps off the heavily leaked Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+. </p>
<p> The Tab S7 duo have leaked extensively over the past couple of months. Featuring 11-inch and 12.4-inch displays respectively, both models will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ processor. The two upcoming Samsung tablets will run Android 10 with One UI 2.5 out of the box. </p>
<p> Beautiful AMOLED screens with a 120Hz refresh rate, quad AKG-tuned speakers, dual rear cameras, up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB storage, S Pen support, and official keyboard accessories are also expected with the two tablets. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the Galaxy Tab S7+ gets a massive 10,090mAh battery, the vanilla Tab S7 settles for a relatively smaller 7,760mAh battery. The smaller model also misses out on an in-display fingerprint scanner. It'll feature a capacitive fingerprint sensor embedded into the power button. Additionally, The Tab S7+ will also come in a 5G variant in select markets. The standard model will only be available in LTE and Wi-Fi variants. </p>
<p> Samsung will unveil a host of products at the Galaxy Unpacked event early next month. Along with the Galaxy Tab S7 duo, the company also has two Galaxy Note 20 models, the Galaxy Z Flip 5G, Galaxy Watch 3, Galaxy Buds Live, and the Galaxy Z Fold 2 pending launch. Some of these devices may launch early, while the Fold 2 is expected to arrive a little late. </p>
<p> With just a few weeks to go for the launch, expect the official wallpapers for the Galaxy Note 20 series to show up in the coming days. In the meantime, check out the official wallpapers for the Galaxy Tab S7+ below. Click here to download the original files. </p>

<p> OnePlus 6 & 6T Performance & Security Boosted Via New Update </p>
<p> The OnePlus 6 and 6T handsets have started receiving a new update which improves the performance and security on the two devices. This update is marked as OxygenOS 10.3.6 for both devices. </p>
<p> The update is rolling out as we speak, and it will reach your device OTA (Over-The-Air). This is a staged update, so it won’t roll out to everyone straight away. Later in the article, however, we’ll explain how you can update it immediately. </p>
<p> This update brings various system stability improvements to the two devices, and also some general bug fixes. OnePlus did not go into detail regarding any of that, however. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This OnePlus 6 & 6T update is all about boosted performance & security </p>
<p> On top of that, the official changelog mentions that this update brings a new Android security patch to the tablet. A security patch for September 2020 has landed on the devices. </p>
<p> That is pretty much everything that got listed in the changelog. Running a VPN in order to update won’t exactly do you much good. This update is not region-based, nor will one region get it before the other. </p>
<p> Having that in mind, you can update manually, if you want. You can flash the update manually by downloading full OTA update files. The full OTA file for the OnePlus 6 can be found here, while you can download it for the OnePlus 6T by clicking here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you do not exactly what you’re doing, you should avoid doing this, however. This is not your regular click-and-install process. If you’re not familiar with flashing, simply wait for the update to arrive. </p>
<p> The OTA update should reach your device within a week. Well, unless OnePlus spots a new major bug in the near future, in which case it may halt the update. It has happened several items in the past, but usually, everything is alright. </p>
<p> There you have it. This is not a huge update for the two phones, but these two handsets are not exactly new at this point. It’s nice to see some quality of life updates reaching them, though. </p>

<p> OnePlus 7, 7 Pro, 7T & 7T Pro To Get Android 11 In December </p>
<p> OnePlus recently started rolling out Android 11 to the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro smartphones and we now have a timeline for the OnePlus 7 series devices as well. The 2019 models will get the latest iteration of Android in December this year, a company spokesperson confirmed to Android Authority. This confirmation comes against recent rumors suggesting that 2019 OnePlus flagships would not see Android 11 before 2021. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 7 series comprises of four models powered by two different chipsets. The OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro feature the Snapdragon 855 SoC while the newer OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro get the Snapdragon 855+. The latter two are likely to get the big update first, followed by older models. This timeline should also cover the 5G versions of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. </p>
<p> Interestingly, there's no mention of the OnePlus Nord anywhere. The mid-range OnePlus smartphone launched a couple of months back running Android 10. Hopefully, Android 11 for this device would also arrive by the end of this year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Android 11 update timeline for OnePlus 7 series confirmed </p>
<p> OnePlus is among the fastest when it comes to rolling out major Android OS updates to its smartphones, largely thanks to its small smartphone portfolio. The company earlier launched only two phones in a year. </p>
<p> However, the company is now gradually expanding its smartphone portfolio. It launched four flagship models last year and entered the mid-range segment with OnePlus Nord this year. This will certainly put some strain on the company's upgrade speeds, but not by much, it seems. </p>
<p> While OnePlus has yet to officially announce an Android 11 update roadmap for its smartphones, this tentative December timeline for 2019 models will still likely beat out many rival brands. Samsung has yet to push a stable Android 11 update to any of its phones. It only recently began public beta testing of Android 11-based OneUI 3.0 with the Galaxy S20 series. The Korean company is unlikely to update any of its 2019 models with Android 11 this year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OnePlus will also likely seed beta versions of Android 11-based OxygenOS 11 to its 2019 flagships ahead of the stable release. With just around two months left for the tentative schedule, it shouldn't be too long now before the beta testing begins. </p>
<p> OxygenOS 11 brings several new features and enhancements to OnePlus' custom Android skin. Always-On Display (AOD) is one of the notable new features. The user interface (UI) also sees a big overhaul for easy one-handed usage. The OxygenOS 11 UI now resembles Samsung's One UI. </p>
<p> While OnePlus prepares to push Android 11 to its older smartphones, it launched the OnePlus 8T yesterday, with Android 11 of course. The company is also expected to launch two new models in the affordable Nord series later this month. </p>

<p> Grab The 12/256GB Variant Of The OnePlus 8 Pro For $900 </p>
<p> Amazon has a great deal on the higher-end model of the OnePlus 8 Pro. With 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, it is now just $899. That's $100 off of its regular price and makes this a really great time to grab one. </p>
<p> This is not a huge discount on the OnePlus 8 Pro, but it is still a discount, and the biggest one we've seen since the phone launched earlier this year. </p>
<p> With the OnePlus 8 Pro you can watch your favorite shows and movies on a state-of-the-art 6.78" QHD+ display with brilliant color accuracy and a seamless 120 Hz refresh rate. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Experience faster upload and download speeds along with lower latency when connected to a 5G network. There's also a Snapdragon 865 chipset inside running the show here. </p>
<p> It also has a 48-megapixel sensor on the back, with ultra-wide and telephoto lenses. There is even a 8-megapixel macro sensor available, which is actually very useful. Unlike the 2-megapixel macro lens on the OnePlus 8 and Nord smartphones. </p>
<p> There is a 4510mAh capacity battery inside, that should get you through the day. But if not, you can speed up your charge with Warp Charge Wireless 30 for fast wireless charging and Warp Charge 30T technology when you need to plug in. </p>

<p> OnePlus with Alexa Built-in provides Hands-Free access to Alexa. Simply say “Alexa” to play music make a call control your smart home check the weather and more using just your voice. Stay up to date and accomplish every day tasks, all while on-the-go. Just ask – and Alexa will respond instantly. How cool is that? </p>
<p> The base-model OnePlus 8 Pro is currently out of stock on Amazon, but likely not discounted at all. Basically, you're getting the upgraded model for the same price though. It's available in black onyx and Ultramarine Blue. You can pick up the OnePlus 8 Pro from Amazon by clicking here. </p>

<p> OnePlus 8T Adopts Dual-Battery Design With 65W Fast Charging </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T got announced today, and it looks very prominent when it comes to the battery department. This phone not only features a large battery, but the technology used here is also quite interesting. </p>
<p> That technology is why we’re here for, as we’ll explain how all of this works. So, OnePlus basically adopted a dual-battery design for the OnePlus 8T. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T charing maxes out at 65W, approximately 33W per battery </p>
<p> The phone comes with two 2,250mAh units, which make a 4,500mAh battery when combined. Now, OnePlus is actually utilizing approximately 33W fast charging per battery, so that it doesn’t damage it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pushing 65W directly would deteriorate the battery quickly, which is why the company opted for this approach. Furthermore, this charging is being done via the company’s proprietary cable and adapter. </p>
<p> The company calls it ‘Warp Charge 65’, as you probably already know. Speaking of which, wireless charging is not available here. One of the reasons for that may be the price bump it would cause, while the other was shared by a OnePlus employee. </p>
<p> One of the prototypes had wireless charging </p>
<p> He told us that one of the prototypes of the device had wireless charging. That addition made the phone 0.6mm thicker, and that didn’t sit right with the company’s CEO, Pete Lau. He wanted the phone to be thinner. That could be another reason for the omittance of wireless charging. Another thing worth noting is that reverse (wireless) charging is also not available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T also comes with a ton of separate temperature sensors, just to be sure. On top of that, the new vapor chamber is 285-percent larger than the one used in the OnePlus 8 series. That should keep the phone even cooler. </p>
<p> Some of you are probably wondering how fast this charging is in practice… well, it’s immensely fast. It will charge the OnePlus 8T’s 4,500mAh battery from 0 to 58-percent in only 15 minutes. In order to take full charge (from 0-percent), it will take only 39 minutes. OnePlus claims that the OnePlus 8T batteries will keep over 80-percent of integrity after 800 charge cycles, so you don't have to worry about that, at least not for the next couple of years. </p>
<p> Another thing worth noting is that you can charge this phone with adapters from other OnePlus phones. That has been confirmed to us, so if you use a charger for the OnePlus 8 to charge this phone, that’s not a problem, it will just charge up a bit slower. </p>

<p> OnePlus 8T Is A Better Buy Than The Galaxy S20 FE, Here's Why </p>
<p> I do believe that the OnePlus 8T is a better buy than the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, though many of you would probably disagree. Hear me out before you reach, though. In this article, I’ll do my best to explain why I feel this way. Both of these phones were announced quite recently, and the reason why I’m comparing them directly is simply… they’re similarly-priced, and both are aiming to be affordable flagships, in a way. Both of these phones are considerably cheaper than the most premium flagships out there, and that will probably make them appealing to quite a few people. Despite the fact they’re more affordable, you’re not really losing out on much. That’s a story for a different day, though, as we’ll focus on these two phones in this article. </p>
<p> So, from my point of view, every phone has its advantages and disadvantages, and those are the easiest to see if you compare a specific device to another phone. Well, this isn’t exactly a comparison article, so I’ll structure it a bit differently. I’ll give out my reasons why I think the OnePlus 8T is a better buy than the Galaxy S20 FE, each of them will come as a separate section of the article. That being said, let’s get started. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S20 FE’s plastic back is more prone to scratches </p>
<p> Even though it may seem like both of these phones are made out of metal and glass at first, that’s not the case. The Galaxy S20 FE does feature an aluminum frame, and glass on top of its display, but its back is made out of plastic. Samsung opted to use plastic on the back of this phone, similar to what it did with the Galaxy Note 20. OnePlus, on the other hand, opted for Gorilla Glass 5 on the back of the OnePlus 8T. Plastic is not bad, per se, but it’s considered to be a lower-grade material than glass. Samsung is calling the Galaxy S20 FE backplate ‘glasstic’, but it’s plastic no matter the way you spin it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is not exactly your fancy plastic, or anything like that, and it does scratches more easily than glass. That’s not surprising, but it may be an issue if you use your phones without a case. Scratching up plastic is not a problem, as we’ve found out on a number of occasions. Gorilla Glass 5, on the flip side, is much more difficult to scratch up. Placing it on surfaces repeatedly may become an issue for the Galaxy S20 FE in terms of scratches, even if you’re being careful about it. Therefore, the OnePlus 8T may be a better option of the two. Both phones are quite sturdy, though, and feel really well-made. </p>
<p> You get more RAM with the OnePlus 8T </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE does ship with less RAM than the OnePlus 8T. Truth be said, the Galaxy S20 FE does include faster RAM, though. Samsung’s smartphone comes with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM, while the OnePlus 8T offers 8GB / 12GB of LPDDR4X RAM. Now, I’d argue that more LPDDR4X RAM trumps less LPDDR5 RAM, but that’s just me. In terms of initial performance testing, both phones are blazing fast. RAM was not an issue on either phone. 6GB of RAM may become an issue down the road, though, that’s what I’m afraid of. So if you’re planning to keep the Galaxy S20 FE for a long time, and use it for RAM-intensive tasks, keep that in mind. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In terms of storage, well, both use UFS 3.1 flash storage, while some phones are still stuck on UFS 2.1. This is a considerable advantage for both phones performance-wise, and is, in a way, future-proofing both of them. I’m glad to see that both OEMs decided to go with such fast flash storage. For comparison’s sake, Google paired LPDDR4X with UFS 2.1 on every single one of its new Pixel phones. That goes for the Pixel 4a, 4a 5G, and 5. The company was kind of limited in that regard because of the SoCs it used in those phones, but still… it’s something worth noting for comparison’s sake. </p>
<p> It offers much faster charging, and includes maxed-out charger in the box </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T does not only offer faster charging in general, but it includes an appropriate charger in the box. The OnePlus 8T supports 65W fast wired charging, and it includes a 65W charger in the box. The Galaxy S20 FE, on the other hand, supports 25W charging, but a 25W charger is not included. Samsung ships a 15W charger with the Galaxy S20 FE, which is simply not something companies should do. If the phone offers 25W charging, then include an appropriate adapter for that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T can charge up from 0 to 58-percent in only 15 minutes. The Galaxy S20 FE’s 25W charging is considerably slower than that, and considering you’re stuck with a 15W charger… the phone will charge even slower than that. The Galaxy S20 FE does have an advantage of wireless charging, though. You can take advantage of 15W wireless charging if you have a Qi wireless charger. You can also utilize Wireless PoweShare (reverse wireless charging). The OnePlus 8T does not offer either of those. </p>
<p> The battery will last longer between charges </p>
<p> These two phones have the same battery capacity, almost identical display size, same resolution, and same refresh rate. Both are also equipped with the same processor, and we’re looking at OLED displays here. So, they should offer similar battery life, right? Well, kind of, but they do not. The OnePlus 8T offers more in the battery longevity department, at least based on our tests. The OnePlus 8T was constantly getting over the 7 and a half hour mark, while I was purposely pushing the device, during the review period. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S20 FE, on the flip side, was getting 5 to 5 and a half hours of screen-on-time on most days. At least that was the case with the unit my colleague was testing. That being said, this is quite a difference. Our usage patterns are different, that’s for sure, but this is a huge difference. This could change drastically based on upcoming updates for both smartphones, but for the time being, the OnePlus 8T does have an advantage. If you’re worried about battery life, and don’t care about wireless charging, the OnePlus 8T is probably a better option. </p>

<p> OxygenOS is excellent, and updated quite often </p>
<p> Samsung has come a long way when it comes to software. The company’s One UI is far cry from the days of TouchWiz, that’s for sure. Still, I personally do think that OxygenOS is better in comparison. OxygenOS has been regarded to be one of the best Android skins ever since it first launched. Android 11-based OxygenOS 11 that comes pre-installed on the OnePlus 8T did teak a step back from stock Android, but it didn’t stray too far. OnePlus even incorporated some One UI-inspired design cues for one-hand usage. </p>
<p> Samsung tends to ship a ton of bloatware with its UI still. There are a ton of services and apps that you will never use, and some of them are still completely unnecessary if you ask me. Samsung basically created its own ecosystem with its Android skin, and that’s perfectly fine, but that’s one of the main reasons I do believe there are better offerings out there. OxygenOS doesn’t beat around the bush, and it mostly offers what you need, including some really useful features… but it doesn’t have a whole separate security suite, and many other, non-essential software additions. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In terms of performance, both builds are really good, and they make the two phones perform really well. Another reason why I’d choose the OnePlus 8T in terms of software is the fact it ships with Android 11 out of the box, while the Galaxy S20 FE is stuck with Android 10. OnePlus also has a tendency to release new updates faster than Samsung, so… yeah. All in all, I do believe OxygenOS is the way to go… your opinion may be different, of course. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is more affordable than the Galaxy S20 FE </p>
<p> Not only is, in my opinion, the OnePlus 8T the better phone to buy in this comparison, but it’s also more affordable. The device starts at $599, while the Galaxy S20 FE is priced at $699. IN fact, you can get the maxed-out version of the OnePlus 8T for the base Galaxy S20 FE model. And with that model, you do get an extra 4GB of RAM and double the storage. So, you can have a device that has double the RAM the Galaxy S20 FE has, for the same price. That’s hard to beat. </p>

<p> OnePlus 8T Comes With Five Cameras & Improved Nightscape </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T got announced today, and as some of you already know, it includes five cameras overall. Four of those are placed on the back of the device, while one is located on the front. </p>
<p> This is the first OnePlus handset to offer a monochrome camera </p>
<p> That being said, the OnePlus 8T is the very first OnePlus smartphone to include a monochrome camera. That is the third camera on the back of the phone, a 2-megapixel unit (f/2.4 aperture). What’s important to note is that the phone will still take monochrome pictures using the main camera (but will collaborate with that monochrome camera), so you’ll still get that high-res picture. </p>
<p> In addition to that, you’ll find a 48-megapixel main sensor back there, which has been taken from the OnePlus 8. Just to be clear, the OnePlus 8 Pro has a newer sensor than the OnePlus 8 and 8T. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That 48-megapixel camera includes Sony’s IMX586 sensor. We’re looking at an f/1.7 aperture here, and 0.8um pixel size. Both OIS and EIS are included. </p>
<p> A 16-megapixel ultra-wide camera (Sony’s IMX481 sensor, f/2.2 aperture, 123-degree FoV) is also a part of the package. The third camera on the back is a 5-megapixel macro unit (3cm focal length), while the fourth one is a 2-megapixel monochrome camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In terms of the selfie camera, we’re looking at a 16-megapixel unit (f/2.4 aperture lens, fixed focus, 1.0um pixel size, EIS). That unit comes with a wider field of view than the OnePlus 8 series delivered, by the way. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T does include five cameras, but also some camera software improvements </p>
<p> Now, OnePlus also improved the software for this release. The company boosted its ‘Nightscape’ mode in a very important way. Up until now, you were forced to manually switch to Nightscape when in extremely poorly-lit areas. </p>
<p> Well, now, that is no longer necessary. The phone will auto-detect when Nightscape is necessary, and will switch to it automatically. You can avoid this, though, if you want, and shoot in auto mode instead. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That’s not the only change, though. The OnePlus 8T also delivers ‘Video Portrait Mode’, which will keep the focus on the subject you’re shooting as well. The Super Stable Mode has been improved compared to the OnePlus 8 series as well. </p>
<p> The phone can shoot 4K video at 60fps, and super slow motion video at 720p at 480fps, and 1080p at 240 fps. Time-lapse videos are also a possibility, as it offers time-lapse 4K video shooting at 30 fps. </p>
<p> You will also notice that the OnePlus 8T has a different position for its rear camera module compared to the OnePlus 8 series. Well, the decision behind that it’s purely aesthetic. The company moved it to improve heat dissipation, and for the antennas, as the OnePlus 8T internals are differently-arranged to those of the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro. </p>

<p> Android News / OnePlus 8T Camera Specifications Leaked, Continues To Sport 16MP Selfie Camera </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T Camera Specifications Leaked, Continues To Sport 16MP Selfie Camera </p>
<p> OnePlus will officially unveil the OnePlus 8T smartphone on October 14th. With the virtual launch event just around the corner, the OnePlus 8T camera specifications are now leaked online. According to leakster Mukul Sharma, OnePlus 8T will sport a quad-camera setup on the rear. </p>
<p> It will be the first non-Pro smartphone from OnePlus to come stacked with four camera sensors on the rear. The company will continue using the 48MP Sony IMX586 sensor as its primary camera. Introduced with the OnePlus 7 in May 2019, the Sony IMX586 is part of every flagship OnePus smartphone from then on. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T camera specifications reveal surprising decision </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T also features a 16MP ultra-wide-angle camera, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP black and white camera. From the leaked images, the LED flash on the rear is accompanied by one more circular element. As of now, its purpose is not yet known, but one could assume it is for color correction. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the front, the OnePlus 8T comes equipped with a 16MP Sony IMX471 selfie camera. Even the Sony IMX471 is first introduced with the last year's OnePlus 7 series. Compared to the OnePlus 8 launched earlier this year, there shouldn't be a big difference in the camera performance of the upcoming OnePlus 8T. </p>
<p> Uses same old Sony IMX471 sensor on the front </p>
<p> Interestingly, the company is not bringing back the telephoto camera which was offered with the OnePlus 7T. The OnePlus 8T packs a 4,500mAh battery and supports the latest Warp Charge 65 fast charging technology. The company claims the device will fully charge from 0 percent to 100 percent in just 39 minutes. </p>
<p> Unlike the Pro variant, there is no wireless charging option on this upcoming device. It runs on the latest Android 11-based OxygenOS 11 out of the box. Under the hood, the device will come powered by the flagship 7nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 mobile platform coupled with at least 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It also sports a Super AMOLED display with a 120Hz high refresh rate. Just like its predecessor, the new OnePlus 8T will also feature a flat panel display. With all these specifications, it weighs 188 grams and measures 8.4mm in thickness. </p>
<p> Alongside the OnePlus 8T, the company will also launch a special edition OnePlus Nord and the OnePlus Buds Z TWS earbuds during the same event. Based on the rumors, the company will introduce the OnePlus Nord in an all-new Grey Ash color option. </p>

<p> OnePlus 8T Gets Canvas AOD Feature Via New Update </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T has just received a new OxygenOS update which brings the Canvas AOD feature to the device. This is a feature that arrived to the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro via an OxygenOS Beta release last month. </p>
<p> It was not available in a stable build of OxygenOS, until now. The update in question is OxygenOS 11.0.1.12, and it just arrived to our unit. Check out the image below to get a better idea of what we’re talking about. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So, if you navigate to the ‘Wallpapers’ section of OxygenOS, you can access this feature. All you have to do is hold down your finger on the phone’s desktop, and you’ll see the ‘Wallpapers’ option. </p>
<p> The Canvas AOD feature is located in the OnePlus 8T wallpaper settings </p>
<p> Now, there you’ll see the ‘Canvas’ option, which is currently in beta, by the way. Once you select that, you’ll be able to choose any photo you want. Once you do, turn off your display, and raise it to activate AOD, or tap on the display to see the changes (you’ll need to have AOD activated, of course). </p>
<p> Once you do that, you’ll see a sketch of your wallpaper. OnePlus notes that this feature works best with faces, though it should work with basically anything. As you can see, we got it to work with our logo. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is not the only change that was brought by this update. The company has also optimized the AOD feature altogether. It has also optimized power consumption for the phone, says the changelog. </p>
<p> On top of that, the camera performance has also received some tweaks. The Nightscape Mode for video should be better now, as the company improved image quality. The company also optimized the white balance under different settings, and improved the app’s stability. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This update is rolling out to OnePlus 8T units as we speak, and it weighs 355MB. It should arrive to your phone in the coming days, if it hasn’t already. </p>

<p> OnePlus 8T Charger Can Fast-Charge Your Nintendo Switch & More </p>
<p> OnePlus has confirmed that you can fast-charge various other accessories using the OnePlus 8T charger. During our talk with the OnePlus’ representative, he confirmed this, while taking the Nintendo Switch as an example. </p>
<p> Most of you know that the Nintendo Switch does not offer such fast charging, at least not one that is nearly as fast as the one on the OnePlus 8T. For those of you who are out of the look, the phone supports 65W fast charging (with a Type-C to Type-C cable). </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T charger can fast-charge various other accessories </p>
<p> That being said, the representative said that the adapter will hold back, and charge at the required speed. This is great to hear, especially considering it’s official news. This way, you don’t need to carry a ton of chargers with you. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OnePlus uses proprietary tech for its Warp Charging, so people are afraid to use it with other products. Well, it seems like that is safe to do, at least when it comes to the OnePlus 8T charger. </p>
<p> This charging brick also comes with a Type-C to Type-C cable, by the way. The charging brick itself is really powerful when combined with the OnePlus 8T, as it can charge up that huge 4,500mAh battery in no time. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T can be fully charged (0-100%) in only 39 minutes </p>
<p> That charger can get it from 0 to 58-percent in only 15 minutes. It takes it 39 minutes to charge it all the way from 0-percent to 100-percent, which is faster than the vast majority of other chargers in the market. If you’d like to know more about that, click here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T, as most of you know, got announced today. We already have a ton of information available on the site, in case you’re interested. </p>
<p> The device is exactly what we expected. It is made out of metal and glass, while it delivers a flat 120Hz display, 8GB / 12GB of RAM, the Snapdragon 865 processor, and five cameras. </p>
<p> All in all, this phone has a lot to offer, and the company managed to keep its price tag rather low… considering everything. The phone comes in both 8GB and 12GB RAM variants in Europe, while it is available in a 12GB RAM model only in the US. It starts at €599 in Europe, and $749 in the US. </p>

<p> It's Official, The OnePlus 8T Cyberpunk 2077 Edition Is Coming </p>
<p> Several tipsters mentioned that a special edition OnePlus 8T is on the way, and now we know exactly what to expect. The company has confirmed that the OnePlus 8T Cyberpunk 2077 edition is coming. </p>
<p> OnePlus confirmed that information via a teaser video on Weibo, a Chinese social media network. That short teaser has a duration of 27 seconds, and it seems to show in-game footage and the OnePlus 8T ringing on the table. At the very end, both OnePlus and Cyberpunk logos are presented. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T Cyberpunk 2077 limited edition is coming soon </p>
<p> In the caption for that tweet, OnePlus clearly said that it partnered up with CD Project Red. It also clearly stated that the OnePlus 8T Cyberpunk 20177 limited edition handset is coming. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That smartphone will become available for pre-order on November 4. Do note that this will happen only in China, though, at least for now. OnePlus did not confirm this via its other social media channels yet. </p>
<p> It is quite possible that this device will launch in many other markets, though. That is something OnePlus will clear up once the device gets a proper announcement. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This information comes only a couple of days after the announcement of the OnePlus 8T. That device was announced on October 14, as many of you already know. We’ve already released our review of the phone, in case you’re interested. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is definitely one of the most compelling devices in the market at the moment. It offers a lot for the price tag. It will be especially compelling to those of you who do not want to break the bank to get a flagship-grade phone. </p>
<p> The device is made out of metal and glass, while it ships with the Snapdragon 865 SoC. It supports 5G connectivity, while it packs in 8GB / 12GB of RAM (varies from one market to the next). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone also supports 65W fast wired charging, and ships with Android 11 out of the box. A large 4,500mAh battery is included, and the same goes for a 6.55-inch fullHD+ 120Hz display, which is flat. </p>

<p> OnePlus 8T Display Earns DisplayMate's Highest A+ Rating </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T display has been awarded the highest rating from DisplayMate. The phone’s display has been awarded the A+ rating by DisplayMate, the same as its siblings, and the 7 Pro. </p>
<p> What does this mean? Well, DisplayMate says that the OnePlus 8T display is “visually indistinguishable from perfect”. That is basically what characterizes displays that win this rating from the company. </p>
<p> The display offers very high absolute color, image contrast, and intensity scale accuracy. This display can actually provide you with up to 1,090 nits of brightness, thanks to its high brightness mode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> DisplayMate says that the OnePlus 8T set or matches 11 Display Performance Records </p>
<p> DisplayMate also notes that luminance accuracy has been improved in comparison to the standard OnePlus 8. The company also notes that this display “sets or matches” 11 Display Performance Records. </p>
<p> The company does note that the OnePlus 8T display also has an improved refresh rate over the OnePlus 8. The device’s display refreshes at 120Hz, while the OnePlus 8’s is rated at 90Hz. </p>
<p> It is also noted that the display calibration color accuracy and image contrast accuracy has been improved. The same goes for the high brightness mode luminance accuracy. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We’ve actually already reviewed the OnePlus 8T, and have been convinced in the quality of its display. This is a fullHD+ AMOLED panel, and it truly is that good. It’s one of the best fullHD+ panels out there. </p>
<p> DisplayMate went into great detail when it comes to this display. It dissected every single aspect of it in its detailed report, in case you’re interested in going through everything. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is a great device overall, with a great price tag. It doesn’t have many shortcomings, and its display definitely isn’t one of them. It is also flat, which is worth noting, as most people seem to prefer flat displays over curved ones. The OnePlus 8T actually follows in the OnePlus 7T’s footsteps when display curvature is concerned. </p>

<p> OnePlus 8T Durability Test Shows Massive Improvements </p>
<p> The only OnePlus 8T durability test we've all been waiting for shows some rather remarkable improvements over last year's model. Which is unsurprising, seeing how similar it is to the OnePlus 8. Which was our first indicator that the company learned from its past, crackingly loud mistakes. In effect, this year seems to be all about structural integrity for the rising Chinese brand. Because the OnePlus 8T is its second smartphone in just over six months that survived abuse from someone menacing enough to call themselves JerryRigEverything. </p>
<p> The handset did pass Zack Nelson's durability test with relatively flying colors. Though the fairly standardized abuse it underwent revealed there's still some room for improvement. Most notably in regards to its resistance to bending. Fortunately, that's one of the last things likely to end your daily driver. Probably. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is otherwise as resistant to scratches and other forms of minor mechanical damage as you'd expect. It's even able to take fire to its closest equivalent to a face like a champ. Which is consistent with the basic properties of AMOLED panels such as the 120Hz module it uses. But it's probably best to see how a $750 gadget gets put through the paces with your own eyes and someone else's production budget. At least if your goal is to appreciate its build quality. So, thank JerryRigEverything for this video if you see him, just don't shake hands with him: </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T durability leaves little to be desired, provided you're not expecting a ruggedized level of protection </p>
<p> After seemingly solving the durability shortcomings of its past products, OnePlus is closer than ever to the modern smartphone ideal. Some will argue it's been close for years and that may be right, but the closer you get to four-digit price tags, the more these little differences seem to matter. Whether in smartphones or any other form of at least somewhat luxurious goods. </p>
<p> Make sure to take a look at our detailed OnePlus 8T review if you haven't already because OnePlus really impressed us this year. And its timing could have hardly been better, given how utterly mediocre 2020 has been for smartphone enthusiasts overall. Of course, that was for reasons outside of the industry's control. Either way, the OnePlus 8T is scheduled for release next Friday, October 23rd, after which it's destined to trade some blows with the Galaxy S20 Fan Edition and the iPhone 12 range. </p>

<p> Watch The OnePlus 8T Announcement Live Right Here </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T will get announced today, and you can watch the event live. The company will host an online-only event, and has shared the livestream link. That link is embedded below the article. </p>
<p> That being said, the event will kick off in a couple of hours, it’s starting at 10 AM EST / 7 AM PST / 4 PM CET / 3 PM BST. The OnePlus 8T has leaked a number of times thus far, while the company revealed quite a few information as well. </p>
<p> The company even shared a render of the phone recently, showing its back side. The OnePlus 8T will offer a somewhat different-looking back side to the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro. </p>

<p> OnePlus also confirmed that blazing fast 65W fast wired charging will be included. This handset will feature a flat display, unlike its siblings, while it’s expected to be made out of metal and glass. </p>
<p> Watch OnePlus announce the 8T, its first device to ship with Android 11 out of the box </p>
<p> It has also been confirmed that the phone will ship with Android 11 out of the box. It will be the first OnePlus handset to ship with Google’s latest OS out of the box, and along with it, you’ll get OnePlus’ OxygenOS 11. </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 865 will fuel the device, while the phone is expected to feature a large display as well. Based on rumors, we’ll get a 6.5-inch fullHD+ panel with 120Hz refresh rate. That will be an OLED panel, by the way. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The device is also expected to be more affordable than today’s flagships, quite a bit more affordable, in fact. The phone is rumored to cost $599 / €599, but we’ll see how accurate those rumors are. </p>
<p> In addition to the OnePlus 8T, the company is also expected to announce Buds Z earphones. The Buds Wireless Z Bass Edition earphones may also become official, alongside the company’s new Power Bank. </p>
<p> The OnePlus Nord Special Edition has also been rumored. Some of these products may not be available globally, though, so keep that in mind. The company may surprise us with some additional announcement, so tune in if you’re interested. You can also check out our preview before the event starts. </p>

<p> These Are The Official OnePlus 8T Cases </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T got announced today, and the company also introduced several official cases for the device. You can check out all of those cases in the image provided below this paragraph. </p>
<p> As you can see, there are four different cases here. The first one is the Quantum Bumper Case, which comes in a cyan color. It has that odd 3D effect on the back, well, it’s visible when you move the case. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The two cases next to it are the Sandstone Bumper Cases, the first one in cyan, and the other in a black color. The last case shown in the image is the Karbon Bumper Case, which is well known to OnePlus users. </p>
<p> Now, we’ve actually received two out of these four cases along with the OnePlus 8T, as part of a review kit. So you can check out some of their images in the gallery below. </p>
<p> You’ll notice that we received a cyan-colored Sandstone Bumper Case. That case is actually really nice, as the material on it is not too harsh, and yet it makes sure the phone doesn’t slip out of your hand. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You’ll also notice that a regular silicone case is shown in these pictures. That silicone case is a part of the regular OnePlus 8T packaging. If you purchase the device, you’ll get it in the retail box, for free. </p>
<p> That case is pretty much the same as the one that shipped with the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro. It is, of course, adapted to the OnePlus 8T size and measurements. It still has that Never Settle logo on the back. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T Karbon Bumper costs $39.99 / €39.95, while the Quantum Bumper Case is priced at $34.99 / €32.95. The OnePlus 8T Sandstone Bumper Case is the cheapest at $24.99 / €24.95. </p>

<p> Android News / OnePlus 8T Is Official With Blazing Fast Charging & Flat 120Hz Display </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T Is Official With Blazing Fast Charging & Flat 120Hz Display </p>
<p> OnePlus has just announced its brand new high-end smartphone, the OnePlus 8T. After months of rumors, leaks, and teasers, the phone is finally here… and it’s exactly what we expected, at least on paper. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is not meant to replace the OnePlus 8 Pro as the company’s top flagship, not at all. This handset is actually considerably more affordable than the OnePlus 8 Pro, and even more affordable than the regular OnePlus 8. </p>
<p> Think of it as a hybrid between the two phones we’ve mentioned, and the OnePlus 7T… in a way. This phone brings high-end specifications, a flat display like the 7T, and it cuts some corners in order to meet its price tag. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It comes with a flat display, and different camera placement </p>
<p> The device is made out of metal and glass, as you’d expect. Its bezels are really thin, while a display camera hole is placed in the top-left corner. That hole is the exact same size as the one on the OnePlus 8, by the way, at least by the looks of it. </p>
<p> The device sports three cameras on the back, and an in-display fingerprint scanner. That’s an optical fingerprint scanner, and it seems to be the same one the company used in the OnePlus 8 series. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T does not come with an official IP rating, but OnePlus did note that it can survive rain without a problem. So, don’t panic if you get caught in a rainstorm or something… just don’t go swimming with it. </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 865 fuels this phone, as expected. OnePlus opted to go for the regular 865, not the ‘Plus’ model. The phone also supports 5G as a result of the Snapdragon 865 inclusion. </p>
<p> The device comes in two variants. The more affordable one includes 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while the more premium one comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A huge battery is included, along with 65W fast wired charging & 120Hz display </p>
<p> A large 4,500mAh battery is included in the package in order to power the phone’s 6.55-inch fullHD+ 120Hz OLED display. Yes, you read it right, this phone does include a display with a 120Hz refresh rate… and it’s flat. </p>
<p> Speaking of power, you can charge up this phone’s battery using 65W fast wired charging. The phone can be charged from 0 to 58-percent in only 15 minutes, so chances are you won’t even have to charge it overnight. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company decided not to include wireless charging here. The main reason is probably the device’s price tag, and the added thickness that would add. Stereo speakers are included, however. </p>
<p> A 48-megapixel camera is included on the back as the OnePlus 8T’s main sensor. That is the same sensor as the one OnePlus used in the OnePlus 8, Sony’s IMX586. It decided not to go with the more powerful unit from the OnePlus 8 Pro. A 16-megapixel ultra-wide camera is also included on the back, along with a 5-megapixel macro unit, and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T comes with Android 11 out of the box </p>
<p> Android 11 comes pre-installed on the OnePlus 8T, along with the company’s OxygenOS 11 skin. That skin comes with boosted one-hand usability due to redesigned UI, and various new changes as part of Android 11. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is taller, wider, and thicker than the OnePlus 8, but that was to be expected due to its flat display. The device is a bit heavier than the OnePlus 8, though, at 188 grams (compared to 180 grams). </p>
<p> OnePlus has announced two color options for this phone. The Aquamarine Green and Lunar Silver. The first one is green, essentially, while the second one is white. Color, RAM, and storage combinations will differ from one market to the next, by the way. </p>
<p> OnePlus did mention that both the 8GB and 12GB RAM models will make their way to Europe. Only the 12GB RAM variant will ship to the US, though. In Europe, the two variants are priced at €599 and €699, respectively. The 12GB RAM model in the US costs $749. Pre-orders kick off today. In Europe, the phone will go on sale on October 20, while in the US you'll be able to get it on October 23. </p>

<p> OnePlus 8T Is Already Up For Pre-Order In Both Europe & The US </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T has been announced today, and you can already pre-order it. The device will be available for pre-order for over a week, and it will go on sale on October 23. At least in the US. </p>
<p> Now, when it comes to the UK, it’s also available to pre-order already, while it will go on sale starting on October 20. Europe is in the same boat as the UK. </p>
<p> Both OnePlus 8T variants are now up for pre-order </p>
<p> As far as pricing is concerned, the OnePlus 8T comes in two variants to Europe. The 8GB RAM variant includes 256GB of storage and it is priced at €599, while it costs £549 in the UK. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The 12GB RAM model also includes 256GB of storage, and that variant costs €699 in Europe, and £649 in the UK. The 8GB RAM model comes in a Lunar Silver color, while the 12GB RAM option is reserved for the Aquamarine Green option. </p>
<p> Now, as far as the US is concerned, only the 12GB RAM model is available. That means that you'll only be able to get the Aquamarine Green color as well, no Lunar Silver for the US. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is the company’s new flagship, of sorts. The OnePlus 8 Pro is still positioned as the company’s crown jewel, but the 8T is really close to it. It may even be a better option for some. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The device is fueled by the Snapdragon 865 SoC, and it features a 6.5-inch fullHD+ Fluid AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. This display is flat, unlike the one on the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro. </p>
<p> The phone includes a large battery, and extremely fast charging </p>
<p> The device also comes with a large, 4,500mAh battery, and it supports 65W fast wired charging. Wireless charging is not supported. The phone is made out of metal and glass, and it includes really thin bezels. </p>
<p> Android 11 comes pre-installed on this phone, along with the company’s OxygenOS 11 skin. The phone does not offer an official IP rating, but it can be caught in the rain without a problem. </p>

<p> There are four cameras included on the back of this device, and one on the front. The phone also offers two SIM card slots, and it does support 5G connectivity. If you’d like to know more about its specs, click here. Hit the link down below if you'd like to pre-order the device. </p>

<p> OnePlus 8T Review: 'T' Stands For Terrific </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T checks all the right boxes, while it costs significantly less than most other flagships. </p>
<p> OnePlus supplied us with a review unit of the OnePlus 8T, but didn’t have a say in our opinion, nor did they see this review before you. We’ve been using the device for over a week before forming an opinion. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 7T was an extremely popular smartphone. OnePlus managed to attract people with a great combination of high-end specs / features, and a great price point. Well, the company did it again this year, as the OnePlus 8T hits all the right spots. The device is more affordable than the OnePlus 8, and it even improves upon that phone in some ways. In other words, it offers more than the regular OnePlus 8, which is something you’ll realize in our OnePlus 8T review. </p>
<p> It is worth noting that the OnePlus 8 Pro is still positioned as the company’s flagship, alongside the OnePlus 8T. The OnePlus 8 Pro does offer some features the OnePlus 8T does not, such as wireless charging, for example. Other than that, a higher-res display (which is a difference you’ll be hard-pressed to notice), and a newer main camera sensor, there’s really no reason why you shouldn’t go for the OnePlus 8T instead. This is a great smartphone, even if it cost more than it does that would be the case. That being said, let’s dive into it, shall we? </p>
<p> High-end look and feel </p>
<p> OnePlus is no stranger to making well-built, sturdy phones, even though they are made mostly out of glass. The OnePlus 8T is no different in that regard. This smartphone comes with an aluminum frame, placed in-between two sheets of Gorilla Glass, for protection. The phone is quite slippery in the hand, as were its predecessors. Chances are you’d want to keep it inside a case, otherwise you may drop it. The OnePlus 8T is not a small phone, so using it without a case, as slippery as it is… that’s certainly not a great idea. To each its own, though, some people like this feeling, and don’t really appreciate cases, which is something I can understand. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T does resemble the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, but it’s a bit different. It’s still curved on the back, but it feels a bit thicker in the hand than it actually is. This phone is only 8.4mm thick, and it feels thicker than the OnePlus 8 Pro. Don’t get me wrong, it doesn’t feel too thick or anything, it’s just a different feeling. The device is a bit lighter than the OnePlus 8 Pro, at 188 grams, which is something your pinky finger will appreciate when holding the phone with one hand. The device is wider than both OnePlus 8 phones, though, at 74.1mm… though it’s not too wide or anything of the sort. </p>
<p> There is a single display camera hole included here </p>
<p> The phone does include a display camera hole in the top-left corner, and its size is the same as the one on the OnePlus 8, at least to my eyes, as I don’t have any official info on that. The phone does include a flat display, unlike its siblings, and its bezels are quite thin. Curved glass is placed on top of its flat display, so don’t worry about your fingers getting stuck to the sides. Using this flat display is actually really enjoyable, and I experienced no issues with accidental presses or anything of the sort. It is worth noting that the phone does not feature official IP rating, but it can handle some water without a problem. We were told it can get caught in the rain without issues, so don't worry about it, just don't go swimming with it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Some of you are probably wondering if the phone is a fingerprint magnet. Well, I’ve used the Aquamarine Green variant of the device for over a week at this point, and I can say that this variant is excellent at repelling fingerprints. I cannot speak for the Lunar Silver model, though. The back side of my review unit is kind of glossy, so I expected plenty of fingerprints despite the fact OnePlus’ employee said that won’t be the case. Well, he was right, this phone did an excellent job of repelling / hiding them. All in all, OnePlus did a really good job in the design department. Some may say that the design is uninspired, and that OnePlus decided to play it safe here. That may be the case, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing… and it was kind of expected. </p>
<p> The display is gorgeous… it's flat, OLED, and 120Hz </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T comes with a 6.55-inch fullHD+ (2400 x 1080) Fluid AMOLED display. That display offers a 120Hz refresh rate, and it is protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass. We’re not sure which variant yet, but it’s either 5 or 6. No matter which one it is, though, it is well protected. This display offers an aspect ratio of 20:9, in case you were wondering. In other words, it is the same display resolution and aspect ratio as the OnePlus 8. The difference here is in its refresh rate, as the OnePlus 8 offers a 90Hz panel. This display is also flat, unlike the ones OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro sport. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That flat display is probably what most people will appreciate, especially those that like to use their phones without a case. I do prefer curved ones, but I do believe I’m in a minority. Chances are you won’t have issues with accidental presses here, just be careful not to drop the phone due to its extremely slippery nature. The display is not only sharp enough, but you’ll hardly notice the difference in resolution between that one, and the one on the OnePlus 8 Pro. It does get bright enough outdoors, while the viewing angles are also great. The colors on this panel are vivid, and the blacks are deep, as you’d expect out of an OLED display. I don’t have a single complaint when it comes to this panel, to be quite honest, as it does support HDR content as well. </p>
<p> This phone is buttery smooth at every step </p>
<p> OnePlus’ smartphones are usually praised for their great performance, and long shelf life because of it. Well, the OnePlus 8T is not different in this regard, the phone is blazing fast. I cannot stress that enough. If you’ve used the OnePlus 8 or 8 Pro, you’ll know what I’m talking about. This phone cuts through everything like butter, and during my usage, I haven’t experienced a single instance of a slowdown. I did notice a couple of skipped frames when throwing something extra-heavy on the phone, but that was only a split-second thing, and not something many people would notice. This is, without a doubt, one of the fastest phones I’ve ever used. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone is incredibly smooth, and its 120Hz display only helps the matter </p>
<p> OnePlus’ animations and the phone’s 120Hz refresh rate display definitely help in that regard. OnePlus did an excellent job with animations on this device, they’re fast enough not to make the phone feel slow, and they’re also so smooth as well. You do have an option to disable them, if you want, though. By doing that, you’ll speed the device up even more, it will open everything instantly. The Snapdragon 865 is the main hardware reason why this phone can run so smoothly, along with the phone’s UFS 3.1 (Gen1) flash storage, of course. The LPDDR4X RAM that OnePlus included here is not the fastest out there, as LPDDR5 is available, but that’s not a difference you’ll notice at all. </p>
<p> Gesture navigation is also really well-executed here, and you can even remove that horizontal white line at the bottom if you want. If you’re annoyed by that, you can completely remove it, and get to use the phone’s entire display for content. All that, in collaboration with great haptics, makes the phone a joy to use. No matter if you like gaming, if you’re heavy on media consumption, or are just a regular user who does everything moderately… this phone will have you covered in the performance department. </p>
<p> Stellar battery life with insanely fast charging, but only wired </p>
<p> OnePlus’ smartphones are well-known for really good battery life. Is that the case with the OnePlus 8T as well? Well yes, yes it is. The phone actually offers excellent battery life. That huge 4,500mAh battery on the inside can handle the phone’s flagship SoC, and fullHD+ 120Hz display without a problem. The company’s optimization definitely has something to do with it as well. I was constantly getting great battery life, and I’ve been using the phone for over a week before I wrote this review. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Even if you’re a power user, this phone should be able to handle anything you throw at it. I’ve fired up a few games just to see how they run, even though I’m not a gamer. They performed great, but I haven’t played them enough to see the impact on battery life. I did use the phone for a ton of other stuff, though, I even downloaded some torrents via Flud, just to put some extra strain on the battery. My usage included watching a lot of videos on YouTube, fired up some videos via MX Player, browsed a lot, took a lot of pictures, processed images, processed video, and so on. I did basically anything you can imagine, even transferred files both via WiFi and USB. </p>
<p> The battery life was stellar during my usage </p>
<p> The phone constantly offered excellent battery life. I decided to try to drain it all the way, and was unable to do it in one day. The phone did manage to go over the 8-hour screen-on-time mark, well into the second day. Around 2-3 PM I finally managed to kill it (second day), at which point it had over 8 hours and 30 minutes of screen on time. Even if you, by some miracle, manage to kill the phone before the end of your day, this phone does support 65W fast wired charging. It does ship with a 65W charger in the box, by the way. Wireless charging is not included, so keep that in mind. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Very few of you will miss wireless charging with charging speeds like this, though. This phone can go from 0 to 58-percent charge in only 15 minutes. In 39 minutes, you’ll be able to charge the battery completely, from 0 to 100-percent. With charging speeds like this, and the longevity this phone offers, battery life should never be an issue… ever. OnePlus did an excellent job here, that’s hard to deny. Do note that you can recharge this phone with chargers from previous OnePlus devices as well. You can also fast-charge other devices with this charging brick, such as your Nintendo Switch, for example. OnePlus also included quite a few temperature sensors here, and you’ll find a larger vapor chamber in the OnePlus 8T, a 285-percent larger than in the OnePlus 8 series. </p>
<p> The camera performance is really excellent… but a step below the best </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T includes four cameras on the back, and one on the front. Now, the company has opted to utilize an older 48-megapixel sensor for its main camera here. It is using the Sony IMX586 sensor, the same one used on the OnePlus 8. The OnePlus 8 Pro uses that sensor as well, but for its ultra-wide angle camera, not the main camera. Its main camera sensor is Sony’s IMX689 sensor. That is one of the reasons OnePlus was able to keep this phone’s price tag in check. Before you start complaining, here me out, as OnePlus did a great job improving the performance of the IMX586. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OnePlus has been utilizing this sensor for quite some time now, and it seems to have a firm grasp on its optimization. I did notice that the performance of the main camera here is better than what my OnePlus 8 offers. Well, at least compared to what it offers on Android 10, as those are the camera samples I’ve compared. Android 11 did arrive on the OnePlus 8 in the meantime, and it remains to be seen how it compares in that regard. I don’t doubt that these improvements that were made on the OnePlus 8T will reach the OnePlus 8 as well, though. The OnePlus 8’s camera performance was good from the get-go, but OnePlus has been constantly improving it. </p>
<p> OnePlus spent a lot of time optimizing the Sony IMX586 sensor </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is basically the culmination of quite a bit of work with the Sony IMX586, as even the OnePlus 7 and 7T series devices shipped with that camera sensor. In any case, the pictures from this phone are really good. They’re not the best in the market, that’s for sure, but very few people will have complaints here. If you’re not coming from a superior camera smartphone, or are not nitpicking, this camera will serve you really well. I’ve captured quite a few camera samples to show you, and they’re all included on Flickr via the link below, at the end of this section. </p>
<p> Daytime photos turn up really great </p>
<p> Pictures during the day are bright, vivid, and well-balanced. I did not notice that the white balance got messed up at some point at all. In some instances, the phone was a bit more aggressive with sharpening, but it never pushed too hard. Details at the edges of the object you’re shooting tend to be a bit softer from time to time, but it’s not a big issue, and it doesn’t always happen. There’s plenty of detail in these images, though on some of them the saturation did get turned up a bit higher than I’d want. It’s not extremely high, but it’s something worth noting. Even with some close-ups that I shot (no macro mode), the phone did an excellent job. Like 90-percent of these images were taken in auto mode (point and shoot). For some, I did use tap-to-focus, and some have been taken with the phone’s Nightscape feature for low light photography. You will notice the difference. </p>
<p> Do note that the phone does an excellent job of brightening up scenes in auto mode as well. You won’t feel the need to fire up Nightscape in the vast majority of low light scenarios, unless you’re in a really dark place. In fact, you may not feel the need to do it at all, as the phone can do it on its own now, when it feels the need to. The phone did struggle with street lights on one occasion only (in a low light situation), while it did an excellent job every other time. This is something I’ve noticed on the OnePlus 8 as well, at first, but OnePlus quickly fixed it. So, don’t worry too much about it. </p>
<p> Low light doesn't disappoint, just don't expect miracles </p>
<p> Images in low light do end up being quite bright, while enough detail is preserved as well. The OnePlus 8 Pro does perform better in low light, without a doubt, but this will be more than enough for most people. If you’re planning to shoot a ton of low light images, chances are you’ll be looking elsewhere either way. The OnePlus 8T can handle such shooting scenarios, though, it can handle them really well. The phone is also equipped with an ultra-wide camera, a macro camera, and a monochrome camera as well. It is using its main camera sensor to shoot black and white images, though, with the help from its monochrome camera. </p>
<p> The Super Stable Mode has been improved compared to the OnePlus 8 series, while the Video Portrait Mode has been added. The phone can shoot slow-motion video at XXX, while it can also shoot 4K video at 60 FPS. 4K video at 60 FPS is good, but the 1080P video at 60 FPS still looks better overall, I’d say. That’s at least my preference here. The front-facing camera is nothing to write home about, but it’ll get the job done, that’s for sure. It balances images nicely, and as long as there’s some light in the shot, don’t worry about that. Its lens is also wide enough. </p>
<p> Android 11 is here, and OxygenOS 11 is one of the best iterations of Android out there </p>
<p> One of the main reasons OnePlus smartphones get recommended so often when Android phones are concerned is the company’s software. OxygenOS has been excellent since it launched, and it’s often regarded as one of the best (if not the best) Android skin. Is that the case with OxygenOS 11? Well yes, yes it is. OxygenOS is the biggest step away from stock Android thus far, but that’s not an issue at all, quite the contrary. I personally really like what OnePlus did here. It’s far easier to use OnePlus’ apps with one hand now, as it he UI in general. OnePlus borrowed some ideas from Samsung’s One UI here, but it did not stray away from stock Android that much. </p>
<p> AOD is finally here, and it's great </p>
<p> OxygenOS that you love is still here, very much so. Quite honestly, I did not feel a huge change when moving to OxygenOS 11, other than the fact it’s easier to use the phone with one hand now. For the most part, this is still a minimalist approach to Android, with some great features. AOD (Always On Display) feature has finally been added, and many people will like it, that’s for sure. OnePlus also added some interesting AOD styles to use, and two caught my eye. One comes with a vertical line that comes with no breaks at first. The more you unlock your phone during the day, the more horizontal lines you’ll see on that line / beam of light. The other style actually mimics your wallpaper. It will create a sketch of your wallpaper by using white lines on a black background, which is quite neat. </p>
<p> Zen Mode has been improved, the same goes for Game Space, etc. </p>
<p> OnePlus also improved its Zen Mode here, even though I didn’t use it much, to be quite honest. The Game Space has also been improved, and the feature that caught my eye the most is the touch-rejection feature that was introduced there. You will also get the most important changes Android 11 offers here. Your chat app messages will now be separated into the ‘Conversations’ section in the notification shade, while all the other notifications will be placed below it. That’s a great change that I underestimated at first. It’s so great to have this separated in the notification shade, that’s for sure. </p>
<p> The company's new font is actually pretty good too </p>
<p> OnePlus also rolled out its new font with this update, the so-called OnePlus Sans (replacing OnePlus Slate). This new font brings forth thinner letters. I found this to be a bit odd at first, but after a day or two, I got used to it, and now I love it. Everything is easier to read now, at least to me, and I do believe I read faster. Do note that you can still use Google’s Roboto font if you want, you can change it in the Settings. OxygenOS 11 is all about customization, so there are tons of stuff like that that you can change. </p>
<p> Speaking of customization, the Dark Mode has been improved even further. You can now access a quick toggle for Dark Mode, and you also have some new options for it. If there are some apps that don’t use dark mode by default on your phone (third party apps), chances are you’ll be able to force them into dark mode. There is a special section included under the ‘Display’ section in the ‘Settings’ app. It’s called ‘Manage apps in dark mode’, and you can force apps into dark mode from there. I was able to do this for over 90-percent of apps on my phone. </p>
<p> This software combines Google & OnePlus features, and it's great because of it </p>
<p> These are only some of the changes / new features that you’ll find in OxygenOS 11. Some of them are brought to you by OnePlus, others by Google… but this is definitely a winning combination. This software, in combination with the phone’s hardware, creates an extremely fluid phone, which offers a great-looking UI, which is full of customization as well. OxygenOS 11 is one of the best Android skins, period… if not the best one. In fact, I’d argue OxygenOS even trumps stock Android, as it simply offers some useful features stock Android does not have… but that’s a completely different story. The point is, if you’re into great software, you cannot go wrong with OxygenOS. </p>
<p> The audio is good… speakers are loud, while the sound is full </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T comes with stereo speakers. It also supports Dolby Atmos sound, and all in all, you’re getting good audio performance here. These speakers are quite powerful, they’re loud, and quite sharp. The distortion is barely noticeable at the very highest of volumes. The performance is actually extremely similar to what we’ve seen with the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, if not identical. Those phones had really good audio performance, so that’s a good thing. Very few of you will find an issue with these speakers. </p>
<p> Now, in terms of audio over headphones. This phone does not include a headphone jack. You’ll need to utilize a Type-C port, or connect wirelessly. If you do either, with a good pair of headphones, you’ll get a really good audio experience here. There’s enough bass, but it’s not overpowering. Vocals are also quite clear, the sound is well-balanced through-and-through. There’s not much more you can ask for from the OnePlus 8T in this regard. If you’re not a nitpicking audiophile, you’ll be perfectly happy with the performance. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is well-worth your hard-earned cash </p>
<p> So, the question is, is the OnePlus 8T worth the money? Yes, yes… and yes. If you want to buy a flagship in the current market, and are unwilling to spend obscene amounts of cash in order to do it… the OnePlus 8T is one of the very few options you have, that checks all the right boxes. This phone has quality build with quality materials. Its display is gorgeous, and 120Hz, on top of that. It is flat, and that is what most people prefer. The camera performance is really, really good, as is audio performance. Performance in general is stellar, as is the company’s OxygenOS 11 UI. Battery life is excellent as well, and insanely fast charging is included. The bottom line is, this phone is well-worth your hard-earned cash. </p>

<p> Android News / OnePlus 8T Specifications: 65W Charging, Snapdragon 865, 5G & More </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T Specifications: 65W Charging, Snapdragon 865, 5G & More </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T got announced today, as the company’s new high-end smartphone. We’ve already covered the initial announcement of the OnePlus 8T, and are here to talk more about its specifications. </p>
<p> This handset has a lot to offer in the spec department. It’s technically not more powerful than the OnePlus 8 Pro, but it’s not far from it either. This handset does come with a high-end set of specs, that’s for sure. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is equipped with a powerful set of specifications </p>
<p> Let’s kick things off with the silicon. The Snapdragon 865 fuels the OnePlus 8T, not the ‘Plus’ variant. This is still Qualcomm’s flagship processor, and a great chip overall, which comes with 5G support as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T also includes 8GB or 12GB of LPDDR4X RAM, depending on which variant you opt to get. Those two RAM variants include 128GB and 256GB of UFS 3.1 flash storage, respectively. Do note that you can’t expand that storage, though. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T features a 6.55-inch fullHD+ (2400 x 1080, 402 ppi) Fluid AMOLED display. This display offers a 120Hz refresh rate (with 240Hz touch sampling rate), and it supports HDR10+ content. The display is protected by the Gorilla Glass 5, by the way. That same glass is placed on the back of the phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The display on this handset is flat, unlike the ones on the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro. We’re looking at a 20:9 display aspect ratio here. It’s also worth noting that the phone offers a screen-to-body ratio of around 84.3-percent. </p>
<p> Android 11 comes out of the box </p>
<p> Android 11 comes pre-installed on this device, along with OnePlus’ OxygenOS 11. This is the company’s first phone to ship with both of those out of the box. OxygenOS 11 boosts one-hand usability on the device, as you’ve probably already heard. </p>
<p> OnePlus crammed a 4,500mAh battery inside of this phone. Well, it’s actually using two 2,250mAh batteries, which make one large 4,500mAh unit. The reason for that is the company’s charging. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> 65W fast charging is also a part of the package </p>
<p> Speaking of which, the OnePlus 8T does support fast charging, 65W fast charging, to be exact. We’re talking about wired charging here, as wireless charging is not available on the device. </p>
<p> An in-display fingerprint scanner is included, and it’s an optical unit. That is the very same fingerprint scanner that you’ll find on both the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, in fact. </p>
<p> There are four cameras included on the back of this phone. A 48-megapixel main camera comes straight from the OnePlus 8. This is Sony’s IMX586 sensor, and we’re looking at an f/1.7 aperture here, and 0.8um pixel size. OIS and EIS are included. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A 16-megapixel ultra-wide camera (f/2.2 aperture, 123-degree FoV) is also included, as are 5-megapixel (macro, focal length 3cm) and 2-megapixel (monochrome) units. </p>
<p> A single 16-megapixel selfie camera (f/2.4 aperture, 1.0um pixel size, EIS, wide-angle lens, fixed focus) is included on the phone’s front side. That camera is placed in the top-left corner of the phone’s display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are two nano SIM card slots available here, so that you can use two SIM cards at the same time. The phone also comes equipped with a set of stereo speakers, Bluetooth 5.1, and an NFC chip. </p>
<p> The phone does include stereo speakers, and an NFC chip. It also comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner (optical). The OnePlus 8T has been announced in two color variants, Aquamarine Green and Polar Silver. </p>

<p> OnePlus Will Continue Without Its Brand Co-Founder Carl Pei </p>
<p> Earlier this week it was rumored that Carl Pei, the co-founder of the OnePlus brand, was leaving the company. Today, Pei has confirmed that he has indeed left OnePlus and will be moving onto a new journey in his career. </p>
<p> The first rumors of Pei's departure were followed by a separate rumor about what Pei will be working on. Now that he wasn't going to be part of the OnePlus brand, and even though he'll still be recognized as the company's co-founder. </p>
<p> While not necessarily the reason for leaving, Pei will reportedly be starting up his own company. Though at the moment it's entirely clear what the company will focus on or if that rumors is even accurate. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> C0-founder of the OnePlus brand, Founder of an entirely new venture? </p>
<p> Pei hasn't been forthcoming on exactly what he's doing next in regards to his career. But if the rumors from earlier in the week are indeed accurate, then he may be starting a new venture. </p>
<p> What this venture will be is all but known. So far, the only thing Pei has shared is that he did leave OnePlus and that he is ready to move on. Pei's penchant for creating things that have a meaningful impact on people's lives is sure to drive him forward. </p>
<p> And whatever the next thing is that he creates, or helps create, there's little doubt that it will gain instant notoriety among his fans and followers. Even if his future venture doesn't involve creating smartphones, it's likely that it would still find a following. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Taking time off to rest </p>
<p> Though lack of Pei's presence will surely be felt among the OnePlus community, Pei like anyone else, is human. </p>
<p> He states that since beginning this journey with OnePlus some years ago, his "singular focus" has been to build up the brand. Any other interests, projects, or visions he had, always fell second to OnePlus in terms of garnering most of his attention. </p>
<p> Pei was 24 when he helped co-found OnePlus. That was seven years ago. He recollects spending most of the last seven years working on everything OnePlus has brought to market. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now that OnePlus is behind him, Pei (now 31) states that he'll be taking time off to rest. He'll use that time to decompress he says. While spending more time with friends and family before moving forward onto the next thing. Whatever that is. </p>

<p> [UPDATED] OnePlus Co-Founder May Not Be With The Company Anymore </p>
<p> UPDATE: The company's co-founder is starting a new company, it seems, after he allegedly left OnePlus. Tech Crunch managed to get this information from "two sources familiar with the matter". The source was told Carl Pei is "starting his own venture", we just don't know what exactly just yet. It could be a new smartphone company, or something else entirely. OnePlus did not comment on it just yet. </p>
<p> ORIGINAL ARTICLE: OnePlus is brand that was created seven years ago with the motto to never settle. OnePlus' Co-Founder, Carl Pei, may no longer be with the company. </p>
<p> This is according to a new rumor from Android Police. The report cites a user on Reddit named u/JonSigur, who has posted images of what are claimed to be internal documents to other company employees. Those documents appear to be about new leadership roles overseeing the OnePlus Nord. And Pei isn't listed anywhere on them. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Though images posted to Reddit are not necessarily a confirmation that Pei has left, perhaps it does raise some questions. Like why Pei is no longer listed as lead of the Nord project. </p>
<p> OnePlus Co-Founder Carl Pei used to be Nord's Product Lead </p>
<p> Based on u/JonSigur's leaked information, if that is in fact what it is, Carl Pei is no longer the lead of the Nord Project. </p>
<p> He used to be though. However, the proposed internal documents state that Emily Dai is now the lead of the Nord Product line. Dai will be the person now responsible for Nord's "overall success or failure." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And she will apparently report to Pete Lau on anything that's relevant to the Nord product line. As Lau is the other Co-Founder of OnePlus and is still the company's CEO. </p>
<p> Android Police says they have reached out to OnePlus for a comment, but the company has declined to say anything in regards to the matter. Which might just ad a little bit of weight to this rumor. </p>
<p> Pei also had big roles at OnePlus during many of the company's events. Helping to unveil new devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Other reports are confirming Pei's departure </p>
<p> Though the original report wasn't sure exactly if Pei had left or not new reports seem to confirm that he is no longer with OnePlus. </p>
<p> Android Central now claims that the Pei has left the company. Citing sources familiar with the matter. Though neither Pei nor OnePlus themselves have confirmed Pei's departure, it does now seem to appear that the rumors may be true. Android Central also states that Pei had left in "recent weeks." So while seemingly recent, this apparently didn't just happen within the last 24 hours. </p>
<p> These changes come at a time when OnePlus is expected to debut multiple new devices. The Nord line is supposed to be headed to the US soon, alongside the 8T. Both of which are expected to be announced at OnePlus' upcoming event this week. </p>

<p> Android News / 'Special Edition' OnePlus Nord Is Official, But Won't Be Available Globally </p>
<p> 'Special Edition' OnePlus Nord Is Official, But Won't Be Available Globally </p>
<p> The ‘Special Edition’ OnePlus Nord handset has been announced, the company launched it in both India and Europe. It launched alongside the OnePlus 8T, but not in the US, and it was not mentioned during the global launch press event. </p>
<p> This variant of the phone is called the ‘Gray Ash’ model. It has a matte texture compared to the other two models. Speaking of which, the other two Nord models are the Blue Marble and Gray Onyx variants. </p>
<p> The OnePlus Nord ‘Special Edition’ variant is actually the ‘Gray Ash’ model </p>
<p> Other than the fact it has a matte finish, this phone is almost identical to the other two models. Initially, everyone thought this ‘special edition’ phone will include a sandstone back. That’s not the case, as you can see. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Do note that this variant of the device comes with 12GB of RAM only, while the other two are available in both 8GB and 12GB RAM variants. The phone also includes 256GB of internal storage. </p>
<p> The design remains unchanged, other than a different paint job. A 6.44-inch fullHD+ 90Hz display is still present, and the same goes for a 4,115mAh battery. The phone supports Warp Charge 30T fast wired charging. </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 765G fuels this smartphone, while Android 10 comes pre-installed. Some people thought Android 11 will come pre-installed on this phone, same as on the OnePlus 8T, but that’s not the case. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The camera setup on this phone also remains unchanged. The device is priced at INR 29,999 ($409) in India, and it will become available on October 16 on Amazon India, and on October 17 everywhere else. </p>
<p> As far as European availability is concerned, the device costs €529, which is the same price tag as for any other 12GB RAM Nord variant. You can already get the ‘Gray Ash’ OnePlus Nord in Europe, but it won’t ship for another couple of days. Chances are it will be sent your way early next week. </p>
<p> This phone won’t be making its way to the US, same as its siblings. Speaking of which, OnePlus is planning to launch two additional ‘Nord’ models later this month (at least one of which will make its way to the US), so stay tuned for that. If you’re interested in the OnePlus 8T, check out our full review. </p>

<p> Special Edition OnePlus Nord Will Launch Alongside The OnePlus 8T </p>
<p> OnePlus will announce a special edition OnePlus Nord handset, alongside its upcoming OnePlus 8T flagship. That will happen on October 14, in case you forgot, two days from now. </p>
<p> The company teased the arrival of this ‘Special Edition’ Nord phone via Twitter. OnePlus released a teaser image for the phone, and it sure seems like this variant will offer the company’s well-known Sandstone finish on the back. </p>
<p> A Special Edition OnePlus Nord may be the ‘Grey Ash’ variant </p>
<p> We’re only guessing here, of course. It could be just regular glass, with a different color underneath. Max J., a well-known tipster, did suggest that this variant of the phone may be called ‘Grey Ash’. That name sure fits with the looks of the phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus Nord was originally launched back in July. The device has been on sale since August, and two more Nord phones are expected to arrive later this month. Before that happens, this special edition model will debut. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T will be the star of the show on October 14 </p>
<p> The focus of the October 14 event won’t exactly be on this device, though. It will be all about the OnePlus 8T, the company’s brand new flagship. That device has been surfacing for a while now, and OnePlus shared quite a few official information as well. </p>
<p> The company has been teasing this device for a while. Its Aquamarine Green color has been confirmed, as well as the fact it will include a flat display, with a display camera hole. This will essentially be a OnePlus 8 look-alike, with a flat display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It will be smaller than the 8 Pro, at least in terms of height, while it will be larger than the OnePlus 8. The phone will feature a 120Hz display, 65W fast wired charging, and the Snapdragon 865 SoC. </p>
<p> The device is also expected to ship at a very competitive price tag, but we’ll see how accurate those rumors were. If you’d like to find out more, tune in on October 14, and meet both devices. </p>

<p> Android News / Special Edition OnePlus Nord May Not Offer Sandstone Back After All </p>
<p> Special Edition OnePlus Nord May Not Offer Sandstone Back After All </p>
<p> Later today, OnePlus is planning to announce a new Nord smartphone, along with the OnePlus 8T. That device got teased by the company already, and many people assumed it will offer a Sandstone back. Well, a new image has now surfaced, suggesting that the Special Edition OnePlus Nord may not feature a Sandstone back after all. </p>
<p> This image got shared by a Twitter user ‘Kellen’, who says he found it on OnePlus Forums, as the image was allegedly shared by the company ahead of time. That image is now gone, but he managed to get it before it was taken down. </p>
<p> The OnePlus Nord ‘Special Edition’ won’t feature a Sandstone back, it seems </p>
<p> If you take at the image below, you’ll see what we’re talking about here. It says this is the ‘Special Edition’ Gray Ash variant, the rumored one. The thing is, we can also see the back side of the device, and it sure doesn’t look like it’s a Sandstone back. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company’s ‘Sandstone’ material became really popular over the years. It was included on the back side of the two OnePlus handsets, and the company also released quite a few cases made out of that material. </p>
<p> Sandstone is supposed to mimic sandpaper, it’s not slippery, or anything of the sort. By the looks of this image, the Special Edition OnePlus Nord will include either glass or ceramic on its back. </p>
<p> It could even be ceramic, as this is supposed to be a ‘Special Edition’ phone, I’m only guessing here. Other than a different color and possibly material of its back, the rest of the phone will be the same, it seems. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This handset will probably cost more than the regular model, by the way. It’s also worth noting that OnePlus is expected to announce two new Nord smartphones later this month. Both will be inferior to the already-available OnePlus Nord, though. </p>
<p> Stay tuned, as the company’s press event will kick off at 7 AM PST / 4 PM CET. During that event, we’ll get all the necessary information about this ‘Special Edition’ smartphone. </p>

<p> OnePlus Teases The Arrival Of Its Very First Smartwatch </p>
<p> The OnePlus Watch was rumored to launch alongside the OnePlus 8T yesterday, but that didn’t happen. Well, don’t be too disappointed, as OnePlus just teased the arrival of its very first smartwatch. </p>
<p> The company did it via the OnePlus India Twitter handle. The company shared a sketch of a smartwatch from 2015, and shared it on Twitter, along with a caption. That caption reads: “More things are coming to the OnePlus ecosystem. It's just a matter of time”. </p>
<p> This almost could not be a more obvious confirmation that the company’s first smartwatch is on the way. This makes us wonder, though, when will the company announce it? Will it arrive alongside the OnePlus 9, or sooner than that, perhaps? </p>
<p> The very first OnePlus smartwatch is coming, but we’re not sure when exactly </p>
<p> We can only guess at this point, but it is possible that it will launch alongside the OnePlus 9. If that ends up being the case, though, we’re in for a long wait. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Max J., a well-known tipster, also shared some information on the matter. He went to Twitter to confirm that OnePlus never planned to announce its smartwatch alongside the OnePlus 8T. </p>
<p> Max J. was the person who teased the arrival of the OnePlus Watch, but he said he never mentioned when will that happen. He did, however, that more information is coming… though he wasn’t all that specific. </p>
<p> At this point in time, we do know that the OnePlus Watch will feature a round body with a circular display. Max J. more or less confirmed that with his teaser, and he seems to know what’s coming. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company’s very first smartwatch will almost certainly ship with Wear OS. OnePlus will likely tweak it, though, similar to what OPPO did with the OPPO Watch. It will be interesting to see OnePlus’ take on Wear OS, that’s for sure, as the company is doing an excellent job with OxygenOS. That being said, stay tuned, more information will probably follow in the near future. </p>

<p> OnePlus Confirms It Will Launch Three TV Variants On July 2 </p>
<p> OnePlus has confirmed that three OnePlus TV variants are coming on July 2. The company confirmed that via its ‘OnePlus India’ Twitter handle, as the TVs will launch in India, at least initially. </p>
<p> The company teased price tags for its TV in a new tweet. OnePlus teased three different price tags, which suggests three OnePlus TV models are coming our way, as expected. </p>
<p> The company will launch three OnePlus TV variants on July 2, as expected </p>
<p> The 32-inch, 42-inch, and 55-inch OnePlus TVs got certified from various sources lately. Those seem to be the display sizes on these TVs. As a reminder, those will be affordable TVs, considerably more affordable than the OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The first price tag the company teased is the INR1X,999, the second is INR2X,999, and the third is INR4X,999. That should give you, at least an approximate estimate of their prices. </p>
<p> So, the 32-inch model won’t be more expensive than INR19,999 ($265). The 42-inch model will not be more expensive than INR29,999 ($394), while the 55-inch model’s price won’t cross the INR49,999 ($662) mark. </p>
<p> Do note that these are absolutely the highest possible price points based on this tweet. It is possible that every single one of them will be more affordable than that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company has been teasing these TVs for a while now. The company did confirm that the TVs will feature an innovative acoustic arrangement, as the speakers will be rotated by 90 degrees. </p>
<p> That gave the company a chance to trim down these TVs even further. They will have extremely thin bezels, and will be extremely thin in general. </p>
<p> These TVs will feature 95-percent screen-to-body ratio </p>
<p> OnePlus did confirm that its new TV will ship with a 95-percent screen-to-body ratio. That will be a standout feature in the budget TV segment, said the company. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These TVs will probably have a lower resolution than the OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro. Those two TVs ship with 4K displays. Well, these new TVs will probably include fullHD or QHD displays. </p>
<p> India will be the first market these TVs will arrive to. The same happened with the OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro last year. The thing is, those two TVs never left India. </p>
<p> Well, these new budget TVs may launch in more markets. We at least hope they will, as it’s about time OnePlus does that. It had a test run with the OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/06/opinion-heres-why-the-blackberry-key2-is-a-premium-smartphone.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485114" filename="opinion-heres-why-the-blackberry-key2-is-a-premium-smartphone.html">
<p> Opinion: Here's Why The BlackBerry KEY2 Is A “Premium” Smartphone </p>
<p> If you look at the spec sheet of the BlackBerry KEY2, you may think it's a mid-range device. And that is because it runs on the Snapdragon 660 processor. Qualcomm has altered most consumers thinking so that a smartphone has to have a Snapdragon 800-series processor to really be a high-end or premium smartphone. But that's not the case. "Premium" refers to the entire smartphone package as a whole, not a processor, or a camera, or the software experience, but the entire smartphone experience. That makes the BlackBerry KEY2 a premium device from TCL and BlackBerry Mobile. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 isn't a flashy phone, but it does have a nice and solid build. It sports an aluminum body, with a rubberized back which makes it easier to hold in the hand, and less likely to slip out of your hand and onto the ground. It actually feels better in the hand than a lot of glass smartphones out there like the Samsung Galaxy S9 or the LG G7 ThinQ, not to mention it is much easier to hold onto since it's not glass. It's a bit of a unique build in 2018, seeing as every other smartphone out there is using a glass-and-metal sandwich build. TCL and BlackBerry Mobile have also made the KEY2 rather rugged, where it can actually take a drop or two better than something from HTC, LG or Samsung with a glass back that's going to be pretty fragile – and if it hits the ground, there's a pretty good chance that the phone will be shattered, but that's not the case with the KEY2. The KEY2 also has a "Convenience" key on the side of the phone, which can be used for anything, whether that's opening up Google Assistant, the camera or something else. This is going to be cheesy but, it's actually really "convenient" and much better than having a button dedicated to either Bixby or the Google Assistant and not being able to switch it to something else. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Then there's the software on the KEY2. It's much the same as on the KEYone from last year, but with a few improvements. On the surface, the software here doesn't look much different from stock Android, which many may feel is "boring" and well – that's their opinion. But what BlackBerry has done with this device is similar to what Motorola has done in the past. Taking stock Android from AOSP and adding on a bunch of features that its customers want, without changing things just because they can. BlackBerry has also added a bunch of security features, including an app called DTEK and another one called Locker. DTEK allows the user to see how secure their smartphone is, and what the user can do to make it more secure – whether that's adding a fingerprint, removing some app permissions, etc. Now with Locker, users are able to lock up pictures, videos, apps, games and so much more. So that prying eyes don't see them. That's not unique to BlackBerry's KEY2 though, as Samsung has something similar, but it is much more robust. Part of the allure of being a "secure" smartphone is getting regular updates, which BlackBerry has already done well with, sending out security updates sometimes before Google even announces them. So while the software here may not be as customized as the Samsung Experience or LG's own software, it does have some great features that give the device a much more "premium" experience. </p>
<p> BlackBerry brought back the physical keyboard on the KEYone last year and made it even better on the KEY2 in 2018. It now has a matte finish, and not only looks premium but also gives you a premium experience. Not only are you able to type quickly using a physical keyboard, but you can also set up a slew of different shortcuts using the physical keyboard here, which makes it easier to navigate through the operating system and opening different apps. It's a feature that many people, especially former-BlackBerry users, love, and it's good to see it back. It does build on the premise that the BlackBerry KEY2 is indeed a premium device. </p>

<p> Despite TCL using a Snapdragon 660 inside the BlackBerry KEY2, this is still a premium device. The processor itself does not designate a phone as a "premium" device or a "mid-range" one but the entire package does. The reason why TCL likely went with the Snapdragon 660 over something like the Snapdragon 845 is simply because the Snapdragon 660 is better on battery life without impacting performance, in addition to being slightly more affordable. And that is one of the key features that makes a BlackBerry smartphone stand out from the crowd – its incredible battery life. The Snapdragon 660 is no slouch, it powers a number of great devices out there and can definitely keep up with other "premium" offerings that money can currently buy. The rest of the BlackBerry KEY2 spec sheet shows that it is a premium device (except perhaps its full HD display), including 6GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of storage. </p>
<p> BlackBerry has done something different with its smartphones since it started its partnership with TCL and formed "BlackBerry Mobile." And that is creating a smartphone that doesn't look the same as the rest of the market. That makes the KEY2 a breath of fresh air in a market full of metal-and-glass smartphones equipped with unseemly display notches. TCL and BlackBerry Mobile have a smartphone here that has a physical keyboard – the only such product released in 2018 – it has an aluminum body with a rubberized back, and offers near-stock Android experience. That is definitely different from the HTC U12 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S9, and the LG G7 ThinQ, all of which are high-end smartphones from 2018 with the Snapdragon 845, but the KEY2 got more attention than most of these, and why is that? Because it is different. And there are many users out there that still want a smartphone with a physical keyboard, which is what BlackBerry is offering here. So yes, the BlackBerry KEY2 is indeed a premium device even though it starts at "only" $599. </p>

<p> Opinion: Smartphone Makers Can Learn A Lot From BlackBerry Mobile </p>
<p> The latest BlackBerry-branded phone is now here, the BlackBerry KEY2, and other smartphone makers can learn a lot from paying attention to BlackBerry and its approach to bringing to market new mobile products. As while smartphones like the KEY2 are not the most spec-heavy handsets currently available, the KEY2 specifically is one that offers consumers something a little different to the rest. Which, in itself is a selling point worth noting, and an additional reason to embrace the BlackBerry brand once again. </p>
<p> Be different, it’s ok </p>
<p> There’s no escaping how iconic of a brand BlackBerry is and being iconic — identifiable — in today’s market is becoming more important each year. As whether intentional or not, BlackBerry has stumbled into the Android world right about the same time that all other smartphone OEMs seem to be converging on a singularity approach where their flagship options are all too much alike. Of course, it’s understandable this is happening at the flagship level as OEMs all want to offer the best specs, the best design, and the best phone they can, overall – and this usually means drawing on others for inspiration and in some cases, downright copying features and design cues. So while understandable, it does not take away from the fact that consumers are starting to have less choice than ever before. Yes, you can opt for the latest phone from this manufacturer, or from that one, but in reality, the smartphone market at the consumer level is now comprised of too many shades of grey. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So while the BlackBerry KEY2 is not the best of the best when it comes to specs, there is no arguing against the suggestion it adds color to an otherwise gray smartphone market. In some respects, it is not just a phone from a brand that is different, but it represents the idea that you do not have to follow the market at all. Take the display for instance; nowadays the common understanding is that a new and so-called premium phone must have more display real estate than it did last year. Whether that is by adopting a larger display in general, utilizing an 18:9 aspect ratio, an edge-to-edge design, or a notch, the cardinal theme is more = better. Yet at the same time, BlackBerry Mobile is offering one of the smallest displays on an Android phone, coming in at 4.5 inches. Adding to that, it doesn’t have a notch. So there are two examples of just display-related aspects that are not only different but the opposite of what OEMs currently see as conventional thinking and consumer must-haves. Need another example? The SoC. Most OEMs would not dare release a high-profile smartphone today not powered by Qualcomm’s 800-series, let alone the 845, but that is exactly what BlackBerry Mobile has done with the KEY2 due to the inclusion of a Snapdragon 660 SoC. In fact, it is this processor that will largely determine this as a mid-range and not a flagship device, although with a starting price of $649 in the US, it seems hard to define this as a mid-range option. And therein is one of the market contradictions, as there is now a common understanding that a 'premium' or top-tier device must be equipped with an 800-series processor. BlackBerry Mobile seems to think otherwise and this is important to note as the KEY2 is a device designed to be a workhorse device – after all, it’s a BlackBerry. So the ‘stepping-down’ do a Snapdragon 660 is something which BlackBerry Mobile believes is sufficient enough to provide users with the power and processing capabilities they need. Whether rightly or not, the very fact the KEY2 is equipped with a 660 is further evidence of thinking differently and not just including for the sake of keeping up with others. The market as a whole would do well to no longer define premium solely by the processor but the package on offer in its entirety. </p>
<p> Still not convinced? Then how about the keyboard. It's hard to look at the KEY2 and not see the keyboard, as it is literally the main selling point with the phone. This is again something which is now seen as a complete no-no in the industry. Not only have apps and interfaces moved toward a touch-based interface, but the inclusion of ANY hardware on the front panel is now considered immoral due to its infringing on the must-have larger display – it's only a matter of time before the last of the front panel hardware (camera, speaker, and so on) is embedded below the display. But there is a missed-logic here as the more display space is only needed if the device is primarily focused on the touch-based interface, and this is where BlackBerry Mobile has been smart as its interpretation of Android is not solely touch-based. The keyboard has not just been included as a means to remind you of who the company is, or to cater to those still living in the early 2000s, but also as an alternative way to engage with the Android interface. Alternative, as in a keyboard-driven user experience. Examples of this were shown off during the launch event with the KEY2 able to jump from app to app by typing the first letter of the app’s name. A point specifically made during the event – you don’t have to rely on a swiping experience with a smartphone anymore. In other words, swiping is not the only option – again, thinking differently. </p>
<p> Security and privacy matter </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Security and privacy do indeed now matter. And to be fair this is something that all manufacturers have started to understand, as most, if not all, do usually include some security or privacy-focused features on their new phones. However, BlackBerry does not just include a feature or two but instead shapes its phones around security and privacy. That is a fairly big difference and to further illustrate how big of a difference it is, security and privacy are to BlackBerry as artificial intelligence (AI) is to Google, Samsung, LG, and the rest. While the other companies are shaping their smartphone products around AI and the so-called smarter experience, BlackBerry is shaping its around protecting user data and providing a reassuring experience to its users. In today's world, something that likely needs little defending or further explanation. This is not to say there are no AI features on offer with the KEY2, as there are, it’s just not the purpose of the phone and this is telling in its own right as the recent mass migration to AI-centric products represents how important AI is to them – the companies. BlackBerry on the other hand, is focusing its centricity on something that actually matters to the consumer. An important distinction as while both approaches favor the companies, one also is designed with the consumer in the now, not in the future. </p>
<p> Wrap-up </p>
<p> Of course, many will counter every point made here by saying all of these reasons are why BlackBerry Mobile will not sell many smartphones this year. Further explained by how no one wants a keyboard, no one wants less display, no one wants a lesser processor, no one wants a non-touch-based interface. And maybe they are right. However, to counter those arguments, there are plenty of OEMs currently operating in the 'singularity mode' and who are not selling as many smartphones as they think they should be, or the market dictates they ought to be. This is not something that even requires name-dropping as the reports have come in thick and fast over the last few years on the number of high-profile companies who are struggling to keep their mobile businesses afloat due to a lack of sales. This is, in spite of those same manufacturers packing those same phones with all the same features – display-first, best specs possible, notch, and in some cases, an almost iPhone copycat design. So there is definitely something in saying others could learn from BlackBerry and not just conforming to the perceived standards self-imposed on the industry, as playing by those rules is not helping a number of big-name companies. To use a now-famous Apple line, maybe it’s time for those smartphone brands to “Think Different.” </p>

<p> Outlook For Android Now Supports Syncing With Calendar Apps </p>
<p> Microsoft has added a nifty feature to its Outlook app with the latest Play Store update. Outlook for Android will now allow users to sync their calendars with other calendar apps like Google Calendar and Samsung Calendar. Users can update their Outlook app to the latest version from the Play Store to start syncing their calendar apps. </p>
<p> This is very beneficial for those who use multiple calendar apps. Notably, syncing calendars works both ways. When compatible calendar apps are linked, the Outlook calendar events will also show up in those apps. Similarly, events from other calendar apps will appear in the Outlook calendar. </p>
<p> Outlook now supports syncing with Google and Samsung calendar apps </p>
<p> Users can also make edits to the events in any of the synced apps. Apart from first-party apps like Google Calendar and Samsung Calendar, this should also work with any calendar app available on the Play Store. Moreover, this new feature is not just limited to Microsoft 365 (previously known as Office 365) subscribers. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It will be available to everyone with an Outlook email account. Outlook is already one of the best email clients available in the Play Store. With this new feature, more users could switch to Outlook from other apps. Over the last few months, Microsoft has added several new features to improve productivity. </p>
<p> Just last month, the company announced that it would soon integrate voice assistant into the Outlook app. The app will support scheduling a meeting or sending a short email using the voice assistant. There are also a few new shortcuts for suggested replies. </p>
<p> Microsoft announced to soon add more shortcuts </p>
<p> First off, Outlook will suggest the option to send availability or schedule meeting if it detects any meeting or get together related information. While the Outlook notifications on Android come with three quick actions, the app will allow the user to customize any of them to their liking. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Furthermore, users can scan the QR code shown on the Outlook website for quickly signing in to the Outlook mobile app. Microsoft is also bringing the weather to the Outlook app. Users can get a quick glance at the current and forecasted weather at their current location. </p>
<p> The company will also add text predictions to the Outlook mobile app. This feature will, however, be exclusive to Microsoft 365 subscribers. Outlook will also get a new feature called Reactions around the New Year. Users can add emojis to emails in group conversations to express their feelings without having to add more emails. </p>

<p> Pete Lau Spills The Beans On Upcoming OnePlus TVs </p>
<p> OnePlus is planning to announce new, more affordable TVs really soon. Pete Lau, the CEO of OnePlus, got interviewed by Android Central, and he decided to share some details regarding those products. </p>
<p> OnePlus' CEO has been heavily invested in the design process of OnePlus products </p>
<p> The company’s CEO has been heavily invested in the design of OnePlus products since the get-go. In the interview, he said that he feels that design is the key aspect when it comes to a product, the main way the company can differentiate itself. </p>
<p> The company is focusing on two key areas in order to differentiate, those areas are the design and user experience. Mr. Lau claims OnePlus is not making design compromises despite the fact these will be budget products. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The upcoming OnePlus TVs will be extremely thin, they will measure only 6.9mm in that aspect. That’s less than the OnePlus 8, for those of you who are keeping track. </p>
<p> Pete Lau also said that the upcoming OnePlus TVs will feature an innovative acoustic speaker arrangement. The speakers will be rotated by 90 degrees, actually. </p>
<p> This basically allowed OnePlus to fit two large, full-range speakers into these TVs. The company’s CEO claims that the result is a 50-percent deeper bass, which sounds great. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> New OnePlus TVs will offer a 95-percent screen-to-body ratio, says Pete Lau </p>
<p> The company’s CEO also confirmed that these TVs will offer a 95-percent screen-to-body ratio. Thin bezels are common in the premium segment, but not in the budget category. That is another way OnePlus TVs will differentiate themselves. </p>
<p> It is also worth noting that the display with a 93-percent DCI-P3 color gamut is also made to stand out. These TVs will also sport a carbon fiber pattern on the back, similar to the OnePlus Q1 and Q1 Pro. </p>
<p> Pete Lau did not reveal any specific features when it comes to software, but we can expect some. The OnePlus Connect service has been quite successful for the company, as did the OxygenPlay content curation platform. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OnePlus is always boasting about its community of users, and their ideas. Mr. Lau says that its users did play a role in designing the OnePlus TV experience, for sure. </p>
<p> OnePlus will announce several new TVs on July 2. Based on the certification filling, we’re expecting to see three TVs. We’ll get 32-inch, 42-inch, and 55-inch OnePlus TV models this time around. </p>
<p> These will be budget offerings, unlike the OnePlus Q1 and Q1 Pro last year. These TVs will become official in India, and it remains to be seen if they’ll ship to other markets. </p>

<p> Phone Comparisons: ASUS ZenFone 6 vs Google Pixel 4 XL </p>
<p> We’re here to see the ASUS ZenFone 6 compared vs the Google Pixel 4 XL. Both of these phones are flagship offerings from their respective companies. The ASUS ZenFone 6 launched back in May, while the Pixel 4 XL arrived last month, in October. </p>
<p> Both of these phones have a lot to offer, though their price tags are considerably different. The ZenFone 6 is a much cheaper smartphone, it’s available at $549 in the US, while the Pixel 4 XL starts at $899 in the States. </p>
<p> Can the Pixel 4 XL justify such a huge price difference? Well, that’s what we’re here to find out, more or less. Both of these phones are compelling in their own ways, and in this comparison, we’ll try to see what are each of their strong and weak sides. Let’s kick off the ZenFone 6 vs Pixel 4 XL comparison, shall we. </p>
<p> Specs </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 6 </p>
<p> Google Pixel 4 XL </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 6 vs Google Pixel 4 XL: Design </p>
<p> These two devices differ quite a bit in the design department. Neither of them has a display hole or a display notch, which is a rarity these days. The ZenFone 6 does sport considerably thinner bezels, though, and there’s a good reason for that. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6 includes a flip-up camera on the back, so ASUS did not need much space on the front. The Pixel 4 XL, on the other hand, includes its camera hardware above the display, along with a ton of additional sensors. The device even includes a radar sensor above the display, which is why its top bezel is so thick. </p>
<p> The rest of the Pixel 4 XL’s bezels are comparable to the ones on the ZenFone 6, but not the top one. That top one is considerably thicker than the one on the ZenFone 6. Both devices offer rounded corners, that goes for display corners as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both phones include two cameras on the back, while the ZenFone 6 also sports a capacitive fingerprint scanner back there. The ZenFone 6 is considerably more slippery than the Pixel 4 XL, despite the fact they’re both made out of metal and glass. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6 has a curved back, while the Pixel 4 XL does not. On top of that, its frame is painted, so the frame itself is less slippery as well. Its back has some sort of brushed coating on top, which helps with grippiness as well. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 6 is shorter, wider, and thicker than the Pixel 4 XL. The Pixel 4 XL is a bit heavier, but only by 3 grams. Do note that only the Pixel 4 XL offer IP68 certification for water and dust resistance here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We can’t really make up our mind when it comes to the winner. The ZenFone 6 looks a lot better from the front, while the Pixel 4 XL’s back side takes the cake. The Pixel 4 XL is also less slippery, and it doesn’t have a motorized camera setup. To each its own, but this is a tie in our book. </p>
<p> Winner: Tie </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 6 vs Google Pixel 4 XL: Display </p>
<p> As far as the displays are concerned, well, there’s one clear winner here. The ASUS ZenFone 6 is one of the very few well-known, flagship-grade phones to include an LCD panel. The phone comes with a 6.4-inch fullHD+ (2340 x 1080) IPS LCD display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That panel is really good for an LCD display, but cannot measure up to the Pixel 4 XL’s display. Google’s flagship includes a 6.3-inch QHD+ (3040 x 1440) P-OLED display. That panel is not only higher in resolution, and an OLED panel, but one of the best displays in the market. </p>
<p> The Pixel 4 XL’s display offers really saturated colors, great contrast, and great viewing angles. The ZenFone 6’s display is not bad by any means, and it offers great viewing angles, but its colors and contrast are not comparable to the Pixel 4 XL’s. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6’s display supports HDR10, and is protected by the Gorilla Glass 6. The Pixel 4 XL’s, on the other hand, supports HDR output as well, while it is protected by the Gorilla Glass 5. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There is one more considerable difference between these displays. The Pixel 4 XL’s panel offers a 90Hz refresh rate, while the ZenFone 6’s is stuck at 60Hz. That makes the Pixel 4 XL a lot more enjoyable to use, as 60Hz displays do look somewhat laggy compared to 90Hz ones, even though that’s just the refresh rate talking. </p>
<p> All in all, the Pixel 4 XL is a clear winner in this category. The device has one of the best OLED panels in the business, and the ZenFone 6’s IPS LCD display is not in the same class, despite the fact it’s one of the best LCD panels out there. </p>
<p> Winner: Google Pixel 4 XL </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 6 vs Google Pixel 4 XL: Performance </p>
<p> Earlier iterations of ASUS’ ZenUI were not all that good. ZenUI used to be quite laggy due to a ton of bloatware that was installed on it. Well, that’s not the case with the ZenFone 6’s ZenUI 6. ASUS decided to change things up, and clear up its UI. It is much more similar to stock Android now, and it performs much better as well. </p>
<p> Both of these phones are great performers, though we’ll give the advantage to the Pixel 4 XL. The device simply stutters less than the ZenFone 6. Just to be clear, the difference is minimal, as the ZenFone 6 performs great. Software iterations on both phones are backed by really powerful hardware. </p>
<p> Both devices are fueled by the Snapdragon 855, and both include 6GB of RAM on the inside. Neither of them includes UFS 3.0 flash storage, though, you’ll find UFS 2.1 storage inside both devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Pixel 4 XL’s 90Hz display also helps when it comes to performance. Well, not exactly, but it does make the phone seem more fluid, due to a high refresh rate. Higher refresh rate displays are impacting both the performance and battery more, but that’s not something you’ll notice on the Pixel 4 XL. </p>
<p> Winner: Google Pixel 4 XL </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 6 vs Google Pixel 4 XL: Battery </p>
<p> Now, when the battery life is concerned, the ASUS ZenFone 6 is the clear winner. The phone includes a 5,000mAh battery on the inside, compared to a 3.700mAh unit inside the Pixel 4 XL. Higher battery capacity does not necessarily mean better battery life, but in this case, it sure does. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6 also has a lower-res display, and lower display refresh rate, which also helps it get ahead in the battery department. Most of you will be able to get 5-5.5 hours of screen-on-time on the Pixel 4 XL, presuming you don’t force that display to run at 90Hz all the time. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6 will push you way above that, you should be able to get over 7-7.5 hours of screen-on-time on this phone without a problem, even above 8, depending on your usage. The ZenFone 6 can really last for quite some time. </p>
<p> Both phones support 18W fast charging, Quick Charge 4.0, in other words. Only the Pixel 4 XL supports wireless charging though, while the ZenFone 6 supports reverse charging. Do note that the ZenFone 6 comes with wired reverse charging (10W), not wireless reverse charging. </p>
<p> Needless to say, the ASUS ZenFone 6 is the clear winner here. If you need a phone with great battery life, the ZenFone 6 should be considered. </p>
<p> Winner: ASUS ZenFone 6 </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 6 vs Google Pixel 4 XL: Cameras </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 4 XL is one of the best camera smartphones in the market. The ZenFone 6 is not bad in that regard, but it cannot compete with the Pixel 4 XL. Both devices include two cameras on the back, while the ZenFone 6 utilizes those cameras as its selfie shooters as well. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6 comes with 48 and 13-megapixel units, wide-angle main camera, and the ultrawide secondary unit. The Pixel 4 XL, on the other hand, does not offer an ultrawide camera, only a telephoto one, in addition to its main sensor. </p>
<p> The Pixel 4 XL can capture images that offer richer colors, more detail, and better dynamic range. Images from the Pixel 4 XL simply look sharper. They may seem a bit unrealistic in some conditions, but in a good way. </p>
<p> When the light goes away, the Pixel 4 XL truly shines. This is probably the best phone for low light photography in the market, as it allows a lot of light and detail to get into a picture. The ZenFone 6 can capture decent images in low light, but nothing close to the Pixel 4 XL. </p>
<p> When it comes to selfies, however, the ZenFone 6 reigns supreme. It uses its main cameras for selfies, so that’s not surprising. The Pixel 4 XL still does a great job when it comes to selfies, as it can produce really sharp pictures with its front-facing camera. </p>
<p> Video capture is comparable on the two devices, though the ZenFone 6 does offer 4K video recording at 60fps. The Pixel 4 XL is limited to 30fps. Truth be said, the Pixel 4 XL does seem to do a bit of a better job when it comes to video, despite that. 1080p recording at 60fps is great on the phone, and you won’t be disappointed. On the flip side, 4K recording at 60fps is not that great on the ZenFone 6, it’s good, but not great. </p>
<p> Winner: Google Pixel 4 XL </p>
<p> ASUS ZenFone 6 vs Google Pixel 4 XL: Audio </p>
<p> Both the ASUS ZenFone 6 and Pixel 4 XL do come with stereo speakers. Those speakers are really good on both phones, they offer clear output, and minimal distortion at high volumes. All in all, there’s nothing to complain about here. </p>
<p> Only the ASUS ZenFone 6 includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, though. It also comes with DTS Headphone X support, in case you were wondering. When you plug in a pair of headphones into these two phones, presuming they’re any good, you’ll hear the difference. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6 offers a bit more bass, while highs and mids are a bit better on the ZenFone 6. Not to say that the audio is bad on the Pixel 4 XL, quite the contrary. We did notice a difference, though. </p>
<p> Having all that in mind, we’ll give an advantage to the ZenFone 6 in this regard. Not only does the phone offer a 3.5mm headphone jack, but audio output through headphones is a bit better in our opinion. </p>
<p> Winner: ASUS ZenFone 6 </p>
<p> The overall winner </p>
<p> That brings us to the end of the ASUS ZenFone 6 vs Google Pixel 4 XL comparison. The Pixel 4 XL did win here, as it won in most categories, but only barely. The ZenFone 6 managed to take the win in two out of six categories, while the Pixel 4 XL won in three. </p>
<p> It all depends on what you need in a phone, of course. The Pixel 4 XL delivers better performance, better display, and better camera experience. The ZenFone 6, on the other hand, has an advantage in the battery and audio departments. </p>
<p> Is the Pixel 4 XL worth paying so much more? Well, it depends on what you need in a smartphone, but we do think that the price difference between the two phones should not be so pronounced. The Pixel 4 XL should be considerably more affordable. </p>

<p> Phone Comparisons: ASUS ZenFone 6 vs OnePlus 7T </p>
<p> It’s time for the ASUS ZenFone 6 vs OnePlus 7T comparison. These two handsets are both flagship-grade offerings from their respective companies. Both of them are also quite affordable compared to other flagship phones in the market. That alone makes them worth comparing, for sure. </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 6 is actually even more affordable than the OnePlus 7T. The device starts at $499 in the US, while the OnePlus 7T can be purchased from $599. Is it worth paying an extra $100 for the device over, the ZenFone 6? Well, that’s what we’re here to find out, basically. </p>
<p> In this comparison article, we’ll pit the ASUS ZenFone 6 vs OnePlus 7T in a number of categories. At the very end, we’ll consider winners from each of those categories, to make the final call. Do note that this is only our opinion, and your mileage may vary, of course. </p>

<p> Specifications </p>
<p> Design </p>
<p> Both of these phones look quite sleek. Both of them are made out of metal and glass, and both have fairly thin bezels. The OnePlus 7T’s bezels are thinner, though, that is worth noting. The phone has a considerably thinner “chin” than the ZenFone 6. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6, on the other hand, does not have a display notch or a display hole. For that reason, you can take advantage of its full display, without any annoyances on it. The OnePlus 7T does have a display notch, though it includes a waterdrop display notch which is extremely small. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both phones are quite slippery, and they actually weigh the same at 190 grams. They are fairly similar in terms of dimensions as well, though the OnePlus 7T is both shorter, narrower, and thinner than the ZenFone 6. The difference in thickness is quite obvious, as the OnePlus 7T is 1.1mm thinner. The main reason for the ZenFone 6’s thickness is its huge battery. We wouldn’t say that the phone is thick, at all, but it’s noticeably thicker than the OnePlus 7T. </p>
<p> Both devices have rather odd-looking camera setups on the back. The ZenFone 6 utilizes a pop-up camera setup, which includes two cameras. Those two cameras serve as both rear-facing and front-facing units. The OnePlus 7T, on the other hand, includes three cameras on the bottom, inside a circular camera setup. The ZenFone 6 also has a capacitive fingerprint scanner on the back, unlike the OnePlus 7T. </p>
<p> Both of these phones look really nice. The OnePlus 7T offers thinner bezels, and a tiny notch. The ZenFone 6, on the other hand, no notch and slightly thicker bezels. Both phones have fairly odd-looking camera setups on the back. As far as the design is concerned, these two phones are on the same playing field in our book. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Winner: Tie </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> Both of these phones include flat fullHD+ panels, though they’re fairly different. The ZenFone 6 comes with a 6.4-inch fullHD+ (2340 x 1080) IPS LCD display. The OnePlus 7T, on the other hand, features a 6.55-inch fullHD+ (2400 x 1080) Fluid AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. </p>
<p> We’ll say it from the get-go, the OnePlus 7T has a better display in this comparison. The OnePlus 7T’s display actually managed to beat the Galaxy Note 10+’s panel in most categories in a technical comparison. The only category it lost is the resolution, but that difference between a QHD+ and FullHD+ panels is not really visible when you hold them side-by-side. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OnePlus managed to reduce blue light emitting from the OnePlus 7T quite a bit. Due to that fact, the display looks extremely crisp. The ZenFone 6 does have one of the best fullHD+ IPS LCD displays in the business, but it cannot really stand up to the OnePlus 7T’s panel. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 7T’s display offers better color reproduction, contrast is way more pronounced, while those blacks are black. Viewing angles are really good on both displays, though. The OnePlus 7T’s panel also supports HDR10+ content, and 90Hz refresh rate. The ZenFone 6 is limited to 60Hz, and HDR10. </p>
<p> Winner: OnePlus 7T </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Performance </p>
<p> OnePlus’ flagships are usually winners in performance comparisons. The same is the case here, but you’d be surprised how well the ZenFone 6 is holding up. Both phones are really smooth on a day-to-day basis, but the OnePlus 7T’s software optimizations plus that 90Hz display make it seem noticeably smoother and faster. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 7T also comes with UFS 3.0 flash storage, which is something the ZenFone 6 is not equipped with. The OnePlus 7T can open apps faster, and is also faster when it comes to multitasking, but not by much. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6 comes with the Snapdragon 855, and either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. That, in addition to Android 9 Pie, and ZenUI 6, make this phone an excellent performer. ZenUI 6 is a lot different than the ZenUI 5, and that’s a good thing. ASUS removed a ton of bloatware from ZenUI, which only benefits the ZenFone 6. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both phones can handle pretty much every game you throw at them, and won’t really struggle with it. We did notice a stutter from time to time on the ZenFone 6, which was not the case with the OnePlus 7T, for now. That is nothing to worry about, as both phones are really smooth in terms of performance. </p>
<p> Winner: OnePlus 7T </p>
<p> Battery life </p>
<p> ASUS has decided to include a fairly large battery inside the ZenFone 6. The phone features a 5,000mAh unit, compared to the OnePlus 7T’s 3,800mAh battery. The OnePlus 7T is actually fairly good when it comes to battery consumption, and can provide you 6+ hours of screen-on-time, at least that was the case for us. The ZenFone 6 goes beyond that, though, as expected. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If battery endurance is of utmost importance to you, the ZenFone 6 is a great option. This phone can go head-to-head with pretty much every flagship out there, and it will beat most of them as well in this regard. </p>
<p> Neither of these two smartphones offer wireless charging, though the ZenFone 6 does offer reverse charging (10W). The OnePlus 7T is equipped with faster battery charging, though, Warp Charge 30T. The ZenFone 6 includes 18W battery charging (Quick Charge 4). The ZenFone 6 is the winner of this category. </p>
<p> Winner: ASUS ZenFone 6 </p>
<p> Cameras </p>
<p> The ASUS ZenFone 6 includes two cameras on the back, and it uses those cameras as front-facing ones as well. The OnePlus 7T, on the other hand, has three cameras on the back, and one on the front. </p>
<p> Both phones are equipped with a 48-megapixel main sensor. In both cases, that is Sony’s IMX586 sensor. The OnePlus 7T’s main camera does offer a camera lens with a more compelling aperture, though, while OIS is also included. </p>
<p> Both phones have a dedicated ultrawide camera, while the OnePlus 7T also includes a telephoto unit (2x optical zoom). So, are these phones capable in regards to capturing images, or? </p>
<p> Well, yeah, they’re both good, but the OnePlus 7T has an advantage. The OnePlus 7T can provide noticeably better shots in low light, while daytime shots from the phone also look a bit better to us. The dynamic range is better on the phone, while colors also seem to be a bit better-balanced than on the ZenFone 6. If you’re into selfies, however, the ZenFone 6 will do a better job, as it uses its rear-facing cameras for shooting selfies. </p>
<p> Winner: OnePlus 7T </p>
<p> Audio </p>
<p> If you’re listening to a lot of music, or consume plenty of multimedia on your phone, you’re probably wondering if the audio is any good. The good news is, audio is really good on both of these phones. They are not providing the best audio in the business, but very few people will complain when it comes to sound quality. </p>
<p> Both of them are equipped with stereo speakers, and those speakers are fairly good. They get plenty loud, and the distortion is barely noticeable when you tune them all the way up. The OnePlus 7T comes with Dolby Atmos sound, while the ZenFone 6 offers DTS Headphone X support. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6 does have a 3.5 headphone jack, which is something the OnePlus 7T cannot say for itself. Sound quality through a pair of earphones is quite similar on both phones, they’re both fairly good, and offer balanced sound. Sound provided by the OnePlus 7T did seem a bit crisper to us, but we’ll end this category with a tie. The ZenFone 6 includes an audio jack, after all. </p>
<p> Winner: Tie </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> That brings us to the end of the ZenFone 6 vs OnePlus 7T comparison. All in all, the OnePlus 7T is the winner of this comparison. This phone is worth spending an extra $100 in our opinion, as it beats the ZenFone 6 in most of these categories. The ZenFone 6 is a fairly good device as well, and you won’t make a mistake by picking that one up. </p>
<p> It all depends on what you need from a phone. If you take a lot of selfies and want great battery life, get the ZenFone 6. If you like buttery smoothness when it comes to performance, and also want better cameras and display, get the OnePlus 7T. </p>

<p> Phone Comparisons: OnePlus 6 vs BlackBerry KEY2 </p>
<p> Do we have a good one for you today – the OnePlus 6 takes on the BlackBerry KEY2. Here we have two smartphones that look to appeal to difference audiences. Just like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 has its S Pen, the BlackBerry KEY2 has its physical keyboard and built-in security. The build on both devices is excellent – the OnePlus 6 is all glass and the KEY2 has a metal back – and both have a premium look, with the BlackBerry KEY2 very much a business-like device. If you are looking for the larger display and premium processor, the OnePlus 6 would be your pick, but if you want a physical keyboard and the best security you will find in a smartphone, then the KEY2 is the answer. Let us look at what these two devices have in common. </p>
<p> In reality, the OnePlus 6 and the BlackBerry KEY2 do not have much in common. The OnePlus 6 is more of a mainstream device while the BlackBerry KEY2 is geared more towards a business user who is concerned about security, and not necessarily the largest display. As their displays are different sizes, use a different technology, a different aspect ratio, and a different Gorilla Glass version for protection. Both smartphones do use a Snapdragon processor and an Adreno GPU, but not the same model. They do share 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, although the storage is only expandable in the KEY2. They both share a dual camera setup, but use different size lenses, and the same can be said for their front-facing camera (FFC). The batteries are close in size, with both being non-removable, and both offering support for fast charging, while neither support wireless charging. Even though their display sizes are different, the two phones are very close in overall physical size due to the KEY2’s physical keyboard. They both have the usual suspects, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v5.0, NFC, and a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer. They both contain a 3.5mm headphone jack, a fingerprint sensor, and come running on Android 8.1 (Oreo). Both devices are sold unlocked. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Please take a careful look at the detailed specifications comparison chart below and here you will see just how these two high-end Android smartphones stack up against each other. Which one is the better purchase by offering the most technology for the least amount of money? Are you looking for a powerful phone or one with more security? These are the type of questions we will attempt to answer. </p>
<p> Specifications </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OnePlus 6 </p>
<p> OnePlus designs and executes well-built and reasonably-priced smartphones. This is something the company has always delivered and the OnePlus 6 is no exception. It does contain a notch and uses AMOLED technology. While OnePlus might never go beyond an FHD+ display, the company does always pack in a bunch of RAM. There are no fancy doodads, such as a heart rate monitor or SpO2 sensor (like you will find on a Samsung Galaxy 9), but you will have a terrific bargain on you hand. You will find a great dual camera and FFC on the OnePlus 6 and to make it more user-friendly you can use the Alert Slider to zoom in/out when taking a photo. Its harshest critics will complain about the notched display and the lack of expandable storage. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 6 sports a 6.28-inch Optic AMOLED display with a Full HD+ resolution and a notch. It has a resolution of 2280 x 1080 pixels, which gives it 402 pixels-per-inch (PPI). OnePlus is trying to save battery life with the FHD+ display, claiming our eyes do not need a QHD+ display. The new aspect ratio is not lost on the OnePlus 6, coming in at 19:9, adding to the phone’s overall modern look. The taller and narrower display is perfectly-suited for watching movies and videos, but also makes multitasking easier. As with other Android smartphones that use a notch, you can falsely hide the notch by making it look like there is a small bezel across the top, but it's still there. Gorilla Glass 5 protects the display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 845 combined with the Adreno 630 is the latest processing combo from Qualcomm and that is just what the OnePlus 6 is packing. It is an octa-core processor clocked at 2.8 GHz and is accompanied by 6GB to 8GB of RAM, along with a base of 64GB of non-expandable storage. You can also purchase a 128GB or 256GB model that comes strictly with 8GB of RAM. What is nice is that each additional storage upgrade only adds $50 to the price of the phone. A 3,300 mAh capacity battery powers the OnePlus 6 and OnePlus’ own Dash Charge (Quick Charge 3.0) technology is available for quick charging. Even with the design change to an all-glass backing, OnePlus still does not offer wireless charging. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 6 uses a dual camera setup with the primary camera using a 20-megapixel sensor, an aperture of f/1.7, as well as EIS and OIS to enhance stabilization. The other camera is a large 16-megapixel affair with the same f/1.7 aperture. PDAF and dual LED flash work for both cameras. The FFC is a large 16-megapixel sensor that uses EIS for stabilization and Auto HDR – this should provide some great selfies and improve video chatting. OnePlus has upgraded its camera software and now you can use the Alert Slider to zoom in or out on your subject. </p>
<p> Besides being a beautiful-looking and well-built device, the OnePlus 6’s top features are 6GB of RAM, a good rear camera experience, and an excellent FFC for a reasonable price. The downsides of the OnePlus 6 are the notch in the display, the lack of a QHD+ display, and lack of an option to expand the storage. The company's user interface, OxygenOS, adds a light touch over Android Oreo 8.1 and does not slow down its operation. The device measures 155.7 x 75.4 x 7.8 mm and weighs in at 177 grams. It comes in Midnight Black, Mirror Black, or Silk White. It will cost you $529 for the 6GB/64GB version, $579 for the 8GB/128GB version, and $629 for the 8GB/256GB version – a bargain for any of the configurations. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> BlackBerry KEY2 </p>
<p> BlackBerry Mobile smartphones are now designed and built by TCL Corporation, and while other flagship manufacturers are enlarging displays and reducing their bezel size, TCL is delivering the BlackBerry KEY2 as a device that stands out from the crowd. The KEY2, while totally retro-looking, is one of the best-built devices on the market. The metal design is beautifully sculptured around a 4.5-inch display and a physical keyboard that is 20-percent larger than the one included with the KEYOne. TCL has thoughtfully added rubberized backing that makes gripping the device a breeze. This is one good-looking device, even though it is vastly different from what we are used to. </p>
<p> The front of the KEY2 looks all business with its display on top and the physical keyboard below. The KEY2 sports a 4.5-inch IPS LCD FHD+ display with a resolution of 1620 x 1080 pixels, and 434 PPI. Like the OnePlus 6, the KEY2 is saving on battery life through the inclusion of an FHD+ display. The KEY2 does have an unusual aspect ratio of 3:2, which makes it great for browsing the web or running office-type apps, but not so good for watching videos/movies or playing games. There are also larger bezels on the top/bottom and both sides compared to the current smartphones which typically provide a larger display. TCL decided to use only Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Some may scoff at the BlackBerry KEY2 because it only has a Snapdragon 660 processor clocked at 2.2 GHz with an Adreno 512 GPU, but our review has shown that the KEY2 is more than capable when it comes to powering apps, including games. It does pack 6GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage, although there is also a 128GB model. It is powered by a 3,500 mAh capacity non-removable battery that uses Quick Charge 3.0 for a fast charge – if you need an even faster charge you can make use of the Boost Mode feature which turns off various services in order to allow the phone to charge more quicker. The average user should get two days of productivity before a charge is required. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2, like most flagships in 2018, uses a dual camera setup. The main camera uses a 12-megapixel sensor with dual pixels. It packs a dual PDAF for quick focusing and an aperture of f/1.8. The secondary camera is also a 12-megapixel sensor with PDAF, an aperture of f/2.6, and 2x Optical Zoom. The FFC comes in at 8-megapixel with an f/2.0 aperture and should be great for selfies and video chatting. The design of the camera and its software is powerful, yet easy to use. Private capture allows you to take a picture and have it placed immediately into your Private Locker – a special folder that adds an additional layer of security. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 will satisfy most users if they don't mind a smaller display and a physical keyboard, but it is definitely geared toward the business user or those who need a heightened level of security. It has an overall Fort Knox level of security, but also an excellent DTEK security and Privacy Shade for hiding files in folders that need authorization to access. It does use a lower SD660 processor with 6GB of RAM, and a dual camera setup. There is no notch on this small (by today’s standards) display, but you will find the option to expand the storage when needed. You do also get Google Pay and BlackBerry’s UI over Android 8.1 Oreo, with BlackBerry expected to update the KEY2 to Android 9 Pie in due course. The KEY2 has many great ways to use shortcuts throughout the phone – for instance, you can run your fingers over the keyboard to scroll up and down and the fingerprint sensor is smartly located on the space key. The device measures 151.4 x 71.8 x 8.5 mm and weighs in at 168 grams. The KEY2 comes in Black or Silver with a black rubberized backing and costs about $650 for the 64GB version. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> …And The Winner Is… </p>
<p> The Final Word </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is tough decision because both devices are terrific, but the OnePlus 6 is just more of what we expect in a newer device – large display, virtual keyboard, game/video oriented, fastest processor, the best GPU – and all while being offered up at a reasonable price. No, it doesn’t have a QHD+ resolution display or expandable storage, but it has the best processor, larger and better cameras, and lots of RAM. These are features that the average user wants in their smartphone. </p>
<p> Customers that purchase a BlackBerry device are not your average user as they tend to be most concerned about the physical keyboard and higher levels of security. The KEY2 offers both of those features in a great package for about $120 more than the OnePlus 6. </p>
<p> With both of these devices offering plenty of features, it is up to the user which features are more important to them, because they are both great devices. If you want a physical keyboard then the KEY2 would be a wise choice – and one you would not regret. If you prefer the larger display and virtual keyboard, then the OnePlus 6 is a no brainer. For this comparison, we think most users are in the latter category and therefore we have picked the OnePlus 6 as the winner. </p>

<p> Phone Comparisons: OnePlus 8T vs OnePlus 7T </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T got announced quite recently, and we’re here to compare it with its predecessor. In this article, we’ll compare the OnePlus 8T vs OnePlus 7T. These two devices do have some things in common, but for the most part, they’re quite different. They do both come with an appealing price tag, and some of you may still wonder whether the 7T is worth getting at this point. Well, that’s what we’re here to help you with. </p>
<p> As per usual, we’ll compare the two devices across a number of categories. We’ll kick things off by listing their specifications, and move from there. The designs of the two phones are not exactly too similar, while their displays are also considerably different. OnePlus upgraded the OnePlus 8T in a number of ways compared to its predecessor, and that is something you’ll realize. That being said, let’s start, let’s compare the OnePlus 8T vs OnePlus 7T. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T vs OnePlus 7T: Design </p>
<p> In terms of the design, well, OnePlus used similar materials here, but the two phones do look quite different in comparison. Both are made out of metal and glass, and both utilize Gorilla Glass 5 on both the front and the back. Both phones also include flat displays, and both are curved on the back. They are almost identically thick, but the 8T feels a bit thicker due to its design. It doesn’t feel too thick, though, not at all, it’s actually quite thin, but in comparison, it’s noticeable. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is a bit taller than the 7T, while they are almost the same in terms of width. They’re also similar in terms of weight, as they’re separated by 2 grams. The OnePlus 7T weighs 190 grams, while the 8T is at 188 grams. Bezels are extremely thin on both, though there’s a difference in the upper portion of the display. The OnePlus 7T includes a tiny waterdrop notch, while the 8T opted for a display camera hole in the top-left corner. </p>
<p> Both of them include multiple cameras on the back, though the 8T has one more than the 7T. All those cameras are packed inside a single module on both phones. The one on the 7T is centered, it’s circular, and it hosts three cameras. The OnePlus 8T’s camera module has four cameras inside it, and it offers a different shape. It’s also located in a different spot, it’s in the top-left corner. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The power / lock key is located on the right-hand side of both phones. Right above that button, you’ll notice the alert slider. The volume up and down buttons can be found on the left-hand side of both devices. Neither of these two phones has a headphone jack, by the way, but they both offer a Type-C USB port. Both are very well-built, and both feel premium in the hand. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T vs OnePlus 7T: Display </p>
<p> The OnePlus 7T and 8T both feature 6.55-inch fullHD+ displays, these two displays are not the same, though. They do offer the same resolution of 2400 x 1080, but the refresh rate is higher on the OnePlus 8T’s panel. That handset offers a 120Hz refresh rate, while the 7T ships with 90Hz. So, the refresh rate on the 8T is not exactly twice as high, but it is higher. The content on the OnePlus 8T seems a bit smoother as a result in case you really look for it. You’ll notice that in specific conditions, like when scrolling, for example. The OnePlus 7T is an extremely fluid device, though, and the difference betwee 90Hz and 120Hz panels is not that big, so some of you my not even notice a difference. If you're coming from a 60Hz panel, you will, for sure, notice that boost (either to 90Hz or 120Hz). </p>
<p> Both of these are Fluid AMOLED panels, and both support HDR10+ output. In terms of image representation, they’re both excellent. They offer saturated images, the colors are vivid, and viewing angles are great as well. Blue light emission is also quite low on both panels, in comparison to some other displays in the market. Gorilla Glass 5 protects both of these displays, by the way, and these are flat panels. There’s really nothing major to complain about when it comes to these displays, though the OnePlus 8T is technically a better choice, though you’ll be just fine with the 7T panel as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T vs OnePlus 7T: Performance </p>
<p> In terms of performance, both of these phones are excellent. The OnePlus 7T is still running blazing fast, a year after its arrival. The OnePlus 8T does feel even smoother, which is not surprising considering it has more powerful specs, and that smooth display. You’ll be fine with either phone in terms of performance, though. They can both open apps really fast, and the same goes for games, even though the OnePlus 8T is a bit faster. They are really smooth during multitasking, browsing, content consumption… basically everything. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T includes the Snapdragon 865, along with 8GB / 12GB of RAM, while the 7T includes 8GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 855+. OnePlus’ software only helps with performance, as it’s well-optimized on both devices. If you’re looking for the better one in the performance section, the 8T is a phone for you, but the difference is really not that big. The vast majority of you would not care about that difference, so if you’re looking to save a bit of cash, you’ll be perfectly fine with the 7T. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T vs OnePlus 7T: Battery </p>
<p> In the battery department, both are well-equipped, but the OnePlus 8T offers more. The OnePlus 8T comes with a considerably larger 4,500mAh battery pack, compared to a 3,800mAh unit in the 7T. Truth be said, the OnePlus 8T does have a much higher refresh rate, but still, the difference is noticeable. I was able to get well over 8 hours of screen on time on the OnePlus 8T on occasion. The 7T is no slouch either, you should be able to get over 6 hours of screen-on-time without a problem. That will, however, be dependent on your usage. If you do game a lot, or use the phone for other processor-intensive tasks, the battery will deplete quicker. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both phones do support fast charging, though neither supports wireless charging. The OnePlus 7T offers 30W fast wired charging, while the 8T sports 65W fast wired charging. The charging on the OnePlus 8T is considerably faster, needless to say. You can get all the way up to 58-percent in only 15 minutes of charging, which is crazy. So, if you really need such fast charging, the 8T is the way to go, even though charging on the OnePlus 7T is not slow by any means. It is also worth noting that neither phone supports reverse charging, wired or wireless. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T vs OnePlus 7T: Cameras </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T comes with four rear cameras, while the 7T has three. Both phones include a single camera on the front. These two devices actually have the same main camera sensor, though with a different lens. OnePlus utilized Sony’s IMX586 sensor on both devices. The OnePlus 7T also includes a telephoto and an ultrawide camera. The OnePlus 8T has an ultra-wide camera as well, in addition to a macro camera, and a monochrome unit. Images taken with the main camera do look better on the OnePlus 8T. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It seems like OnePlus improved the software on the device, as the images do look a bit sharper, while the softness on the edges is also not a much of a problem as it used to be. The colors are also slightly better. Not to say that the OnePlus 7T is bad in that regard, at all. The phone’s camera performance has also improved quite a bit since launch. Once the phone gets Android 11, it will improve even further, at least that’s what we’re expecting. It may even be really close to the performance of the OnePlus 8T, at least as far as the main sensor is concerned. </p>
<p> Both ultra-wide cameras are good, but they’re not the best we’ve seen, not even close. The OnePlus 8T is better when it comes to close-up shots, while both phones are really good in low light. The company’s Nightscape mode does help in extremely low-lit environments as well. </p>
<p> Audio </p>
<p> Now, when it comes to audio, neither phone is extraordinary, but they’re both really, really good. Both include stereo speakers, and those speakers are actually really compelling. They do offer a full sound, while distortion isn’t noticeable until you turn the volume all the way up. Even then, it’s quite minimal. The sound is good across the spectrum, and the same goes for a sound through a good pair of headphones. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The bass could be a bit stronger, but that’s just nitpicking. The most important part is, the vocals do not get overpowered by the instruments in any way, shape or form. OnePlus did a good job balancing things out. Neither of these two phones comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack. So, you’ll have to either use a Type-C port, a dongle, or utilize wireless headphones in order to listen to music, podcasts, or make phone calls via headphones on these two phones. </p>

<p> Phone Comparisons: OnePlus 8T vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T got announced recently, and one of Samsung’s phones is one of its main competitors. We’re, of course, talking about the Galaxy S20 FE. In this article, we’ll compare the OnePlus 8T vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE. These two phones are both flagship-grade phones that are well below the $1,000 price tag. Both of them feature premium specifications, and both will be quite appealing to consumers for a number of reasons, with their price tag being one of the main reasons. </p>
<p> Both of these phones come with the flagship SoC from Qualcomm, both of them feature OLED displays with 120Hz refresh rate, extremely thin bezels, and so on. If you’re unwilling to break the bank for a new phone, and you really want flagship-grade performance, you should definitely consider one of these two devices. That being said, in this article, we’ll compare them in a number of ways. First, we’ll list their specifications, and then move to the design, display, performance, battery, camera, and audio categories. With that out of the way, let’s kick off the OnePlus 8T vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE comparison. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE: Design </p>
<p> When it comes to the design, these two phones do look somewhat similar. Both of them offer thin bezels, flat displays, and a similar shape. Their rear cameras are also placed in the same spot, basically. There are quite a few differences here, starting with the build materials. The Galaxy S20 FE features a plastic back, combined with an aluminum frame. The OnePlus 8T, on the other hand, comes with an aluminum frame as well, which is combined with a glass back. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T is slightly lighter than the Galaxy S20, at 188 grams, compared to 190. The two devices are almost equally tall and wide, while they’re exactly the same in terms of thickness. So, even in the size department, these are direct competitors. The OnePlus 8T includes a display camera hole in the top-left corner, while the Galaxy S20 FE’s is centered. Rear camera modules are placed in the top-left corner on both phones. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T includes four cameras inside its rear camera module, while the Galaxy S20 FE sports three. Both phones include a single camera on the front. Both of them feature curved backs, while the OnePlus 8T’s does feel more premium due to the glass black. Company brandings are placed on the back of each phone. Both devices are quite slippery, so keep that in mind, as you’ll probably want to use a case. These two devices are also not small by any means, but they’re not exactly the largest phones out there either. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE: Display </p>
<p> When it comes to the display category, both of these phones have plenty to offer. Both devices come with fullHD+ displays (6.55 and 6.5-inch, respectively), and those displays are even the same in terms of resolution / aspect ratio. We’re looking at 2400 x 1080 panels here. Both devices feature AMOLED displays, with a 120Hz refresh rate. Both of those panels are flat, and both support HDR10+ output. Gorilla Glass protects both displays as well. Even the screen-to-body ratio is almost identical on these two phones. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So, are the two displays any good in general? Well, yes, definitely. These two AMOLED panels are amongst the best fullHD+ displays we’ve seen, that’s for sure. The colors are vivid, viewing angles are great, and blacks are deep, as they should be. In fact, looking at these two displays side-by-side, we really can’t make up our mind which one is better. Even if you compare them to some great QHD+ displays out there, chances are you won’t be able to see the difference. These fullHD+ displays are that good. You can’t go wrong with either of them. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE: Performance </p>
<p> The performance aspect is also great on both devices. These two phones are immensely powerful, needless to say. Both are fueled by the Snapdragon 865 SoC, which is Qualcomm’s flagship processor. Both devices ship with fast flash storage, and the OnePlus 8T and Galaxy S20 FE include 8GB and 6GB of RAM respectively. All in all, their hardware components are great, and in combination with really good software, you’ll get great performance here. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T includes Android 11 out of the box, while Android 10 comes pre-installed on the Galaxy S20 FE. Both OxygenOS and One UI are mature Android skins, which are highly-optimized. That, in combination with the hardware, results in a really great performance. Both phones are buttery smooth, and can handle anything you throw at them, really. They can both go head-to-head with the most powerful smartphones in the market, as they are amongst the most powerful handsets out there. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T may feel a bit smoother, but that’s mostly due to slightly different animations. Both smartphones are immensely fast, no matter if you’re gaming, multitasking, opening, and closing apps, consuming media… it really doesn’t matter. Chances are that these two devices will remain fresh in the performance department for quite some time, which is yet another reason for you to consider getting one. Do note that even though 6GB of RAM on the Galaxy S20 FE wasn’t an issue during our usage, it may become one in the future. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE: Battery </p>
<p> Both of these phones feature a 4,500mAh battery pack, while having the same processor, and quite similar displays. They should offer the same battery longevity as well, right? Well, no, not really. We’ve had considerably better results with the OnePlus 8T, to be quite honest. The Galaxy S20 FE didn’t really get much further than 5 and a half hours of scree-on-time during our usage, before dying. The OnePlus 8T, on the other hand, was able to constantly cross the 7 and a half-hour mark, even 8 hours on several occasions. </p>
<p> We’re not sure why is that, but it probably has something to do with the software. Not only is the OnePlus 8T running Android 11, but OxygenOS is probably better optimized and lighter than One UI. We’re only guessing, of course, but the difference is considerable. So, if you’re a power user, and plan to use your phone a lot during the day, the OnePlus 8T will probably provide you more longevity in the battery department. Your mileage may vary, of course. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, if wireless charging is something you’re interested in, the Galaxy S20 FE is your only option. The device supports 15W wireless charging, while the OnePlus 8T doesn’t support it at all. The OnePlus 8T does offer faster charging in general, though. It offers 65W fast wired charging, compared to 25W on the Galaxy S20 FE. Do note that you’re getting a 15W charger in the Galaxy S20 FE box, though, so you’ll need to spend extra to get a 25W one. The OnePlus 8T already ships with a 65W charging brick. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8T vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE: Cameras </p>
<p> As far as camera performance goes, both are really good, but are not the best out there. Not many people will complain about cameras on either phone, though. Both devices can provide great-looking shots during the day, no matter the lighting, really. The images turn out sharp, with good white balance, and dynamic range. The Galaxy S20 FE tends to provide more saturated images, which are a bit heavier on the processing side. The shots from the OnePlus 8T also tend to be a bit heavy on the processing, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing, as both manage to do a great job. </p>
<p> When the light goes away, they’re quite capable as well. Both come with dedicated camera modes for low light photography. Those modes can do a really good job of lighting up the scene. Even in auto mode, though, these two phones do an excellent job in low lighting. They’re not at the level of Google’s new Pixel phones in that regard, but they’re really good none the less. The video side of things is not a problem either, while front-facing cameras are good, but nothing special. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Audio </p>
<p> When it comes to audio, well, these two phones are nothing to scoff at either. They come with stereo speakers, which do offer really full, and compelling sound. The speakers on the Galaxy S20 FE have been tuned by AKG, by the way. Both sets of speakers also get quite loud, and the distortion is barely noticeable at the very highest of volumes. The sound output is well balanced, and the speakers are not tinny at all. </p>
<p> If you hook up a good pair of headphones, whether be it through a wire or wirelessly, you’ll be pleasantly surprised. The sound is good across the spectrum, even though both devices could provide a bit more bass. Vocals are clear at all times, and do not get overpowered by anything. A 3.5mm headphone jack is not present on either phone, so you’ll have to use a Type-C port or Bluetooth. </p>

<p> Phone Comparisons: Samsung Galaxy S9 vs BlackBerry KEY2 </p>
<p> Do we have a good one for you today – the Samsung Galaxy S9 takes on the BlackBerry KEY2. Among other things, these are two smartphones separated by a virtual keyboard on the Galaxy S9 and a physical keyboard on the KEY2. The Galaxy S9 claims some security features, but certainly does not compare to the KEY2 which is built around top-level security. The Galaxy S9 is more for the everyday user with a large display for watching videos and playing games, while the KEY2 is designed for the user that likes a physical keyboard and a more business-like device. The Galaxy S9 has a faster processor and more advanced GPU, but neither is technically slow when it comes to performance. Let's see what else these two devices have in common before we look at each one in more detail. </p>
<p> Obviously, these two devices are very different from each other. The Galaxy S9 has a larger display, a higher resolution, a different aspect ratio, and is even protected by a different Gorilla Glass version. They both use a Snapdragon processor and an Adreno GPU, but different models. They both have the same base storage (64GB) and both are expandable, although the amount of RAM differs. They both use an 8-megapixel sensor for their front-facing camera (FFC), and both rear main cameras are of the same 12-megapixel variety although the KEY2 is equipped with two rear cameras. Even though their displays differ in size, the physical keyboard adds enough space that the two devices are relatively comparable in physical size and weight. The Galaxy S9 and KEY2 both support Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v5.0, NFC, and a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer. Both support Google Pay, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a fingerprint sensor, and both run Android 8.0 (Oreo). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Please take a careful look at the detailed specifications comparison chart below and here you will see just how these two Android smartphones stack up against each other. Which one is the better purchase by offering the most technology for the least amount of money? Are you looking for a powerful phone or one with more security? These are the type of questions we will attempt to answer in picking the winner of this comparison. </p>
<p> Specifications </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S9 </p>
<p> Samsung puts out many different phones during a given year, but the Galaxy S9, S9 Plus, and Note series are the company's flagship phones. The Galaxy S9 is the basic flagship option as it's missing some of the bells and whistles found on the Galaxy S9 Plus. For instance, it has a smaller display, less RAM, and only a single rear camera, but other than those items, it's relatively equal to the Galaxy S9 Plus. As you'll find the same processor/GPU, Hi-Res audio with stereo speakers, the Super Dual Pixels in the same 12-megapixel camera, with the new Adaptive Aperture. It also packs Intelligent Scan – iris and facial recognition working together – for more accurate and faster authentication. </p>
<p> Not many people will argue that Samsung makes the best display on the market and the Galaxy S9 boasts a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED Infinity Display with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio making it great to watch media or play games on. It has a QHD+ resolution of 2960 x 1440 pixels and 570 pixels-per-inch (PPI) for eye-popping images. It incorporates the Always-On feature that helps save battery life as well as making it easier to glance at notifications to determine if they should be read. This entire phone uses Gorilla Glass 5 for protection. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung uses two different processors in its Galaxy S9 depending on where purchased. For example, the US model uses the newest Qualcomm SoC, the Snapdragon 845 along with an Adreno 630 GPU. The SD845 is an octa-core processor clocked at 2.7 GHz and the Adreno 630 will handle any graphic you toss at it. The Galaxy S9 sold in some other regions uses Samsung’s own Exynos 9810 octa-core processor clocked at 2.7 GHz along with a Mali-G72-MP18 GPU. Both processors are equally capable of running the Galaxy S9 without issue. The S9 is packing 4GB of RAM and a base of 64GB of expandable internal storage, although 128GB and 256GB models are offered, depending on location and carrier. </p>
<p> When it comes to new features on the Galaxy S9, one of the most exciting is in the camera department – the new Adaptive Aperture. Which can adjust the aperture from a large f/1.5 for pictures taken in low-light conditions, all the way to a small f/2.4 for pictures taken in brighter lighting. The camera uses 12-megapixel Super Dual Pixels, as well as Phase Detection AutoFocus (PDAF), OIS, 8x Digital Zoom, and an LED flash. The FFC is an 8-megapixel unit with an aperture of f/1.7, auto-HDR, and has its own autofocus. A 3,000 mAh capacity battery powers the Galaxy S9 and should last a full day for most average users. The Galaxy S9 also comes with Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging and quick wireless charging for both Qi and PMA formats. </p>
<p> Samsung always adds a lot of features (some might say, bloatware) to its flagships, and while some are very useful, others are not. For example, Samsung Pay is a great feature that allows you to make purchases almost anywhere that accepts credit cards. Intelligent Scan is a new feature that adds more security for unlocking your phone by combining iris scan and facial recognition. Then there is Bixby, Samsung’s answer to Apple’s Siri and Google’s Assistant. The phone is IP68 certified against dust and water, has a heart rate monitor, SpO2 sensor, and a new blood pressure monitor, although one of the best new features is the great sounding stereo speakers. The Galaxy S9 also features a new AR Emoji feature, which is although is a great idea, it needs more work if it is to compete with Apple’s version. Samsung also improved its DeX support which lets the user turn the phone into a desktop computer by using a simple dongle. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy S9 is available in Midnight Black, Coral Blue, Titanium Gray, Lilac Purple, Burgundy Red, and Sunset Gold depending on location and carrier, and comes with Android 8.0 (Oreo) out of the box. The device measures 147.6 x 68.7 x 8.4 mm and weighs in at 163 grams. It is retailing from $750 to $800, but there are usually quite a few promotions available. </p>
<p> BlackBerry KEY2 </p>
<p> TCL Corporation now designs and builds most BlackBerry Mobile phones, including the BlackBerry KEY2, and it looks like the company did an excellent job in that department. As this is a device that stands out from the crowded smartphone market, due to the inclusion of a smaller than usual display and a large physical keyboard. It's totally retro looking, yet at the same time one of the more attractive devices on the market. It sports a metal design that wraps smoothly around a 4.5-inch display with the physical keyboard positioned directly below. The keyboard is 20-percent larger than the one on the KEYOne with this design change employed to make it easier to use. The rubberized backing not only lends towards its good looks, but also improves the grip as well. The KEY2 comes with as many security features that BlackBerry could squeeze into a smartphone, and certainly more than you will find on any other smartphone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While it has retro/business look to it, that look is very pleasant with the display, keyboard, metal casing, and rubberized backing all adding to its sharp look. The display is 4.5-inches and uses an odd 3:2 aspect ratio, which works fine for business applications or scrolling a website, but not so well for media or gaming. It uses an IPS LCD FHD+ display with a resolution of 1620 x 1090 pixels and 434 PPI. TCL uses the older Gorilla Glass 3 standard to protect the display. </p>
<p> Some users may think that the BlackBerry KEY2 should not be compared to the Galaxy S9 because the KEY2 only has a Snapdragon 660 octa-core processor clocked at 2.2 GHz and an Adreno 512 GPU. On paper, this would be a reasonable assumption, however, both processors are more than capable of providing a fast and smooth user experience with no lag. The KEY2 packs 6GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage, although there is also a 128GB storage model available as well. A non-removable 3,000 mAh capacity battery powers the KEY2 – which is arguably quite a lot for a 4.5-inch LCD display and a SD660 processor. The KEY2 uses Quick Charge 3.0 for a fast charge, and users can activate a Boost Mode which turns off certain functions of the device for even faster charging. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 includes a dual camera setup with 12-megapixel sensors. The main camera packs a dual PDAF for quick focusing with an aperture of f/1.8. The secondary camera also has PDAF, an aperture of f/2.6 and 2x Optical Zoom. It uses the same sized 8-megapixel sensor as the Galaxy S9, but with an aperture of f/2.0, and none of the other features. Private capture is a great feature that saves photos directly to a Private Locker – a special folder with added security. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 is designed for those that want a physical keyboard and are okay with using a smaller display, as well as people who are interested in advanced security features such as the company's excellent DTEK security and Privacy Shade. Thanks to the inclusion of NFC, the phone does support mobile payment solutions including Google Pay, and BlackBerry’s UI runs over Android 8.1 (Oreo), and it's expected to receive an update to Android 9 Pie in due course. The fingerprint sensor is smartly mounted on the space bar on the physical keyboard, but that is only one of many shortcuts this keyboard has to offer – for instance, you can slide your fingers over the keyboard to scroll up or down on the display. The device measures 151.4 x 71.8 x 8.5 mm and weighs in at 168 grams. The KEY2 comes in Black or Silver with a black rubberized backing and costs around $650 for the 64GB version. </p>
<p> …The Winner Is… </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Final Word </p>
<p> This win could go either way, depending on the needs of an individual. Here, we chose the more expensive (by $150) Galaxy S9 because it's offers more of a mainstream appeal compared to the BlackBerry KEY2. Both devices are well-built, with the Galaxy S9 looking more modern, although the KEY2 does offer that certain business/retro look that is really cool. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S9 has the larger display with the ratio users want for media entertainment and multitasking. The Galaxy S9 also has the bezel-less display and and a higher resolution. It has a good camera, IP68 certification, Samsung Pay, and many options for health-conscious users. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 provides its users with an excellent physical keyboard and the best security you will find on a smartphone, but is not the most technologically advanced smartphone when it comes to the display and processor. However, if you long for a physical keyboard, and like a smaller display, the KEY2 will not let you down. </p>

<p> Pocket Casts Now Lets You Filter Episodes By Duration </p>
<p> Pocket Casts is finally adding the ability to filter episodes by duration. The v7.11 of the app adds this much-needed feature, although it comes a little bit late. A new Duration bubble in the Filters tab lets you filter episodes by specific length you choose. The new menu is available in the top row below every filter you create, along with all other existing options. </p>
<p> You can set both the minimum and maximum length limit for each filter, in five-minute increments. This allows you to select from episodes that best fit your listening session. If you have about 30 minutes during your commute, you can set the app to only show episodes that aren't lengthier than your available time. This way, you won't have to pause an episode midway and listen again later. </p>
<p> Pocket Casts already lets you sort episodes by their duration. You can select between shortest to longest and longest to shortest. The new Duration filter now ensures that you'll only see episodes that you may consider listening to at any given time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pocket Casts adds duration filter, more new features on the way </p>
<p> In addition to the duration filter, which is now live for all users with v7.11 of the app, Pocket Casts also have several new features in the pipeline. The v7.12 of the app, which is currently available in beta from the Google Play Store, adds new episode multi-select options. </p>
<p> You can un-star your starred episodes, remove episodes from the archive, delete multiple downloaded episodes at once, and mark played episodes as unplayed. Essentially, Pocket Casts is making all these actions two-way. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additionally, the app now also lets you customize the toolbar. The option to customize the toolbar is available through the overflow menu that appears after you long-press on an episode. The pencil icon lets you rearrange or select/deselect actions that appear on the toolbar, so your most-used ones are always easily accessible. Those actions include download/remove downloads, star/un-star, archive/un-archive, mark as played/un-played, select all/deselect all, and play first and play last. </p>
<p> The upcoming version of Pocket Casts will also introduce the ability to filter episodes by duration as low as one minute. The current minimum duration is five minutes. The new version will also offer better integration with Android 11's media notifications. Pocket Casts also promises improved rearranging of "Up next" items. </p>
<p> You can sign up for Pocket Casts v7.12 beta here. The latest stable version, v7.11, is now available on the Play Store for all users. </p>

<p> Possible BlackBerry KEY2 Android Mid-Ranger Approved By FCC </p>
<p> A TCL Communication-made device identified by the model number BBF100-2 that's widely believed to be the upcoming BlackBerry KEY2 has been certified by the United States Federal Communications Commission late last week, with the regulator publishing its commercial approval on Friday. While the Chinese tech giant asked for a standard six-month confidentiality period from the federal agency in regards to publicizing detailed images of the device itself, it likely won't need more than several weeks of cooperation from the FCC, with the company already confirming the BlackBerry KEY2 will be officially announced in early June at an event hosted in New York City. </p>
<p> The upcoming handset is likely to become available for purchase by mid-summer following its June 7 announcement, with recent reports pointing to a largely universal upgrade over last year's KEYone. TCL is understood to have equipped its next BlackBerry-branded product with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 660, 6GB of RAM, and 64GB of flash memory expandable via a microSD card slot by up to 2TB. A 4.5-inch screen is still said to be part of the package, featuring a blocky 3:2 aspect ratio, as was the case with the KEYone. The BBF100-2 certified by the FCC appears to be a GSM variant of the handset and is likely to be sold unlocked, much like its predecessor did last year. A 3.5mm headphone jack is also expected to be on offer, together with a USB Type-C 3.0 port and a custom implementation of Android 8.0 Oreo enhanced with BlackBerry's mobile security software. </p>
<p> A device bearing the same model number has previously been certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance and China's telecom regulator TENAA, as well as the Bluetooth Special Interest Group. Besides the KEY2, another one of the Canadian company's partner manufacturers — Optiemus Infracom — is expected to introduce a BlackBerry-branded handset in the coming weeks, with recent reports pointing to a mobile offering called the BlackBerry Ghost Pro being on course to India. Unlike the KEY2, the Ghost Pro isn't expected to feature a physical QWERTY/QWERTZ keyboard and should instead adopt the traditional candy bar form factor. </p>

<p> You Can Pre-Order The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 </p>
<p> If you're looking to pre-order the Samsung Galaxy tab S7, you won't have a long wait to get your hands on it. </p>
<p> Samsung officially announced the Galaxy Tab S7 during its first Unpacked event back on August 5. At the time, it noted that details on availability would be forthcoming. </p>
<p> Those details were shared as part of Samsung's second Unpacked event this week. Samsung also unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold 2 and started pre-orders for that device on September 1. So if you're considering buying both devices, you may want to think about pre-ordering everything at the same time as it would make the transaction easier. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can pre-order the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 from today </p>
<p> Pre-ordering the Galaxy Tab S7 is now available as the page went live earlier this morning. Though it will still be a couple of weeks before you can actually buy and get a hold of it the same day. </p>
<p> To purchase it out of pre-order status, customers will need to wait until September 18 where at that time it should also be available in stores at Samsung's retail partners. </p>
<p> If you want to get a jump start though, today is your day. Samsung is making pre-orders available for the Galaxy Tab S7, and The Galaxy Tab S7+ in Wi-Fi and 5G models. Prices will start at $649 for the 11-inch Galaxy Tab S7 and go up from there depending on the configuration you choose. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the Galaxy Tab S7+, prices start at $849 as it has the bigger 12.4-inch display. </p>
<p> If you pre-order the tablet you get a nice little perk </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 is no doubt going to be a useful device but it's more useful with the keyboard attachment. </p>
<p> And if you pre-order the tablet Samsung is giving you a nice little perk. A savings on the keyboard. Anyone that pre-orders the device before it launches on September 18 will get 50-percent off the cost of the keyboard. And since neither the tablet or the keyboard are relatively cheap, any savings is good savings. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung is no stranger to giving out rewards to customers who pre-order its devices. So this practice is nothing new here. Still, even though it's not surprising, it's still always nice to see that you can save a little money on new tech. </p>

<p> Prime Day vs Black Friday: When Should You Do Your Holiday Shopping? </p>
<p> Every year we wonder whether we should shop on Prime Day vs Black Friday, and which will offer the best deals. Well this year, the question is even more important, as Prime Day has been pushed back to mid-October, about five to six weeks ahead of Black Friday (and Cyber Monday). </p>
<p> So which shopping holiday should you spend your money during? </p>
<p> When is Prime Day? </p>
<p> Prime Day is happening on October 13 and 14 this year. That's nearly three months later than it normally occurs. It's once again a 48-hour event, where Amazon is discounting thousands (if not millions) of items on its site, for Prime members. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We have even started seeing deals for Prime Day ahead of Prime Day, which you can see here. </p>
<p> When is Black Friday? </p>
<p> Black Friday is always the Friday after Thanksgiving. And this year, that happens to fall on November 27. </p>
<p> Typically, we see Black Friday deals come out as soon as a week before Black Friday. However, this year, it's going to be a bit different, as it is likely going to be entirely online. In previous years, Black Friday has offered better deals in-store. But with social distancing and the global pandemic, a lot of stores have already announced that they will be closed on Thanksgiving and on Black Friday. That's probably better for everyone involved – customers and employees – as Black Friday can be very hectic. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Black Friday is technically just one day, but it usually lasts through the following Monday, which is called Cyber Monday. Cyber Monday typically has leftover deals from Black Friday, and a small number of new ones available too. </p>
<p> What deals can we expect on Prime Day? </p>
<p> Companies as well as Amazon, have already started to announce their Prime Day deals for October 13-14. So here's what you can expect for deals on Prime Day. </p>
<p> We will see some steep discounts on robot vacuums, Instant Pots, smartphones, tablets, TVs, and more. If you're looking to get some of Amazon's newer hardware that it announced last month, you can likely save big on those new products during Prime Day as well. Including the new Fire TV Stick Lite, which was already pretty cheap. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon isn't the only retailer discounting products on Prime Day either. Other retailers like Target, Walmart and Best Buy have already announced that they will be discounting a number of items during Prime Day, under their own sale name. Amazon does also do price matching, so you can likely get even more deals from Amazon on Prime Day thanks to that. </p>
<p> Do I have to be a Prime member to take advantage of Prime Day? </p>
<p> Yes and no. To take advantage of the majority of deals on Prime Day, you will need to be an Amazon Prime member. And you can sign up for a free 30-day trial by clicking here. </p>
<p> But, not all deals available on Prime Day will be for Prime only. For example, we know of a handful of deals already that will be available to any Amazon customer – Prime or not. But you will also get the slower shipping times. So if you are buying anything that you want to receive in a decent amount of time, you'll want to sign up for Prime. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There is a 30-day trial for everyone, and six months if you're a student. Otherwise, it'll cost you $12.99 per month of $119 for the whole year. </p>
<p> Are there still delays on shipping from Amazon? </p>
<p> For the most part, Amazon has fixed their shipping delays that we saw earlier this year when the pandemic first hit. Most items are shipping within a day of your order. </p>
<p> What we are really seeing a lot of from Amazon though, is under-promising and over-delivering on products. For instance, it'll say that this particular product will arrive on Friday, but it might actually arrive a day or two early. Lately, none of my orders have come on the day Amazon stated. They usually come a day (sometimes two days) before. Which is a good way to do customer service. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now there are still some products that are back-ordered. Things like webcams, laptops, desktops, monitors, and such, that people are buying for their home office. But for the most part, everything is shipping right away. That could change in the days after Prime Day though. </p>
<p> What deals can we expect on Black Friday? </p>
<p> Hardly any retailers have released Black Friday circulars yet, but that will change pretty soon. So we don't really know any specific deals to expect for Black Friday, yet. </p>
<p> But we are expecting to see some of the last sales and discounts on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One series consoles. As the new models are launching just ahead of Black Friday – but will be sold out for months anyways. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Typically, Black Friday is the second best time of the year to get a new TV – the other being around the Super Bowl in February. So if you are looking to grab a new TV for your home, then Black Friday is likely the better time to grab one (vs Prime Day). </p>
<p> Tech in general, is discounted pretty heavily on Black Friday. But you'll also see sales on streaming services and other services that can save you a good chunk of cash. For example, last year, Disney+ was on sale for $59.99 ($10 off of its annual yearly rate) for a year. And with the streaming wars heating up right now, you can expect plenty of other services adding discounts, to get new subscribers. </p>
<p> Outside of tech, you'll also find deals on kitchen appliances big and small. As well as clothing, pet supplies and much more. It's going to be tougher to find something not on sale for Black Friday than something that is. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But typically, tech is discounted the heaviest on Black Friday. With TVs leading the way. </p>
<p> Will there be in-store shopping on Black Friday this year? </p>
<p> We've already heard from a handful of retailers that they will be closed on Thanksgiving and likely on Black Friday too. Which means that there is even less reason to shop in-store this year on Black Friday. This is great news for employees as they can stay at home with their families. And it makes it easier to find deals, as you can just visit their site, instead of camping out overnight. </p>
<p> We'd expect to see many more retailers close their doors on Thanksgiving and Black Friday this year. Especially since the pandemic is showing no signs of slowing down. Social Distancing would be pretty much impossible to do on Black Friday, especially when doors open. Never mind those that refuse to wear masks. </p>
<p> This year, you will likely be able to get the same deals online as you would in-store. So stay home, grab a cup of coffee and start shopping on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Deals will likely still start that Wednesday before Thanksgiving though. </p>
<p> Will deals be better this year, due to the pandemic? </p>
<p> Deals are likely to be even better this year, due to the pandemic. Now that might sound odd, since stores have been struggling to keep stuff in stock – especially toilet paper, webcams, laptops, etc. </p>
<p> But where a lot of the brick and mortar stores have been closed for around six months now, or open a limited capacity, they haven't been making much money. Which means they are going to discount products even more than usual, to sell more. Which drives in more money. This is going to be especially true for stores like Best Buy and Micro Center. Who don't also sell groceries – like Walmart and Target – as those stores are likely fine. </p>
<p> In addition to these stores being closed for large parts of the year, many consumers don't have a lot of money to spend. Over 60 million people were unemployed for a large portion of the year. Which means they aren't going to be buying a bunch of stuff they don't need. So retailers need to lower prices to levels that will make them buy. </p>
<p> While we don't know for sure, we could end up seeing some pretty incredible deals for Black Friday and throughout the holiday season this year. </p>
<p> What about Cyber Monday? </p>
<p> Traditionally, Black Friday has been the holiday where you shop in-store and Cyber Monday was all online. This was mostly because most people have that Friday off, but are back to work on that Monday. Though in recent years, both holidays have been mostly online. And there hasn't been much to differentiate the two. </p>
<p> We've noticed in the past five years that Cyber Monday is basically leftover deals from Black Friday. There are some new deals for Cyber Monday only, but for the most part, they are deals that lasted all weekend through til Cyber Monday. </p>
<p> You may see a handful of new deals on Cyber Monday that might be better than Black Friday, but as a whole, you won't see a lot of great deals on Cyber Monday. Which is rather unfortunate. </p>
<p> After Cyber Monday, you'll see retailers move to their more traditional holiday shopping deals. Where you may occasionally see something discounted at 50%, but it'll mostly be between 20 and 30%. </p>
<p> This year, you'll have a bit more time between Black Friday/Cyber Monday and Christmas though, with 29 shopping days between Black Friday and Christmas. But the longer you wait, the worse the deals will be. The early bird gets the worm when it comes to holiday shopping deals. </p>
<p> Should I shop on Prime Day or wait for Black Friday? </p>
<p> It's really hard to say which shopping holiday is the better one for you to shop. Black Friday typically has more deals at more retailers, but Prime Day has faster shipping (before the rush of holiday shopping), so you can get your items sooner. </p>
<p> The best piece of advice we have, is to make a list. Make a list of what you want and/or need to buy during these holidays. That includes making a list of what you're buying everyone for Christmas (and other holidays) this year. It doesn't hurt to start your holiday shopping early, especially since you likely won't see most of the people on your list this year, due to the pandemic. </p>
<p> Use your list during Prime Day and make your purchases. Unfortunately we can't say that while a TV might look like a really good deal on Prime Day, it won't be discounted further on Black Friday. So you kind of have to take your chances there. But, remember that Amazon does offer a 30-day return window. So if a Black Friday sale is announced, with a lower price than what you paid, you can return it. Unfortunately, the 30 days would be up before Black Friday comes around. </p>
<p> If you're a Prime Member, you may want to do your holiday shopping on a mixture of these two holidays. </p>

<p> The PS Remote Play Android App Already Supports The PS5 </p>
<p> Sony is thinking ahead, because the PS Remote Play app for Android already supports the PS5. You can't remotely play games from the PS5 yet of course because the system releases November 12. </p>
<p> However, Sony is prepared to let you play your PS5 games from your Android device day one of launch using the Remote Play app. </p>
<p> That's not to say that users will want to. For those that are getting a PS5 on day one, chances are you're looking to play it in the best way possible. And that's going to be on the biggest TV or monitor you have in the home. That being said, having the ability to use Remote Play from the start affords a specific opportunity. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The chance to move gameplay to your phone in the event that you have to share the TV. Ensuring you don't miss a beat. </p>
<p> Remote Play on the PS5 requires the latest system software </p>
<p> If you're familiar with Remote Play then you probably already know. But using it to remotely access your console and thereby, your games, requires you to have the latest software. </p>
<p> Not just for the Android app. Which was updated within the last 24 hours it seems. But also the latest system software on your console. Since the PS5 is going to be fresh out of the box for everyone next month, then they should automatically have the newest software. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But don't rule out the possibility that Sony may push a software update to the console on day one. </p>
<p> Sony only lists two verified devices </p>
<p> There's a pretty decent chance this will work on numerous types of Android phones. However, Sony officially lists just two devices that are verified to work with this. </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 3 series and the Google Pixel 4 series. And this likely includes the Pixel 3a and Pixel 4a. If it isn't one of these phones, then it would seem that Sony isn't guaranteeing that it will work. Meaning it isn't guaranteeing that you can remotely play games on the PS5 using a device that isn't those listed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Not guaranteeing the ability to work correctly is not the same as not working at all though. So even if you don't own a Pixel 3 or Pixel 4 but are getting a PS5, you should still try to use Remote Play if you feel like using it. The update for Remote Play should already be available to install on your Android device since it seems Sony pushed the update out to the app earlier this week. </p>

<p> Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus To Power The ASUS ROG Phone III </p>
<p> The successor to the popular ROG Phone II gaming smartphone that released last year may or may not be the first phone to come with this mobile platform. It certainly won't be the only phone though. </p>
<p> Similar to the Snapdragon 855 Plus, other gaming smartphones in 2020 will also likely use the upcoming mobile platform from Qualcomm. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These are also going to be fairly similar to the Snapdragon 865 which you can find in phones like the Galaxy S20 family. The difference is that they will have gaming-centric features. </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 865 Plus makes the most sense for the ROG Phone III </p>
<p> ASUS may choose to use another processor inside of its upcoming phone. However it would make the most sense to use the Snapdragon 865 Plus. </p>
<p> The Plus model will no doubt be the more gaming-focused platform. And if ASUS wants to keep up with other gaming phone brands that it will be competing against, it'll need to use this in particular. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company has not however confirmed what the components inside of the phone will be. So there is always a chance it could use the normal Snapdragon 865. </p>
<p> ASUS is expected to release the ROG Phone III in Q3 </p>
<p> It's rumored that ASUS might end up releasing the ROG Phone III in the third quarter of this year. </p>
<p> This is around the same time that Qualcomm is expected to launch the Snapdragon 865 Plus. If the timing is accurate for both product launches then it would match up for ASUS to use the mobile platform in the upcoming device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So far ASUS hasn't mentioned anything about the hardware in the upcoming device. In fact it hasn't event confirmed the device will be launched. The existence of the device has been confirmed by Qualcomm though. </p>
<p> So the ROG Phone III is coming. It will also use a Snapdragon 865 5G mobile platform of some kind. As this was also confirmed by Qualcomm a couple of weeks ago. Whether or not it will be the standard or the Plus model is unclear. </p>
<p> Whatever the other specs are, they will be at least as powerful as the components in the currently available device. Which means consumers can probably look forward to a display of similar size, as well as the same amount of RAM and storage, and the same battery capacity. </p>

<p> Razer Officially Releases Kernel Source For The Razer Phone </p>
<p> Razer has officially released the kernel source code for the Razer Phone earlier today which means that any developers who have been hoping to get their hands on this data will now be able to begin work (or perhaps further their work) on developing software for the device specifically. While there are more than a few things that the kernel source code could end up being useful for, it's commonly used by developers to create third-party ROMs and custom firmware for the device that would let users customize it should they want to do so. You see this fairly often from companies like Motorola and HTC as they both tend to release the kernel source code for a fair amount of the phones that launch from their brands. </p>
<p> As an end user, the kernel source code really won't do much good as it's not meant to be software that can be used by the consumer, but it can lead to software that the consumer can get a hold of and install onto their own devices. As mentioned above the source code can be used by developers and those who like to tinker with their devices to create custom firmware for that device, so if you're a consumer who has purchased the Razer Phone and you have loaded custom firmware onto your past devices, this is something that will soon be possible to do with Razer's first smartphone too, all that remains is to wait for developers to take the source code and work with it to create a ROM that you can flash to the phone. </p>
<p> For those that are interested or for developers, there are four different builds of kernel source code that Razer has made available for download. There are two listed under an MR1 label, which are listed as builds 853 and 851, and there are two listed under a production label, which are listed as builds 8822 and 813. All of the builds are exactly 138MB in file size, so the files shouldn't take too long to download. In addition to that it shouldn't be a huge deal if you download them while connected to a mobile network as 138MB is quite small in the scheme of things. If you can find the kernel source code useful, you can grab the necessary files from the source link below. </p>

<p> Prime Day Deal: Ring Video Doorbell 3 with Echo Show 5 </p>
<p> Amazon Prime Day deals wouldn't be Amazon without some discounts on the company's own products and that now includes the latest Ring Doorbell bundle. Specifically, Amazon is bundling its Ring Doorbell 3 with the Echo Show 5, its screen-enabled smart home hub. </p>
<p> Now, there are two bundles to choose from for this Amazon Ring gadget, exclusively for Prime members. But both are only available for Prime subscription holders. So you'll want to head over to Amazon to check out their free 30-day trial if you're looking to bolster your smart home with a new camera and display hub. That's available here and brings added perks like 2-day shipping and video streaming. </p>
<p> In terms of pricing, what buyers are getting is the Echo Show 5 for just $10 as part of the bundle. And that's paired with either a Ring Doorbell 3 or Ring Doorbell 3 Plus for Prime Day and Prime members. The difference between the two gadgets comes down mostly to features. For instance, the Ring Doorbell 3 Plus giving users access to a pre-roll feature. Summarily, that provides extra viewing time on saved video, saving up to 4-seconds of pre-motion-detected footage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For the bundle with the standard Ring Doorbell 3, Amazon is offering a discount of just over 48-percent for Prime Day. That sets the price at just $149.99. The Ring Doorbell 3 plus comes with a discount of just over 46-percent off from the standard $319.98 price. That leaves the overall balance for the more pricey bundle at just $169.99. </p>
<p> There are also steep discounts on the Ring Doorbell 3 as a standalone right now. Those put the pricing at $139.99 for the Ring Doorbell 3 and $159.99 for the Ring Doorbell 3 Plus. That's a 30-percent discount in either case, down from $199.99 and $229.99, respectively. </p>
<p> If you've been holding off pulling the trigger on new camera doorbells or a new Amazon Alexa-powered display hub, these are likely to be the best deals of the year on those. </p>

<p> Got Pets? Then You Need The Roborock S6 MaxV AI </p>
<p> Robot vacuums have always struggled with those of us that have pets in our home. From the hair that our best friends shed, to them leaving their toys out, or even having an accident on the floor, the robot vacuuming experience was just not entirely fuss-free for pet owners, until now. The Roborock S6 MaxV is THE robot vacuum that pet owners should consider buying. </p>
<p> Not only does the Roborock S6 MaxV offer the most powerful suction in the industry at 2500Pa, but it also uses its new ReactiveAI features to avoid things like cords, shoes, and even pet poop. </p>
<p> Update: The Roborock S6 MaxV will be just $599 during Prime Day (that's October 13 and 14), good for $150 off of its regular price! </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> More suction for a deeper clean </p>
<p> The S6 MaxV boasts 2500Pa suction, which is powerful enough to pick up even the most stubborn dirt and dust from your floors. </p>
<p> With this extra suction, you’re going to get an even deeper clean, particularly in carpeted rooms. </p>
<p> So why is this important? Well, with even better suction, this robot vacuum is going to get up every bit of dirt, dust, pet hair and other debris on the floor of your home. Even those that you do not see. Sometimes when I run the S6 MaxV in my home, and then go to empty the dustbin, I wonder where all this dirt came from. As my house did not look that dirty before it started vacuuming. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This extra suction power will give you even less of a reason to pull out a regular vacuum to clean your home. </p>
<p> The S6 MaxV has eyes </p>
<p> These days, there are cameras everywhere, including on your robot vacuum. The Roborock S6 MaxV sports a stereo camera on the front, which is used for obstacle avoidance. </p>
<p> Roborock S6 MaxV sees obstacles like shoes, scales, cords, pet poop, and anything else that might be on the floor. Basically anything that is two inches by one inch, or larger, the S6 MaxV is able to see and will avoid it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The app will ask you, when you first start running the S6 MaxV, if you have pets in the working area. This will let it know whether it should look out for pet poop or not. So it doesn’t think that there is poop on the floor, when it’s actually just a mess that the vacuum should be cleaning up. </p>
<p> The way the S6 MaxV is able to avoid these obstacles is with these two cameras, Artificial Intelligence and the Qualcomm APQ8053 processor. </p>
<p> The APQ8053 is one of Qualcomm’s newer chipsets, that is specifically aimed at IoT devices, like robot vacuums. It works with the cameras (which run at a maximum speed of 30fps) on the S6 MaxV and artificial intelligence to let the vacuum know to avoid obstacles that it might run into. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It was trained by tens of thousands of images and the processing power of the Qualcomm APQ8053. Which is why it is so accurate at avoiding these obstacles. </p>
<p> With the artificial intelligence baked into the S6 MaxV, Roborock is continuing to improve this robot vacuum. It is not learning after every run in your home, but rather being trained by Roborock at its headquarters. When improvements are made to the recognition function, Roborock will roll that out in a firmware update to all S6 MaxV users. After the update is applied, the S6 MaxV will perform even better. </p>
<p> ReactiveAI is also paired with Roborock’s brilliant LiDAR Navigation System. Which has continued to improve over the years, and is the best in the industry. Roborock uses a LiDAR setup on the top of the vacuum, which maps out your home. So that the vacuum knows where the walls are, and how big the room is, that it is cleaning. Additionally, it also knows where it has cleaned already. And where it still needs to clean. This is important for spot cleaning or zone cleaning. Making it easier for you to tell the vacuum that you only want it to clean a specific room, instead of it cleaning the whole house. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Different maps, for different floors </p>
<p> Finally multiple floor plans are supported on the Roborock S6 MaxV. </p>
<p> Those that have a multi-floor home, or apartment, can have multiple floor plans with the S6 MaxV. But, it still has not mastered how to get up the stairs to that second floor (or down to the first). So you will need to place it on each floor. But once it is there, it’ll locate itself, and know which floor plan to use to start cleaning. </p>
<p> The S6 MaxV can remember up to four levels. With 10 no-go zones, no-go lines and no-mop zones per level. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> No longer do you have to decide which floor you want your robot vacuum to clean. As it can now clean it all. With the no-go zones, you have more control over where the S6 MaxV vacuums and where it doesn’t. </p>
<p> Smarter, quieter and better mopping </p>
<p> Mopping is nothing new for a Roborock robot vacuum, but it has seen some great improvements in the S6 MaxV. </p>
<p> Roborock has a new electric water tank, which is app-controlled. Now that might sound odd, since the whole unit is app-controlled, but what’s new on the S6 MaxV is that you can control the amount of water it puts on the floor for mopping and when it mops. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can choose to have it use maximum water flow in the kitchen, and then minimum water flow in the living room or bathroom, where the floor may not be as dirty. </p>
<p> Additionally, the S6 MaxV’s mop is able to turn itself off when it is finished. Not only when it is docked, but also when it is heading back to the dock. So that the S6 MaxV is not dripping water onto the pad while it’s traveling back to the dock or docked. </p>
<p> This is super helpful if you have the Roborock S6 MaxV cleaning your entire home and you have a mix of carpeted and laminate/tile/hardwood floors. </p>
<p> For instance at my house, it’s laminate everywhere, except the bedrooms which are carpeted. So I’d want the S6 MaxV to mop the house except for the bedrooms. And with the ability to turn off the water flow, I won’t need to worry about the S6 MaxV dripping water while it is cleaning the bedrooms. Or worry about it skipping the bedrooms because it has the mopping module installed. </p>
<p> The Roborock S6 MaxV is one of the best all-in-one robot vacuums on the market, that can mop and vacuum your floors. </p>

<p> The Roku Channel Arrives On Amazon Fire TV </p>
<p> The Roku Channel, which is home to more than 100,000 titles and over 115 live TV channels, is now available on Amazon Fire TV. The free, ad-supported service will be accessible on all Fire TV devices, including Fire TV Edition smart TVs, Fire TV Edition soundbars, and streaming devices, with support for Alexa voice commands. </p>
<p> Users can ask Amazon's digital assistant to find and download the Roku Channel app. Alexa will also be able to open the app once downloaded. You can also access the app's vast library by opening it through the Fire TV search menu. </p>
<p> Launched in 2017, the Roku Channel has steadily grown in popularity throughout the US. As of Q2 2020, the service has reached American households with an estimated 43 million people. Roku also recently launched a standalone mobile app for the service. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Roku Channel is now available for Fire TV users </p>
<p> Amazon and Roku are direct competitors in the set-top-box hardware market. While Amazon Prime Video and Amazon Music have been available on Roku devices for years, Roku's free service was surprisingly missing on the former's Fire TV devices. That's finally changing. </p>
<p> Despite their competition, this move makes a lot of sense. Neither of the two companies solely rely on hardware sales. Amazon also offers several subscription services and its Fire TV lineup is primarily a gateway to those. Having more free content onboard may make its hardware offerings more appealing to potential customers. </p>
<p> On the other hand, the Roku Channel is all about advertising and subscription revenues. So it makes sense that Roku would want the service to be accessible to as many viewers as possible. The more viewers, the more ad revenues for the company. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Roku also offers premium channels but, unfortunately, you cannot subscribe to them directly from Fire TV. If you want to watch Showtime, Starz, Epix, or HBO (not HBO Max, which isn't officially available on Roku or Fire TV yet) on The Roku Channel on your Fire TV, you must first sign up directly through Roku and subscribe to those channels. You can then log in with the same Roku account on Fire TV and stream those channels. </p>
<p> As for the free content on the Roku Channel, you don't need a Roku account to access any of those. Just download the app and start streaming. </p>
<p> "We're building on our commitment to make The Roku Channel even more accessible by expanding onto streaming devices such as Amazon Fire TV. We know how much customers crave free entertainment and we're thrilled to bring The Roku Channel to even more households," said Rob Holmes, VP of Programming and Engagement at Roku, in a press release on Thursday. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A51 Picks Up Android 10-Based One UI 2.5 Update </p>
<p> Good news for the Samsung Galaxy A51 owners. As some international variants of the Galaxy A51 are picking up One UI 2.5 update which is based on Android 10. </p>
<p> Notably, the update also bumps the security patch level to October 1, 2020. This Galaxy A51 One UI 2.5 update started rolling out yesterday in Russia and more regions have reportedly started receiving the update. </p>
<p> Moreover, more regions are expected to join the list soon. So, those who are yet to grab hold of this Galaxy A51 One UI 2.5 update, you are in line. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The update arrives with build version A515FXXU4CTJ1 and is live for the Galaxy A51 devices with the SM-A515F model number. The update is arriving a bit late than expected. </p>
<p> As the September 2020 security patch arrived almost six weeks ago. But looking at the implementation of One UI 2.5 and all the new features this new update bundles with it, the wait would definitely worth it. </p>
<p> Besides, Samsung has become a known and reputed name when it comes to the timely rollout of updates. Though the company understood the importance of regular updates pretty late, it has well maintained its position as a top player in this category. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Galaxy A51 One UI 2.5 update brings ultimate Android 10 user experience </p>
<p> As already mentioned, this new Galaxy A51 update packs all the latest and greatest features, Samsung has to offer for its Android 10-based One UI 2.5 update. </p>
<p> Essentially, it is the ultimate Android 10 experience that one could have on their Samsung Galaxy phone. The list of features this update brings is pretty lengthy. </p>
<p> Among other things, it brings various camera features like Single Take and Pro Video mode, adds more Always On Display functionality to Bitmoji, stability improvements, Music Share, Quick Share, etc. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, note that the features might not be the same as what the flagships from Samsung Galaxy S and Note series received. But whatever it is, it surely brings an advanced user experience. </p>
<p> As far as the update is concerned, it is being pushed via OTA in batches. Meaning that it will gradually hit all the units and cover more regions as the days pass by. </p>
<p> However, if you wish to manually check for the latest updates on your phone, then you can head over to Settings > About device > Software update > Update now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If there is a new update available, then you can tap on it to install the latest One UI 2.5 Android 10 on your smartphone. We would strongly advise you to create a complete backup of your data before triggering a manual update. </p>

<p> Samsung & BlackBerry Partner On 'Enterprise Of Things' Tech </p>
<p> Samsung and BlackBerry are partnering on new Enterprise of Things technologies, in addition to joining forces on improving existing solutions in the field, the two companies announced this week. The project will be primarily focused on supporting the duo's shared business customers, though neither party divulged how long that list of companies is. The strategic partnership will run for multiple years and be dedicated to accelerating advancements in the enterprise segment of the Internet of Things market, as well as their clients' efforts to embrace the thereof in a swift and efficient manner. </p>
<p> Samsung's role in the partnership will primarily be that of a hardware provider, whereas BlackBerry will be leveraging its security expertise as part of a bid to create cutting-edge B2B solutions for 21st-century enterprises. While the ultimate results of the newly announced collaboration are yet to be seen, the partnership will already benefit Samsung and BlackBerry's business clients seeking to integrate Galaxy-branded smartphones, tablets, wearables, and DeX-series solutions into their everyday operations, with the two companies confirming such products will now ship with native support for the BlackBerry Universal Endpoint Management (UEM) platform, allowing business owners to manage them from a single hub. </p>
<p> Samsung and BlackBerry have been collaborating on B2B technologies since 2014, having described their latest partnership as a natural extension of the previous project which also included BlackBerry UEM, as well as the Canadian firm's SecuSUITE system and Samsung Knox. The two tech giants haven't disclosed any concrete information about the length of the new project or its financial details. BlackBerry has recently been moving away from consumer electronics, at least in the sense that it effectively shuttered its in-house production division and is now collaborating with manufacturers such as TCL Communication and Optiemus Infracom on Android smartphones, whereas its core business completely refocused on security. The strategy authored and executed by CEO John S. Chen is now largely paying off, with BlackBerry once again giving its investors reasons for optimism after years of underwhelming results. </p>

<p> The Two Newest Samsung Devices Are Powered Up With Xbox Perks </p>
<p> The Samsung and Xbox partnership is finally coming to fruition in a way that you'd expect, as the company's two newest devices will have access to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. </p>
<p> This matters because Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will incorporate xCloud on September 15. As part of that, users will get access to over 100 games including Destiny 2, Forza 4, Halo 5: Guardians, Gears Of War 5: Ultimate Edition, Minecraft Dungeons and more. </p>
<p> Basically, this means owners of the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and/or the Galaxy Tab S7 will have an Xbox in their pocket thanks to the Game Pass compatibility. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 will be the first smartphone to support Xbox Game Pass </p>
<p> This is kind of a big deal for Samsung because it puts the company's devices front and center as gaming powerhouses. </p>
<p> Samsung usually packs its flagship devices with top-end specs. So while they aren't gaming phones or tablets, they're more than capable of handling mobile games. Now, that power only increases with the official Xbox Game Pass Ultimate support. </p>
<p> Surely, down the line other phones will support Game Pass too. And any of the phones can currently run the xCloud Preview will be able to have access to xCloud through Game Pass come September 15. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The benefit of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on the Galaxy Note 20 is that Game Pass Ultimate will take advantage of Samsung's AI Game Booster feature. Samsung is also touting the Note 20's 120Hz display as helping with a smoother gaming experience, though the game streaming won't go beyond 60Hz refresh rates. </p>
<p> A big tangible benefit of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on the Galaxy Note 20, is that buyers of the phone will get three months free of the Xbox service. Which means they save $45. Samsung will also be selling an Xbox Game Pass bundle, which includes a Bluetooth controller optimized for Game Pass. </p>
<p> Games can be played over Wi-Fi and mobile data </p>
<p> Much like the xCloud Preview, Xbox Game Pass will work with Wi-Fi connections as well as mobile data. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When the Galaxy Note 20 is available later this year, it will be able to utilize this feature. Meaning you can instantly play the Game Pass titles whether you're on Wi-Fi, 4G LTE, or 5G connections. </p>
<p> The gameplay experience will probably be best on Wi-Fi. At least for now, and until 5G is more accessible and has expanded to more markets. But, even from the get-go it will still work. </p>
<p> And the only places anyone should ever have any issues when connected through mobile data is where the signal strength and speed isn't very good. However if your connections are fast and stable, gameplay should be excellent. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This works out well for Samsung device users too. Because both Razer and PowerA just announced new peripherals meant specifically for use with xCloud. if you're going to be playing Xbox games on the go, you might as well do it with proper controls. </p>

<p> Samsung Working On An Exynos Chipset With AMD Radeon Graphics </p>
<p> Multiple reports have indicated that Samsung's upcoming Exynos 2100 flagship mobile SoC would arrive as a big upgrade over the Exynos 990, giving Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips a run for their money. However, that isn't the only upgraded mobile processor the Korean company is currently working on. </p>
<p> Noted tipster Ice Universe has claimed that Samsung is working on an Exynos chipset featuring an AMD GPU. The said processor goes by the internal model number Exynos 9925. To recall, the Exynos 990 has the internal model number Exynos 9830, while its upcoming successor – Exynos 2100 – has the model number Exynos 9840. </p>
<p> There's no release time frame or spec details available at the moment. Samsung has only recently launched a 5nm mid-range chipset in Exynos 1080 and is gearing up to launch the Exynos 2100 in a few months. In all likelihood, the latter will arrive with the Galaxy S21 series, which itself is reportedly launching ahead of the usual schedule. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Exynos 9925, however, may not arrive at least until 2022 although there are reports of Samsung launching an Exynos chipset with AMD graphics as early as 2021. The two companies signed a multi-year partnership last year. Under this partnership, AMD will license its RDNA graphics architecture to Samsung. </p>
<p> Some reports even suggest a 2023 release for the Exynos 9925. That estimate is because there's an Exynos 9855 in the works as well. This chipset will likely succeed the Exynos 2100 (Exynos 9840) and launch ahead of the Exynos 9925, probably in 2022. Specifics of this processor are also a mystery for now. </p>
<p> With so much uncertainty around this report, we suggest you take this information with a pinch of salt. We can only be certain once Samsung makes an official announcement or at least more concrete evidence starts popping up. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung hoping to edge Qualcomm by integrating AMD graphics in its Exynos chipsets </p>
<p> There's no confirmation yet about whether and when the Exynos 9855 and Exynos 9925 chipsets may arrive. However, it's more or less certain that Samsung has an Exynos chipset with AMD graphics in the pipeline. It's only a matter of time before we get to know what it'll be called and when it'll arrive. </p>
<p> Samsung seems to have already turned the tide with the Exynos 2100. The upcoming flagship SoC is reportedly ahead of the Snapdragon 875 in CPU performance. However, Qualcomm's Adreno 660 GPU is still offering around 10 percent better graphics performance than the Mali-G78 GPU in the Exynos chipset. </p>
<p> With AMD GPU, Samsung would be hoping to at least match, if not overtake, the performance of Qualcomm's solutions. The flagship mobile SoC market is nicely poised for a much-needed intense battle at the top. </p>

Samsung is also adding a split keyboard feature in the landscape mode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As per the changelog, this update also brings quality and stability improvements to the camera. In the connectivity department, the device will be getting some smart features.

<p> It also carries the latest October Android security patch </p>
<p> First off, the updated app will allow users to share SOS location-sharing messages every 30 minutes for 24 hours to pre-selected emergency contacts. Another newly added feature will show an option to call any of those emergency contacts. Since it is rolling out to Galaxy A71 users globally, it might take a few more days to show up on all the eligible devices. </p>

<p> Meanwhile, interested users can also manually check for the latest update by going to Settings > Software update > Download. If there is a prompt for this new update, tap on the "Install now" button to download and install it. For the Galaxy A smartphones, the newly released One UI 3.0 update based on Android 11 is expected to be available by early next year. </p>
<p> The device was launched with android 10-based One UI 2.0 out of the box. As per the company's refreshed update policy, the Galaxy A71 is also eligible to receive up to three years of software updates. </p>

<p> Wearables News / US Consumers, Here's Your Chance To Buy The Samsung Galaxy Fit 2 </p>
<p> US Consumers, Here's Your Chance To Buy The Samsung Galaxy Fit 2 </p>
<p> Samsung announced the Galaxy Fit 2 a little earlier this year, but now it's officially available for US consumers to buy. The new fitness tracker is the company's latest and greatest wearable. Following on from the launch of the Galaxy Watch 3 that was released earlier this year as well. </p>
<p> With the Galaxy Fit 2, the design is generally the same, but it comes with all-new features and some refined ones that Samsung decided to keep around. </p>
<p> It also comes in at least one new color, with a total of two colors, though Samsung will probably launch additional ones eventually as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> US consumers can pick up the Galaxy Fit 2 for $60 </p>
<p> In terms of wearables, fitness trackers are definitely more on the affordable end. The nice thing about this device is that it benefits from Samsung's beautiful AMOLED display and its more advanced features. </p>
<p> Plus, again it's not that expensive. It'll retail for $60 and it's available directly from Samsung, as well as from retail partners like Amazon and B&H Photo. </p>
<p> As noted it's available in only two colors. Black, and Scarlet which is a lighter red color. The interesting thing is that if you order from Samsung the company's website says that trackers will ship by October 19. That's not until next Monday. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you're ok with the wait and would rather order from Samsung, you'll get the tracker soon enough. However, if you order from Amazon you can have it delivered overnight by 8AM. Though that probably depends on how close you are to an Amazon distribution center. </p>
<p> Which means the Amazon delivery time could vary based on where you live in the US. So keep that in mind. </p>
<p> A lighter, more basic option than the Galaxy Watch 3 </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Fit 2 is the perfect device for anyone that wants fitness tracking features but doesn't want a large display and a full-blown smartwatch. Or the full-blown cost that goes along with it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Fit 2 is a lighter device, so it should be more comfortable no mater how long you wear it. Because of the smaller size it's also likely to feel less invasive than the Galaxy Watch 3 while you sleep. Assuming you want to use the sleep tracking features in the first place. </p>
<p> Of course it'll also have much longer battery life. So if you value battery life and comfort over the multitude of features, this is definitely the better choice of the two. If there are any downsides at all, it's that it doesn't offer customizable watch faces or interchangeable bands. </p>

<p> More Rumors Point To Samsung Launching Galaxy S21 In January </p>
<p> There have been rumors about the Galaxy S21 launch date for some time now, and we're hearing even more (reliable) rumors stating that it'll happen in early January 2021. </p>
<p> Samsung typically launches the Galaxy S devices in February at an event a week or two ahead of Mobile World Congress. But where MWC has been pushed out to June, due to the global pandemic, Samsung is looking to do it earlier. There are likely many other reasons as to why Samsung is doing it earlier too. Like the fact it has two foldable lines and two flagship lines to hold events for. </p>
<p> More than likely, the Galaxy S21 launch will be another virtual event. It doesn't look like COVID-19 is going to be slowing down between now and January. So it'll be a virtual one. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's no exact date set, yet for the Galaxy S21 announcement, so this could be happening around the time of CES, or possibly a bit later on. If it does happen around CES, it would be the biggest phone launch at CES in nearly a decade. </p>
<p> Expect more frequent Unpacked events in 2021 </p>
<p> If this fall has taught us anything, it's to expect more frequent virtual Unpacked events from Samsung. Now that it is unable to do in-person events at huge venues like the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn, it'll do more virtual events. </p>
<p> This is very smart of Samsung, as it can spread out its launch events a bit more. Without giving us everything all at once. This year, we saw the Galaxy Note 20 series in August, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 in early September and Galaxy S20 FE in late September. Expect something similar next year. Likely the Galaxy S21 in January, Galaxy Z Flip 2 in February and so forth. </p>

<p> An earlier Galaxy S21 launch is likely also due to the lagging sales of the Galaxy S20 and Note 20 devices. Launching devices that cost over a grand, during a pandemic, was likely not a good idea. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy S21 May Launch Before The End Of 2020 </p>
<p> According to a new report, Samsung may actually launch the Galaxy S21 before the end of 2020. As most of you know, Samsung usually announces its S series flagships in February or March every year. </p>
<p> Well, according to this information, the company is actually rushing the arrival of the Galaxy S21 series. This information comes from MTN, a Korean publication, and is based on the information provided by insiders. </p>
<p> Galaxy S21 may launch before the end of 2020, key components will enter mass production soon </p>
<p> They claim that many of the key Galaxy S21 components will enter mass production as early as next month. That means this phase of the development is coming considerably earlier than usual. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On its own, this does suggest an earlier arrival of the Galaxy S21 series, but what the source is reporting is kind of extreme. This year has been quite odd due to the global pandemic and everything, and that may be one of the main reasons for this change. </p>
<p> If this does happen, it is yet another indicator that Samsung is not entirely happy with its sales this year. According to the source, the company wants to beat its competitors to the market, and arrive as early as possible. </p>
<p> You may wonder how will Samsung pull this off when the Snapdragon 875 is not even out yet. That chip will get announced later this year, and chances are it won’t become available early. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Even if this happens, the devices won't become available until 2021 </p>
<p> Well, Samsung could technically announce the Galaxy S21 in December, and ship it later on, as soon as it’s able to manufacture the required number of units. Chances are that the Snapdragon 875 samples will be available at that time, to OEMs. </p>
<p> There is a lot of speculation here, as this report is quite surprising. It’s still more likely that Samsung will wait with this announcement, but it seems like some industry insiders think the Galaxy S21 series will come early. We’ll just have to wait and see what will happen. One thing is for sure, you can expect many Galaxy S21 rumors and leaks moving forward. </p>

<p> Android News / Samsung Galaxy S21 & S21 Ultra Designs Revealed; Launching In January </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S21 & S21 Ultra Designs Revealed; Launching In January </p>
<p> Both the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Ultra have surfaced over the weekend, showing off their designs. These two designs both come from @OnLeaks, and they leave very little to the imagination. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S21 and S21 Ultra designs have surfaced </p>
<p> Let’s start with the Galaxy S21, shall we. This handset will feature a flat display, it seems. It is mentioned that the phone’s frame will be made out of metal, while we don’t know about its back. </p>
<p> The device does include a rather interesting-looking rear camera module, which extends from the metal frame. That module houses three cameras sensors, by the way. You can also see the phone’s Type-C port at the bottom, and the main speaker as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The power / lock and volume rocker buttons are all placed on the right-hand side of the phone. It does seem like this handset has thicker bezels than the S20, and a display camera hole is still here, and it’s still centered. </p>
<p> Both of these phones, and the Galaxy S21+, will launch in January </p>
<p> The source notes that the phone features a display that measures 6.2 inches, approximately. The phone itself measures 151.7 x 71.2 x 7.9mm (9mm with the camera bump). This source has confirmed that the whole Galaxy S21 lineup will launch in January, and is not the first source to say so. </p>
<p> Now, as far as the Galaxy S21 Ultra is concerned… well, its rear camera module is huge. More on that soon. The phone itself seems to have a slightly curved display, which will measure 6.7 or 6.9 inches. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A display camera hole is centered, while the phone’s bezels seem to be thinner than the ones on the S21. The phone’s camera module also extends from the frame, as on the Galaxy S21. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S21 Ultra features a huge camera module </p>
<p> Speaking of which, that camera module is huge, to say the least. It seems like there will be four camera sensors included in there, along with an LED flash, and some additional sensors. </p>
<p> The source did not mention what cameras exactly can we expect, but it seems like a periscope camera is included, and chances are we’ll get a separate telephoto camera, an ultra-wide unit, and a main wide-angle camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy S21 Ultra allegedly measures 165.1 x 75.6 x 8.9mm (10.8mm with the camera bump). The phone will not ship with an S Pen, but that doesn’t mean that it won’t support it, we’ll see. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2020/10/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-no-144hz-display.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484385" filename="samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-no-144hz-display.html">
<p> Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra Won't Upgrade To A 144Hz Display </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra won’t upgrade to a 144Hz display, it seems. A tipster said that the phone will stick to a 120Hz display its predecessor offers, basically. </p>
<p> This information comes from ‘NOT DJ Koh’ Twitter account. He claims that some fake rumors have been shared online, claiming that the Galaxy S21 Ultra may offer a 144Hz display. He says that’s not going to happen, period. </p>
<p> We’ve seen several smartphones rocking a 144Hz display already. Those were mostly gaming handsets with fullHD+ panels, so it makes sense, to a degree, though that’s also up for discussion. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy S21 Ultra will likely stick to a 120Hz display, a 144Hz may be an overkill </p>
<p> The difference between a 60Hz and a 90Hz display is quite noticeable. The difference between a 90Hz and a 120Hz, not so much. The same goes for a jump from a 120Hz to a 144Hz panel. So, it’s not exactly surprising Samsung opted to stick to a 120Hz panel. </p>
<p> In fact, all three Galaxy S21 flagships will probably offer a 120Hz display. The same thing happened with the Galaxy S20 series, actually. If Samsung plans to stick with the S20 recipe, then all three phones will arrive with a QHD+ panel as well. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S21 Ultra is expected to become a reality in the first quarter of next year. The phone will launch alongside the Galaxy S20 and S20+, most probably. There is still a chance Samsung may switch things up, though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Chances are that the Galaxy S21 Ultra will resemble the S20 Ultra. The company is once again expected to utilize a display camera hole, thin bezels, and glass + metal build. </p>
<p> It remains to be seen if the company will stick to a curved display, though. As far as an under-display camera is concerned, the Galaxy S21 Ultra won’t feature it. The Galaxy Note 21 or 21 Ultra may, however, we’ll see. </p>
<p> Expect to see quite a few additional Galaxy S21 Ultra rumors in the coming weeks / months. </p>

<p> One UI 2.5 Update Will Be The Last Big Upgrade For Galaxy S9 </p>
<p> Samsung is now rolling out the One UI 2.5 update to the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ smartphones. The update arrives just a couple of days after hitting the Galaxy Note 9 smartphones. The Galaxy S9 series and Galaxy Note 9, launched in 2018, came with Android Oreo out of the box. Now, the newly released One UI 2.5 UI will be their last big update. </p>
<p> At the moment, the One UI 2.5 update for the Galaxy S9 series is rolling out to users in Germany. The latest update carries the build numbers G960FXXUCFTJ2 and G965FXXUCFTJ2 for the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ smartphones respectively. It comes in around 700MB size and includes the latest October 2020 Android security patch. </p>
<p> One UI 2.5 update now available for the Galaxy S9 series </p>
<p> It is expected to expand to other regions very soon. Meanwhile, users can manually check for the latest update by going to Settings > Software update > Download. If there the new update is available, tap on the "Download and install" option. Samsung has introduced a bunch of new features with the One UI 2.5 update. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the Galaxy S9 smartphones already support DeX mode, the latest brings the all-new wireless DeX support. Users can use any smart TV for running the DeX wirelessly. The default Samsung Keyboard app gets the split keyboard functionality when using in landscape mode. </p>
<p> Moreover, the keyboard's search function can be used with Youtube as well. In the camera department, the One UI 2.5 update gets a few new options to further enhance the video recording experience. The Pro video mode will have options for choosing the resolution and frame rate for recording video. </p>
<p> Also, the Single Take mode gets a new option to select the recording duration. The Galaxy S9 users can now send SOS messages every 30 minutes for 24 hours to pre-selected emergency contacts from the default Messages app. These SOS messages will also include GPS data for sharing the exact location. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> During the Galaxy Note 20 launch in August this year, Samsung promised to offer three years of software support for all Galaxy flagships starting with the Galaxy S10 series. This makes the new One UI 2.5 update, which is still based on Android 10, the last OS upgrade for both the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 9 users. </p>
<p> Going forward, the Galaxy S9 will continue to receive monthly Android security patches for a few more months. After that, even the security patches will be limited to one update for every three months. </p>

<p> Android News / Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 & Tab A 8.0 Starts Receiving Android 10 Update </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 & Tab A 8.0 Starts Receiving Android 10 Update </p>
<p> Recently, Samsung rolled out the latest Android update to its premium Galaxy Tab S4 and Galaxy Tab S5e tablets. The company is now releasing the Android 10 update to two of its more affordable tablets — the Galaxy Tab A 10.1 and Galaxy Tab A 8.0. </p>
<p> Surprisingly, the new One UI 2.0 OTA update also includes the latest July 2020 Android security patch. The update is currently rolling out to only LTE variants. </p>
<p> Galaxy Tab A 10.1 and Galaxy Tab A 8.0 gets Android 10 update </p>
<p> The Wi-Fi variants of the Galaxy Tab A 10.1 and Galaxy Tab A 8.0 should be receiving the same update in the next few weeks. While the Galaxy Tab S tablets received the One UI 2.1 update, it is only the One UI 2.0 update for the Galaxy Tab A tablets. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This new update comes with the firmware versions T515XXU4BTFK for the Galaxy Tab A 10.1 and P205DXU5BTFB for the Galaxy Tab A 8.0. Both of these tablets were launched with Android 9.0 Pie out of the box. As per the company's policy, we can also expect to see an Android 11 update for these tablets in 2021. </p>
<p> As the rollout will happen in phases, not all users will be able to get their hands on Android 10 on the first day itself. However, interested users can manually check for a new OTA update by going to Settings > Software update > Download. </p>
<p> The tablets are also eligible for the Android 11 update </p>
<p> The Android tablet market is getting less exciting with each passing day. Still, it's good to see Samsung offering the latest OS updates, even for affordable tablets. Samsung introduced several new features with the One UI 2.1 update released for the Galaxy Tab S4 & Tab S5e tablets. While not all the features will be available on the cheaper Galaxy Tab A tablets, we expect to see a few of them. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab A 10.1 and Galaxy Tab A 8.0 should be getting the Quick Share feature for quickly transferring files with other Samsung devices. It will work just like the AirDrop on iPhones and iPads. With the new One UI update, the Floating keyboard now includes new size and transparency settings. It can also be used on top of all the apps. </p>
<p> The default Samsung Keyboard will also support the new Unicode 11.0 emojis. Samsung already offers system-wide dark mode with the One UI. With the new One UI 2.0 based on Android 10, we should be noticing improvements in terms of text and colors. </p>

<p> Galaxy Tab Active 3 Gets Official Support Pages, Launch Imminent </p>
<p> Samsung's upcoming rugged Android tablet, the Galaxy Tab Active 3, could launch anytime now. The device has been picking up the necessary certifications pretty rapidly over the past couple of weeks. Now, it has got support pages on Samsung's official websites as well. </p>
<p> Samsung's German and UK websites have published support pages for an unannounced device with model number SM-T575. Going by previous leaks and certification listings, this is none other than the LTE variant of the Galaxy Tab Active 3. Samsung is also preparing Wi-Fi-only (SM-T570) and 5G (SM-T577) variants of the new rugged tablet. </p>
<p> The official support pages for the Galaxy Tab Active 3 do not reveal anything about the device itself. However, we already know a lot about the upcoming Samsung tablet, thanks to all those leaks, rumors, and certification listings in the recent past. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Galaxy Tab Active 3 rumored specifications </p>
<p> It's been nearly three years since Samsung last launched a rugged Android tablet. The successor to the Galaxy Tab Active 2 is now finally arriving, with three years worth of changes and improvements. According to a Geekbench listing, the Galaxy Tab Active 3 will be powered by the Exynos 9810 chipset with 4GB of RAM. The tablet scored 723 points in the single-core test and 2,085 points in the multi-core Geekbench test. </p>
<p> It'll debut with One UI 2.x based on Android 10, hopefully, One UI 2.5. The device packs an EB-BT575BBE battery module with a rated capacity of 4,900mAh (5,050mAh typical). For a quick reminder, the Galaxy Tab Active 2 launched in October 2017 with the Exynos 7870 chipset, 3 GB of RAM, Android 7.1 Nougat, and a 4,450mAh battery. </p>
<p> As mentioned earlier, the Galaxy Tab Active 3 will come in Wi-Fi-only, 4G LTE, and 5G variants. It will become Samsung's first rugged tablet to support 5G, joining an ever-growing list of 5G-capable Galaxy devices. The Bluetooth SIG recently certified the tablets with Bluetooth 5.0. The new rugged Samsung tablet misses out on the latest Wi-Fi standard, Wi-Fi 6, though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In terms of size and design, the Galaxy Tab Active 3 shouldn't look and feel too different from its predecessors. The tablet measures roughly 215 x 130mm, which is identical to that of Tab Active 2, which measures 214.7 x 127.6 x 9.9mm. Since ruggedness is the primary focus here, the tablet will still feature three physical navigation buttons, a rare sight in 2020 as we push for all-screen mobile devices. </p>
<p> Samsung has yet to announce a launch date for its new rugged tablet. However, with support pages going live on its websites, an official introduction for the Galaxy Tab Active 3 may not be too far off now. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 & S7+ Appear In All Color Options </p>
<p> Samsung will be officially unveiling the Galaxy Tab S7 and Galaxy Tab S7+ on August 5. The complete specifications of the tablets were leaked much ahead of the launch day. Thanks to Evan Blass, both the Galaxy Tab S7 tablets were now leaked in all three colors. </p>
<p> There is even a 360-degree video to give us a proper first look at the new flagship Galaxy tablets. These metal-clad tablets will be available in Mystic Bronze, Mystic Silver, and Mystic Black color options. </p>
<p> Galaxy Tab S7 & Galaxy Tab S7+ to come in three colors </p>
<p> Considering these are flagship devices, we can't expect any compromise over the build quality. The tablets come with a metal unibody design with a magnetic groove on the rear to hold the S Pen. As seen in the previous leaks, both the Galaxy Tab S7 and Galaxy Tab S7+ look very similar. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ comes with a 12.4-inch Super AMOLED display. Whereas, the Galaxy Tab S7 sports a slightly smaller 11-inch display and uses LTPS LCD panel. Even with different kinds of display panels, both the tablets will offer a high refresh rate of 120Hz. </p>
<p> Because of the LCD panel, the smaller Galaxy Tab S7 comes with a side-mounted fingerprint scanner, which also doubles up as a power button. Hence, there is no visible power button in the images. For the Galaxy Tab S7+, both the power button and volume rocker can be seen on the side edge. </p>
<p> We can also spot the "Sound by AKG" branding on the back. Both the tablets will feature quad speakers tuned by AKG. On the rear, there is a dual-camera setup featuring a 13MP primary camera and a 5MP ultra-wide camera along with a LED flash. Compared to its predecessor, the 8MP front camera has been moved from the top to the side bezel. </p>

<p> Samsung to bundle 15W charger in the box </p>
<p> Perhaps best of all, the Galaxy Tab S7 tablets will feature the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ Mobile Platform coupled with LPDDR5X RAM. While the 4G variants offer at least 128GB of internal storage, the base variant of the 5G variant will come with 256GB of internal storage. There will also be a MicroSD card slot for further expansion of storage. </p>
<p> The 11-inch Galaxy Tab S7 will be equipped with a 7,040 mAh battery. Whereas the Plus monicker comes with a much larger 10,090mAh battery. While both the tablets support 45W fast charging, Samsung will only provide a 15W power adapter in the box. </p>
<p> With the design and specifications already leaked, we still have to wait for the Galaxy Unpacked event to know the pricing and availability details of the Galaxy Tab S7 and Galaxy Tab S7+ tablets. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ Live Images Leak Ahead Of Launch </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Tab S7 tablets have been leaking extensively over the past few weeks. Now, with less than a month to go for their official introduction, live images of the Galaxy Tab S7+ have appeared online. </p>
<p> South Korean certification authority Safety Korea recently certified the Galaxy Tab S7+ with model numbers SM-T975N and SM-T976N. The two model numbers probably correspond to the LTE and 5G versions of the tablet, respectively. </p>
<p> While the certifications did not reveal any details about the device, they give us our very first look at the upcoming Samsung flagship. The Galaxy Tab S7+ will feature minimal bezels around the display, which is a 12.4-inch Super AMOLED panel with a screen resolution of 2800 x 1752 pixels. There's a single selfie camera at the front, which, rumors suggest, is an 8-megapixel sensor. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the back, the Galaxy Tab S7+ gets a dual-camera setup consisting of a 13-megapixel and a 5-megapixel sensor along with an LED flash. Just side of the camera housing is the long strip where the Bluetooth-enabled S Pen would attach magnetically. </p>
<p> The whole setup is identical to the Galaxy Tab S6 that launched last year. There’s also an AKG branding at the rear, confirming that the tablet's quad-speaker setup will be tuned by the Samsung subsidiary. </p>
<p> Galaxy Tab S7+ live images leak </p>
<p> This is the first time Samsung's Galaxy Tab S7+ has appeared on the internet in live images. However, the tablet's specifications and feature details have been leaking for the past several weeks. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Specifications of the vanilla Tab S7, which features an 11-inch Super AMOLED display, have also surfaced on the internet before. An official-looking press render of the Tab S7 leaked earlier today. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 series will come equipped with the recently announced Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ SoC. Both the tablets will be available in multiple memory configurations with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of expandable storage. The two tablets will run Android 10 with One UI 2.5 out of the box. </p>
<p> The vanilla Tab S7 also gets the same set of front and rear cameras as its more powerful sibling. Additionally, both the tablets will feature an in-display fingerprint reader. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ packs a massive 10,090mAh battery and may come with 45W fast wired charging support. The Tab S7, on the other hand, gets a relatively smaller 7,760mAh battery. It may also lack 45W charging speeds. </p>
<p> Samsung will offer the Galaxy Tab S7 duo in both LTE and Wi-Fi-only variants. Additionally, The Tab S7+ will also come in a 5G variant in select markets. </p>
<p> It will only support sub-6Ghz 5G networks though. Samsung built a custom variant of the Galaxy S20 for Verizon's mmWave 5G networks earlier this year. It remains to be seen if the company does the same with the Galaxy Tab S7+ as well. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7, S7+ Are Coming, But When & Where Can You Buy </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Tab S7 series is now official but Samsung, for now, hasn't given a whole lot of detail about where or when it will be available to buy. The news will undoubtedly become available shortly after Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked 2020 event ends. But the pricing of the devices is much more certain. As are details about exactly what customers are getting for their money from Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+. </p>
<p> The latest in Samsung's premium line of tablets, the Galaxy Tab S7 is available in two primary form-factors. And there are at least a couple of variants on the smaller of those available too. Samsung indicates the 11-inch Galaxy Tab S7 will start at $649. That's likely for the Wi-Fi-only variant. the company lists separate weights for the Galaxy Tab S7 with Wi-Fi, LTE, and 5G support. </p>
<p> Samsung also indicates that the 12.4-inch, 5G-only Galaxy Tab S7+ will only be available to buy in a 5G-supporting configuration. That'll start at a much more premium $849. There will likely be carrier deals as well to bring the cost down. But that remains to be seen as of this writing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So where are these gadgets set to be available? </p>
<p> Another detail that's been kept under wraps at this point is exactly where the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 or Tab S7+ will be made available to buy, to begin with. The company hasn't provided details about which carriers might be selling the 4G and 5G variants in-store. If at all. And even regions haven't been revealed just yet. </p>
<p> That's with one exception; the United States. It can be surmised that Samsung will likely deliver most sales through its own dedicated online storefront. That was the chief sales point for these gadgets' predecessors too. And it will likely cost a bit more to buy the carrier-supported variants. At least for the smaller Galaxy Tab S7. And it will likely appear in effectively every region that other devices, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 was sold. </p>
<p> For the time being, Samsung has only said this gadget will go on sale in the US, "this fall." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What colors are available to buy for the new Galaxy Tab S7? </p>
<p> Now, when this device does go on sale, Samsung is launching three different color configurations. And those will align with the newly launched Samsung Galaxy Note 20 series. With one exception. Samsung isn't selling its tablet in "Mystic White." It is selling its third variation in "Mystic Silver." </p>
<p> The other two available colors, for both gadgets from launch, are Mystic Black and Mystic Bronze. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ Will Feature A Large 10,090mAh Battery </p>
<p> Samsung will be unveiling the successor to the flagship Galaxy Tab S6 Android tablet in the coming months. However, the company is rumored to launch a Plus monicker alongside the standard Galaxy Tab S7. Now, the Galaxy Tab S7+ reportedly spotted on TUV Rheinland and Safety Korea certification websites revealing its battery capacity. </p>
<p> As per the latest leaks, the Galaxy Tab S7+ will come equipped with a massive 10,090mAh battery. However, the rated capacity of the battery on the Plus-sized tablet will be only 9,800mAh. This huge battery should make the tablet last for a longer period of continuous usage. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ to launch with 10,090mAh battery </p>
<p> The current-gen Galaxy Tab S6 features a 7,040mAh battery and is rated to last for a full 15 hours of video playback. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As seen with the Galaxy Tab S6, the Galaxy Tab S7+ could also support charging through the POGO Charging Dock apart from the USB Type-C port. </p>
<p> In comparison, the Galaxy Tab S7 might sport a 7,760mAh battery. While the Galaxy Tab S6 came with a 15W Adaptive fast charger, the upcoming Galaxy Tab S7 lineup will likely come bundled with a 25W fast charger. </p>
<p> While the latest certifications only revealed the battery capacity of the Galaxy Tab S7+, the earlier leaks disclosed even more details. The rumored 12.4-inch display on the Plus variant will be supporting a 120Hz high refresh rate. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Even with so much real estate, these new tablets won't be able to accommodate the 3.5mm audio jack. It will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Mobile Platform. The cellular variant of the tablet will also support 5G connectivity. </p>
<p> Samsung might launch these new tablets on August 5th </p>
<p> The Geekbench listing also revealed the tablet to come with a minimum of 6GB of RAM. Just like the upcoming Galaxy Note 20 series, the Galaxy Tab S7 tablets will also run on Android 10-based OneUI 2.5 out of the box. </p>
<p> Also, the leaked renders have revealed the design, which looks very much similar to its predecessor. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the rear, we can spot the dual-camera setup along with a magnetic groove for holding the S-Pen. </p>
<p> With the Galaxy Tab S7+, Samsung is looking to compete with the larger Apple iPad Pro. If you weren't aware, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro packs a 9,720mAh battery. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+ are expected to be launched alongside the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Z Flip 5G on August 5th. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ Design Revealed Ahead Of Launch </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ design has just surfaced in CAD-based renders (both images and video). These renders have been shared by Pigtou and OnLeaks, in collaboration. </p>
<p> These renders are probably quite accurate, and they reveal the design of Samsung’s upcoming flagship tablet. As you can see, the device will have quite thin bezels. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ design revealed, thin bezels in tow </p>
<p> Tables should always have bezels for grip purposes, though that doesn’t mean they have to be thick. That’s something that Samsung is trying to express with this design. The device will not include display holes, or a notch, by the way. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company seems to have placed two cameras on the back of this device. Those two cameras are vertically aligned, with an LED flash placed below them. The whole camera module protrudes on the back. </p>
<p> We’re not sure what material is Samsung using here, but it’s either metal or glass. It sure looks like metal in the renders that are provided here, though. </p>
<p> Overall, the design of the Galaxy Tab S7+ resembles the design of Apple’s last-gen iPad. It has those flat sides and everything. You will also notice pogo pins on the left, for docking purposes. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ will feature a 12.4-inch display. That is quite a large display, for a tablet, and only slightly smaller than the one Apple’s 12.9-inch iPad is offering. </p>
<p> We’re sure that Samsung will utilize an OLED display here, by the way, and the resolution is still unknown. If we had to guess, though, we’d say this will be a QHD+ 120Hz panel. </p>
<p> The S Pen will be a part of the package as well </p>
<p> To round up the package, Samsung will also throw in an S Pen stylus into the mix. That stylus will ship alongside the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ is rumored to include a 9,800mAh battery. Its smaller sibling, the Galaxy Tab S7, will probably include a smaller battery pack, a 7.760mAh one. </p>
<p> Some may assume these two devices will arrive in August, along with the Galaxy Note 20 series. That almost certainly will not happen, though. Samsung will launch five flagship-grade devices during that launch event, so including these two tablets would be hectic. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 and S7+ will almost certainly launch next month. We still don’t know when exactly will that happen, but July seems to be the month it will happen. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Series Specifications </p>
<p> In addition to launching the Galaxy Note 20 series, and some other hardware, Samsung also announced its flagship tablets today. We’ve already covered the initial launch of the Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+, and now we’re here to take a closer look at their specifications. </p>
<p> These two tablets have quite a bit in common, but they’re not exactly identical in this regard, of course. That being said, we’ll first talk about the specs that are the same, and then more to see what are the differences here. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 tablets feature powerful specifications </p>
<p> Both of these tablets are fueled by the same SoC, Samsung utilized the Snapdragon 865 Plus in both cases. That is, along with the Snapdragon 865, the company’s most powerful SoC. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Do note that the Snapdragon 865 Plus is included in the US and China, while the Exynos 990 will fuel these tablets in Europe and India. The SoC selection will be market-dependent, and that is something we’re used to when it comes to Samsung. </p>
<p> Both devices will arrive in 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. The 6GB RAM model will include 128GB of storage, while the 8GB RAM variant will ship with 256GB of storage. MicroSD card expansion will be available as well, up to 1TB. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Android 10 comes pre-installed on both of these tablets, while both of them come with Samsung’s software on top of Android. Both devices include a quad speaker setup. Those speakers are tuned by AKG, while Dolby Atmos support is included. </p>
<p> These two devices also have the same camera setups. Both include two cameras on the back, and one on the front. 13 and 5-megapixel units are located on the back (main + ultrawide), while an 8-megapixel camera can be found on the front. </p>
<p> A Type-C USB 3.2 port is included at the bottom of both tablets. Both of them pack in Bluetooth 5.0, and support 5G. Availability may vary by market, though, as both Wi-Fi only and 5G / LTE variants will become available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both of these tablets also come with an S Pen stylus. That is pretty much everything they have in common when it comes to their spec sheets. There are quite a few differences as well. So, let’s start with the Galaxy Tab S7, shall we. </p>
<p> The base model includes an inferior display, different fingerprint scanner </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 features an 11-inch WQXGA (2560 x 1600) LTPS TFT display. That display offers 120Hz refresh rate, by the way, and it’s flat, of course, as is the one on the ‘Plus’ model. More on that later. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 includes a side-facing fingerprint scanner, and an 8,000mAh battery. The device supports 45W fast wired charging, by the way, so you should be able to replenish that battery really fast. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This tablet is both smaller and lighter than its sibling. It measures 253.8 x 165.3 x 6.3mm, and weighs 498 grams (Wi-Fi variant) / 500 grams (LTE variant) / 502 grams (5G variant). </p>
<p> The 'Plus' model offers a better, and larger display </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+, on the other hand, comes with a 12.4-inch WQXGA (2800 x 1752) Super AMOLED display. That display offers a 120Hz refresh rate as well. </p>
<p> The ‘Plus’ variant comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner, not a side-facing one. It also includes a larger battery than its sibling, a 10,090mAh unit, which also supports 45W fast wired charging. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ measures 285 x 185 x 5.7mm, and weighs 575 grams (Wi-Fi, LTE & 5G), in case you’re wondering. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ Specs Leaked, To Come With Snapdragon 865+ </p>
<p> Samsung is rumored to launch the Galaxy Tab S7 Android tablets at the Galaxy Unpacked event on August 5. The design of the new flagship Galaxy tablet has already been revealed through CAD renders. Today, the key specs of the Galaxy Tab S7+ were leaked online. </p>
<p> As seen on the Galaxy Tab S6, the S Pen will magnetically clip back into the groove on the back of the Galaxy Tab S7+ tablet. While the S Pen is mentioned to come with Bluetooth connectivity for using it as a remote control, there is no confirmation on the gesture support. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ Leaked Specifications </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+ will be coming with 11-inch and 12.4-inch displays respectively. As per the leaks, the AMOLED display on the Plus monicker will offer 2800 by 1752 pixels resolution. We should also be seeing the in-display fingerprint scanner for biometric authentication. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Powering the tablet is the newly announced Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+. Compared to the Snapdragon 865, the Plus variant offers a 10 percent improvement in both CPU and GPU performance. The Snapdragon 865+ is also the first mobile SoC to offer a clock speed of more than 3GHz. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab S7+ with 6GB or 8GB of RAM will be available in 128GB and 256GB storage variants. According to SamMobile, it will also include a MicroSD card slot for further expansion of the storage. As usual, Samsung will be launching these new tablets in both Wi-Fi and cellular variants. </p>
<p> These flagship tablets might support up to 15W fast charging </p>
<p> However, the 5G variant of the Galaxy Tab S7+ will be missing support for the mmWave spectrum. At the time of its launch, the company would only launch a Sub-6GHz supported variant. Therefore, the cellular Galaxy Tab S7+ won't work on carriers like Verizon, which uses the mmWave spectrum for 5G. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As for the cameras, there will be a 13MP + 5MP dual-camera setup on the rear and a single 8MP camera on the front. Just like the upcoming Galaxy Note 20 series, the Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+ will be running on the new One UI 2.5 out of the box. </p>
<p> Finally, it has a 10,090mAh battery, which should provide a day-long battery life. Sadly, the company is likely going to stick with 15W fast charging technology. Along with the new Galaxy Tab S7 tablets, Samsung is also expected to unveil the Galaxy Note 20, Galaxy Z Flip 5G, and Galaxy Watch 3 at the Galaxy Unpacked 2020 event. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 & Tab S7+ Specs Leaked Ahead of Launch </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 and Galaxy Tab S7+ are expected to be officially unveiled on August 5. Several leaks have surfaced online, giving us a glimpse into the next flagship Galaxy tablets. </p>
<p> Thanks to WinFuture, the full specs of the Galaxy Tab S7 and Galaxy Tab S7+ tablets were revealed ahead of the launch event. We also got our first look at these tablets in the Mystic Black, Mystic Bronze, and Mystic Silver color options. </p>
<p> This is also the first time the company will be launching its flagship Galaxy Tab S tablet in two sizes. On the design front, the two tablets look very similar with their metal uni-body design and narrow-bezel display. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Galaxy Tab S7 & Galaxy Tab S7+ Full Specs </p>
<p> However, there are a few differences between the Galaxy Tab S7 and Galaxy Tab S7+ tablets in terms of specifications. First off, the Galaxy Tab S7 will be using an LCD panel for its 11-inch display. On the other hand, the Galaxy Tab S7+ sports a 12.4-inch Super AMOLED display with 2800 by 1752 pixels resolution. </p>
<p> Unlike the Galaxy Tab S7, the Plus monicker takes advantage of the AMOLED panel and includes an in-display fingerprint scanner. Whereas the non-plus variant comes with a side-mounted fingerprint scanner embedded into the power button. Furthermore, both tablets offer a high refresh rate of 120Hz for a super smooth experience. </p>
<p> As seen on the Galaxy Tab S6, the upcoming tablets also come with a groove on the back to hold the S Pen magnetically. With a low latency of just nine milliseconds, the S Pen will reportedly feel like you're using a real pen. Additionally, it might even support air gestures, just like the Galaxy Note 20 series. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Speaking of performance, the Galaxy Tab S7 series will be powered by the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ Mobile Platform clocked at 3.09GHz. This is in contradiction to previous leaks that suggested the standard Galaxy Tab S7 will feature the Snapdragon 865 Mobile Platform. With the built-in Snapdragon X55 modem, both tablets will also get 5G variants. </p>
<p> The tablets will be equipped with at least 6GB of LPDDR5X RAM and at least 128GB of UFS flash storage. There will also be a MicroSD card slot for further expansion of storage. Coming to the cameras, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 and Galaxy Tab S7+ share the exact same sensors. </p>
<p> Both tablets will only have a 15W fast charger inside the box </p>
<p> There is a 13MP (wide) + 5MP (ultra-wide) dual camera setup on the rear and an 8MP camera on the front. Unlike earlier, the front camera is now positioned on the side bezel of the tablets. While the Galaxy Tab S7 comes with a 7,040mAh battery, the larger Galaxy Tab S7 is equipped with a 10,090mAh battery. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung will only include a 15W charger inside the package, though the tablets are capable of supporting up to 45W fast charging. Both tablets should be good enough to last for all day on a single charge. The tablets also feature AKG-tuned quad speakers with Dolby Atmos support. </p>
<p> Compared to the Galaxy Tab S7, the Galaxy Tab S7+ is a bit thinner but weighs nearly a chunky 100 grams more. The company will also unveil a new keyboard cover that comes with a built-in trackpad. Anyway, we have to wait until the launch day to know about the pricing and availability of these tablets. Stay tuned! </p>

<p> Galaxy Tab S7 to launch with LCD display </p>
<p> First off, the Galaxy Tab S7 could feature an LCD display. Surprisingly, the last year's Galaxy Tab S6 came with a Super AMOLED display. Apart from compromising on the display panel, the rest of the specifications are on par with the plus monicker. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The 11-inch display on Tab S7 offers Full HD+ (2560 by 1600 pixels) resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. While the Galaxy Tab S7+ is expected to feature the Snapdragon 865+ Mobile Platform, the standard Galaxy Tab S7 will come equipped with Snapdragon 865 Mobile Platform. </p>
<p> The base variant of the tablet will offer 128GB of internal storage. Also, there is a MicroSD card slot for further expansion. In terms of optics, it will feature a single 13MP camera on the rear and an 8MP selfie camera on the front. It's worth noting that the front camera is moved from the top of the tablet to the side. </p>
<p> It runs on the all-new One UI 2.5 out of the box </p>
<p> As seen on the previously Galaxy Tab S tablets, the upcoming Galaxy Tab S7 will also support S Pen. And, it will magnetically clip back into the groove on the back of the tablet. The Galaxy Tab S7 also has a massive 8,000mAh battery, which should last for a whole day on a single charge. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Software: Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is the company's second foldable phone, and it has some interesting software tweaks to take advantage of that folding display. </p>
<p> Samsung worked with Google to make the majority of these changes, so it's possible we could see them trickle down to other clamshell foldable smartphones. But as for now, they only exist on the Galaxy Z Flip. </p>
<p> Here's everything that's new (and different) about the Galaxy Z Flip's software. </p>
<p> What is Flex Mode? </p>
<p> Flex Mode is one of the main new features on the Galaxy Z Flip. It allows you to fold your Galaxy Z Flip halfway (essentially). By doing this, you break the app that is open in two. Now not all apps support this, but apps like the camera do. </p>
<p> With the camera, the bottom half has all of the controls like the shutter, the button to switch cameras and so forth. While the upper half is your view finder. So you can basically put this down on a table and have it still take a photo, because it is folded in an L shape. Even in Flex Mode, content creators can take photos and videos in a variety of different aspect ratios. Like 1:1, 4:3, 16:9, and even 22:9. So you can take the perfect shot for whatever you want. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Flex mode also works with some other apps like the gallery and Google Duo. Samsung says that other apps will adapt to this new mode in the near future. With Google Duo, it works really well, as it sort of becomes a phone stand, so you can do video chatting without having to hold the phone for long periods of time. </p>
<p> Flex Mode is a pretty unique feature in the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip software, and perhaps the biggest feature available currently. However, most people likely won't use it until more apps support this mode. </p>
<p> The cover display is actually useful </p>
<p> On the front of the Galaxy Z Flip, you'll find a pretty tiny 1.1-inch AMOLED display. This display is pretty small, but despite it being tiny, it is still pretty useful. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This small front display is mostly used to show you the time, and any notifications you might have. But it can also do a few other things. </p>
<p> The cover display is able to show you multimedia controls, allowing you to play/pause your music from that screen without needing to open the phone. It also gives you the ability to answer or reject someone that is calling you – not to mention, see who is calling you. </p>
<p> Now there is one feature that some might not see as very useful, and that is the camera. You can double tap the power button, with the Galaxy Z Flip closed, and use the cover display as a viewfinder to take a selfie. Since the phone is closed, you can only take a selfie, since the rear camera is facing you. Now this does mean that you can get a better selfie, as the rear cameras are better quality than the front-facing camera. But the viewfinder is pretty hilariously small. It's kind of a cool feature, but likely not one you'll use all that often. </p>
<p> It has a built-in stand! </p>
<p> Well, not totally. But because the Galaxy Z Flip has a few more stops in the hinge, you can use it as a stand when it is in "Flex Mode" which we talked about earlier. </p>
<p> This is actually really great for those that do a lot of traveling, as you can watch Netflix on your new Galaxy Z Flip without needing to hold the phone the entire time. It also is going to make it easier to type on, even though it is a bit of a narrow screen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Z Flip is capable of standing upright on its own and it can also stand at multiple angles, and that comes back to the multiple stops on the hinge. So you can have it a 90º angle, or a bit larger of an angle depending on your preference. </p>
<p> This is actually really good for taking photos at night though, and for taking time lapses. As you can set the phone down and take the photo, not having to take into account your hands moving while it's taking long exposure shots. Which can cause night mode photos to become a bit blurry, since it is taking multiple long exposure shots and stitching them together. </p>
<p> However, on the downside, you can't just flip the Galaxy Z Flip open like it's a flip phone. Because it has the multiple stops, you can't really flip it open with one hand. Since it will stop at the first stop on the hinge. But if you do it forceful enough, it can flip all the way open. However, that might feel like you're going to break the phone, or like it's going to flip out of your hands. Which is not something we want to happen. </p>

<p> Perfect for Multi-tasking </p>
<p> The tall display on the Galaxy Z Flip makes it perfect for multi-tasking, and Samsung made sure to make that a big deal with its software. </p>
<p> You can split the Galaxy Z Flip's display in half, right at the crease, and essentially have two 4-inch screens available for different apps. Both apps will be active at the same time too. So one won't be idle while you scroll in the other. </p>
<p> Just like with multi-window on other Samsung devices, you can swipe in from the right edge to open up another app in Multi Active Window. Most apps are compatible, but there are some that still don't support multi window, like Instagram – sadly. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This makes the Galaxy Z Flip great for watching a video on YouTube and also scrolling through Facebook or Twitter on the lower half of the screen. There are many combinations that you can use the Multi Active Window feature for. </p>
<p> Still running Android 10 & One UI 2 </p>
<p> All of these features are in addition to what is found in Android 10 and One UI 2. That also includes a system-wide dark mode. Which looks really great on the Galaxy Z Flip, since it has an AMOLED display. Not to mention it'll save you some battery too. </p>
<p> It also includes features like Digital Wellbeing, Samsung's Game Launcher and much more. All of the features that you know from Samsung's other smartphones, are available on the Galaxy Z Flip too. </p>
<p> Samsung had to add in some of these other features to take advantage of this new form factor. Since the Galaxy Z Flip is not just your regular slab smartphone, so adding some software features was definitely needed. If you're thinking of grabbing a Galaxy Z Flip, these tips should help you make the most of your purchase. If you haven't bought one yet, you can grab one here. </p>

<p> More To The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 Display Than Meets The Eye </p>
<p> Samsung announced the Galaxy Z Fold 2 on September 1 but didn't reveal all of the details about its folding display. Now, the company has announced that the flagship has the shortest curvature of any smartphone to date. In fact, it has a curvature rated at a radius rating of 1.4R. </p>
<p> The figure is down from the 1.5R rating found on the Galaxy Z Flip and original Galaxy Z Fold. And it represents a significant reduction in the gap when the handset is closed too, according to Samsung. </p>
<p> For clarity, the smaller the number, the smaller the gap that's present between the two sides. But the smaller figure also means that there's more stress placed on the panel. And that may make this a bigger achievement than it seems at first glance. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy Z Fold 2 display was tested to withstand day-to-day use for years </p>
<p> In fact, Samsung says that its "proprietary foldable display optimization technologies" not only allow a bright display at 2208 x 1768 resolution at 7.6-inches. That's when folded open. It also managed to attain an "Eye Care Display” certification from SGS. And to overcome stress testing from a third party. </p>
<p> Summarily, the displays have been tested by Bureau Veritas to withstand up to 200,000 folds. That's a verified and certified figure, rather than something Samsung tested internally. </p>
<p> To accomplish its goal, Samsung optimized its display across more than just the standard tests. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company doesn't dive too deeply into the technical aspects of that. But it also changed things in terms of display structure, material, and assembly. The result is a multi-layered display that acts as a cushion when folding occurs. So Samsung was able to use an Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG) panel, while still improving the design. At least in terms of the gap between the two halves of the fold. </p>
<p> This device could change the way smartphones are made </p>
<p> Samsung additionally points out that its focus on folding displays is directly linked to the incoming change to mobile connectivity. Namely, 5G. The company hopes that the introduction of a new form factor will match the needs presented by the new technology. Particularly when it comes to multi-form devices, such as a smartphone that conveniently turns into a tablet on-demand. And it may not be wrong about that, according to recent reports. </p>

<p> Samsung, HK Hynix Request US Approval To Supply Chips To Huawei </p>
<p> Samsung and HK Hynix have reportedly requested approval from the US to continue supplying semiconductor chips to Huawei. The two South Korean chipmakers join MediaTek and Qualcomm in making such requests, Korean publication ET News reports. </p>
<p> All these chip companies have been affected by the US government's tightening trade restrictions on Huawei. In the latest development, the US Department of Commerce last month announced a new set of rules that threaten the survival of the Chinese company's smartphone business. </p>
<p> The new rules prevent Huawei access to any US-based technology, product, or components. The company cannot even obtain components from a non-American firm that uses US-origin software or technology. Essentially, these restrictions prevent it from obtaining semiconductor chips from any global company. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Chipmakers can still apply for a special license that'd allow them to continue trades with Huawei for a limited time. However, there's little chance of the requests receiving approval. </p>
<p> The new rules come into effect on September 15th. That's when Samsung, HK Hynix, and others will have to cease trades with Huawei if their requests aren't approved. The two companies have already announced those measures. </p>
<p> "Many multinational semiconductor manufacturers including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix made requests for approval from the US Department of Commerce," said a high-ranking official from the government. "Regardless of whether these requests get approved or not, they took necessary measures before the US Government imposes its sanction on September 15." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung and LG's display manufacturing arms will also stop selling OLED panels to the Chinese company from next week. Huawei primarily sources display panels from domestic suppliers BOE and CSOT, so those measures won't affect the company much. However, with it being unable to receive DRAM chips and NAND flash chips from Samsung and HK Hynix, it's smartphone business is facing a life-threatening situation. </p>
<p> It's a win-lose situation for Samsung </p>
<p> If there's a company that could benefit from the current situation of Samsung being unable to supply semiconductor chips and display panels to Huawei, then it's Samsung. The two companies compete directly in several industries, including smartphones and telecommunications. </p>
<p> Samsung's network business is already flourishing because of the US sanctions on Huawei. It recently bagged a whopping $6.6 billion equipment contract from Verizon. On the other hand, all major countries are shutting the doors on Huawei. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, troubles for the Chinese company's smartphone business is also a blessing in disguise for Samsung. Its semiconductor and display manufacturing arms may lose some business, but they could look to increase sales to other customers such as Apple, Oppo, and Vivo. </p>

<p> Samsung & HK Hynix To Stop Selling Chips To Huawei </p>
<p> In the latest blow to Huawei, South Korean chip manufacturers Samsung and HK Hynix will reportedly cease all trades with the Chinese company beginning next week. This comes after the US Department of Commerce last month announced an amendment to the trade restrictions it imposed on Huawei back in May. </p>
<p> According to reports from various Korean news outlets, the companies will suspend trade on September 15th. That's when the new set of rules come into effect. The rules bar any American or non-American company that uses a US-origin software or technology from selling components to Huawei. Any such trade would require the companies to obtain special approval from the American government. </p>
<p> TSMC has reportedly already suspended trades with Huawei following the first round of restrictions in May. With Samsung and HK Hynix also now forced to stop selling components to the Chinese giant, it poses a serious threat to the company's smartphone business. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei will now have little-to-no options for securing DRAM and NAND flash memory chips. It may no longer be able to make its Kirin chipsets for smartphones. Domestic semiconductor company SMIC could have been an alternative supplier for Huawei. However, the Trump Administration has threatened to put SMIC in the Entity List as well. The largest Chinese semiconductor foundry company recently secured an investement from the nation's state-backed investors. </p>
<p> Huawei does have a long-term plan to become self-sufficient in the software department, including the Harmony OS and Huawei Mobile Services (HMS). However, it's immediate survival is now under threat because of a string of trade restrictions by the US government since May last year. The company is already expecting a steep decline in smartphone sales next year. </p>
<p> Not just Huawei, but Samsung and HK Hynix lose too </p>
<p> Trade restrictions on Huawei affect the business of its suppliers as well. The Chinese giant recently rose to the top spot in the list of the largest smartphone vendors in the world. It overthrew Samsung from the top spot as the latter struggled to move units off the shelves during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While Huawei's troubles are beneficial for Samsung, it is also a considerable loss for the Korean company's semiconductor arm. Huawei had emerged as one of its biggest memory chip clients in recent years. </p>
<p> HK Hynix is probably a bigger loser of the two. It is sort of a win-lose situation for Samsung but not for the other Korean semiconductor company. More than 40-percent of its sales in the first half of 2020 reportedly occurred in China, with Huawei being a major customer. </p>
<p> The US-China trade war isn't showing any signs of slackening in the near future. It remains to be seen how Huawei copes with it. </p>

<p> Samsung Internet Browser 13 Goes Live With Updated One UI 3.0 Design </p>
<p> As per the latest development, Samsung Internet Browser 13 update is now rolling out for all the users. Notably, the update brings new One UI 3.0 design elements, and an updated Chromium engine. </p>
<p> Samsung Internet Browser is one of the best Android internet browsers. Well, those of you who own a Samsung Galaxy device would be more familiar with this one. </p>
<p> Basically, it combines the Chromium web engine with a customizable user interface and some extension support. The company has been adding new features to the Samsung Internet Browser regularly. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In fact, the latest update that the browser received was in June. And now, a new update is live for the users that brings some notable design changes and core engine upgrade. </p>
<p> Talking about the core engine update, the internal Chromium engine is now updated from v79 to v83. Meaning that users will have the advantage of all the new APIs and security fixes available with Chrome 80, 81, 82, and 83. </p>
<p> Moreover, the Samsung Internet Browser now also supports Web Share API Level 2. This API allows web apps to send files to native Android apps. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> New APIs for extensions are also included like webRequest, which is basically used by ad-blockers or content blockers. Apart from this core engine upgrade, new design elements are also visible with Samsung Internet Browser 13. </p>
<p> Samsung Internet Browser 13 update brings One UI 3.0 design elements </p>
<p> After installing the new Samsung Internet Browser 13 update, once the user adds a Bookmark, a new Edit button will show up on the confirmation page. </p>
<p> This would enable the user to quickly change the title and other details of the Bookmark. For tablets, the corners of the tab are now more rounded to give it a modern appeal. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Moreover, the bottom action bar is also getting an upgrade with One UI 3.0 design elements. There are some new settings options as well, that users can tweak. </p>
<p> Additionally, the permissions request notification is also getting a new user interface. The permission notification now also shows the entire warning message, if you visit a malicious website. </p>
<p> Some other nifty changes include double tap to Play/Pause online videos, new grid view tabs, smart Anti-Tracking, etc. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Apparently, users of Samsung Internet Browser 13 will be able to enable high contrast mode at the same time as the dark mode. Besides, there is a new option where users can also hide the status bar while scrolling. </p>
<p> The updated version of the Internet Browser is specifically v13.0.1.44 and is rolling out for all the non-beta users via the Google Play Store and Samsung Galaxy Apps Store. </p>

<p> Samsung & LG To Stop Supplying Display Panels To Huawei </p>
<p> Ever since placing Huawei on the Entity List last year, the US Department of Commerce has been tightening its trade restrictions on the Chinese giant with several amendments to the rules. The latest of them was announced last month and its starting to affect Huawei now. </p>
<p> According to recent reports coming from Korea, Samsung Display and LG Display will stop supplying mobile display panels to Huawei. This is the latest in a string of blows to the beleaguered Chinese conglomerate. Reports earlier this week said Samsung and HK Hynix will suspend chip trades with the company on September 15th. </p>
<p> The new set of rules defined by the US Department of Commerce come into effect next week. That's when the display manufacturing arms of Samsung and LG are likely to cease trades with Huawei. The new rules ban any American or non-American company from selling components that use a US-origin software or technology to Huawei. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Since display panels made by Samsung Display and LG Display use certain chips that are based on American technologies, both companies cannot supply those panels to the Chinese company unless they get special approval from the American government. </p>
<p> Huawei used Samsung's OLED panels on its select flagship smartphones. Most recently, the company used OLED panels from Samsung Display on the P40 Pro+. The vanilla P40 Pro, on the other hand, used screens from LG, Samsung, and BOE. The Huawei P30 series also used Samsung OLED panels. </p>
<p> While Huawei will be able to continue sourcing OLED screens from Chinese suppliers such as BOE and CSOT, it'll miss out on Samsung's superior quality. This still isn't as worse a piece of news for Huawei as the chip restrictions, which threaten the survival of the company's smartphone business. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung Display, LG Display To Suspend Trades With Huawei </p>
<p> Huawei has emerged as Samsung's main rival in the smartphone industry. So troubles for the Chinese company are often good news for the South Korean giant, even if it means loss of business for one of its arms. And this time around, it isn't much big of a loss as Huawei isn't the company's biggest OLED customer. Apple is a major customer of Samsung Display's OLED screens. </p>
<p> The impact of this ban will be minimal on LG Display's business as well. In a statement to Reuters, the company said it has limited panel shipments to Huawei. The company still plans to diversify its customer base in the future. Samsung declined to a request for comment. </p>

<p> Samsung May Sell A More Powerful 'Galaxy Tab A' Tablet For 2020 </p>
<p> Samsung could be on the verge of releasing an even more powerful Galaxy Tab A mid-range Android tablet in 2020. That's based on a recently spotted benchmark from back in May, showcases a device with the model number SM-T575. </p>
<p> The model designation here may seem familiar to some Samsung fans. And that could be because it falls between two other Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablets. That's the newest Galaxy Tab A 8.4 — SM-T307 — and the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1-inch tablet from 2019 — SMT510. </p>
<p> The specifications that are detailed for this Android 10-powered slate should be fairly familiar too. For starters, it packs an identically-specced battery at a capacity of 5,000mAh. The overall size of the gadget isn't listed in the benchmark but that could point to a similarly-sized display panel at 8.4-inches. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This Samsung Galaxy Tab A would be much more powerful </p>
<p> Those specs, however, are where the similarities would seem to end. It's possible and even likely that both Wi-Fi and LTE variants will be made available. That was the case with previous Samsung Galaxy Tab A devices too. But this new Galaxy Tab A, presumably planned for 2020, would be much more powerful. </p>
<p> That isn't just because it shows in the benchmark with 4GB of RAM either. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.4 released earlier this year only had 3GB. The newest entry into the benchmarks also packs a flagship SoC from 2018. That's Samsung's in-house Exynos 9810 SoC. </p>
<p> That chip is a 2nd Gen 10nm FinFET chipset. Samsung packs it with eight cores with 64-bit support. Four of those cores, Exynos M3 cores, are clocked at 2.9GHz. The remaining four, ARM Cortex-A55 cores, are built for efficiency and run at 1.9GHz. That's actually comparable but slightly better on paper, than Qualcomm's equivalent Snapdragon 845 SoC. The latter chip packs four Kyro 385 cores at 2.8GHz and four more of the same at 1.7GHz. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Perhaps more importantly, this chipset will easily outperform the in-house-built Exynos 7904 powering the abovementioned 2020 tablet. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.4 is powered by two Cortex-A73 cores clocked at up to 1.8 GHz. The chip packs those in alongside a total of six power-efficient Cortex-A53 cores. The latter cores are only slightly underclocked to at up to 1.6 GHz. </p>
<p> Will Samsung actually release this device? </p>
<p> Now, benchmarks are a great way to look at the performance of underlying hardware with a pinch of standardization. But they aren't the end-all when it comes to accuracy. In fact, as often as not, benchmarks display specifications that are not accurate at all. That's because both day-to-day uploaders and the company can easily fudge the figures and readings. </p>
<p> They can include incorrect memory and performance readouts. But also incorrect model designations. Companies also often use benchmarks for testing under wraps because the figures can be manipulated. Here, that comes with several implications that aren't necessarily likely but also aren't impossible. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So everybody is going to have to wait to see whether this device ever makes its way to market at all. Let alone with everything as tested. Samsung may have no intention of doing so. Or the South Korean tech giant could as easily be testing the device itself with no real guarantee of accuracy in the benchmark readouts. </p>

<p> Samsung's latest growth strategy in the United Kingdom hasn't exactly been trying to embody elegance. Or anything of the sort, really. But the sheer volume of opportunities you now have to exchange your relatively new Huawei handset for a Samsung one is getting pretty difficult to ignore. </p>
<p> Especially given how much quicker virtually any existing Huawei handset, no matter how luxurious, is currently losing value given the fact itts manufacturer probably won't be pursuing security updates the moment it can once again access a contemporary Android license, including the entirety of the Play Store and countless services composing the core of today's Android mobile experience. </p>
<p> As illustrated by one of Samsung's many ads currently making the rounds on British social media, getting rid of something akin to the Huawei P30 Pro has never really been easier. Because between Huawei's struggles to deliver the very basics of what Android devices require (including a convenient charging adapter). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei is still doing what it can to push out much more painstakingly assembled lines of code, though it's unsurprising that the overall idea was to ty patches often enough for its handsets to maintain something resembling relevance, it's a pretty good time to be leading a British division of the world's largest handset manufacturer. </p>
<p> Samsung is all about collecting those British pounds now </p>
<p> But anyway, what could possibly illustrate that state of affairs better than a couple of intelligently positioned devices? Products meant to maximize the current constrast in appeal between Huawei's and Google's portfolio. For xample, the Galaxy Note 20 is currently available for purchase with as much as £349.99 off its base price of £949.99 if you trade a Huawei P30 Pro in exchange, as Samsung began teasing earlier today. </p>
<p> Switch to a Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra and get up to £350* off when you trade in your old Huawei. Purchase from Samsung Shop Online before 08/11/20. £350 trade in value is for Huawei P30 Pro device. T&Cs apply </p>
<p> The offer itself, originally launched on Monday, is so far planned to run through November 8th. And, of course, the catch for British consumers is that they can only take advantage of this promotion by going directly to Samsung. All things considered, Samsung pursuing Brexiters and trying t0 produce as many Huawei P30s… well, this is becoming quite familiar as the page is already listing all of the available rounds for the. Something that Finlad isn't really even trying to hide any longer. </p>

<p> Samsung Is Reportedly In Talks With LG For LCD Display Panels </p>
<p> Samsung is reportedly in discussions with rival LG Display in a bid to buy LCD panels. The former company is seeking to buy the panels from the latter, according to industry insiders. Samsung is also in talks with China Star Optoelectronics Technology, BOE Technology Group, and Sharp Corp, the reports indicate. But it hasn't managed to strike a deal with any of those companies just yet. </p>
<p> Samsung's decision to take its time on any deals pertaining to LCD panels isn't entirely surprising either. Analysts have reportedly valued a potential deal between Samsung and LG at over $833 million. While that doesn't represent even half of one percent of Samsung's yearly revenue, it is a sizable figure. </p>
<p> Why is Samsung looking to buy LCD panels from LG? </p>
<p> As to the reason behind Samsung's alleged move, the decision isn't altogether surprising either. The company will soon cease production on LCD displays altogether. That comes as part of Samsung's shift toward QLED panels. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Short for Quantum Dot LED, QLED is a variation on LCD panels that effectively adds a quantum dot film between layers. That, in turn, allows a higher brightness and contrast. The response time of QLED isn't as good compared to OLED panels. But the displays are also more affordable. That's helped drive the popularization of televisions made with the technology. </p>
<p> As part of that move, Samsung will reportedly cease all production on LCD panels by the end of the year. But that doesn't mean it wants to stop selling LCD-based technologies. It just means that Samsung is downsizing its own operations on that front in anticipation of killing them off entirely at some point in the future. </p>
<p> It also makes some sense for LG Display to be the partner-of-choice here too. Although the companies are rivals, LG has pulled Samsung out of the fire in the past on display technology. Most notably, LG came in to supply displays to Samsung after Sharp stopped supplying them back in 2017. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Diminishing returns are driving this </p>
<p> Ultimately, Samsung's decision to move away from LCD panels is the result of diminishing returns. Its return-on-investment for LCD displays has dropped substantially over the past several years. And, in fact, their demise has been a long time coming. Samsung first started formulating its exit from the market back in 2016. </p>

<p> Samsung / Samsung Trolls Apple's Decision To Remove Chargers From iPhone 12 Boxes </p>
<p> Samsung Trolls Apple's Decision To Remove Chargers From iPhone 12 Boxes </p>
<p> Samsung in a recent post has mocked (guess who!) Apple, and this time around, it is for not including the charger with its latest flagship iPhone 12 series phone. </p>
<p> Well, it was mocked a lot when Apple removed the 3.5 mm jack from the smartphone. Soon after Apple ditched the 3.5mm jack, all other smartphone manufacturers including Samsung followed suit. </p>
<p> But it gave rise to a new truly wireless Bluetooth earbuds market. And is no hidden fact that there are tons of players in this category. New and already established companies are into this true wireless earbuds market. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Apple introduced four models of the iPhone 12, i.e. the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. In terms of features, the devices are more or less similar to last year's iPhone 11. </p>
<p> But the company announced that it will not be bundling the charging brick with any of the iPhone 12 devices. As explained by Apple, this step is taken to reduce carbon emissions. And also done to avoid the mining and use of precious materials. </p>
<p> Moreover, the company also highlighted that this move would benefit the company's shipping capabilities. As many as 70% more boxes can now be shipped on a pallet due to the reduced packaging size of the iPhone 12. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung mocked Apple in a Facebook post for not including the charger with iPhone 12 </p>
<p> In an official Facebook post, Samsung took a dig at Apple for this decision of not including basic things like chargers. The post reads, "Your #Galaxy does give you what you are looking for. From the most basic as a charger, to the best camera, battery, performance, memory, and even 120Hz screen on a smartphone." </p>
<p> Well, this is not something new, as in the past, Samsung has mocked Apple several times. Who could forget the jibe taken against Apple's decision of including that big fat notch? </p>
<p> However, a good thing for Apple is that other Android manufacturers always follow what Apple has done. Although Samsung did not follow Apple in implementing notch for its devices, it surely got rid of the 3.5mm jack. Which was the move first taken by Apple. </p>

<p> Sensibly thinking, take the scenario of buying a car. You do not purchase only the body of the car and then buy other parts separately like the tire, set of wheels, steering, etc. It comes as a package. </p>
<p> Here, by not including the charger, Apple has literally taken off one of the most important things that first-time buyers of Apple iPhone would need. </p>
<p> Every year there is a huge set of people that migrate from Android to Apple, just to experience the iOS ecosystem. But now without the charger in the iPhone 12 retail box, users might have second thoughts. </p>

<p> Whatever it is, loyal Apple iPhone users will still buy the iPhone 12, charger, or no charger. In fact, soon Android OEMs will follow the same steps, for which Apple is being mocked currently. </p>

<p> Need Security For Your Car? Ring Has Some New Products For You </p>
<p> Amazon's Ring has now officially launched a range of security- and connectivity-related devices, including cameras, specially designed for a car. But these aren't just dash-style cams either, reports indicate. The suite of devices covers car alarms, car cameras, and connectivity. And they've got branding to match — dubbed the Ring Car Cam, Car Alarm, and Car Connect. </p>
<p> In fact, both Ring Car Cam and Alarm are built to take advantage of the new Ring Car Connect platform. The platform effectively integrates those devices with the rest of the Ring ecosystem. But those aren't the only devices slated to work on the platform at all. </p>
<p> The company has additionally announced a partnership with Tesla. So Model 3, X, S, and Y devices will be able to integrate with Ring's other devices, as long as they have Sentry Mode enabled. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A secondary device will need to be installed first. But the finished system will allow more than just camera access. The Ring Car Connect APIs will, in the future, enable any participating car manufacturer to enable alerts for events, footage playback, and to check whether the car doors are locked. </p>
<p> Ring Car Alarm and Car Cam focus on security </p>
<p> Now, there are some differences between how Ring Car Alarm and Car Cam connect to provide vehicular security. The Ring Car Alarm, for instance, connects via Amazon's Sidewalk network, set to launch later in 2020. Car Cam utilizes Wi-Fi or LTE. And that makes sense, these are two very different devices with very different functionality. </p>
<p> To begin with, Ring Car Cam is a dashboard camera that has a camera pointed both outward and inward. The camera is packed with sensors to send alerts for break-ins, towing, and accidents too. And users can access the camera feeds at a distance, just as with Ring's smart home cameras. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Moreover, Ring Car Cam can automatically detect a "serious crash" and send notice to first responders. That's in addition to features that allow users to say "Alexa, I'm being pulled over" and have the camera record and save the footage to the cloud. Conversely, Ring Car Cam features a physical camera shutter. And users will be able to disable both or either interior or exterior feeds and recording. </p>
<p> The Car Alarm from Ring goes a different route. It still detects break-ins, towing, or if the vehicle suffers an impact — whether the car is being driven at the time or not. But it's siren-enabled so that users can either remotely set off the alarm or have it go off automatically when needed. And integration with the Ring and Alexa ecosystems means users can get audible alerts too when any of those things happen. </p>
<p> The Ring Car Alarm is plugged into the vehicle's OBD-II diagnostic port. So there isn't any messy installation either. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pricing and availability </p>
<p> Pricing for Ring Car Connect hasn't been reported as of this writing. But the Ring division of Amazon has detailed the information for its Car Alarm and Car Cam. The former device will cost $199.99. Car Alarm will be much less pricey at just $59.99. Each of the devices is slated for release sometime next year. </p>

<p> Senate To Vote On Whether To Subpoena Twitter CEO Over Biden Story </p>
<p> Senate Republicans want to subpoena Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey after the company blocked a New York Post Story about Joe Biden. As reported by Engadget, Twitter blocked the story as it violated its rules on doxxing and hacked materials. </p>
<p> Twitter's ability to crackdown on misinformation and other posts that violate its policy has grown over the past few months. A new 'birdwatch' feature is designed to help curb the spread of misinformation through contributors notes. </p>
<p> The company has also added labels to make people think twice about retweeting disputed information. All of this work has got them into trouble with politicians before with both sides criticizing the company's handling of sensitive posts. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Senator Ted Cruz has made a video calling for Twitter CEO to be subpoenaed. He accuses the company of "actively interfering in this election". </p>
<p> Twitter CEO attacked over decision to block Biden story </p>
<p> Senate officials will vote next week over whether to subpoena Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey over the company's decisions to block a story about Joe Biden. Facebook has also limited the article's spread so Republicans want answers from the company too. </p>
<p> Twitter claims it blocked that articles because it violated its policies. It points to the article containing “personal and private information — like email addresses and phone numbers". </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This looks like the main reason the company blocked the report. However, this has angered Republicans as they claim Twitter has interfered in the upcoming election. </p>
<p> Alongside the video, Ted Cruz has also sent a letter to the Twitter CEO demanding answers over the company’s decision. </p>
<p> Republicans have also made attempts to try and share the story whilst skirting the blocks Twitter imposed. H ouse Judiciary Committee RepublicansRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) have published the article on their websites. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> They hope to share the story more broadly in order to give it the publicity they feel it deserves. The article itself claims to be a 'smoking gun' containing emails from Biden and Biden's son's laptops. </p>
<p> Some experts have called into question the authenticity of the report and the material contained within. Biden has also denied some the allegations made in the story. </p>
<p> The messy situation has led to some calls to revoke protections that internet platforms have under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tensions are clearly running high prior to the election in just a few weeks time. Flashpoints like this appear to be inevitable but are no less concerning social media platforms when they do occur. </p>

<p> Seven BlackBerry KEY2 Video Tutorials Appear On YouTube </p>
<p> BlackBerry has released seven new KEY2 video tutorials via its official YouTube channel, following the ‘Tour & Device Walkthrough’ video which surfaced quite recently. The BlackBerry KEY2 is the company’s new handset which was announced last month, and which comes with a full QWERTY keyboard. The company actually improved this phone quite a bit compared to the BlackBerry KEYone which was announced last year, and now it’s trying to get you started with the device. Some of the video tutorials that BlackBerry released are quite basic, while others may actually help you. </p>
<p> All of these video tutorials start with words ‘How To’, and they will show you how to take a screenshot, change ringtones, change a wallpaper, install SIM & SD card(s), assign keyboard shortcuts, setup fingerprint scanner, and power up the device. As you can see, some of these video tutorials are quite basic, but one, in particular, is quite interesting, especially if you haven’t used the KEY2 thus far, and are not all that familiar with the phone. The ‘How To Assign Keyboard Shortcuts’ video tutorial will show you how to bind shortcuts for basically any letter on the KEY2’s keyboard. The BlackBerry KEY2 comes with a special shortcut key, which can be used as sort of a function button. If you press that key, and a letter on the keyboard, you will be able to launch an app that is assigned to that letter. Having said that, both short and long key presses are available, so you can basically set up over 50 custom shortcuts. For example, if you press the shortcut key and then hit the letter ‘P’, you will be able to assign something for that letter, launching of the Google Photos app, for example. Next time you do the same thing, the phone will launch Google Photos, it’s as simple as that. </p>
<p> You can do that very same thing from the settings menu, just navigate to ‘Shortcuts & Gestures’, hit ‘Keyboard Shortcuts’, select a letter, and then assign a shortcut to that letter. This video, along with the other six we’ve mentioned, are all embedded down below for your convenience, just in case, you’d like to check them out. We’ve already published the BlackBerry KEY2 camera review, if you’d like to check it out, while the full BlackBerry KEY2 review is coming soon. </p>

<p> Share Your Alexa Routines Via An Easy To Create Link </p>
<p> Amazon has now enabled a new piece of UI in the Alexa app that allows users to share Routines with a straightforward link. That's according to recent reports following an official announcement from Amazon. </p>
<p> For clarity, Routines are sets of instructions carried out by Alexa all at once with a single command. Or when conditions for the Routine are met. For instance, users might have an Alexa Routine set up that turns on exterior lights at a certain time of day. Or they might have a morning Alexa Routine that turns on the coffee maker and the bathroom lights. </p>
<p> Now, users can set up their Routines as normal. But they'll also be able to share those, making the AI features much more accessible. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So you want to share Alexa Routines via link? </p>
<p> Sharing routines with a link — or using one — is a fairly simple process for Alexa users. In fact, each only takes a few steps to accomplish. </p>
<p> To share an Alexa Routine; </p>
<p> Open the Alexa app </p>
<p> Navigate to Routines via the menu icon in the top-left corner of the UI </p>
<p> Select an Alexa Routine, or create and then select an Alexa Routine </p>
<p> Choose to share the Alexa Routine by text, email, or social media </p>
<p> The Alexa app will create the link and share it via that method </p>
<p> To use Alexa Routines received through a link; </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Select the shared link on a mobile device with the Alexa app installed </p>
<p> Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the Alexa Routine </p>
<p> For the set-up process, users will be presented with options that are shown in a yellow-colored string of text. Those are optional fields. So, for example, users might be able to choose specific smart devices the Routine will interact with via those fields. </p>
<p> How might this be useful? </p>
<p> The most obvious use case for shareable Routines isn't difficult to ascertain. Namely, this will allow tech-savvy users to share complex sets of instructions with other users who may not be as well-versed in the technology. For example, users might set one up that turns up the lights, delivers a medication reminder, and then plays the most recent news on a smart speaker. That type of routine might be particularly useful to an elder family member. </p>
<p> With the update, users will be able to create those routines and then simply send them over. And that should drastically cut down on the complications involved in setting up a routine. </p>

<p> Upcoming Skyboxe Hub 4G Gets FCC Certified, Launch Imminent </p>
<p> In July last year, Florida-based Skyboxe announced to launch a first-of-its-kind device in Q1 2020. As per the official website, the company pushed the launch into the fall of 2020 without mentioning any reason. Nevertheless, the Skyboxe Hub 4G is now certified by the FCC for the US launch. </p>
<p> The Skyboxe Hub 4G is an all-in-one device combing the Android TV box and Wi-Fi Router. Instead of using broadband via an internet service provider, the device offers internet connectivity with a 4G LTE connection. By the time of its official launch, Skyboxe will partner with one of the biggest carriers in the US. </p>
<p> All-in-one Skyboxe Hub 4G to launch in fall 2020 </p>
<p> As of now, there is no mention of the exact launch date. Instead of just selling hardware, the company will be offering Skyboxe Hub 4G and its service as a package. Apart from an internet connection, the company will also provide local digital TV channels with over-the-air antenna technology. Additionally, these local channels can be watched for free. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Furthermore, it comes loaded with Android TV OS for accessing all the smart TV features like streaming Netflix and Prime Video. The company says this new device is designed for cord-cutters and remote workers. With the FCC certification, Skyboxe will start testing it with the carrier partners. The data service plan pricing will be announced at a later date </p>
<p> While the current-gen Skyboxe Hub comes with 4G LTE support, the company also mentioned bringing an upgraded version with 5G support in the future. As of now, we don't know how the company could pull all features with just an LTE connection. Moreover, 4G internet plans are also costlier than broadband plans. </p>
<p> The company also plans to launch a 5G TV box in the future </p>
<p> As per the Opensignal's Mobile Network Experience Report January 2020, AT&T had the fastest LTE download speed of 29.1 Mbps among the four big US carriers. In comparison, the average download speed of fixed broadband connections is around 135 Mbps, according to Speedtest.net. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the LTE connection is good enough for basic tasks, it won't be able to offer the same experience as a broadband connection for streaming 4K content or playing multiplayer games. However, this could change when 4G will eventually get replaced by 5G. </p>
<p> Currently, the average 5G download speed in the US is just 50.9 Mbps. With 5G gradually becoming widespread, there should also be improvements in the 5G speeds. </p>

<p> Are Smartphone Advancements Behind Evolving Mobile Gaming Trends? </p>
<p> Throughout the 21st century, mobile gaming has become more popular than ever before. While there are many factors behind this remote emergence, the importance of both hardware and software developments within modern-day smartphones can’t be overlooked. This advanced approach to the phone market has undoubtedly modified the pre-existing gaming habits of mobile players. So, let’s take a look at why technological advancements have altered the outlook of smartphone gaming. </p>
<p> A Future of Console-Like Releases </p>
<p> The 2010s were a breakthrough era for the rise of mobile gaming. Advancements in game development and mobile creation became intertwined to form a console-like experience that had never before been possible on phones. According to a report by Ranker, as of October 13th, PUBG Mobile and Call of Duty: Mobile rank second and third respectively regarding the market’s most popular mobile titles. The two open-world shooters are behind Among Us, which first made a name for itself on PC following its release in June 2018. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In years gone by, effectively optimizing high-spec titles onto the mobile market was a troubling task for developers. While the likes of Call of Duty: World at War: Zombies and Minecraft became available during the late 2000s and early 2010s, neither elevated the phone market to competitive heights. This contrasts the games listed above. Following the release of the aforementioned battle royale shooters in 2019, the smartphone sector accounted for almost 60 per cent of the global gaming revenue in the same year, as per Mobile Marketer. </p>
<p> Due to smartphones now possessing long-lasting batteries and greater RAM than many laptops, their scope for further console-like releases continues to grow. Valorant, for example, could the latest to hit the mobile market, with the game’s developers previously showing interest in diversifying their content. It’s a testament to the title’s popularity that Valorant eSports has reached new heights following its release, with fans of the Riot development able to get the latest Valorant news at platforms such as Win.gg. This includes competition results, upcoming schedules, and in-game guides for those seeking to better their performances. </p>
<p> Is It a Case of Out with the Old and In with the New? </p>
<p> When mobile gaming first came to the forefront during the mid-2000s, the sector’s appeal revolved around its accessibility. While, of course, that remains an integral part of the market’s attraction, the style of the games that prospective players are now immersing themselves in has changed significantly. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Throughout the last decade, first-person shooters and open-world battle royales weren’t always the go-to genre. As per Business Insider, the most popular mobile titles during the 2010s were typically casual arcade games that required no long-term strategy. Subway Surfers, for example, topped the charts between 2010 and 2019 with around 1.5 billion downloads. </p>
<p> Although there’s nothing to suggest that hyper-casual games are on the way out due to the rise of console-like titles, there’s an undeniable correlation between smartphone advancements and evolving gaming trends. In fact, it appears that both genres can coexist successfully. SLA state that the total number of hyper-casual game downloads in 2019 sat at approximately 630 million. Moreover, it also generated £40.6 million in in-game sales. </p>
<p> A Varied Market Can Only Be a Positive </p>
<p> At the time of writing, the smartphone gaming sector has never been more lucrative. Although modern-day developers have enabled the market to reach new audiences, the sustained popularity of hyper-casual titles has continued on high-spec phones. With both new and old able to work together, the coming years could see the mobile gaming industry reach unprecedented levels of success, especially if hardware and software improvements continue to be made. </p>

<p> SMIC Now Asks The US For Permission To Supply Chips To Huawei </p>
<p> China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) has asked for approval from the US to continue supplying semiconductor chips to Huawei. The company is barred from supplying chips to Huawei, effective last Tuesday, September 15. </p>
<p> That's when the latest amendments to the US-imposed trade restrictions on the Chinese electronics giant go into effect. The new rules ban companies around the world from supplying intellectual property, products, or components that make use of American software, technology, or anything remotely American in the manufacture, to Huawei. </p>
<p> Any such company wanting to continue doing business with the Chinese behemoth would require to obtain a special license fro the US government. Several major chipmakers including Samsung, HK Hynix, Qualcomm, MediaTek, and SMIC have been affected by these restrictions. While all of these companies have applied for the license, the US Department of Commerce is yet to issue one to any of them. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's little chance any of them will get either. After all, Huawei has been the Trump administration's tactical stick to defeat China in an ever-growing trade war between the world's two most powerful economies. The fact that one Chinese company requires US permission to do business with another Chinese company speaks volumes about the importance of this tactical stick for the US. </p>
<p> "SMIC is committed to compliance with all applicable US export regulations and the intentions of the relevant governmental agencies. To that end, we have submitted to BIS export license applications covering several Huawei products," an SMIC spokesperson told CGTN. </p>
<p> SMIC asks US permission to continue supplying chips to Huawei </p>
<p> Huawei's troubles began back in May 2019 when the US Department of Commerce put the company in its Entity List. The string of restrictions imposed since now threatens the very survival of the company's smartphone business. It is struggling to acquire components to produce chipsets for its upcoming smartphones. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), one of Huawei's major chip suppliers, said in July that it would cease business with the company after the September 15 deadline. It's unclear if the company has applied for the license or not. </p>
<p> SMIC, meanwhile, has applied for the licence but it's unlikely to get the approval. Even if it does, SMIC's most advanced smartphone chips are based on 14nm process. On the other hand, Samsung, Qualcomm, and TSMC are all now ready to mass produce 5nm chips. </p>
<p> So Huawei still won't be able to acquire cutting-edge chips from SMIC for its upcoming crop ofsmartphones. On top of that, the US government has threatened to put SMIC in the Entity List as well. The largest Chinese semiconductor foundry company earlier this year secured a $2.25 billion investement from the nation's state-backed investors. </p>

<p> Snapchat Users Can Finally Send Music Along With Snaps </p>
<p> Snapchat has finally allowed users to send music with their snaps on the platform. As reported by Engadget, this move has been a long time coming and brings the app more in line with Instagram and TikTok. </p>
<p> Snapchat rarely adds significant new features to the platform. The company generally seems more content to stick with the tried and tested formula rather than change things up. The only changes we generally see are additions like voter awareness tools and other relevant innovations. </p>
<p> We first heard of this new feature back in August, Snapchat promised to bring the innovation to us in the fall. It appears to have kept that promise with it now rolling out to users. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Snapchat introduces 'Sounds' feature </p>
<p> Snapchat has named the feature 'sounds' which will allow users to send music along with their snaps. The feature further brings Snapchat into line with the likes of Instagram and TikTok. </p>
<p> Essentially, this feature allows users to add songs that will play alongside their posts. This is something that users have cried out for now for a while but only now has Snapchat delivered. </p>
<p> The feature operates in a very similar way to Instagram’s music feature. This is hardly surprising given that this looks to be a move to try move in on what TikTok has been doing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Right now, there are only a few tracks available. Although, one of them is a new Justin Bieber claiming to be a 'Snapchat exclusive'. It will be interesting if this idea of exclusive songs to social media platforms is something that will continue as more platforms gain this type of functionality. </p>
<p> For now, the music choice on Snapchat is way less exhaustive compared to Instagram or TikTok. However, the company claims to have struck a number of multi-year deals with labels. This means the catalog should grow substantially in the near future. </p>
<p> At the moment it looks as if the feature has rolled out to all iOS users. However, there has been no word on the status for Android. Not great news for us non-iPhone users but hopefully this will be resolved in the near future. </p>

<p> In other news, Snapchat is also working on a new feature that will allow users to add their own audio to snaps. Again this is another innovation that seems rather TikTok-like as it looks like Snapchat wants to muscle in on their success. The company says that this new feature will be available "in the coming months". </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Sony Confirms Which PS4 Games Are Backwards Compatible On PS5 </p>
<p> Sony Confirms Which PS4 Games Are Backwards Compatible On PS5 </p>
<p> Sony today revealed which PS4 games are going to be backwards compatible on the PS5. And which ones won't be. </p>
<p> In regards to the former, Sony said that it would be a very large list. And Sony meant it. Nearly all PS4 games are going to be backwards compatible on the PS5. </p>
<p> Which means you can take your entire library of games with you over to the new console. Or, almost your entire library of games. If you have any of the ones that aren't backwards compatible, then you'll need to keep playing those on the PS4. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> 99-percent of PS4 games will be backwards compatible on PS5 </p>
<p> A large list is a large list. In this particular case, 99-percent of the games from PS4 will work on the PS5. </p>
<p> It's not quite the backwards compatibility that some were hoping for. As there are still a number of consumers that want the PS5 to play PS3, PS2, and PS1 games. Technically, they will. But only if they've been ported into the PlayStation Store as a PSN game or if they're available on PS Now. </p>
<p> The PS5 won't actually be backwards compatible with games from those systems though. And that unfortunately means you can't insert the discs from them into the console's Blu-ray drive. If you have the disc model to begin with. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the PS4 games though, you're golden, and you should be able to download them digitally as well if that's where the bulk of your game library is. But what about the PS4 games that aren't compatible? There's only a very small amount of them. </p>
<p> Just ten games won't be backwards compatible </p>
<p> Sony is only leaving behind a total of ten games from the PS4 era. That's as many games as you have fingers. </p>
<p> All of them also seem to be smaller games rather than big budget AAA games or popular indie titles too. Chances are Sony found that the games weren't that popular or being played that much. Or maybe there's another reason entirely why they weren't added along with all other games. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The games that aren't backwards compatible are Shadow Complex Remastered, Hitman Go, Afro Samurai 2 Revenge Of Kuma Volume One, DWVR, TT Isle Of Man – Ride On The Edge 2, Just Deal With It!, Robinson: The Journey, We Sing, Shadwen, and Joe's Diner. </p>
<p> Surely there are some people out there that loved these games. But, as you can see, it's less likely that people are going to be heartbroken about not being able to play these on the PS5 once it launches. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Sony PS5: Release Date, Specs, Design, Price & More – Updated Oct. 16 2020 </p>
<p> Sony PS5: Release Date, Specs, Design, Price & More – Updated Oct. 16 2020 </p>
<p> The PlayStation 5, referred to by most as the PS5, is Sony's next-gen console headed to store shelves and doorsteps (for those that secured pre-orders) later this year. </p>
<p> There are still some things that are unknown about the PS5, such as what the UI looks like, whether or not your PS Plus subscription will carry over, and how many games will be available for the console by year's end. But for the most part everything that could be outed about the console has been made officially public by Sony. </p>
<p> In this guide we'll break down everything there is to know about the PS5, at least in regards to what information is currently out there. Which is quite a bit at this point. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When does the PS5 launch? </p>
<p> The PS5 will release on November 12 in the US and a few other global regions. This includes Mexico, South Korea, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The rest of the world will be able to purchase it on November 19. </p>
<p> The console is currently available for pre-order at various retail partners, and direct from Sony. However it's unlikely that there's any stock left of the console as many retailers sold out within 20 minutes of the pre-orders going live. </p>
<p> Some retailers may get more stock though prior to the console's release date. Most retailers will also have stock of the PS5 on-hand for release day so there will still be chances to get the console on the day that it comes out. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How much does the PS5 cost? </p>
<p> That cost of the console depends on which version of it you buy. There will be two versions of the PS5. </p>
<p> There's the standard PS5, and then the PS5 Digital Edition that doesn't come with a disc drive. If you go for the PS5, then it retails for $499. If you decide on the PS5 Digital Edition then you'll end up paying $399. </p>
<p> This is of course assuming you don't spend any extra money on games or additional accessories. Which many consumers are sure to do. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What do you get with the console? </p>
<p> Inside the box you'll get the console itself, your power adapter and cable, one DualSense controller, an HDMI cable, and a copy of Astro's Playroom. </p>
<p> Since there aren't any bundles of the console that have been produced yet, the contents of the package will be just the basics. Anything you want on top of these things has to be purchased separately. </p>
<p> What accessories are there for the PS5? </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> From Sony there are a handful. And they're all available for pre-order right now alongside the console. Though, the accessories are probably still in stock where the PS5 is not at this time. </p>
<p> In regards to the Sony accessories, there's the HD Camera, the additional DualSense controllers, the Pulse 3D wireless headset, the Media Remote, and the DualSense charging dock. </p>
<p> All of these can be found at various retail partners including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and more. There are also going to be accessories available from other brands. Such as SteelSeries with its new Arctis 9 wireless headset that is designed for use with both PS5 and PC. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What games are available for the PS5 at launch? </p>
<p> There will be a small number of games available to play on the PS5 on launch day, but throughout the rest of the year and the beginning of next year there will be more released in Sony's "launch window," which is still technically considered launch by the company. </p>
<p> On release day, the PS5 will have 12 confirmed games to play. This includes Astro's Playroom, Demon's Souls, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Destruction Allstars, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition, Sackboy: A Big Adventure, Godfall, Observer: System Redux, Fortnite, Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War (technically this counts, but it officially releases on November 13), and Just Dance 2021. </p>
<p> You'll also get access to the PS Plus Collection on launch day, which has a ton of different top PS4 games in it at no cost. This includes God Of War, Final Fantasy XV, Batman: Arkham Knight, Battlefield 1, Bloodborne, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Fallout 4, Days Gone, Detroit: Become Human, Infamous Second Sun, Monster Hunter World, Persona 5, Until Dawn, Mortal Kombat X, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Ratchet and Clank, The Last Guardian, and The Last Of Us Remastered. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Other games available within the launch window include Far Cry 6, Cyberpunk 2077, Watch Dogs Legion, NBA 2K21, Override 2: Ultraman Deluxe Edition, Immortals: Fenyx Rising, and likely more. </p>
<p> There are a ton of games listed on retail sites with December 31 as the release date. So while that likely is just a place holder date for those titles, chances are they will launch soon after or sometime before and will still be considered within Sony's PS5 launch window. </p>
<p> There's also a chance that more games will be confirmed in the future as coming at some point during this time period. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What are the main features of the console? </p>
<p> The big features that Sony has been promoting are 3D sound, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers from its DualSense. All three of which are designed to immerse you into the world of whatever game you're playing as much as humanly possible on a console at this time. </p>
<p> The PS5 will also support frame rates at up to 120fps with 120fps output, 4K TV gaming with support for resolutions up to 8K (you'll need an 8K TV for that and a game which supports that resolution), a super fast SSD for quick load times, Ray Tracing, HDR technology, backwards compatibility for most PS4 games, game boost, and the ability to upgrade some of your PS4 games to digital PS5 games. </p>
<p> Many headsets should support 3D AudioTech on the PS5 at launch </p>
<p> Good news for anyone who is looking at buying the new Pulse 3D headset from Sony but may already have a headset. Sony has confirmed that many compatible headsets will support the 3D AudioTech on the PS5 at launch. </p>
<p> Which means you won't necessarily need to buy the Pulse 3D wireless headset to take advantage of one of the PS5's headlining features. </p>
<p> That should save you some money. And instead you can either actually save that money, or put it towards another game for your library. Either way, This is a big boost to anyone that already has a headset that will work for the PS5. </p>
<p> Granted, you'll still want to make sure that your headset is compatible with the 3D AudioTech. Because it may not be. Sony does mention that many players will be able to though. </p>
<p> It also notes that to experience the 3D audio, users will need to plug the headset into the console through USB, or directly into the DualSense controller. This should exclude headsets like the SteelSeries Arctis 9 which connect via a USB transmitter. In the case of headsets like this one, you should still be able to use the headset wirelessly and get the 3D Audio benefits. </p>
<p> How much will the games cost? </p>
<p> Based on pre-order listings of some of the games that are already live, it seems like the norm will start to become $70 per game. At least for the bigger titles. </p>
<p> Demon's Souls for example is $70. Chances are other big AAA titles will be the same. Though not all of them. Assassin's Creed Valhalla on PS5 is still $60 for the standard edition. The main price for many games that released during the PS4 era. </p>
<p> So pricing is going to be a mix and match here. That being said, we'll reiterate that $70 is likely to start becoming the new normal. So expect that to be the case in the future. Even if it takes a little while to get there. </p>
<p> What are the specs? </p>
<p> The PS5 is Sony's most powerful console and is a pretty big leap forward from the PS4. It comes running on eight Zen 2 3.5GHz cores with variable frequency. It's also running an AMD RDNA 2 GPU 36 clocked at 2.3GHz with 10.28 TFLOPS of power. </p>
<p> It has 16GB of GDDR6 RAM, an 825GB PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD for game storage, an NVMe SSD slot for expandable storage, and HDMI 2.1 for the display output. </p>
<p> Everything on the Digital Edition is the same, except it doesn't have the 4K UHD Blu-ray disc drive of the standard model. </p>
<p> Both models will also come with one USB-A port on the front alongside one USB-C port, two USB-A ports on the back, an ethernet port, and the console supports Wi-Fi 5. </p>
<p> Sony uses liquid metal to keep the PS5 cool during use </p>
<p> On October 7 Sony revealed the PS5's internal hardware during a teardown video. One of the biggest revelations was that Sony is using a liquid metal cooling technology to keep the console temperature down during use. </p>
<p> This should help the PS5 perform better for longer. And according to Sony it implemented this technology because it's a more long-term stable cooling tech. </p>
<p> Sony says it took them two full years to develop it. While the console itself took five years to design and develop. In addition to the liquid metal cooling tech, Sony also revealed components like the PS5's giant dual-sided intake fan. </p>
<p> And that the console has dust catchers, which you can vacuum out when they need to be cleaned. Sony also confirmed that the side panels of the console can be easily removed. Which is how you get to the dust catchers. </p>
<p> Sony gave a first-look at the console's UI, and there's lots of big improvements </p>
<p> Sony finally gave consumers a look at the PS5 UI on October 15, and it comes with some sweeping changes that are really going to make using the console an enjoyable experience. </p>
<p> Of the most notable, the PlayStation Store is completely integrated into the system. With the PS4 it was a standalone app. So when you launched it you had to pause whatever other app you were already in. You won't need to do that on the PS5. The console is also much more powerful than the PS4, which will help with the speed of moving through the store to browse for new games and other content. </p>
<p> That isn't the only big change though. The UI in general is quite a bit different from the PS4. Games and media for example are split up into their own sections on the home screen. Instead of everything just being displayed in one long rolling carousel of apps. </p>
<p> Other smaller changes include picture-in-picture mode for Game Help tips (which are also new) and shared screens of live gameplay from friends. Beyond all that there's actually quite a few new things about the UI. You can read about most of those changes in our longer post about the UI here. </p>
<p> Burger King is giving away 1,000 PS5 consoles </p>
<p> the King has his hands full. help a guy out by ordering the 2 for $5 for a chance to win a PS5™ console. </p>
<p> It's no secret that getting a hold of the PS5 during its pre-order phase has been a nightmare for some. </p>
<p> Sony had a clear plan to go live with pre-orders at a specific time, and its retail partners didn't exactly follow that plan. Fear not though. Because whether you're going to try and brave the crowds on launch day or not, there's still another way to get a hold of a PS5. </p>
<p> Burger King is officially giving away 1,000 of them to anyone that enters its recently announced contest. To enter, you need to buy a 2 for $5 combo at a participating location. </p>
<p> Rules state though, that Burger King won't be announcing the winners of the contest until after the PS5 officially launches. So if you do happen to win and get the console through this method, it unfortunately won't be showing up on launch day. </p>
<p> The minor bits </p>
<p> How big is the console? </p>
<p> It's big. By and large much bigger than any other console out there past and present. Here's a diagram below showing comparison sizes with other consoles and TV display sizes. </p>
<p> Basically, don't expect it to fit just anywhere. You may have to adjust your setup to make room for it. </p>
<p> Do I need a 4K or 8K TV to play games? </p>
<p> No. While Sony maintains that the best experiences will be available on a 4K TV (on its 8K TVs once they're available, though they won't be cheap), you can play your PS5 games on a 1080p TV or monitor if that's what you have. </p>
<p> Games will still look crisp and high fidelity with plenty of rich color. In short they'll still look awesome and you'll still have fun playing them. </p>
<p> Are games backwards compatible? </p>
<p> Sony has confirmed that PS4 games are backwards compatible and you will be able to play your PS4 discs in your PS5 if you got the version with the disc drive. </p>
<p> Not all games were tested though, so some may not work. However you should be fine for most games. Anything from the PS3, PS2, and PS1 will not be backwards compatible. </p>
<p> Also worth mentioning is that Sony hasn't confirmed yet whether or not PS4 digital games can be downloaded to the PS5. Though it would be weird if Sony didn't allow this. </p>
<p> Can I transfer my save data? </p>
<p> The best answer for this is probably yes and no. Since the PS5 will support PS4 discs, and probably PS4 digital saves, any save data should be there for the PS4 versions of those games. Though Sony has not yet confirmed this. </p>
<p> When it comes to save data between PS4 and PS5 versions of the same game, it will not be transferrable. As an example, you won't be able to transfer the save data from the PS4 version of Yakuza: Like A Dragon to the PS5 version. </p>
<p> Can I use my DualShock 4 controllers with the PS5? </p>
<p> For PS4 games, yes. For PS5 games, no. </p>
<p> The PS Remote Play Android app already supports the PS5 </p>
<p> If you were hoping to use Remote Play on the PS5 right at launch, you're in luck. Because Sony updated the Android app earlier this week and it now supports the PS5. </p>
<p> Which means you should be able to play PS5 games remotely from your Android phone on launch day. if you want to. </p>

<p> Why Sony's PS5 UI Is A Masterclass In Design </p>
<p> Earlier this morning Sony showed off the very first look at the PS5 UI in a brand-new video. Prior to today, the only thing it had shown off to users was the power screen that asks you to hit the PlayStation button. </p>
<p> Suffice it to say, a more in-depth PS5 UI reveal this morning was a big deal for Sony. And for the players. The new UI looks good. Like, really good. But a pretty interface is just the cherry on top. There's definitely more depth there. And the UI does a great job at showing how much thought Sony put into it. The PS5 UI is such a good design and here's why. </p>
<p> The PS5 UI is such a good design because it focuses heavily on the player </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sure the UI looks good. But, the visual design of the UI is not the main reason it's as good as it is. </p>
<p> A bigger reason for that is its focus on the player. The UI focuses heavily on the player in fact. What does that mean exactly? Many things, really. First, Sony wants to keep you engaged. And the PS5 UI is going to do a very good job of keeping content engagement up. </p>
<p> You can tell this just by learning about the Control Center. A new feature of the interface coming with the PS5 when it launches in November. The control center is Sony's way of allowing you to access and interact with various features of the console, but without having to back out of the game you might be in to get to the home screen and all its menus first. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is such a good idea because it allows you to stay on the game screen while you poke around in other things. For example, the cards in the control center that you can see in the image above. </p>
<p> These cards are based on the game you're currently playing. There's a card for screenshots, as well as cards for stories relating to the game, and a few other things. There are also cards for a new type of feature called Activities. </p>
<p> With activities, players can see useful information that relates to the game. Such as how much of a specific level they've completed, and even a personalized system estimate of how long it will take to finish that activity based on the current completion percentage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All of this is, again, crafted in a way that lets players see everything without having to leave the game screen. Which is huge. No longer will I (or you) have to disconnect from the game to go do something else in a menu far far away. Ultimately leading to wasted time. </p>
<p> Everything is a lot more organized </p>
<p> Look, no one enjoys having to wade through a convoluted UI just to find what they're searching for. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The PS5 UI seems to combat this issue by, gasp, organizing things more efficiently. In Sony's first-look video, it shows off the home screen. Which is a lot more organized than it was on the PS4. First off, games and media content are split up into their own tabs. </p>
<p> You'll see games first, which is the left tab, then media second, which is the right tab. So instead of having all of your content laid out in one rolling carousel like on the PS4, it's separated out into specific sections. </p>
<p> You still have the rolling carousel. That's not going away. All Sony did was separate games and media. So if you're looking for games you want to play, or you want to buy a new game, all of your game cards and the PSN Store card will be listed under the games section. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you're wanting to sift through screenshots or captured video however, or stream something on Netflix, Crunchyroll or other TV apps, then you will find it all listed under the media section. Some people may still prefer to have everything all in one place. </p>
<p> But Sony's decision to shift towards a more organized UI for the PS5 is a smart one. And a decision that many players will surely appreciate. </p>
<p> Get by with a little help from your friends </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One of the standout features that deserves a ton of attention is the new official game help that some games will include. And I have to wonder how unnoticed this feature will go by some players. </p>
<p> Say you're stuck at a particular part in a game. Your first reaction might be to do what I usually do, and go search for a guide or walkthrough on YouTube. Sony is adding official game help tips to some games for specific activities. So if you do end up stuck, you can check these tips to help get by. </p>
<p> Now, these will only be available for some activities and not all of them. And as mentioned only for some games. Since these are part of the activities, you'll find the official game help on the activity cards that have them. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Game help will also be a PlayStation Plus feature. You'll need to have an active membership to access the tips, so that might be some incentive to getting one if you don't already subscribe. </p>
<p> Another big focal point here, and probably the biggest focal point, is that you don't have to leave the game to get the help. Some help tips even have video instead of text, and you can watch them from the activity card then jump right back to the game. Videos can even be expanded for a larger view if desired. </p>
<p> Even better still is that some cards can be put in a picture-in-picture mode. Allowing you to have the card up as you play the game. Should you need to, this may help you play along with the hint so you don't have to go back and check it. You can simply look over to your left or right and view the activity hint and continue until you complete whatever you're going after. Seamless play. Limitless fun. </p>
<p> The PS5 UI kind of has its own Stream Connect feature </p>
<p> So @PlayStation basically has its own @GoogleStadia #StreamConnect feature for the #PS5. If you're in a party with a friend, and you're both playing the same game, you can both share your screen and then pin it to be picture-in-picture. This will be huge for team-based games. pic.twitter.com/QWwrv8EZvm </p>
<p> — Justin Diaz ⛩Wayfarer of Tsushima⛩ 🍜🍥 (@JDNews4) October 15, 2020 </p>
<p> If you're familiar with Stadia, then you probably know what Stream Connect is. Love or hate the platform, it's introduced some really cool stuff to the world of gaming. Stream Connect is one of those things. And the PS5 sort of has its own version of it. </p>
<p> Stream Connect is a feature that allows you to see a live view of where a friend is in a game that you're both playing when in a party. This launched on Stadia with Ghost Recon: Breakpoint. Which is honestly a perfect game for it. Say you're partying with a friend and you're both engaged in a difficult encounter. </p>
<p> Stream Connect allows you to see where they are at all times. In turn they can also see where you are at all times too. This allows you to strategically plan out your next move in the encounter, and those video feeds are placed in small windows to the side of the screen so as not to take up precious screen space for your own gameplay. </p>
<p> On the PS5, you can bring up a live video feed of any friend that has decided to stream their gameplay. You can then pin that video to the screen. This opens up some really awesome capabilities when playing PS5 with friends. And should bring a whole new level of engagement to the gameplay experience. </p>
<p> You do have to be in a party for this to work, and you and the friends you may be playing with all have to share your screens. But it'll definitely come in handy when playing team games. Such as Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. </p>
<p> You can use the control center to join in-progress matches for multiplayer games </p>
<p> Got friends already playing together in a multiplayer game? Want to join them quickly? The PS5 is making this pretty simple to do. </p>
<p> From the control center you can scroll all the way to a card that shows the friends you're in a party with. If one of them has already started a match in a multiplayer game, you can click on this card and there will be a join button that you can click. </p>
<p> This will immediately load up the game they're playing and dump you into the match. Now there are some caveats here to keep in mind. Jumping right into a match is probably only going to work if the match hasn't already started. </p>
<p> I can't imagine that if a friend is in the middle of a MP match in Call Of Duty that you'll be able to join that particular match. But there may be instances where it lets you. Like say, when that friend's team doesn't have all the players. It might also be required that games supports this feature, and it's just as possible that not all games will. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, this will make partying up and playing with friends way quicker because you can do it all from the control center. </p>
<p> The PS5 PlayStation Store is completely integrated into the system </p>
<p> Gone are the days where we have to use that abysmal PS4 version of the PlayStation Store. With PS5, the PSN Store is completely integrated into the system and is no longer a standalone app. </p>
<p> I can't stress enough how much better this is. First of all, launching the PlayStation Store on the PS4 was always slow. Maybe this is because I'm still using an original launch day PS4. And maybe not. </p>
<p> Either way, the complete system integration along with the PS5's much better performance is going to make searching for new games to purchase a dream. Because getting to the store and surfing through it will be way faster. </p>
<p> This is also likely going to help Sony sell more stuff. People won't hate using the store so they'll spend more time in it. Which probably means more chances that people will spend money. the store experience, Sony says, is also more personalized. So that probably means you'll see recommendations of games that are personalized to you as opposed to a blanketed list of featured titles. </p>
<p> Everything is about convenience and ease of use, player engagement, and a more enjoyable player experience. Sony's first-look video doesn't show off a ton of the PlayStation Store but it does give you enough of a peek to know that the experience received a big quality of life upgrade. </p>
<p> You can now use voice dictation to type messages </p>
<p> Typing out messages on the PS4 that are longer than a few words is not the greatest experience. It takes too long and sometimes it's too easy to have typos. </p>
<p> In my own personal experience, I often find that I accidentally back out of the message entirely. Causing me to have to restart the entire message. That sucks. PS5 solves this by adding the option to use voice dictation to type and send messages. </p>
<p> Using the DualSense controller you can bring up the message keyboard, and click on a mic button to use your voice. The voice dictation will type everything out for you. Then all you have to do is hit send. Easy peezy. </p>
<p> Obviously there's no telling how well this works for longer messages right now. Not without testing it first. But even if the messages you send tend to be kept short, this will still be a much faster way to send them. And that means more game time. </p>
<p> Media shared with friends can contain spoiler warnings </p>
<p> Spoilers. The bane of my existence. And maybe yours too. Unless you don't care about ruining the story or experience in a game you're playing, you probably hate spoilers. </p>
<p> Here's one way of how Sony is attacking that with that PS5. Say you captured some screenshots or video of a game you were playing. And then you want to share that media with a friend. You might even choose to use that fancy new voice dictation feature to type out your message. </p>
<p> Should the developer of the game your media was captured from think that it might contain spoilers, it'll warn the friend you're sharing it with about the potential spoilers before they view it. </p>
<p> This is such a fantastic feature. Especially for anyone who wants to experience parts of a game first-hand. Shared media won't always have these spoiler warnings. Some developers may not even choose to utilize this at all. But for the ones that do, your friends can rest assured that they won't have their game ruined by learning something before they've played it. </p>
<p> More features to come </p>
<p> Sony didn't divulge everything there is to know about the UI in this video. It is a bit long at just over eleven and a half minutes. But that isn't enough time to go over every aspect of the UI. </p>
<p> Sony says it will have more to share leading up to the PS5 launch in November. And there will be more to share in the months and years following the PS5 launch as Sony puts out updates and adds new features. </p>
<p> For now, there is plenty that makes the UI of the PS5 such an amazing experience. And if you're excited even in the slightest for the console's launch, make sure to check some of these UI features out when you get the chance. </p>
<p> Because they're definitely big upgrades to the experience that will make using the PS5 more enjoyable every time you power it on. If you're interested in watching the whole video, you can view it below. </p>

<p> Here's Your First Look At The UI For The Sony PS5 </p>
<p> This morning Sony lifted the curtain a little and showed off bits and pieces of the UI on the PS5. Giving the public their first look at what they'll see when they interact with the console. </p>
<p> Sony doesn't leave too much to the imagination here with the PS5 UI. A new video Sony uploaded showcases the major parts of the interface, including the home screen. Though it is worth noting that it doesn't show off the home screen right away and there's likely a big reason for that. </p>
<p> Sony designed the PS5 UI with a big focus on the control center </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the PS5, one thing players may notice is that there's a big focus on what Sony is calling the Control Center. </p>
<p> This is the portion of the interface you'll see when you hit the PlayStation button while you're inside of a game. It's meant to give you access to various elements and features of the system without having to jump out of the game you're in. </p>
<p> In Sony's video, it's jumping back into a current game of Sackboy: A Big Adventure after having powered the PS5 back on from rest mode. It appears this Control Center is a big part of the new console and likely why Sony wanted to focus on it at the very beginning. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Control Center is setup in two layers. With a series of large cards that are displayed on the top layer containing information that pertains to your game. Such as stories, recently taken screenshots, and even the player's current progress on various levels. </p>
<p> Below the cards layer you have system information. From here you can check your notifications and game download status, as well as see which friends are online and manage things like connected devices. All of this can be done without leaving the game. </p>
<p> The home screen layout takes up much less space </p>
<p> Later on in the video you get a peek at the brand-new home screen design. Which appears to take up much less space than it does on the PS4. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the PS5, games and other game content are presented on much smaller cards that extend out from the top left corner. Sony says this design presents beautifully on 4K displays. It also displays the home screen theme background much more vividly because cards aren't as large as they were on the PS4, nor are they sitting right in the middle of the interface. </p>
<p> Sony has also split up games and media into their own tabs. Which should make finding specific content much easier and keep things more organized. If you want a longer and more in-depth look at the UI, you can watch Sony's video below. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Sony Will Improve The PS5 Cooling Over Time Via Software Updates </p>
<p> Sony Will Improve The PS5 Cooling Over Time Via Software Updates </p>
<p> Sony built the PS5 with a massive cooling fan. So massive in fact that it's the main reason why the console is as big as it is. </p>
<p> This along with the other components in the console's design should prove to help the PS5 stay as cool as possible during gameplay. Even longer gaming sessions. Better yet, it should also be a lot quieter during gameplay. Instead of sounding like it's about to lift off into space like the PS4. </p>
<p> According to a new report from a Japanese publication 4Gamer.net (spotted by The Verge) who spoke with Yasuhiro Ootori, the PS5 cooling will even evolve as the console gets older. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sony plans to improve the PS5 cooling capabilities through software updates </p>
<p> You might wonder how Sony is planning on doing this. And that's a fair question to ask. Ootori says that Sony will collect data from the console to help optimize future performance of the cooling fan. And thereby the PS5. </p>
<p> When the PS5 is powered on and users play games, the cooling fan will run thanks to the PS5's Accelerated Processing Unit. The data that's collected will be based on how the APU and cooling fan run during specific games. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sony can then develop software updates to push out to the PS5 that help the fan run more efficiently based on the games it's playing. Which could in turn help the console perform better, and perhaps even draw less power if it the fan doesn't need to run at maximum levels. </p>
<p> It sounds like Sony's plan is to simply optimize the PS5 to run at its absolute best at all times. Which doesn't necessarily mean always at peak performance. But sometimes the best performance for the activity you're currently engaging in. </p>
<p> One fan to rule them all </p>
<p> For all the power that the PS5 will deliver, you'd probably think that Sony would need multiple fans. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Yet it does not. It simply decided to go with a large double-sided intake fan that measures 120mm wide. It's also 45mm thick, so it stretches from one side of the console to another. The size of this fan rules the entire cooling functionality of the console. </p>
<p> With the help of the PS5's APU of course. And the dedicated future updates. But in terms of the fans, this single fan handles the job by itself. Which makes it all the more interesting when thinking about how the system will sound three or four years from now. After it's got some life on it and it's been used for quite some time. </p>
<p> The good news is that it should (hopefully) still sound pretty quiet down the road, as long as users are taking proper care of the system and utilizing those sweet built-in dust catchers that you can vacuum out. </p>

<p> Android News / Android Phones / Sony Xperia 5 II Teardown Video Shows Graphite Sheet For Cooling The Cameras </p>
<p> Sony Xperia 5 II Teardown Video Shows Graphite Sheet For Cooling The Cameras </p>
<p> A recent Sony Xperia 5 II teardown video showcases that the company put plenty of thought process to provide optimal camera performance and has included a graphite sheet for the cameras. </p>
<p> Sony tried to take the limelight away from the Samsungs and Huaweis of the world with its recent releases, the Sony Xperia 1 II and Xperia 5 II. </p>
<p> Notably, the Xperia 1 II is the older sibling to the Xperia 5 II. Moreover, Xperia 5 II was launched recently in the last month. Both phones are touted to be powerhouses in the camera department. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sony ported over some of the photography and videography controls over to Sony Xperia 1 II and Xperia 5 II. Sony also claims to provide the best possible manual controls for photography on a smartphone. </p>
<p> Apparently, the Sony Xperia 5 II comes with a graphite sheet for cooling the cameras on the device. As the phone is all about cameras, this is something nice to see. </p>
<p> Besides, the video also gives us a look at the internals of the device. The video by YouTube channel PBKreviews also shows how all the internal components are arranged in the compact form factor of the Xperia 5 II. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Given the device is powered by a Snapdragon 865 processor, houses an 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage onboard and a 4,000 mAh battery, the component arrangement looks well thought. </p>
<p> Interesting thing is that the company managed to keep up with all good internals, even with the compact size of the phone. Once the device is peeled open, the graphite sheet is visible. This sheet is meant to dissipate the heat from the device. </p>
<p> The graphite sheet on the Xperia 5 II extends to the triple-camera setup </p>
<p> We all know that the Sony Xperia 5 II comes with great camera setup. And to avoid performance comptonization, the graphite sheet now extends up to the triple camera setup. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> To recall, the Xperia 5 II comes with a 12MP (f/1.7) primary sensor, a 12MP (f/2.2) ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 12MP (f/2.4) telephoto lens. This setup is capable of shooting [email protected] </p>
<p> Additionally, the Xperia 5 II teardown video shows that the phone houses a copper tape behind the screen. This is meant to transfer heat from the mid-portion of the Xperia 5 II. </p>
<p> Some of the internal components are securely placed using adhesives, giving the phone a water-resistant build. In fact, the mic is secured with adhesive while the USB-C port is protected by a rubber gasket. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There is another positive thing that can be deduced from the video. It is that the phone is fairly easy to disassemble and put back together. So, it scores good numbers when it comes to repairability. </p>

<p> South Korea Refuses To Join The US Drive Against Huawei </p>
<p> The American crackdown on Huawei isn't limited to the nation's geographical boundaries. The Trump administration also wants other countries to ban the beleaguered Chinese telecommunications equipment giant. However, not everyone believes in the US resolve. </p>
<p> During the recently concluded fifth Senior Economic Dialogue between the US and South Korea, Lee Tae-ho, South Korea's second vice foreign minister, sternly rejected the US proposal to ban Huawei from the country's telecom infrastructure. </p>
<p> "The US side explained its position on the matter, and we explained our basic position to them," a foreign ministry official told Korean media after the meeting. "We made it clear that whether a private telecom company uses the equipment of a specific enterprise is up to that company to decide." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> "It was not a discussion in the sense that one side asked the other specifically what or whom to exclude, but we talked about the importance of the Clean Network and the issues requested by the US," the official added. </p>
<p> The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched the "Clean Network" program in August. It is essentially a drive to ban Chinese equipment suppliers from global telecom infrastructure. Pompeo called for "all freedom-loving" countries to join this initiative. </p>
<p> The US has labeled the two major South Korean mobile carriers – SK Telecom Co. and KT Corp. – that do not use Huawei equipment as "clean" telecommunication firms. However, LG Uplus Co. still does and America wants Seoul officials to pressurize the carrier to cease relations with Huawei. But that seemingly isn't happening, as the recent discussions didn't go entirely smoothly. Keith Krach, the US under-secretary of state, was the chief American representative in the meeting. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> South Korea rejects US proposal to ban Huawei </p>
<p> The American government is using its global influence and economic prowess to convince other countries to ban Huawei equipment from their telecom infrastructure. And such is the power of the Trump-led administration that many countries have actually gone on to do so. </p>
<p> The US claims that any data with Huawei is not safe. It believes the Chinese government may have access to all data on Huawei servers. This poses a huge risk to national security. However, not all countries are buying this claim and South Korea is one of them. </p>
<p> Interestingly, Lee and Krach did not talk about Economic Prosperity Network (EPN) during the meeting held earlier this week. EPN is another US initiative that aims at shifting global supply chains away from China. However, they have reportedly agreed to hold the fourth annual public-private economic talks later this month. Discussions around China could be the focal point of that meeting as well. </p>

<p> 'Special Edition' OnePlus 8T Is Coming As Well </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8T got announced yesterday, and it seems like a ‘special edition’ of this smartphone is also coming. This information comes from Max J., who is usually spot on when it comes to OnePlus information. </p>
<p> He went to Twitter in order to tell people that the special edition variant of the OnePlus 8T is on its way, just to keep everyone on their toes. This is probably the same phone Evan Blass teased last month. </p>
<p> Mr. Blass tweeted out “OnePlus 8T Limited Edition” via his official Twitter handle, and that was it. He did not share any other information about the device. This sure seems to be the same phone Max J. is talking about, though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ‘Special Edition’ OnePlus 8T coming, following the ‘special edition’ OnePlus Nord model </p>
<p> OnePlus actually announced a ‘special edition’ Nord variant, which is essentially just an Ash Gray model with a matte back. Does that mean that the ‘special edition’ OnePlus 8T will just be a differently-colored OnePlus 8T? Well, it’s possible, but we’re hoping for more. </p>
<p> Many of you know that OnePlus is no stranger to releasing special edition smartphones. In the past, the company partnered up with Disney, Marvel, and McLaren in order to release some special edition devices. </p>
<p> Well, we’re hoping something similar will happen in the near future for the OnePlus 8T. McLaren and OnePlus ended their partnership a while back, so that makes us wonder what to expect here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OnePlus will almost certainly find a new partner for its special edition handset, but we can’t even begin to guess who it is. We just hope that this special edition model will differentiate in more ways than one. </p>
<p> In the past, the company even changed the backplate on its special edition phones. Well, some of them, others simply had a different paint job and a logo of a brand OnePlus is partnering with. </p>
<p> Let’s hope this new partnership will result in some more flare to the device, like a sandstone back or something of the sort. We’re guessing that this special edition device will arrive in a couple of months from now. Until then, check out our OnePlus 8T review. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Spotify App For Android Tablets & Chromebooks Gets UI Overhaul </p>
<p> Spotify App For Android Tablets & Chromebooks Gets UI Overhaul </p>
<p> The Play Store on Android tablets includes several apps that are designed only for small screen devices. Up until now, even the Spotify app for Android tablet devices just mirrored its mobile UI experience. According to the Android Police, the app is finally introducing a revamped UI to better suit the large screen devices like Android tablets and Chromebooks. </p>
<p> The UI now looks similar to the Spotify app for Apple iPad. Unlike Android tablets, the apps available on the App Store for Apple iPads include better-optimized apps. The refreshed UI for the Android tablets comes almost 10 months after it was introduced on Apple iPads. </p>
<p> Spotify finally revamps the app UI on Android tablets </p>
<p> The left bar on the app now includes the menu featuring home, search, and your library, along with the now playing information. It is shown all the time except when the now playing is in an expanded view. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the bottom left is the and stays put while you're checking your home page, searching, or browsing through your library. The only time it goes away is when you expand the now playing screen. Previously, the now playing bar at the bottom was difficult to use as it is just an expanded version of what it offered on smartphones. </p>
<p> The new UI now looks similar to its desktop interface </p>
<p> Now, it looks more similar to Spotify's desktop interface. With the larger screen size and form factor, the tablet version should have the best of both worlds. As of now, there is no official announcement from the company. </p>
<p> With Spotify getting into video podcasts, this new update is evident. As per the source, the refresh UI was found on the v8.5.72.625 for the Android tablets and v8.5.72.287 on Chromebooks. Additionally, this rollout could have been a server-side update. If not, try updating the Spotify app to the latest version through Play Store. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Recently, Spotify all made changes to the newly introduced "Group Session" mode. It now allows its users to listen to the same song or podcast together at the same time from anywhere in the world. For now, this feature is only limited to its paying customers. </p>
<p> The Spotify app for Android now comes with a new Bedtime feature for listening to sleep playlists while going to bed. Instead of opening the Spotify app, the users can set the bedtime feature from the default Clock app. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Spotify Introduce Promo Cards To Help Share Music And Podcasts </p>
<p> Spotify Introduce Promo Cards To Help Share Music And Podcasts </p>
<p> Spotify has introduced its new promo cards tool to help artists and creators better share their material. As reported by Engadget, this now gives creators the ability to better advertise their work on social media. </p>
<p> Spotify has been hard at work to improve their platform over recent weeks and months with a host of new features. This is perhaps to try and counteract the work done by YouTube Music to improve their offering. </p>
<p> Back in September, Spotify made it much easier for users to control the quality of streaming. Spotify achieved this by giving different quality options for both WiFi and cellular streaming. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company also added the ability to search for songs by lyrics at the start of October. The was always available on the web client but now has been added to the app. </p>
<p> This new promo cards feature looks to be a way for Spotify to better advertise its creators. It also gives them a better option to promote their music on the platform which looks like a win-win for both parties on the face of it. </p>
<p> Spotify introduces promo cards to better promote content </p>
<p> In order to create a card, you must navigate your way to Spotify for Artists or Podcasters. Here you can follow on-screen instructions to start your creations. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Promo cards can be used to promote a single track or podcast episode. Alternatively, you could also create one for an album or series. Those who make it into Spotify’s top 33 music or podcast playlists can also make a specific card to point people to those. </p>
<p> Cards come in various different formats to suit where they will be used. You can produce them in landscape or vertical as well as square to best suit the platform you wish to promote on. </p>
<p> Fans can also create these promo cards as well to celebrate their favourite artists and creators. Spotify says that the feature is mostly designed with creators in mind. However, the will not stop fans from using the new tool. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You will not need access or a login to one of the creation websites to do this so it is really simple. Ultimately, this is a very smart business move from Spotify. By getting creators and fans to make these cards they are essentially getting others to do their marketing for them. </p>
<p> These cards only direct to Spotify so they channel traffic away from other streaming platforms like Apple and YouTube Music. How much of an impact this will have remains to be seen but it is certainly a shrewd move from the company. </p>

<p> Google SVP Gives Us The Clearest Look At Surface Duo Yet </p>
<p> Google SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer has now provided what could be the clearest real-world Microsoft Surface Duo yet. Shared via Twitter, the executive's recently-reported tweet highlights an image of some "yakitori and yakiniku" he made over the weekend. But, placed front and center amid all that delicious food, is the upcoming device. </p>
<p> The Microsoft gadget is shown in the same stark white configuration that's been seen in previous leaks. But this image is much clearer than those leaks have been. There are also a few differences that are readily noticeable in the difference. </p>
<p> For instance, the casing on the dual-screen Android smartphone appears to boast a few notches and cut-outs meant to make handling it easier. One such notch is seen at the right-hand side of the device and would presumably help open and close the gadget more effortlessly. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A charging port is also clearly visible. The company tucked the port inside another piece of the surrounding edge that's been cut away. Of course, that's a USB-C port. </p>
<p> What is Microsoft Surface Duo? </p>
<p> The Google exec hasn't provided a lot of detail to go along with the newly-shared image. But that doesn't mean this is an entirely unknown device. Not only has Microsoft itself teased the device since October of last year, with plans to launch in "Holiday" 2020. Many of the deeper details are already known. </p>
<p> As the branding implies, Surface Duo is a dual-screen-enabled foldable. But instead of running Microsoft Windows as other surface devices do, this one runs Android 10 out-of-the-box. And it will be updated to Android 11 quickly, almost without question. That's because it's not a foldable, single-screen device but two separate screens. And the upcoming OS has a lot of improvements in store for multi-screen devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> More specifically, those are two 5.6-inch AMOLED displays. Microsoft has set the resolution at 1,800 by 1,350 pixels — for each display. The displays are also set on a 360-degree hinge that allows the gadget to be used as a smartphone or flipped around for more tablet-like productivity. A single 11-megapixel camera is embedded in the frame. </p>
<p> Inside, as of the teaser, this is expected to be driven by a Snapdragon 855 backed by 6GB of RAM. Storage is set at 64GB or 256GB. </p>
<p> A 3,460mAh-capacity battery is expected behind all of that </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When is this actually coming? </p>
<p> As noted above, Microsoft has only alluded to the holiday season for Surface Duo. But the full-blown announcement and even shipping are reportedly expected by the end of the month. So nobody will have to wait long to get all of the details. </p>

<p> Tablet Market Shows Surprising Growth In Q2 2020 </p>
<p> The worldwide tablet market has grown by almost a quarter in Q2 2020 as reported by Canalys. The industry grew by 26% from this period last year. </p>
<p> This remarkable growth is largely due to the coronavirus outbreak. With a dramatic rise in home working, people are looking for basic computing power and larger screens. The sector had faltered in recent years but this is a welcome trend for those in the industry. </p>
<p> Overall, the smartphone market is down from this time last year despite Huawei overtaking Samsung as the largest distributor. Therefore, overall growth is a really promising sign for the tablet sector. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Table sales increase by 26% in Q2 2020 </p>
<p> A 26% increase in the tablet market in Q2 2020 is as seriously impressive statistic given most of the world is heading into an economic recession. All major tablet vendors saw double-digit growth from last year's figures. </p>
<p> These sorts of sales levels are normally associated with the Q4 holiday season. This gives the figures some context into how impressive they are. Canalys Analyst Ishan Dutt pointed out that tablets were a perfect purchase given the current situation. Dutt said, “tablets enjoyed a renaissance in Q2 2020 because the devices tick so many boxes for remote work and education use.” </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Apple continues to lead the way in tablet sales </p>
<p> Unsurprisingly, Apple continues to lead the tablet market from its competitors. The company saw a 20% increase in sales, resulting in 14 million units shipped. This is a second-quarter record for the company. </p>
<p> Samsung found themselves in second with 9 million units shipped but a massive 39% rise in sales. Huawei followed with an even larger 45% year on year growth. Amazon and Lenovo followed behind in fourth and fifth place respectively. Both companies also saw large increases in sales. </p>
<p> Dutt's analysis of the increase pointed out that tablets generally tend to be budget-friendly. For example, the Amazon Fire HD 8 is currently retailing at $59. Dutt points out that this increase means we must include tablets when "evaluating the PC market as a whole." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Ben Stanton, who is a senior analyst at Canalys noted that the carrier and channel ecosystem is a key context for understanding this growth. He points to back to school deals to entice buyers as well as offers from carriers offering free data. </p>
<p> Having a reliable connection has been key to supporting remote learning and working. Therefore, the tablet market has adapted to these needs and ensured that they can meet this demand. </p>
<p> It will be interesting to see how the tablet market continues to evolve over the coming months. Is this a short-term spike or will this become a longer-term trend towards tablet preference? Only time will tell but with much of the world set to work from home for the foreseeable future, the need for tablets is likely to stay for a while. </p>

<p> Take A Look At Amazon's FAA Approved Drone Program </p>
<p> The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved Amazon's drone program to fly. As reported by Business Insider, Amazon now has permission to fly "unmanned aircraft systems". </p>
<p> Amazon has been working on drone delivery for years now. Over the years, they had to file a number of patents in regards to the technology they would use. One of the major issues the company faced was cushioning the packages in delivery. </p>
<p> The project began in 2013 but it was not until June 2019 that the company received approval from the FAA to test drones in the US. Now it looks like after all that work Amazon has finally reached their goal. You can take a look at the technology below. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon has approval for Drone Progam </p>
<p> Following years of work Amazon Prime Air Vice President David Carbon has made a statement on the news. He said, "We will continue to develop and refine our technology to fully integrate delivery drones into the airspace, and work closely with the FAA and other regulators around the world to realize our vision of 30-minute delivery." </p>
<p> So far the Amazon drone fleet has put in hundreds of hours of testing in flight. This means that by this stage the technology must have improved significantly from back in 2019. </p>
<p> The drones have an inbuilt sense-and-avoid system. This uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to avoid obstacles such as chimneys in flight. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Right now it does not look like Amazon's drone program will not be used for regular deliveries. The system has, however, undergone tests with packages delivered in under thirty minutes. </p>
<p> As the various images show, Amazon has a range of different drone designs in its fleet. They say that each one is optimized for different types of delivery. It is not yet clear what these different types of delivery are. Perhaps, it has something to do with the length of travel or the type of area they deliver to. </p>
<p> The newest model Amazon has produced can fly up to 15 miles. It also delivers packages of up to five pounds. Amazon is yet to specify which drones it will use. However, this most recent model is likely to be closest to the final one. Below is an image to show you what it looks like. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon first tested its drone delivery system back in 2016 in England. It took just 13 minutes to deliver a package. However, the company now says it has tested the system in five different countries using various designs and delivery systems. Amazon also says that the system "will continue to evolve over time" as the system refines itself. </p>

<p> Android News / TCL Announces The BlackBerry KEY2 LE, Arriving Next Month – IFA 2018 </p>
<p> TCL Announces The BlackBerry KEY2 LE, Arriving Next Month – IFA 2018 </p>
<p> TCL, the BlackBerry-branded licensing partner, has announced the latest BlackBerry that will be available beginning next month. And that is the KEY2 LE. This is the newest edition to BlackBerry's lineup, and it's also a slightly cheaper model, coming in at $399. The BlackBerry KEY2 LE sports a 4.5-inch, 1620×1080 resolution display, and is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 chipset with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of storage here. There is also a micro SD card slot for expanding storage, should you need some more space. </p>
<p> This is essentially a lower-end version of the KEY2 that BlackBerry debuted earlier this year, though it does still have many of the same specs as the regular KEY2, it is much cheaper. It does still have that physical keyboard – that's what makes it a "KEY" smartphone after all. That keyboard supports the usual shortcuts that you'd expect on a BlackBerry smartphone, and those shortcuts are customizable. The fingerprint sensor is once again hidden in the space bar, which makes it easy to secure your device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> TCL has kept the "Speed Key" that was included in the KEY2 earlier this year. This provides you with a dedicated button that can be mapped to do whatever you want. Whether that is opening the camera, turning off the ringer on your KEY2 LE or something else. It's a pretty simple feature, but one that is very useful. </p>
<p> On the camera-front, BlackBerry is still using a dual-camera setup on the backside of the KEY2 LE. That includes a 13-megapixel sensor as the main camera and then a 5-megapixel secondary sensor that is going to be used primarily for gathering depth information. The camera has a pretty average field-of-view, around 79.8-degrees. It also has phase detection auto focus, with an aperture of f/2.2. BlackBerry still supports Google Lens on the camera as well, allowing you to open Google Lens and take a picture of something, in which Google Lens can tell you what it is (and possibly where to get it, depending on the item). The front-facing camera is a 8-megapixel sensor, and it is able to shoot video at 1080p and 30 frames-per-second. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The key feature of any BlackBerry smartphone is its battery life. BlackBerries have been known for staying charged for multiple days at a time, and that is still going to be the case here. The KEY2 LE has a battery capacity of 2000mAh, and when you need to top up, there is Quick Charge 3.0 support here as well. Allowing you to quickly top off the phone, if the battery does happen to get low. </p>
<p> TCL has announced that the BlackBerry KEY2 LE is going to be coming to the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany and the UAE beginning next month. It'll be priced at $399 or €399 for the 32GB capacity model, and $449 or €429 for the 64GB capacity model. Other markets have not yet been announced. The KEY2 LE will also be available in three colors – Atomic, Champagne and Slate. The backside of the KEY2 LE is going to be black, with the frame being different colors. In this case, Atomic is red, Champagne is more of a Gold, and the Slate is black (matching the back side). Some interesting color choices, compared to the silver and black colors on the KEY2. </p>

<p> TCL has kicked off its IFA 2020 announcements with a couple of new tablets. The company unveiled the TABMAX & TABMID affordable Android tablets under its TCL 10 series. During the same event, it also launched the MOVETIME Family Watch and MOVEAUDIO S200 TWS earbuds. </p>
<p> Speaking of the new tablets, they come packed with mid-range specifications and will be available in 4G LTE and Wi-Fi-only variants. The TCL TABMAX & TABMID will go on sale starting Q4, and the availability is limited to selected markets. </p>
<p> TCL TABMAX & TABMID tablets launched with mid-range specifications </p>
<p> As per the names suggest, the TCL TABMAX is a better offering than the TCL TABMID. Both of the tablets run on Android 10 out of the box with custom TCL UI on the top. The company is including a dedicated Kids Mode along with parental controls. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Both the tablets will feature TCL's proprietary "intelligent eye protection" for blue light reduction. It will even trigger an alarm when the face gets too close to the screen. The TCL TABMAX comes with a 10.36-inch LCD display with Full HD+ (2000 x 1200 pixels) resolution and symmetrical bezel. </p>
<p> It comes powered by MediaTek Helio P22T (MT8768T) octa-core processor coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. In terms of cameras, there is a 13MP sensor on the rear and an 8MP sensor on the front. There are also dual speakers and dual microphones with far-field noise cancellation support. </p>
<p> The tablets come with dedicated Kids mode & intelligent eye protection </p>
<p> Furthermore, it comes integrated with Google Assistant and can also be used as a smart display. As seen on high-end tablets, the mid-range TCL TABMAX also supports ultra-low latency T-Pen (Stylus) and keyboard case. It is backed by an 8,000mAh battery which should be good enough for using all-day. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the other hand, the TCL TABMID comes with a smaller 8-inch LCD display with the Full HD+ (1920 x 1200 pixels)resolution. Even the top and bottom bezels on this tablet are relatively thicker compared to 2020 standards. </p>
<p> Interestingly, the company opted for a much superior Snapdragon 665 chipset for its smaller tablet. It includes 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. There is even a MicroSD card slot for further expansion of storage. </p>
<p> With the smaller screen size, the tablet obviously comes with a smaller 5,550mAh battery. There is an 8MP camera on the rear and a 5MP selfie camera on the front. It measures 209.4 x 125.2 x 8.55 mm and weighs 325g. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Coming to the pricing, the smaller TCL TABMID will start at €230. The TCL TABMAX is priced at €249 and €299 for the Wi-Fi only and 4G LTE models respectively. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/01/tcl-weather-alcatel-blackberry.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485053" filename="tcl-weather-alcatel-blackberry.html">
<p> Android Apps & Games / TCL Weather App Pre-Installed On Alcatel, BlackBerry Phones Collecting Way Too Much Data </p>
<p> TCL Weather App Pre-Installed On Alcatel, BlackBerry Phones Collecting Way Too Much Data </p>
<p> A weather app made by TCL, loaded by default on some Alcatel phones and also available in the Play Store, was found by security firm Secure-D to be harvesting users' personal data and using that data to commit fraudulent financial transactions. Those transactions centered around signing users up for various paid subscription services without their consent. Thus far, the activity seems to have only taken place in smaller markets like Brazil, Nigeria and Malaysia. While Secure-D managed to catch many of these attempts and the app has been taken down from the Play Store, the estimated cost to users if the attempts had been successful is around $1.5 million in total. The threat has seemingly been neutralized at this time, but owners of Alcatel and Blackberry phones would do well to disable their stock weather app and use another, and those who have downloaded it from the Play Store are urged to uninstall it and use a different app. </p>
<p> Background: The findings began with reports of fraudulent transactions received by Secure-D. These reports seemed to originate largely from Alcatel Pixi 4 and Alcatel Max A3 smartphones in the affected regions. Upon further investigation, Secure-D was able to determine that all of the similar-looking fraudulent transaction requests originated from the same app across devices. The weather app in question has a number of possibly invasive permissions that are required for usage, and in particular, it was found to be sending users' physical locations, IMEI numbers, and email addresses to a server in China. While the location is par for the course with weather apps, the users' email addresses and device IMEI numbers are not typically useful to the core function of such an app, and thus, should raise alarm bells with security-conscious users. Secure-D investigated the matter by securing a number of allegedly affected devices, and operating them in a monitored environment. The devices showed noticeable lag, as reported by users, and as soon as they began operating, started sending data and requests to servers in China that were seemingly unrelated to the app's advertised weather function. The app was also found to be committing ad fraud, which ate up users' data allotments and affected device and network speeds, by making large numbers of web requests to advertisers and sending clicks. These clicks often resulted in purchasing paid subscriptions either using billing information stored on the device, or by billing subscriptions to a user's carrier bill. </p>
<p> Impact: The app's play store rating, 4.4 stars as of this writing, may also be fraudulent. Many of the 5 star ratings for the app only had one or two words, and they were found to be drowning out a good number of one and two star reviews that point out some of the problems with the app that users face, such as slowing down devices or using up far more mobile data than a weather app has any business using. While no outside investigations, criminal or otherwise, have been announced at this time, this development could have far-reaching implications. For starters, TCL manufactures Alcatel phones on license from Nokia, and also manufactures BlackBerry devices with the blessing of the company that once did so, back when the brand was in its heyday. No such activity has been detected on any other apps associated with TCL, Alcatel, or BlackBerry as of this writing, though caution should be taken with any apps made by TCL. In fact, it's good practice to take a close look at all of the permissions for any app you install. A link to the app in the Play Store is provided below for reference. For obvious reasons, Android Headlines does not recommend installing the app. </p>

<p> Teracube 2e Review – A More Affordable Sustainable Smartphone </p>
<p> Teracube the sustainable smartphone company is back again with a new smartphone - Teracube 2e. Can it live up to the hype generated by the first Teracube device last year? </p>
<p> No charging accessories, difficult to find the right charger brick </p>
<p> Charging time is just under 3 hours which is long </p>
<p> Stock camera app is not that great </p>
<p> Long wait time for delivery from launch date </p>
<p> Teracube provided Android Headlines with a pre-production review unit of the Teracube 2e. This review was written after using the device for more than 7 days. The phone is running Android 10 and September 5, 2020 security patch. </p>
<p> Teracube's slogan is "Better for your pocket, better for the planet". In this Teracube 2e review we do a deeper dive to see if it lives up to the affordable yet sustainable smartphone slogan. </p>
<p> AndroidHeadlines did an early read on this device on launch day. I have been using the Teracube 2e for a little over a week in preparation for this review. </p>
<p> Before we dig into the Teracube 2e review let's take a look at the company's philosophy and why they believe their approach is more beneficial to the environment. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Earth and Environment Friendly </p>
<p> Smartphones’ biggest environmental impact comes from the manufacturing process and the e-waste when discarded. According to Teracube, in the U.S. alone, over 151 million cell phones are thrown into landfills every year. To help combat this, the Teracube 2e was designed to help reduce e-waste and smartphone turnover. </p>
<p> Teracube's devices are good for the environment not only because they use replaceable batteries and recycled materials. By offering a long warranty and a swappable battery with guaranteed 3-year software updates, they are counting on people to keep their phones longer. This in turn should help reduce e-waste generated by smartphones filling landfills. </p>
<p> According to a United Nations report on E-Waste, the world produces as much as 50 million tons of electronic and electrical waste. And if we continue on our current path, we are on track by 2050 to reach 120 million tons of e-waste per year. Experts are anticipating a fresh glut of gadgets as we all rush to join the 5G revolution. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In order to live up to their slogan "Better for your pocket, better for the planet", the introductory limited-launch price of the Teracube 2e is an eye-popping $99. However, launch quantity stock is limited and is on a first-come-first-serve basis. MSRP of the Teracube 2e is $199 once the initial launch period ends. Let's find out if the device lives up to the hype in the Teracube 2e review. </p>
<p> Teracube 2e – a closer look </p>
<p> Design of the 2e is very basic but functional. It is a non-descript slab with just the right proportions and weight distribution for one-handed use. It is eerily reminiscent of the Nokia 2 series devices. However, compared to the plastic back Nokia devices, Teracube 2e has these unique detents in each bottom corner of the polycarbonate backplate. These detents allow for easy removal of the backplate to gain access to the two nano-SIM card slots and the micro-SD card slot. </p>
<p> There is a fairly large pad-printed Teracube logo in white color on the backplate. The backplate has a slight matte finish but it does not prevent a fingerprint smudge fest on it. The dual-camera module has a virtually negligible bump which is a marked departure from most other smartphones. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Teracube 2e has a rear fingerprint sensor in the tried and tested location. The FPS has just the right amount of tactile feedback and is quick and accurate. I did not observe any errors in unlocking the phone with the FPS during my time with the device. Of course, as soon as you pop open the backplate you see the large replaceable 4000 mAh battery. </p>
<p> Design and build quality impressions </p>
<p> The Teracube 2e is quite nondescript save for its little green power button which is a nice design touch gently reminding us that the device is eco-friendly. Power and volume buttons are on the right-hand side of the device and placed in a good location for one-handed use. All three buttons provide good tactile feedback. Top frame of the phone has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The bottom of the frame houses the USB-C charging port and the speaker grille. </p>
<p> Display panel on the 2e is flat with a teardrop notch at the top in the middle to accommodate the selfie camera. The top and side bezels are not overtly egregious but the bottom bezel is noticeably chunky. There is a small notification LED to the right of the top speaker grille which is a definite bonus. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are a few overall hardware gripes. Getting the SIM card out of the slot was quite a process. It would have been nice if Teracube included the push-pull pins on the SIM slots. The SD card slot does not suffer from the same issue since the micro SD cards have a detent to grab on to when you want to eject it. The haptic motor is a glaring weak spot in an otherwise well-built device with no noticeable squeaks, creaks, or rattles. </p>
<p> In summary, the design is mostly functional which is a good thing. </p>
<p> Performance on Teracube 2e is quite decent </p>
<p> Teracube 2e comes equipped with a MediaTek Helio A25 processor. This is a TSMC 12nm FinFET processor for the entry-level 4G smartphone segment focused on boosting battery life. The A25 is an eight-core chip with four Cortex A53 cores clocked up to 1.80GHz and four Cortex A53 cores at 1.50GHz. Needless to say that this phone is not going to win any spec wars. But when coupled with 4GBof RAM, I did not encounter any issues running my usual slate of apps. In regular use, I wasn't able to discern a huge difference between the Teracube 2e and my older Pixel 3A. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Having said that, this phone was quite capable of playing games and switching between apps without any hiccups. I played Subway Surfers, BB Racing, Hill Climb, and Angry Birds while switching back and forth between the games and apps without any hassles. The phone didn't get unusually warm when playing these games either. Knowing what processor is on the phone, I deliberately steered away from Call of Duty or PUBG type games. </p>
<p> Geekbench scores were as expected, 138 for Single-Core score and 840 for Multi-Core score. The A25 isn't the fastest processor in this segment, and stock Android runs well enough. However, you'll definitely feel that it's a budget phone when compared to a faster 90Hz or 120Hz device with a better processor and more RAM. </p>
<p> As soon as you set the phone up you will notice that about 10GB storage is set aside for the system software and basic Google apps. So almost 50+ GB of storage is still available for your regular apps and games. For additional storage one can always add a micro SD card. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The display is the best part of this budget-friendly device </p>
<p> The 6.1-inch IPS display is better than what I expected in a device at this price-point. It has a 720 x 1560 HD+ resolution with 280 ppi and 450 nits of brightness. The screen definitely does not look washed out compared to most other devices in this price category. Screen resolution is good enough that on-screen content doesn't show any noticeable pixelation despite my efforts at pixel peeping. Visibility outdoors in broad daylight is surprisingly quite good. Night light mode along with eye protection modes are two additional nice features, especially at this price point. </p>
<p> Keep in mind, this is not a high-end panel but within the price segment, this panel punches way above its weight class. Color accuracy is quite decent and the screen is responsive to touch. I did not see any lag between my touch inputs and the screen's behavior. </p>
<p> The tempered glass on the display panel is from Mantix. Teracube will ship the device with a factory-installed screen protector. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Software on Teracube 2e is Stock Android 10 </p>
<p> Our test unit came with the Teracube_2e_01 build based on Android 10 with the September 2020 security patch. Stock Android with zero bloatware means the phone feels fast and snappy in regular use. Teracube promises that its devices will receive Android OS software and security updates for three years from the time of purchase. Their software support policy is way better than most other manufacturers in this price range. Teracube is promising the Android 11 update by Summer 2021. </p>
<p> Battery life is quite acceptable </p>
<p> The 4,000-mAh battery capacity frequently lasted a full day, with around 40 percent left by 10 pm. Screen-on time was usually between 7 and 8 hours depending on usage before the battery went down to 0%. With moderate use, you can get almost 2-day usage from this device. Additionally, this is a replaceable battery so down the line, you don't need a new device if you find yourself topping up the battery often. </p>
<p> Since Teracube does not include a charging brick or a USB-C cable in the box you need to be aware of a few things when it comes to charging the device. The charging brick that came with my Pixel wasn't recognized by the phone. I then used a 10W power brick and a generic USB-C cable and the phone started charging without any issues. I think you may have a couple of trials before you find a brick/cable combination that satisfactorily charges this phone I wasn't able to trigger the charging quickly prompt despite trying about 5 different charging output bricks with a high-quality USB-C cable. </p>
<p> Charging time was 2 hours and 45 minutes from zero to full battery capacity which is definitely on the high side. About 70% charge was reached in about 1 hour 25 minutes though. </p>
<p> Camera output surprised me but the app can be better </p>
<p> Teracube 2e main camera on the rear is a 13MP f/2.8 with a focal length of 3.46mm. The pixel size is 1.12 µm and the view angle is 68.5°. A wide-angle 8MP f/2.2 with a focal length of 1.6mm is also included along with a LED flash. The pixel size for the wide-angle camera sensor is 1.12 µm and the view angle is 97.5°. The selfie camera is identical to the rear wide-angle camera. </p>
<p> Good outdoor light results in reasonably good pictures that you can view or share on social media. On a smartphone or a tablet, the pictures look decent. Try viewing them on a large screen monitor and any attempt at pixel peeping will be disappointing. Outdoor pictures show good color and detail in close up shots. </p>
<p> Blue skies are a hit or a miss depending on the framing of the shot. More often than not the sky tends to wash out. Indoor shots in low light are quite grainy. With daylight coming through the window or artificial light, they are passable. Selfie camera results are acceptable in outdoor light. </p>
<p> My main issue is that the camera app takes a bit of fidgeting to switch modes. To use the wide-angle lens you need to toggle over to the Wide mode. Wide-angle lens pictures show distortion at the edges. The camera app also offers Panorama and Pro Mode options. HDR mode is there but you need to turn it on manually. Since HDR mode was quite slow in capturing pictures, I typically did not use it. There is no dedicated Night mode so keep that in mind as you look at some sample photos below. </p>
<p> Video is FHD or 1080p for both front and rear cameras. Microphone performance in video mode for both front and rear cameras was surprisingly good. Video quality is good enough that it will not dissuade you from using it as long as there is decent lighting. </p>
<p> Image stabilization is missing but that is the case with pretty much most smartphones in this category. The camera takes perhaps half a second longer than higher-end devices to focus. But neither of those two issues are deal-breakers in my opinion. </p>
<p> In summary, the camera is definitely serviceable and performs admirably for its price. However, if the camera and video quality are top priorities for you then you should definitely look elsewhere. </p>
<p> Audio quality is way better than expected </p>
<p> There is only one bottom-firing speaker on the right-hand corner but it gets reasonably loud when playing music or videos on YouTube. The top speaker produces good output for voice calls. </p>
<p> Audio coming via the headphone jack is actually a lot better than I anticipated. Bluetooth audio quality on my Enacfire E60 earbuds was satisfactory but definitely not as good as the headphone jack. </p>
<p> Connectivity is excellent </p>
<p> As promised, I got LTE and VoLTE on the device as soon as I put my T-Mobile SIM card in it. The data speeds were comparable to what I get on my Pixel 4 XL on the same network. T-Moblie, MetroPCS, and other T-Mobile MVNOs are fully supported out of the box. </p>
<p> Teracube is working to get the device certified so you can use it on AT&T as well. Since this is a GSM device, Verizon users are out of luck at this time. </p>
<p> Call quality was excellent using the main mic (handset) or via the speakerphone mode. Sending texts, downloading apps, streaming music via Spotify, and watching videos on YouTube was seamless. Bluetooth 5.0 made pairing with my E60 earbuds quick and easy. There was no difference in call connectivity when using a wired headset using the 3.5mm headphone jack or via Bluetooth. </p>
<p> FM Radio works fine on the phone as well along with Wi-Fi calling. NFC for Android Share / Google Pay is a welcome feature in the COVID-19 era and quite often omitted in phones in this price category. </p>
<p> Should you consider buying a Teracube 2e? </p>
<p> Having used Teracube 2e for over a week I can safely say that it meets its goal of being an affordable sub $200 smartphone. It has a functional ergonomic design, better than expected display, good audio, and connectivity. It boasts clean bloat-free software, great battery life, and a decent camera. </p>
<p> There are a few downsides as pointed out in various parts of this review but none of them is a resounding deal breaker. </p>
<p> A battery that is replaceable along with a 4-year warranty and, low flat-fee repairs provides a compelling case for keeping your smartphone longer than 2 years. Additionally, the free two-way shipping and 3-year guaranteed software updates are welcome add-ons and unheard of in this price segment. </p>
<p> To conclude the Teracube 2e review, if you are looking for an affordable smartphone that will get support for quite some time in the future then Teracube 2e should definitely be on your shortlist. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / The Android TV Dongle Seems To Have Low-Latency Game Mode Support </p>
<p> The Android TV Dongle Seems To Have Low-Latency Game Mode Support </p>
<p> The Android TV dongle will potentially be compatible with Stadia, and thanks to the discovery of support for a low-latency game mode it may be better suited for the job than the Chromecast Ultra. </p>
<p> XDA Developers has found information that points to ALLM, or Auto Low Latency mode, which suggests that Google wants this device to have game mode support. Most likely for Stadia. </p>
<p> You can play Android games on Android TV. But low latency seems like something that would be much more important for Google's cloud gaming platform. Given that you need to stream games to play them and the less latency the better. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Users would still need a TV with ALLM to utilize the Android TV game mode </p>
<p> Low-latency game mode support for this dongle is a good start to better gaming experiences. But it won't do you any good if you don't have a TV that supports ALLM. </p>
<p> So that's worth keeping in mind if you plan to pick one of these up after they officially launch and use it for some gaming. If you have one of those TVs though, the dongle should be able to switch on this mode automatically. </p>
<p> Perhaps anytime you boot up a Stadia game, this dongle would be able to detect that and switch over to this low-latency mode. Overall that would probably lead to a better gaming experience. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Android TV support for Stadia is already technically in place </p>
<p> Google pushed out a handful of changes to Stadia earlier this week. Part of that update to the platform included experimental support for more devices. </p>
<p> Of which one of those was Android TV devices. Since this support isn't official, the app technically has to be sideloaded and there are a couple of workarounds that you have to do to get things going. Like using a mouse and keyboard for the initial sing-in process. </p>
<p> After all that though, you can generally start playing games the way you would if you were streaming from the Chromecast Ultra. With Android TV support being experimental, proper support through this upcoming dongle would make things a breeze. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And there's a chance that support may be official around the time of the Android TV dongle launch. Whenever that happens to be. </p>
<p> One thing is for sure. Google needs to add support for Stadia Android TV quickly. Because GeForce NOW just gained its own experimental support for Android TV. The app is however much more accessible as it doesn't need to be sideloaded. </p>
<p> It's still experimental, so it might not work as well for some. But it's there. </p>

<p> The ASUS ROG Phone 3 Has A Hidden Display Refresh Rate </p>
<p> The refresh rate of the ROG Phone 3 display is already one of the highest on any smartphone out there. </p>
<p> It does however compete with other devices in the gaming phone space. The recently announced Lenovo Legion Phone Duel is one of those phones. As is the Red Magic 5S that was just announced by Nubia. </p>
<p> But ASUS may have set the bar just a little higher during its development stages. As it was recently discovered that the ROG Phone 3 display actually has the capability to go beyond 144Hz. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is a hidden refresh rate that isn't listed in the official spec sheet of the device. But it is there. And if anything it could point to what ASUS may be working on for future gaming smartphones. </p>
<p> The ROG Phone 3 refresh rate can go up to 160Hz </p>
<p> According to XDA Developers, it's possible to engage the display on the ROG Phone 3 to go up to 160Hz. </p>
<p> Pushing past the official refresh rate of 144Hz. ASUS apparently tested the display in supporting this refresh rate. But it never made it into the final version of the device as a user-facing feature. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At least not without performing a couple tweaks first. The 160Hz refresh rate is there. But to get to it you need to enable some options. Notably though, this requires plugging the device into your PC with a USB cable and pushing commands to it through the ADB Shell. </p>
<p> So this isn't something that just anyone will likely want to interact with. Moreover, the 160Hz refresh rate isn't going to be supported by much at this point. </p>
<p> While you may get smoother scrolling on your screen, no mobile games are going to support 160Hz refresh right now. At least not officially. There are barely any that support the 144Hz refresh rate which is the official refresh rate cap on the phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ASUS' 4th-Gen ROG Phone may bump up to a 160Hz refresh rate </p>
<p> This is purely speculation, but it's not crazy to think that ASUS could actually be considering a 160Hz refresh rate for the ROG Phone 4. Should there be one. </p>
<p> The fact that it's possible to enable a 160Hz refresh rate in the third phone showcases that the company was at least experimenting and testing the phone with it. </p>
<p> And even if you do need to push commands to the device through the ADB Shell, the feature is still there. The hardware supports it. It might not be properly calibrated, but it's there. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However perhaps ASUS didn't see the need to ship the ROG Phone 3 with a 160Hz display. Moving forward, it could look to use that as it's next step up. </p>

<p> The Best-selling Android Phones In Q3 2019 List Has A Surprise At The Top </p>
<p> Counterpoint Research has just published its latest Market Pulse report for the ten best-selling smartphones globally in Q3 2019. The top ten list includes eight Android smartphones and two iPhone models. And surprisingly, Samsung's entry-level smartphone Galaxy A10 has emerged as the best-selling Android smartphone during the third quarter of the year. </p>
<p> With a global market share of 2.6 percent, the Samsung Galaxy A10 was second only to Apple's iPhone XR in Q3 2019. The iPhone XR, which accounted for three percent of the total smartphones sold during the same period, has been the best selling smartphone every quarter since Q4 last year, Counterpoint says. </p>
<p> Samsung has two more Galaxy A phones in the top ten. Galaxy A50, which is perhaps the most appealing mid-range offering from Samsung this year, was the second most popular Android smartphone during the three month period between July to September 2019. The smartphone sits third in the overall list with a global market share of 1.9 percent. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy A20 is the third Samsung smartphone to make it to the top ten list. Capturing 1.4 percent of the global market, the handset was the seventh most popular smartphone during the quarter and fifth best-selling Android smartphone. </p>
<p> Like Samsung, Oppo also has three A series devices in the top ten list. The Oppo A9, Oppo A5s, and the Oppo A5 find themselves at the number four, number six, and number eight spots with 1.6 percent, 1.5 percent, and 1.3 percent global market share respectively. </p>
<p> Apple's iPhone 11 sneaks in at the number five spot with 1.6 percent market share globally. Xiaomi's Redmi 7A with a 1.2 percent market share was the ninth most popular smartphone during the quarter. The Huawei P30 completes the top ten with a 1.1 percent market share. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Mid-range phones toppling the flagships </p>
<p> As you could see, Huawei's P30 is the only Android flagship in the top ten list, at the tenth spot. Neither of Samsung's Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10 flagships makes the cut. To be fair, S10 was launched in Q1 and people buying a Samsung flagship in Q3 probably waited for Note 10, which arrived too late Q3 to get a fair shot. Expect Note 10 to make an appearance in the chart for the fourth quarter of the year. </p>
<p> However, that's certainly not the only reason. Counterpoint says the combined sales of the top ten models increased nine percent year on year from 15 percent in Q3 2018 to 17 percent in Q3 2019. However, the combined revenue fell 30 percent year on year. Also, the top ten list featured five flagships last year, but only three this year. </p>
<p> This indicates that people are increasingly opting for mid-range smartphones as they are getting more and more powerful with each passing quarter. Increasing competition among OEMs means a flurry of traditionally premium features is now making their way into mid-range phones, making them an excellent value proposition. Expect this trend to continue with the arrival of mid-range 5G phones next year. </p>

<p> The Fire TV Stick Lite Is Light On Design Changes </p>
<p> A new set of leaked images for Amazon's upcoming Fire TV Stick Lite showcases that it's light on design changes. </p>
<p> More or less, it looks exactly the same as the most recent version of the standard Fire TV Stick. Right now, the standard model isn't something you can buy directly from Amazon. So the speculation is that this Lite version is going to be Amazon's new model that takes over that price point. </p>
<p> Above that in cost, will be the Fire TV Stick 4K. Which is currently the only one that you can buy on Amazon officially. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Fire TV Stick Lite design changes are mostly on the remote </p>
<p> It's the remote for the setup that really sees the most changes here. And even then those are pretty minimal. </p>
<p> There appears to be a new button that Amazon has included here which lets you control something on the TV. The button itself even has a TV logo printed on it. So it's clear that this is likely to be a quick access button for launching stuff. </p>
<p> What isn't clear is what the button will do exactly. Perhaps it can be configured to quick launch any number of TV streaming apps designated by the user. Or perhaps Amazon has different plan for it entirely. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Aside from the new TV button, both the remote and the stick itself have the more barebones Amazon logo. The remote also now loses the button for powering the remote on and off. So presumably it'll just work at all times as long as you press buttons and it has power. </p>
<p> Amazon has also seemingly updated the power supply and the adapter with this new stick. </p>
<p> Coming soon? </p>
<p> Amazon has already announced that it's got an event coming up. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In fact it takes place on September 24, which is Thursday. That means we could be seeing this Fire TV Stick Lite at the event. It's also not impossible that Amazon could announce the release date and availability information for the device. </p>
<p> There are bound to be more devices announced aside from the Fire TV Stick Lite too. If the new stick is announced. Because Amazon probably wouldn't hold an entire Fall event for just a single new TV stick. </p>
<p> It would put out a press release for that. This suggests that Amazon has quite a few things to show off in a couple of days. What all the products may be is unclear, however. </p>

<p> The Lenovo Legion Leaks Again Just Days Before An Official Reveal </p>
<p> Lenovo is close to officially announcing the Legion phone with just a few more days to go, and yet, another set of leaks has popped up showing more of what the device will look like. </p>
<p> To be clear, these leaks of the Lenovo Legion are not much different (if any different at all) from some of the previous ones. The only difference may be the available colors. In past leaked images of the device, the Legion has shown up in a blue color like you see above. </p>
<p> These new leaked images however show the device with a more sinister look. Sort of matching what the phone looked like even earlier this year when leaked images showed up of the packaging. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo Legion leaks confirm that the phone will come in a black and red option </p>
<p> New images of the Legion surfaced earlier this morning. What's more is that they came from Lenovo's own Legion social page on Weibo. </p>
<p> Even though the company is set to unveil the Legion officially on July 22, which is next Wednesday, it's not wasting any time in hyping up consumers for the upcoming gaming phone. </p>
<p> This is perhaps the right move. Considering that ASUS will be officially unveiling the ROG Phone 3 on July 21, just one day earlier. Both phones are bound to compete with each other. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Seeing as how they will both be coming with top-tier hardware including state of the art cooling tech for gaming phones, as well as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ mobile platform. It would make sense then that Lenovo would want to drum up some excitement over its own device. </p>
<p> Especially when you consider that social engagement for this kind of thing is the norm in China. It's essentially free marketing without having to spend money on large billboards or video ads. </p>
<p> No word on if the phone will launch in the US or not </p>
<p> It would make sense for Lenovo to release the Legion in the US, but at this point there's not much to suggest that it has plans to. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The phone is set to be unveiled next week, but the only official information on it is on Lenovo's Chinese website via the Legion landing page. Meanwhile the page for the ROG Phone 3 is available on the US version of the site from ASUS. Not to mention the ROG Phone II and original ROG Phone are already available in the country. </p>
<p> Lenovo does make a fair bit of product that you can get in the US though, and more than a few other gaming phones have already released in the US. Lenovo also has a decent-sized gaming presence here with its Legion PCs. </p>

<p> The Lenovo Smart Frame Will Start Shipping In August </p>
<p> The Lenovo Smart Frame that was announced at CES earlier this year, is going to start shipping in August. </p>
<p> This means that we'll still have to wait a few more months to get our hands on one. But that is pretty common for products that are announced at CES. So that's not a big surprise. </p>
<p> But the shipping date isn't all the news that Lenovo has in regards to the Smart Frame today. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Lenovo Smart Frame will have Google Photos support </p>
<p> When Lenovo showed this off in January, it didn't have Google Photos integration, which was pretty surprising. Since it is a "Smart Frame" and pretty much purpose built for Google Photos. </p>
<p> Well, now we know that it does have Google Photos integration. So you can throw up a an album from Google Photos and have it show up on the Smart Frame, which is pretty neat. </p>
<p> It's also great for holidays, as you can relive your favorite moments on the Lenovo Smart Frame. And it'll look great when you have guests over. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As a refresher, the Lenovo Smart Frame is a 21-inch smart display that is meant to look like a picture frame that you'd hang up on the wall. And with Google Photos integration, you're going to be able to throw your own photos up onto the wall, on the Lenovo Smart Frame. Which is an easy way to make your home look like it's yours and change out pictures from time to time. </p>
<p> If you back it on Indiegogo, you can get it half off </p>
<p> While the Lenovo Smart Frame won't officially be launching until August, it is going up on Indiegogo fairly soon. And you can get it for half off, through Indiegogo. </p>
<p> So it'll be $199, instead of the regular $399 price tag. Which is a very impressive price for the Lenovo Smart Frame, actually. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's a bit odd that Lenovo is using a crowdfunding platform to back the Smart Frame though. Considering Lenovo is one of the biggest PC companies in the world. But Lenovo says it wants to build a "passionate community" for the Lenovo Smart Frame. And it believes that Indiegogo is a great place to do just that. </p>
<p> So if you are looking to pick up the Lenovo Smart Frame from Indiegogo, you can head to Lenovo's website and sign up for updates so that when it does launch on Indiegogo, you can get your order in and "back" it. </p>

<p> The New Echo Show 10 Will Follow Your Every Move, Literally </p>
<p> In addition to a brand-new design, the device comes with some interesting new features. Like its ability to follow your every move. Literally. With the front-facing camera in the top right corner of the screen, the device can recognize your movement and when you step out of frame. </p>
<p> It can then use that knowledge to follow you to your new position around the room. That way you're always facing the display and can see what's being shown on it. This is a very nice idea that many people will probably love. Especially if it's being used for video calls or watching shows. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Even if the whole concept seems a little bit too "sentient robot" for some people's tastes, it's a feature that will undoubtedly be appreciated. </p>
<p> The new Echo Show 10 sits on a swivel base so it can spin around </p>
<p> Part of the magic of the new device is the base. It's motorized so it can swivel around and pan the display to face you. </p>
<p> That's paired with the 13-megapixel camera in the corner and some computer vision technology to tell where you are in the room. These pieces together allow the Echo Show 10 to follow you around. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The idea is to allow users to interact with the device not only completely hands-free, but with constant visual contact because they aren't missing out on content. Since it swivels, you don't have to worry about stepping away to do something and then hurry back to see what's on the screen. </p>
<p> Essentially you can stay on task with whatever it is you're doing. Amazon says that a large majority of people use the Echo Show in the kitchen when cleaning, cooking, eating etc. </p>
<p> So the idea to give the device the capability to move with you stems from people's use of the older Echo Show devices and always having to go back and forth between tasks and content. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You still need to engage the Alexa keyword for it to turn </p>
<p> Amazon says that while the Echo Show 10 can swivel to face you, it won't do so automatically. Not unless you're watching a video at least. </p>
<p> If you're not watching a video, you still need to interact with it by saying the "Alexa" keyword or touch the display. If you use your voice, it uses the location recognition of your voice with various collected data points to gauge where you are and then swivel to face that point in the room. </p>
<p> It may not move on its own accord whenever you move around (mostly), but at least you don't have to touch it or press any buttons. You can, but it's not required. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The base also uses a brushless motor and it's apparently completely silent when it turns. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2020/08/the-rog-phone-3-vapor-chamber-massive.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484984" filename="the-rog-phone-3-vapor-chamber-massive.html">
<p> This HUGE Vapor Chamber Is How ASUS Keeps The ROG Phone 3 Cool </p>
<p> The ROG Phone 3 is touted as having quite a few improvements over the previous model phone, and one of those is the brand-new vapor chamber ASUS used. </p>
<p> This new vapor chamber is supposed to keep the ROG Phone 3 cooler than the one that was used in the ROG phone II. Which, admittedly can get a little hot if you have things tuned up all the way. </p>
<p> Meaning you're using the 120Hz refresh rate and you're playing with brightness all the way up and playing a game that makes use of the faster frame rate. How does ASUS achieve better cooling in its latest gaming smartphone? Apparently by using a rather HUGE vapor chamber. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Check out the ROG Phone 3 vapor chamber in this teardown video </p>
<p> You get a peek at just how big it really is in this teardown video (which you can view below) from Zack Nelson, better known as JerryRigEverything. </p>
<p> To get to it, Nelson has to take the phone apart beyond a point of where he'll be able to get it back to working order. But seeing the vapor chamber appears to be too much to resist. </p>
<p> Based on the footage, the vapor chamber really is a massive part of the phone's components. And is about the size of the battery or slightly larger. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The battery stretches from the bottom edge of the rear camera array to almost the bottom of the phone. So it's quite large. The vapor chamber sits under the battery covered by a couple layers of tape. The second layer of which is made from copper just like the vapor chamber. </p>
<p> It also spreads nearly the entire width of the phone. So it seems ASUS took its experience from the ROG Phone II and did everything it could to ensure a more comfortable experience when gaming on its new device. </p>
<p> All this should amount to much improved cooling </p>
<p> It'll be tough to tell without actually using the device to compare it to the ROG Phone II. But it seems the ROG Phone 3 may just be able to keep things a lot cooler. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Or, cooler than the last phone. The large vapor chamber plus the functional heat sink should do a pretty good job preventing the phone from warming your fingers and hands to uncomfortable levels. </p>
<p> And all that will likely play into the price of the ROG Phone 3 in the US. Once ASUS decide to officially announce that along with an official US release date. </p>

<p> This Is The First Official Look At The ASUS ROG Phone 3 </p>
<p> If you were waiting for your first official look at the ASUS ROG Phone 3, wait no longer. Because this is it. </p>
<p> A recent leak from Evan Blass this morning shows what the official global version of the ROG Phone 3 will look like. It's mostly the same as the leaked image from earlier this year. The only difference being that the "Tencent" logo that was shown on that earlier leak now says "Republic of Gamers." </p>
<p> Considering that, it's likely that the earlier leaked version is a model exclusive to China that is part of a partnership with Tencent. A Chinese game publisher. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> An official design leak of the ROG Phone 3 at this point was inevitable </p>
<p> ASUS is set to launch the ROG Phone 3 in a little less than 6 days. Based on the landing page ASUS put up back on July 1, the date of the unveiling will be on this coming Tuesday, July 21. </p>
<p> This will be one day before the Lenovo Legion is revealed. Which is scheduled to be announced and launched on July 22 according to Lenovo's pre-order page that went live yesterday. </p>
<p> The one thing to take into account is that ASUS' landing page is its US-based site. So next Tuesday's reveal of the ROG Phone 3 is sure to include a US-related reveal for the phone. Which should include details about its availability and pricing in the US as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In Lenovo's case, the information is on its Chinese site. So the Legion reveal may not include anything relating to the US availability. If it'll be available in the US at all. </p>
<p> "The design hasn't changed much, and that's ok" </p>
<p> ASUS has certainly made a few tweaks to the design of the ROG Phone 3 compared to the ROG Phone II. The design still hasn't changed much, though, and that's ok. </p>
<p> The ROG Phone II is a stellar looking phone. So there was no need for ASUS to change much about it. That being said it has updated some of the hardware so there are a couple of things that are noticeably different and needed to changed to fit ASUS' vision for the device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For example, the rear camera array. There is now a third sensor so ASUS needed to extend the array just a little bit to make room for it. ASUS has also seemingly removed the little vent for the aerodynamic system on the back of the ROG Phone II. </p>
<p> Overall though the design is very much the same and it still looks just as clean. Not without its obvious gamer aesthetic, of course. </p>

<p> This Is The New Google TV-Powered Chromecast In All Its Glory </p>
<p> The new Chromecast with Google TV was leaked this morning, and with that leak was a slew of images that shows off the packaging, the device, and everything else that comes with it. </p>
<p> Prior to Google's upcoming event, where the Chromecast with Google TV is expected to make its official debut, this seems to be as close as anyone is going to get to seeing it. </p>
<p> The Chromecast with Google TV was initially discovered earlier this year. Leaked promotional images showed off the device in at least three colors. One of which is the Snow (white) color that popped up in today's leaks. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That being said the design of the device was already known. These are however the first real life images of it (spotted by 9To5Google) that have surfaced. </p>
<p> The Chromecast with Google TV still looks pretty small </p>
<p> This was probably expected but the device still looks pretty small. </p>
<p> The oval shape sounded like it could be a significantly bigger than the Chromecast Ultra, but that doesn't appear to be the case. It does look bigger, but not by much. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's nearly the same size as the remote that comes with it in the box. And of course it still has the same HDMI plug with a flat band that the current Chromecast has. This is also magnetic so it can be attached to the back of the actual dongle. </p>
<p> Google is suspected to charge about $50 for this device. Which puts it a little below what the Chromecast Ultra costs. And if the price is accurate it'll be a decent value. Though it probably doesn't support 4K. </p>
<p> The remote has dedicated buttons for YouTube, Netflix, and Google Assistant </p>
<p> Google is making it pretty easy to get to a few different useful features. Notably, YouTube, Netflix, and Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The remote that comes with the Chromecast in the box has a dedicated button for each of those. Allowing you to either launch one of the video streaming service with a single press, or interact with Google Assistant on the fly. </p>
<p> There are also buttons for home, back, volume adjustment, muting, input method, and power. In the box you also get the power adapter for the dongle, a USB-C to USB-A cable, and 2 AAA batteries for the remote. </p>
<p> So instead of being something you can recharge, it acts more like a normal TV remote would. You simply swap out the batteries once new ones are needed. Meaning you have one less thing to charge. </p>

<p> This Is What The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Probably Looks Like </p>
<p> A recent leak appears to showcase what the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 probably looks like. </p>
<p> First and foremost, these are renders which were created using information from CAD drawings and designs. So these are not officially from Samsung itself. That means the design could very well change and there are some elements which could be different from these renders when Samsung finally launches the tablet. </p>
<p> All that said, it's still possible that this is the design in full. If this Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 design is entirely accurate, this will be a very thin device. With extremely thing bezels to match and a big, bright beautiful display to show off all your content. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 will come with an 11-inch display </p>
<p> Speaking of big, bright, beautiful displays, the display on this upcoming tablet is apparently going to be 11-inches. Plenty big enough to use for everything from media and games to homework and work projects. </p>
<p> In addition to the tablet's display size, the tablet is rumored to be just 6.3mm thick. It will also be 253.7mm long and 165.33mm wide. If all the rumored dimensions are accurate. </p>
<p> One thing to keep in mind is that the report alleges the tablet will be "around these dimensions." Which means they may not be exactly this size but could be pretty close. Either way, it sounds like Samsung has designed a pretty sizable tablet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There will be two rear cameras </p>
<p> Based on these renders, Samsung has included two rear cameras on the tablet. Something which is a bit of a different approach as tablets are not necessarily the best for taking pictures. </p>
<p> Even if the cameras are decent quality, tablets are bigger, heavier, and more clunky than smartphones when it comes to holding them in landscape mode for photos. </p>
<p> All that aside, there doesn't seem to be any information on the resolution of the cameras on the back. Just that there will be two sensors there. One will likely be for the main part of photos, while the other could be depth or wide-angle. And knowing Samsung's track record for wide-angle sensors, it could very well be a wide-angle sensor. </p>

<p> It will use USB Type-C for the charging port and have bottom-mounted speakers. As well as a slot for either a SIM card or expandable memory. There's a front-facing camera too, on the right-size bezel so it's on top when holding the tablet in landscape. </p>
<p> You can more of the images of the tablet below, in addition to a video that shows the 3D renders from multiple sides. </p>

<p> This Is Why The Speakers On The ASUS ROG Phone 3 Are So Good </p>
<p> On July 22 ASUS announced the ROG Phone 3, boasting improvements over the last version of the device, including updated speakers that promise higher quality and more immersive audio than before. </p>
<p> The ROG Phone II was widely praised for how good its audio was. And the ROG Phone 3 speakers are already shaping up to surpass those of the ROG Phone II. </p>
<p> That's essentially because of ASUS' partnership with Dirac. The two companies worked together to collaborate and bring mobile gamers unparalleled sound. And whether you have audio playing through the speakers or a pair of headphones, that high-quality audio should be noticeably present. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The secret to the ROG Phone 3 speakers is Dirac's Immersive Audio Solution </p>
<p> So you know that the speakers sound good. Or you've heard from someone you know that they sound good. But how exactly? </p>
<p> The secret is in the Immersive Audio Solution technology from Dirac. ASUS worked with Dirac to employ this technology into the speakers. Without getting into the technical side of things, this helps the speakers on the phone produce a higher quality audio that mimics surround sound to a stunning degree. </p>
<p> Dirac says it uses the solution to "co-optimize" the impulses and frequencies of the speakers. Which leads to the acoustical experience being broader, thus forming what seems like surround sound to the user. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When gaming on the phone, this is no doubt likely to enhance the experience to a much more enjoyable level. </p>
<p> The sound is improved on headphones too, but it's limited to ones from ASUS </p>
<p> A big benefit of the Dirac audio solution used on this phone is how much better it makes things sound. This works for headphones too, but only for a select few headsets right now. </p>
<p> These unfortunately only include a handful of pairs from ASUS. So if you want the improvements, you'll need to either get one of the supported pairs or simply listen through the phone speakers themselves. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A few of the headsets that support the Immersive Audio Solution are the ASUS ROG Cetra, ROG Delta, ROG Strix GO 2.4, and the ROG Theta 7.1. </p>
<p> There are other ROG headphones or headsets that will work with this technology too, but which ones specifically aren't mentioned. Regardless of whether or not you have a ROG headset, the speakers on the ROG Phone 3 are likely to be the best on the market for some time. </p>
<p> If you're a mobile gamer who values immersive audio, consider this device as your upgrade. </p>

<p> Three OnePlus TVs Get New Features, Including Kids Mode & More </p>
<p> OnePlus has started pushing out a new update for OnePlus TVs, and that update brings new features along with it. Both Q series OnePlus TVs are getting these new features, along with a brand new OnePlus TV 55U1. </p>
<p> So, both flagship TV models are getting it, and the company’s largest budget option. As most of you probably already know, the OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 launched last year. The OnePlus TV 55U1 followed quite recently, along with two other models. </p>
<p> This new update is bringing Data Saver Plus, Kids Mode, and a Connect app for iOS devices (that can be downloaded from the App Store). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> New update for OnePlus TVs weighs 853MB, and brings new features to the table </p>
<p> This update weighs about 853MB, and it is rolling out as we speak. Do note that all of these TVs have been launched in India only, at least for now. </p>
<p> It is also worth pointing out that this is a staged rollout. In other words, it is rolling out at the moment, but it may not be available to everyone just yet. It is rolling out in stages, basically. Everyone should get it in the coming days, though. </p>
<p> Now, for those of you who are wondering what is Data Saver Plus. That is an enhanced version of the Data Saver feature, says OnePlus. It will keep a check on data usage through bandwidth control. It will also enable data usage alerts, and will monitor monthly usage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Kids Mode is yet another addition here. Many parents will probably find this useful. Thanks to this mode, you can enforce control on apps, limit watch times, and an eye protection function is also included. </p>
<p> In this version, you can also long-press any poster in the OxygenPlay homepage in order to see a pop-up window with information, and enhanced UI. </p>
<p> These are some useful features the company has added, that’s for sure. Kids Mode was long overdue for the OnePlus TV Q1 and Q1 Pro units, and it’s finally here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These new TVs are considerably more affordable than the Q1 and Q1 Pro models </p>
<p> That being said, the all-new OnePlus TVs are considerably more affordable than the OnePlus Q1 and Q1 Pro. Truth be said, they’re also inferior to the company’s 4K TVs. </p>
<p> Still, the all-new OnePlus TVs are quite compelling in their own right. Truth be said, the smallest one is only HD ready, but the other two come with fullHD+ panels. </p>
<p> OnePlus is expected to continue releasing updates for its TVs, all of them. We’re expecting to see some new features and various improvements in the coming months. </p>

<p> T-Mobile Launches LG Velvet 5G Powered By The New Dimensity 1000C SoC </p>
<p> The LG Velvet 5G is already available from AT&T and Verizon in the US. As seen in the international markets, both the carriers are offering the Snapdragon 765G-powered variant. Today, T-Mobile has officially launched its "exclusive LG Velvet 5G" smartphone powered by the all-new MediaTek Dimensity 1000C SoC. </p>
<p> Apart from featuring a different chipset and a smaller battery, T-Mobile's variant is no different from the LG Velvet 5G sold by the other two carriers. First off, it looks premium with the LG's new design language featuring a raindrop camera setup and 3D curved edges. The device comes in Aurora Gray and Pink White color options. </p>
<p> The T-Mobile Velvet 5G comes with the new MediaTek Dimensity 1000C chipset </p>
<p> Comparing the specifications, the Dimensity 1000C looks like a superior chipset to the Snapdragon 765G 5G. It is built on 7nm process and comes packed with 4x Cortex-A77 cores clocked at 2.0GHz and 4x Cortex-A55 CPU cores clocked at 2.0GHz. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the 5-core Mali-G57 GPU, the graphics performance of the chip should be comparable with that of Snapdragon 765G. Also, the Dimensity 1000C is the first 5G chipset from MediaTek to launch in the US. It's IP68 certified for water and dust resistance and MIL-STD-810G certified for durability. </p>
<p> Speaking of the other specifications, the LG Velvet 5G sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with Full HD+ (2340 × 1080 pixels) resolution and 20.5:9 aspect ratio. The waterdrop notch on the front features a 16-megapixel selfie camera. It includes 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. </p>
<p> With the MicroSD card slot, the storage can be expanded technically up to 2TB. The device runs on Android 10 out of the box. On the rear, the triple camera setup features a 48-megapixel primary camera, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and a 5-megapixel depth camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It packs in a slightly smaller battery </p>
<p> With all these specifications, the device is kept powered on by a 4,000mAh battery and supports 18W fast charging. In comparison, the Snapdragon 765G-powered LG Velvet came with a 4,300mAh battery. The device sports stereo speakers and also a 3.5mm audio jack. </p>
<p> Connectivity options include Wi-Fi, 5G, LTE, Bluetooth 5.1, NFC, and USB Type-C port. There is also a dedicated Google Assistant button on the left edge of the device. It will be available starting September 10 for $588 or $0 down with $24.50 per month for 24 months. </p>
<p> Consumers can also save up to 50-percent with an eligible trade-in device or by adding a new line. And this is a deal that's applicable to both new and existing customers. Moreover, the T-Mobile LG Velvet 5G is also cheaper than the AT&T and Verizon variants and that too by featuring a superior chipset. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Casual Games – March 2020 </p>
<p> Casual games are many things and sometimes they're nothing but time wasters, but some of the best casual games are there to not only help you pass the time but also deliver a great gaming experience that you really do enjoy. </p>
<p> Casual games can also be a great way to relax and wind down from a more hectic day. They're also generally great for kids because of the more mild themes. </p>
<p> However you slice it, casual games are a huge hit and they offer a wide variety of gameplay elements and stories. What they don't usually do is deliver a hardcore experience that requires a lot of your attention. So they're great if you aren't looking to dive too deep into a complex story or combat system. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are lots of casual games on Android. So we've handpicked 10 of the best casual games you'll find on Google Play and have rounded them up here in this list. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Android Casual Games – Summary </p>
<p> Below is a summary table of which games are on this list. If you're short on time and simply want to see which games we picked, you can view them all directly from the table included here. </p>
<p> If you want to read a little more about each of our picks, as well as check out the associated game trailers, you can view the actual longer list below the summary table. </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Android Casual Games – Ranked List </p>
<p> Potion maker </p>
<p> Concocting potions generally takes a lot of time and effort. It's a common staple within many RPG games too. But Potion Maker is neither of those things. </p>
<p> It's a simple to play casual game where you make potions of various types. There are multiple character unlocks and a relatively easy tutorial walkthrough that helps you become acquainted with the different things to do. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you're looking for something extremely casual that won't be too involved, this is it. </p>
<p> Tape It Up! </p>
<p> The goal of this game is as simple as it gets really. Just as simple as making potions. You work in a factory that appears to ship a bunch of stuff and you have to make sure all the packages are taped up. </p>
<p> Sometimes you don't have tape though and you still need to make sure that the packages are sealed. So you use whatever you have on hand. Maybe it's bacon, maybe it's an octopus who seals the boxes up with its ink. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are tons of crazy ways to make sure all the boxes get taped up in time. You can also unlock more than 20 different characters (the things you use to tape up the packages), and over 40 unique themes. There are more than 50 levels to play through as well. </p>
<p> This may be one of the best casual games out there but that doesn't mean that it has to be a quick game to complete. You should have no problem spending hours playing this whether it's all in one sitting or over a good period of time. </p>
<p> And considering many people now have a lot more time on their hands for at least the next couple of weeks, now is a good time to sink your teeth into a good casual game. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Shiba Force </p>
<p> This game is extremely casual. It's a simulation game where you send out Shiba dogs that are actually powerful heroes trying to save the city from monsters. </p>
<p> There are all kinds of different Shiba heroes to collect, and when you can, you send them out on missions. There are also mini games that you can play that help you acquire useful in-game items or currency. </p>
<p> You also only have so much you can do this game at any given time. If all your Shibas are out on missions then you'll likely run out of things to do unless you continue to play the mini games. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But you can only do that for so long as well. So when we say this is extremely casual we mean it. It is also however a very easy game and it offers up cute graphics that are likely to be a hit with anyone that loves Shiba dogs. </p>
<p> If you fit into that category, download and give Shiba Force a try as it's one of the best casual games out there. </p>
<p> Spies In Disguise: Agents On The Run </p>
<p> Spies In Disguise: Agents on The Run is an endless runner game that features characters from the popular film. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the main gameplay will be like any other endless runner, which is trying as hard as you can to get as far as you can while you dodge obstacles, there are some unique elements that set the game apart. </p>
<p> For instance, the vehicle mode, which lets you play missions in a vehicle instead of running. You can also play as different characters from the film, though you will need to unlock the extra characters first. </p>
<p> There are gadgets to unlock as well, like gliders, and a collection of different challenges that will reward you with various in-game items, currencies and more. </p>
<p> If you enjoyed this film, then this is a great casual game to consider. It's easy and fun and just addictive enough to keep you coming back to play more of it. </p>
<p> The Battle Cats </p>
<p> Unless you hate cats and games that center around them, then there's no reason why you shouldn't like this game. </p>
<p> It's simple to play, involves a plethora of silly yet cute and off the wall cat types that you can use to battle against your enemies. There's everything from giant, powerful Titan Cats to small miner cats that attack with picks. </p>
<p> Your goal as a cat army is to take over the world location by location and fend off against waves of enemies trying to fight back. </p>
<p> It features easy one-tap controls and a huge cat cannon that you can fire if your enemies are getting too close to you. The game features a side-scrolling view not too unlike Metal Slug, so if you're familiar with that game at all then this might appeal to you. </p>
<p> Though this game isn't really similar to Metal Slug in any other way. There are hundreds of stages to complete and three separate story mode campaigns to go through. So it's safe to say that you'll be able to spend a ton of time on this game before you've done everything in it. </p>
<p> With over ten million installs and a solid 4.5 star rating, players definitely agree that this is a wonderful little casual game to sink your teeth into. You have the time now more than likely, so why not check it out? </p>
<p> Tsuki Adventure </p>
<p> The art style alone should be enough to grab anyone's attention because there is clear heart and soul put into the visuals for Tsuki Adventure. </p>
<p> More than the art though, if there's one game that could signify the beauty of the simpler things in life, such as casual games and the simplicity that they usually evoke, it's this one. </p>
<p> The theme is literally you (Tuski) moving from the hustle and bustle of the big city in Japan to the slower pace of the Japanese countryside to take over the family carrot farm. </p>
<p> The longer you're there you grow to appreciate the simpler things in life along with the more easygoing lifestyle that you have there. </p>
<p> You'll be able to grow and maintain the family carrot farm business, drink matcha with friends, and complete random tasks around the town for the other villagers. </p>
<p> There's actually quite a bit to do in this game and there will be times that you will need to wait for stuff to finish (like carrots to grow) so you won't have to worry with always having the game in your hands. </p>
<p> It is a super casual game after all. </p>
<p> Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector </p>
<p> Does it really get more casual than a game that is all about collecting different types of cats? Probably not. And that's why this game is one of the best casual games you can get your hands on. </p>
<p> Playing the game is easy too. All you have to do to start is put snacks and toys out in your yard and watch the different cats arrive to eat up the snacks and play with the toys. Once they show up, the game logs the cats as ones you've collected in your extensive cat book. </p>
<p> There are over 40 different types of cats to collect, and tons of different toys and snacks for you to lay out for them. You can also expand your yard so it can fit more cats at any given time. The cats need space after all! </p>
<p> Each cat gets its own page in the cat book, and those pages contain all kinds of information about the cat like its name, its personality type, the power level, and how many visits it's made to your house. Can you collect all the different cats and become the cat master? That's the goal here. </p>
<p> Inbento </p>
<p> We've written about Inbento before as it was on one of our top games lists. It's a also a very casual game to play and very relaxing thanks to the theme. </p>
<p> You're a mother cat that is just trying to make sure her child has food for their meals every day. As you complete each puzzle and progress through the game, additional parts to the story unfold. </p>
<p> This is another game where there is no vocal dialogue for the story though. Everything is told through pictures and lighthearted, upbeat music. A picture tells a thousand words, and that saying really plays into things here as it couldn't be more true. </p>
<p> There are over 120 puzzles to solve, each with varying levels of challenge. Your goal is create the bento boxes that match up with the picture before starting each stage. </p>
<p> There are also achievements. So if you really enjoy achievements then that will be an extra level of accomplishment for you to obtain as you take in the beautiful story and gameplay of Inbento. </p>
<p> Pocket World 3D </p>
<p> This is basically just a game about assembling different small-scale 3D models of various things. There are models of the Eiffel Tower, small Japanese buildings and shops, trains, the Golden Gate Bridge and more. </p>
<p> It's also a puzzle game which means certain pieces can only be put in a specific spot and you'll have to figure that out. </p>
<p> It's a relaxing experience that allows you to create miniature little worlds in a way, by putting together the different models included in the game. It even includes 3D virtual environments that you can spin around 360-degrees to view things from every angle. </p>
<p> If you enjoy puzzles and have ever spent hours on end putting together models of any kind, then you'll enjoy this one. </p>
<p> KOONGYA Draw Party </p>
<p> Stay away from this game if you absolutely hate fun. Otherwise, download it and give it a try because it's a really well-made game that is extremely enjoyable. </p>
<p> Whether you're playing with friends or just playing solo, KOONGYA Draw Party (which just launched today) is a great time. The game is simple to play and offers up only slightly challenging pun drawings that you will need to solve. </p>
<p> You're given a collection of letters jumbled up at the bottom of the screen to work with, and all you have to do is tap them in the order of the word/pun that is being turned into a work of art in front of you. </p>
<p> There are daily rewards to collect, missions to complete which give you more rewards, and achievements that give you even more rewards. If you enjoyed Draw Something and similar games then you'll like this one too. </p>
<p> Plus it's kid-friendly, making it easy to play with children. If you're able to put the phone down long enough to share that is. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Smartphones – April 2018 </p>
<p> This time of the year is an interesting time as it follows on from the main announcements made during MWC and precedes the number of Spring and Summer smartphone announcements that are due to come through. Which typically means April is a much quieter month compared to some of the others. On that note, if you are after a new smartphone this month then here are our top ten best Android smartphone picks for April, 2018. </p>
<p> 10. Google Pixel & Pixel XL </p>
<p> In spite of the first Pixel 3 rumors now starting to surface the Google Pixel and/or Pixel XL remain one of out top ten options for those looking for a new smartphone. Yes, these are not the newest phones around, or the most premium spec based on today’s standards. However, they are highly capable smartphones and still remain solid options. Especially considering both phones are currently capable of running Android 8.0 (Oreo) and will be some of the first phones to see an upgrade to Android P when the next version of Android gets its general release later in the year. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As for the specs, the Pixel and Pixel XL are more alike than different with both models featuring 4GB RAM, 32GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. Resulting in their main differences coming down to the display, resolution and battery capacity. The standard Pixel comes loaded with a 5-inch display and a 2,770 mAh battery, compared to the Pixel XL which features a 5.5-inch display along with a 3,450 mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> HTC's U11 smartphone has not quite proven to be the hit it could have been in spite of this being a very good phone overall. Some of the reasons that have likely stopped this from becoming a better-selling phone is its lack of keeping up with the neighbors. As not only does the U11 sport a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio, but it is also only equipped with one rear camera. Although, HTC has paid particular attention to the phone’s camera capabilities making it a very strong contender for anyone looking for a camera-centric smartphone irrespective of the lack of a dual camera setup. In addition, the U11 was the first phone to come with the option to squeeze the sides to initiate commands resulting in its ‘squeezable phone’ dubbing. While this feature is now available with the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, it is still far more customizable on HTC’s phone. As for the rest of its core numbers, the HTC U11 features a 5.5-inch display along with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. Inside, buyers can expect 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, IP67 certification, and a 3,000 mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> Like the original Pixels, the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are not quite the new phones they once were. Not only have these phones been superseded by the Galaxy Note 8, but that phone has now also been succeeded by the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. However, the two 2017 models still remain highly-capable smartphones and better options to go for than a number of 2018 models from other manufacturers. Especially, if you can pick them up on sale. Also like the Pixels, these are two phones which are very similar in most respects. For example, they both come loaded with 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US), a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and full support for all the various Samsung- branded features, such as Bixby, Edge, and Pay. Where they differ in is the screen size and resolution with the standard Galaxy S8 utilizing a 5.8-inch display along with a 3,000 mAh battery. In contrast to the Plus model and its 6.2-inch display and 3,500 mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> The Mate 10 Pro is no longer the newest Huawei phone, although, unlike the newest Huawei phone, the Mate 10 Pro is one that is available to buy in the US. So this is a selling point in its own right for buyers in the United States. Availability aside, the Mate 10 Pro is a very good option overall and another one which places its focus on its camera capabilities. This not only means it comes with newer hardware such as a dual rear camera configuration but also a fairly robust software experience and especially for those looking for greater manual control of their smartphone cameras. The Mate 10 Pro may also prove to be suitable for anyone looking for a larger phone with a smaller footprint as not only does it include a 6-inch display (along with a 2160 x 1080 resolution) but also an 18:9 aspect ratio for a slimmer and taller look and feel. The rest of the specs are padded out with 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, a Kirin 970 SoC, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 4,000 mAh battery. </p>
<p> The Razer Phone is not going to be a phone for everyone and it is certainly less likely to appeal to those who are after a more modern-looking smartphone. As the Razer Phone does sport a more dated appearance due to its employment of a traditional aspect ratio and a heavy reliance on bezels. That said, this is certainly a powerful phone and therefore will appeal to those looking for great computing power and specifically when it comes to mobile gaming. As one of the clear benefits of the 5.72-inch display is its 120 Hz refresh rate which is coupled with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. Likewise, the Razer Phone manages to pack in 8GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, resulting in a more than capable multi-tasking smartphone. Cameras are not bad either with a dual rear camera setup on the back and an 8-megapixel camera on the front. Completing the list is a more than adequate 4,000 mAh capacity battery and stereo front-facing speakers. </p>
<p> The LG V30 is a phone that is not short of variants with the standard model available, as well as a “+” model and the even newer 30S ThinQ model. Thought of the three to V30+ is a good option to go with. This one essentially comes with everything the standard model does with two exceptions. The first being it has a greater internal storage capacity (128GB vs 64GB) and the second being you get a free pair of QuadPlay headphones. Making the + model the best 'value for money' option from a line that is otherwise fairly expensive. At the display level, the V30+ features a 6-inch display along with an 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2880 x 1440 resolution. Inside, the V30+ comes loaded with 4GB RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. While cameras come in the form of 16-megapixel and 13-megapixel rear cameras, along with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. This in addition to a number of audio and camera-related software tweaks – staples of the V-series in general. </p>
<p> The Huawei P20 Pro, along with the standard P20, are the latest smartphones to come from the house of Huawei. Typical of this brand, the two phones do place much of their focus on photography capabilities, and of the two, the P20 Pro is the even more powerful and capable handset. Especially considering, the P20 Pro actually features three rear cameras. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As for the rest of the specs, the P20 Pro features a 6.01-inch display along with an 18.7:9 aspect ratio, resulting in a 2240 x 1080 resolution, and a notch. Inside, the P20 Pro is loaded with 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, and is powered by a Kirin 970 octa-core SoC. Additional features include IP67 certification, a fingerprint scanner, facial recognition, USB Type-C, a 4,000 mAh battery and Android 8.1 (Oreo). Those looking to buy the Huawei P20 Pro in the US will have to opt for an international model compatible with GSM bands in the US as there are no current plans for this phone to become officially available in the United States. </p>
<p> In spite of sitting in the third place this month, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is arguably one of the best phones you can currently buy. It certainly is for those looking for a stylus as the inclusion of an S Pen (and all its related features) is a massive selling point in its own right. That aside, and the Galaxy Note 8 competes with the best in virtually all departments. This is another highly intelligent smartphone with access to both Google Assistant and Bixby, as well as one which packs in the camera hardware and features, including a dual rear camera setup – the first Samsung flagship to do so. As for its more generic numbers, the Galaxy Note 8 offers a 6.3-inch screen along with an 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2960 x 1440 resolution. As well as 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US), an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,300 mAh battery. </p>
<p> If you ask some people the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will be the best Android phones you can buy today and this is a stance that is hard to argue against. After all, these are Google’s phones for 2018 and have been designed with Android specifically in mind. While that may be assumed to be the case with all Android phones, it is not, and the Pixel 2 line is proof of this. As these phones have literally been built from the ground up with a view to ensuring the software works hand in hand with the hardware. Whether it is the design, the display, the cameras, or anything else, it has been fine-tuned for a more Android-centric experience. The end result is a highly intuitive and smooth user experience. While this was also the case with the original Pixels, the new Pixels are more different to each other than their predecessors were. So while both new models do feature 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and Android 8.0 (Oreo), they are somewhat aimed at different buyers. Those more interested in a traditional phone will want to opt for the standard Pixel 2 and its 16:9 aspect ratio 5-inch display, compared to the Pixel 2 XL which adopts more of a ‘2018 look’ thanks to its taller and slimmer use of an 18:9 aspect ratio with its 6-inch display. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus remain out go-to options for those looking for a new Android phone right now. These are two of the most premium smartphones around and ones which pretty much check most, if not all, of the boxes. Their only downside is the price although compared to previous flagships that have launched in the last year or two, they are not even that expensive. Which when combined with the wealth of features on offer make the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus two very good value options. Yes, they do cost, but you are seriously getting a lot for the money. </p>
<p> What’s more, the two phones are a lot more different than sibling launch phones typically are which makes it far more easier now to choose between the two. For example, if you do want a dual rear camera setup on a smartphone then the Galaxy S9 Plus is the option to go for as the standard model features one rear camera. Likewise, the Galaxy S9 Plus is a larger phone due to its inclusion of a 6.2-inch display compared to the 5.8-inch display on the standard model. Although both models do sport a now-common slimmer and taller profile. There is even more of a difference in the internals with the Plus version coming loaded with 6GB RAM compared to the 4GB RAM offered with the Galaxy S9. This is in addition to the expected battery capacity difference between the two models with the standard version boasting a 3,000 mAh battery and the Plus version, a 3,500 mAh battery. So arguably of the two new S9 variants, the Plus model is the more premium and better option to go for. That is, if you need greater RAM, a larger screen, and dual cameras. As otherwise, the more affordable standard model will be a better-suited option. In either case, both versions come loaded with all the Samsung software tweaks you would expect from a flagship Samsung phone. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Smartphones – August 2018 </p>
<p> Nearing the end of Summer means that it's about time for the Fall phone season to kicks off. While we've only got one new phone on our list, the likelihood of seeing a number of these phones discounted in August is pretty high, as retailers will be looking to flush out inventory at reduced rates to make room for the upcoming Fall launches. Without further ado, let's check out the 10 best Android phones you can buy in August 2018. </p>
<p> Essential Phone </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This marks the first time ever that Essential has made it onto our top 10 Android phones list, and it's for a good reason: they've worked their way up, and it shows in the results. Essential launched its first phone just a little too early, and it felt like a beta device in every way when it launched last August. Now, a full year later, the Essential PH-1, or better known just as the Essential Phone, has come full circle and delivers a compelling experience for a price that's lower than any other phone out there. Recently selling for as low as $250 on Amazon Prime Day, the specs for the Essential Phone cannot be beaten for even the regular price of under $400. On top of this, Essential has kept an update schedule that rivals the Google Pixel line, delivering timely monthly updates, and thus far the only non-Pixel branded phone on the market with an Android 9 Pie update as well. If you're looking for a phone with fantastic specs, one of the most amazing builds in the industry, an unrivaled update schedule and a price to kill, the Essential Phone is what you want. </p>
<p> Sony's latest premium-grade flagship eclipses its recently released smaller cousins in many ways, not the least of which is in the price category. Retailing for £799/€900/$999, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium pushes the base price point of Android phones up, but packs in some serious new specs to cope with that. With a large 5.8-inch 4K HDR display, you'll be blown away when watching 4K HDR content on the phone. That screen is capable of natively playing back the 4K HDR video that the new dual-camera system on the back can record, and there are quite a few additional tricks up the phone's proverbial sleeve too. It's as fast as they come and has some incredible features, but it's lower on the list because it doesn't pack the value that some of the other handsets here do. </p>
<p> LG's latest duo of flagship devices is seeing wider distribution and lower pricing when compared with July, including availability on Google's own Project Fi. Both phones offer LG's latest features running atop Android 8.0 Oreo, and both feature the same upgraded sensors in that dual-camera module on the back. This includes a new super low light mode on the secondary wide-angle camera, as well as an upgraded front-facing camera too. The G7 ThinQ packs a brand new super bright IPS LCD display in addition to what LG is calling the Boombox speaker. This new speaker is capable of delivering louder volume than many previous LG phones, as well as a distinct quality to its audio when placed on a table or other surface. Meanwhile the V35 ThinQ offers an OLED panel and a thinner, lighter build without that notch cut out of the display. </p>
<p> HTC's U12+ garnered some mixed reviews, including our own, mainly due to some overall bugginess of the phone, including those new pressure-sensitive buttons on the side. To mitigate these issues, HTC has released an update that not only deals with the issues we experienced in regards to the buttons, but also tweaked edge sense and added a handful of other new features as well. It's not only refreshing to see such a quick response to widespread issues, but also ones that actually put in a fix rather than providing a workaround or a band-aid. HTC's U12+ features some of the absolute best video recording on the market, including silky-smooth 4K recording at 60FPS with active hybrid stabilization, as well as the ability to zoom into a video and specifically focus on an audio source. It's HTC's best phone in some time, and that transparent blue color is certainly one of a kind in an industry filled with similar looking black slabs. </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 is BlackBerry's most intuitive phone yet, and despite what the spec sheet might initially make you think, is absolutely a flagship phone in its experience. Offering what is probably the most unique experience on Android at this time, the BlackBerry KEY2 ignores many industry trends, like a taller display and gestures, for something wholly BlackBerry at the core: a physical keyboard. This physical keyboard isn't just for typing though, it provides a convenience factor that other phones simply don't offer, with the ability to quickly launch dozens of apps and functions from anywhere on the phone, thanks to the new Convenience Key. This is just a small sliver of what BlackBerry offers with the KEY2, and one of the reasons we love it so much. </p>
<p> Huawei has recently accomplished a big sales feat, selling more than 100 million devices so far in 2018 alone. The Huawei P20 Pro is responsible for a good percentage of that, including the award of Hauwei's most successful phone in Western Europe yet. It's no wonder too, with the camera Huawei is packing on the P20 Pro, which sees constant awards and praise as the best overall smartphone camera on the market. Aside from that, Huawei has built a sleek and solid feeling phone that's both thin and strong, with a gorgeous OLED display on the front, as well as some incredible new features over previous generation phones. Huawei has also designed some absolutely jaw-dropping colors for the P20 lineup with shiny, irridescent shades and color-changing gradients. It's a stellar phone that's a sight to behold in every way. </p>
<p> OnePlus has long delivered one of the best values in the industry with every single release, packing the absolute latest specs while almost always coming in at a lower price than anyone other flagship phone. The OnePlus 6 is OnePlus's most expensive phone yet, but it offers some of the absolute smallest bezels in the industry, as well as a flagship-tier experience at every level. A killer camera, lightning fast performance, ultra-quick charging, and a feature set that rivals many other phones, the OnePlus 6 is a recommended buy at every level. We used the phone for well over a month before delivering the review, ensuring that it can hold up to expectations in the long run, and you can see the results in our review. </p>
<p> Sony surprised many with the complete redesign of the Xperia series when it launched the Xperia XZ2, a phone that packs in amazing battery life, some of the absolute best speakers in the industry, and a camera that sports the highest quality slow motion video out there. It's also got a brand new design that's not quite like anything out there, a finally a fingerprint scanner that works in the US, meaning anyone worldwide can finally buy an Xperia flagship with a fingerprint scanner that's enabled out of the box. It's Sony's fastest, most efficient phone yet, and one that consistently impresses, no matter what you're looking for in a modern smartphone. </p>
<p> Google's Pixel line consistently tops the charts when considering phones to recommend, and it's any wonder. Android is Google's own OS, so it makes sense that Google's own hardware would take best advantage of Android's strengths and design. Google offers two sizes of the Pixel 2, but it's the Pixel 2 XL that has the new 18:9 aspect ratio that's taller and can fit more information in, all while reducing the size of the bezels. Front-facing speakers have become a rarity in the world of smartphones, but Google has fit them on here even though it increased the screen size and reduced the bezels. On top of this, both Pixel 2 phones feature a camera that's easily in the top of the charts no matter which measurement you use, and Google's regular updates keep it on a newer version of Android than almost any other phone out there. </p>
<p> Samsung has made the best overall Android devices for some time now, and 2018 is no exception. While many feel this year is a bit "boring" in terms of new things, Samsung has perfected what it does, and offers more features and a more well-rounded device than anyone else. Three devices make up Samsung's 2018 flagship trio, and while the Galaxy S9 and S9+ have both been available for a few months now, Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 will be out on August 24th, and it's sure to be the best device you can possibly buy. That doesn't mean it's going to be cheap though, and while it's not the first thousand dollar phone to make it to market, it's certainly the latest, and the $1249 version with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage makes it the highest spec phone money can buy. Whichever model you choose, Samsung's phones are the undisputed kings right now in 2018, and it's going to be hard to beat Samsung after what it has delivered this year. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Smartphones – July 2018 </p>
<p> As the dog days of summer start to kick in, which means the smartphone release train is slowing down a bit for the next month or so. We've had a few new releases since the June list was created though, and these releases have made their way onto July's list, pushing out a few phones from last month. Whether it's just a few days old, or a few months old, we're going to break down the 10 best phones to buy in 2018 for the month of July based on price, user experience, and overall functionality. </p>
<p> Nokia 6.1 </p>
<p> First up is the Nokia 6.1, which compared to the rest of the phones on the list, seems to be the odd man out. It's the least expensive phone on the list, coming in well under $300, yet packs a punch in the performance and looks department. A Snapdragon 630 SoC, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage mark the base model at $269, and a gorgeous metal build with slimmer bezels, a rear-facing fingerprint scanner, and the bloat-free Android One branding make this an incredible choice for anyone looking for a more simple, less expensive experience. This means it's running the latest version of Android, with guaranteed quick updates to Android P shortly after it is finally released. If you're looking for something fast, cheap and well-built, this is the phone for you. </p>
<p> Following up the fantastic V30 from last Fall, LG has delivered a similar design and build to that phone, all while differentiating itself with one big new feature: the Boombox Speaker. Many phones are moving to stereo speakers, but LG has worked to create a resonating chamber in its phone, creating a speaker that's not only loud but features much better bass than most other phones could ever hope to achieve. A new super-bright display is on the front, and while it does have a notch, it has quickly become the easiest display to see outside, even in bright sunlight. It's also got a new wide-angle camera sensor which has significantly better low-light performance than the sensors used in the V30 or the G6. Unlike last year, this is packing the latest high-end mobile SoC from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 845, whereas the G6 last year featured an older SoC than competing flagship phones at release. Folks on AT&T in the US will need to opt for the V35 ThinQ instead, which features the same specs as the LG G7 ThinQ, but with the same build and design as the V30. </p>
<p> HTC's latest flagship is the most feature-packed, beautiful flagship they've ever delivered. It sports one of the absolute best cameras in the industry, with incredible video recording quality that can actually focus audio onto a single subject, helping to block out annoying background noise when zooming in. HTC has upgraded its Edge Sense technology with a new double-tap gesture, including a brand new Edge Launcher that makes launching apps faster from anywhere on the phone. Packing in tons of software features and a new button design for its power and volume buttons, which introduce some odd frustration points, but the HTC U12+ is ultimately a fantastic phone that fits in with the best of them in almost every single way. </p>
<p> Huawei's P20 Pro is all about the camera, and it's easily the highest quality, most feature-rich photography solution on the smartphone market. Utilizing the industry's first triple-camera system for its rear-facing cameras, Huawei has worked up some software magic that takes a composite image from multiple sensors and creates an image superbly detailed, incredibly well balanced, and full of life in a way that only a large sensor with good optics can. Aside from an incredible camera, Huawei has also designed a phone with the most gorgeous colors ever seen this side of the HTC U12+, and a software experience that's jam-packed to the gills with features. It's also got the incredibly fast and smart Kirin 970 chipset inside, manufactured by Huawei's own Hisilicon, which features an AI-focused secondary Neural Processor, and aides in everything from scene detection in the camera, to speeding up offline speech and photo recognition on the phone. </p>
<p> OnePlus has consistently delivered quality phones for a price tag well under what the competition provides, and while the OnePlus 6 is the company's most expensive phone to date at $529, it's easily the most well-polished phone they've delivered as well. Sporting the smallest bezels of any Android phone that has a notch in its display, the OnePlus 6's all-glass design looks gorgeous, and unlike last year's devices, doesn't look like an iPhone clone from first glance. It's got all the latest in mobile flagship hardware, including a Snapdragon 845 SoC, a whopping 8GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and comes in three svelte colors. There are trade-offs to be had with a price tag that's so significantly lower than the competition though, meaning you'll have to do without fancy stereo speakers, support for technologies like ARCore or Daydream VR, HD playback on many streaming apps like Amazon Prime Video, and IP water and dust resistance to name a few things. Still, if you don't think you'll need these things, you'll be getting the absolute fastest phone on the market, with a camera that's well-rounded in every single way. </p>
<p> Sony's latest flagship is the first phone on our list that looks truly different from the competition out there, and it's all thanks to Sony's new Ambient Flow design language. Sporting a taller 18:9 display with smaller bezels, yet still giving users front-facing stereo speakers, Sony's new design language is as gorgeous as it is practical. A new curved back features a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, situated nearly at the mid-point of the back, and this curve functions as a way to provide a more ergonomic design for the phone. It's also got the best battery life of any flagship released so far in 2018, a killer camera, and an ultra-fast experience that's matched only by the OnePlus 6. That new camera sports 4K HDR10 video recording, full-HD 1080P slow motion recording at 960FPS, as well as a number of other advanced features through Sony's own line of exclusive camera sensors for the Xperia smartphone line. Like the OnePlus 6, the Xperia XZ2 can also run the Android P Beta out of the box without any configuration, thanks to Sony's participation in Project Treble, and puts the XZ2 on the cutting-edge of software releases. </p>
<p> Brand new to the list is the BlackBerry KEY2, the follow-up to last year's successful mid-range phone. This time around BlackBerry has stepped up its game in every way, from a massive spec boost to a redesigned keyboard, along with tons of new features to get excited about. It's not targeted toward media-consumption-heavy consumers, as the 4.5-inch 3:2 aspect ratio screen is a bit awkward to watch lots of widescreen content on. It is, however, very much targeted towards folks who are looking for a faster, more convenient way to get a lot of things done at once, and this multi-tasking powerhouse not only features 6GB of RAM, but also a physical keyboard that can act as a way to quickly launch up to 52 of your most used apps and actions with the press of a single button. It's the best multi-tasking experience in the land, and it's also the most secure Android phone out there, offering ways to not only control your privacy and lock down content, but also gives an easy way to find out what apps accessed data like location or contacts in a succinct timeline fashion. It's an incredible experience that's more than worth taking a look at, and it's quickly rocketing BlackBerry back to the top of the smartphone game. </p>
<p> This wouldn't be a best of Android list without at least one of Google's own phones, and the Google Pixel 2 XL represents the absolute best Google has to offer right now. While the Pixel series is a bit barebones in its features, it's generally among the fastest, most stable, and most consistent experiences on any platform, mobile or otherwise. The Pixel 2 XL is Google's "pure" vision for Android, and as such you'll always find the most bleeding-edge version of Android, but we've also seen that monthly updates can cause a bit of headache in terms of bugs. Still this is one of the absolute best cameras on the market, and quite possibly the most consistenly high-quality camera on any smartphone, including incredible photography imagery, ultra-stable 4K video recording, and a general look and feel that's simple, easy to use, and just plain enjoyable. </p>
<p> As the king of Android, Samsung consistently outdoes itself when it comes to introducing valuable new features and quality hardware design. The Galaxy Note family has always been on the cutting edge of experimental features and hardware design, and while the hardware design isn't quite as radical as it used to be, that has more to do with the industry catching up to the Note, not the other way around. The Galaxy Note 8 fixes the big issues of its predecessors and brings about the most feature-rich experience you'll find on any smartphone, bar none. The S-Pen gives it abilities that no other phone on the market can match, and while it's not for everybody, folks who use the S-Pen will find themselves wondering what they did without one. With everything that the Samsung Experience adds to the stock Android exprience, it's any wonder the Galaxy note, with its big 6.3-inch screen and gorgeous minimal bezels, has stuck around on this best-of-Android list since its release last Fall. </p>
<p> Just as it's no surprise to see the Galaxy Note 8 make the list once again, Samsung's Galaxy S9 and S9+ offer the most feature-rich, user-centric experiences out there. With services like Samsung Pay, exclusive Galaxy Store content, an immense library of themes, huge number of available accessories, and a general boatload of other features available, it's almost impossible not to recommend the either sized Galaxy S9 out of sheer possibilities. A beatiful design that's nearly identical to last year's Galaxy S8 includes bumped up specs and a new dual-camera system on the larger S9+, as well as a brand new dual-aperture lens for each size. If you want the best overall Android phone on the market that will appeal to the widest range of consumers, look no further than the Samsung Galaxy S9 or S9+. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Smartphones – June 2018 </p>
<p> The weather is not the only thing that has been heating up recently as the last month has seen a number of new and high-profile smartphones getting announced, resulting in the top-tier smartphone scene changing considerably in the last month alone. In some cases, this has meant just a new addition to an already-existing lineup, while in other cases (looking at you LG) there has instances of more than one high-end phone having become available from the same manufacturer within a small amount of time. Which is where this list comes in as the goal here is to try and help consumers navigate the ever-more complicated smartphone market by highlighting what are the best phones currently available. Here are out best Android smartphone picks for June, 2018. </p>
<p> 10. Nokia 6.1 </p>
<p> By just about every measure the rest of the phones on this list are better options than the Nokia 6.1. However, the price difference alone represents the gulf of difference between flagship smartphones and the Nokia 6.1, and it's that price difference which makes the Nokia 6.1 an option worth considering. If, for example, you are after a new phone but just do not want to pay the prices associated with the rest of the smartphones on this list, the Nokia 6.1 might just be what you are looking for – so consider this more of an honorable mention than a vindication as one of the best phones on the market. In spite of coming with a price tag well under $300 the Nokia 6.1 is a phone that offers a number of premium design traits resulting in a rather good-looking device overall. Adding to that, this is also a smartphone which comes running on Android One which essentially means that in addition to a stock-like software experience, this is a phone which will receive regular and routine software and security updates – and directly from Google. At its more basic level the Nokia 6.1 is made up of a 5.5-inch display (with a 1920 x 1080 resolution), 3GB RAM, 32GB storage and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 SoC. </p>
<p> Up until recently the V30S ThinQ was the best and most current phone from LG although a lot has changed in the last month thanks to the release of two new LG phones. One of which is the V35 ThinQ and this is best summed up as the V30S in terms of design, but an LG G7 in terms of the specs and features. Therefore, if the G7 is not quite the style of LG phone you are looking for, the V35 ThinQ is likely to be the best option to go for. However, there is a fairly big caveat with the V35 ThinQ – that it's an AT&T exclusive phone in the US. So those not with AT&T might find getting this one a little less welcoming than other options, which might then mean the V30S ThinQ is actually the best option to go for. Complications aside, the V35 ThinQ features a 6-inch display along with an 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2880 × 1440 resolution. As well as 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC. Padding out the list of specs and features is a dual rear camera setup and a 3,300 mAh capacity battery. Typically speaking, the absence of a feature or design trait is not normally thought of as a selling point in itself, although for those less keen on the notch revolution it might be – as the V35 ThinQ does not include a notch. </p>
<p> The Huawei P20 and the P20 Pro are certainly phones worth buying, although one of the primary decision-making factors will be where the buyer is located as these two phones are not available everywhere. Either way, the P20 and P20 Pro do offer a heightened and premium smartphone experience and especially in the camera department. This is even more true for the P20 Pro as one of the main differences between the two models is the P20 Pro features, not one, or two, but three rear cameras. Compared to only two cameras on the standard P20. Which does mean of the two the P20 Pro is positioned as the more premium option (along with a slightly higher cost) and so it's worth focusing more on this model. In addition to a triple rear camera setup, the P20 Pro comes loaded with a 6.01-inch display, 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, a Kirin 970 octa-core SoC, facial recognition, a 4,000 mAh capacity battery, and Android 8.1 (Oreo). Like a number of 2018 flagship smartphones, the P20 Pro does boast a notch. </p>
<p> The LG G7 ThinQ might not feel quite as new as some of the other new arrivals, and especially as LG has since announced another new premium smartphone – the V35 ThinQ. That said, this is a new device as it was only announced at the start of May, and only very recently became available to buy in the US. More to the point, it is one of the phones you might want to consider if you are in the market for a new phone this month. Like most 2018 phones, the G7 ThinQ places most of its focus on three key areas: the display, the camera experience, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI), making this a very smart and capable phone. However, unlike other 2018 options it also does come with a couple of extra focuses too, with one of the best examples being the audio capabilities as the LG G7 ThinQ is said to be able to act as a resonance chamber where the body of the phone has been designed to improve the quality and volume of the output. Therefore, those looking for a better audio experience might want to give the G7 ThinQ a closer look…and listen. As for the main specs, the G7 ThinQ features a 6.1-inch display, a minimum of 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, a Quad DAC, a 3,000 mAh capacity battery, dual rear cameras, and an AI shortcut button. That is, all in addition to the notch. </p>
<p> The HTC U11 marked a fairly big change for HTC-branded smartphones and while the new HTC U12 Plus continues the same trend, it differs far less from its predecessor, than its predecessor did from its predecessor. So this is much more of a refined released than a revolutionary one. Which is not a bad thing, as for those who liked the look of the U11 the U12 Plus offers much of the same and more. For example, the U12 Plus sports the same stylish design, setting it apart from the rest of the flagship options that seem to be collectively emulating the look of an iPhone. Adding to that, this one also does feature a dual rear camera setup (one of the main differences compared to the U11), as well as a 6-inch QHD display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Not forgetting of course, the U12 Plus continues on from the U11 with the inclusion of Edge Sense technology letting the owner squeeze the sides to initiate a specific command. This is very similar to what Google offers on its Pixel 2 devices although the HTC implementation is a lot more customizable, and even more so now with the U12 Plus. The major downside with this smartphone is that's primarily only available as an unlocked model and does come with a fairly high price tag attached. </p>
<p> More recent Sony phones in the US have left a lot to be desired although they have still remained good options and especially for buyers already heavily involved in the vast Sony ecosystem. Things have now changed though with the latest premium options from Sony, as the Sony Xperia XZ2 is arguably the best smartphone to have come from Sony in a long time. Not only has it seen updates to its design, but also a ton of new features added. As a result Sony now offers consumers something different and more unique, compared to the majority of top-tier smartphones that are now more alike than different. The new model comes with a much more refined design with a greater reduction in bezels (compared to previous models), a working fingerprint sensor in the US, a heightened camera experience, and a feature-packed experience in general. Of course, it is not without its downsides but with all things considered the Xperia XZ 2 is looking like a great option for those who like the Sony way of doing things. As for the more general numbers, the Xperia XZ2 features a 5.7-inch display along with an 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2160 x 1080 resolution. Along with a minimum of 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, a 19-megapixel rear camera, and a 3,180 mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 6 is a new arrival to the smartphone scene having been announced last month and only recently became available to buy. Of course, with this being a OnePlus phone its main selling point is that it's a more affordable flagship smartphone and therefore will be best-suited to those looking for a top-tier device without a top-tier price. Price aside, the OnePlus 6 is a very powerful smartphone as it does come with a core combination 6GB RAM (minimum), 64GB storage (minimum) and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 645 SoC. This is in addition to a 6.28-inch display, a dual rear camera setup, and a 3,300 mAh capacity battery – with fast charging support. In spite of the selling points, the OnePlus 6 is a device that is limited in other respects as it is not the most feature-rich smartphone on the market. So when directly compared to other flagship options (which do cost more) there is less on offer with the OnePlus 6, and this is its biggest compromise. However, if those extra-added features are not quite what you need in a smartphone, then the OnePlus 6 is likely to be a great option for you. It’s also worth mentioning the OnePlus 6 does include a notch – which will either be a benefit or an additional cost depending on your notch viewpoint. </p>
<p> In spite of their common purpose, some smartphones have become more individual over the years and the Samsung Galaxy Note line is an example of this. As while this phone will fulfill the smartphone needs of any consumer, those who find themselves using a Galaxy Note device tend to stick with the line exclusively, highlighting the unique properties of the Note line. In today's market, the Note line comes in the form of the Galaxy Note 8. A phone that is not only larger than most other phones, but also one that comes equipped with a stylus and a wealth of software optimizations and features designed to further heighten the stylus experience. In 2018 the use of the stylus has become more apparent with a number of personal devices now sporting a pen-like accessory, and so for those users the Galaxy Note 8 will likely be a great addition to their newly-found pen-powered lifestyle. Besides the pen, the Galaxy Note 8 is as about as powerful as a smartphone gets, as it does come with a spec list to rival everything else on this list. To sum up, the Galaxy Note 8 features a 6.3-inch display along with an 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2960 x 1440 resolution. As well as dual rear cameras, 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US), fast charging support, wireless charging support, Samsung Bixby and Samsung Pay. </p>
<p> The Pixel 2 and 2 XL have remained solid options ever since they were first announced and in spite of now being positioned as the runner-up, these could easily be the best Android phones on the market. For some users specifically – they will be the best options. One such example is for those who care about a stock Android experience as the software is at the heart of the two Pixel 2 phones and in more ways than one. As Google has looked to ensure there is a tight integration between the software and the hardware on these phones. In other words, while on paper they do not boast the greatest of specs, the hardware is very much a conscious decision as the software has been fine-tuned to draw the best out of that hardware. The cameras being the absolute best example, as while both models feature a single rear camera, the experience is equal to, if not better than, the experience on offer by competing devices sporting a dual rear camera setup. It is this sort of optimization where Google has excelled in thanks to its emphasize on machine learning and the Pixel 2 and 2 XL are the sum of that excelling. If you want a highly-tuned and highly-Google-oriented smartphone experience, the two Pixel 2s are the only way to go. As for their differences, the Pixel 2 XL is certainly the more premium option due to its larger display and overall more bezel-less-like design and 18:9 aspect ratio. </p>
<p> Put simply, the Samsung Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S9 Plus are two of the best phones you can buy right now, if not the very best phones. As while they are top-tier priced, they are not quite as expensive as some of the options on this list, and in spite of this they both come packed full of extra features. In fact, regardless of what an individual's smartphone feature preferences are, the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus will likely have those features included. If you need a high-quality display, you got it. A heightened camera experience, you got it. Additional security features, you got it. Facial recognition, AR, VR-compatible, mobile payments, you got it, you got it, you got, you got it. Therefore when it comes to deciding on which phone to buy the only real question is which of the two Galaxy S9 phones to opt for, and even that decision has become easier this year with the Plus version now featuring more distinctive traits compared to its sibling model. Some of the most noteworthy differences with the Plus model include a dual rear camera setup, 6GB RAM, a larger display, and a greater capacity battery. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Smartphones – March 2018 </p>
<p> With MWC 2018 having now come and gone, one of the biggest phone announcements of the year has taken place through the introduction of the Samsung Galaxy S9. Although this is one of the first major releases of this year, it is expected to remain a go-to option for months to come. If you are in the market for a smartphone this month then you may be wondering whether this is the best option for you? In answering that question we will be taking a quick look at our picks for the best Android phone as of March, 2018. </p>
<p> 10. Google Pixel & Pixel XL </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> By any measure, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are old phones compared to the rest of this list. However, age is not always the issue with smartphones as there are plenty of phones available that in spite of being newer, offer less, or a more limited user experience. The Pixel and Pixel XL are designed to offer a great user experience and therefore in spite of their age, are solid options to consider. For example, these two phones are immediately capable of being upgraded to the latest version of Android – Oreo. Something which still escapes a number of newer phones. Software aside, there is very little to complain about with the first-generation Pixel phones as they both come loaded with 4GB RAM, 32GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC. In addition to a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and more. Their main differences come down to the display and battery life, making the decision between them an easy one. If you want a larger display with a greater resolution and a higher mAh capacity, go for the Pixel XL. </p>
<p> The HTC U11 is one of those devices that has flown somewhat under the radar compared to the others on this list and this is in spite of offering a very good smartphone experience overall. In particular, in the camera department, with the U11 offering a highly capable rear camera along with a number of additional software tweaks. This is also a notable device as it was the first to really bring to customer attention the option to squeeze the sides of the device to initiate a specific command. In fact, while the Pixel 2 and 2 XL now offer this feature as well, Google’s implementation is far more limiting than what HTC offers. One of the downsides, however, is the U11 does not conform to the current all-screen trend, resulting in a front panel that is more limited in the amount of screen it offers compared to the size of the front panel overall. The display itself measures in at 5.5-inches and utilizes a 2560 x 1440 resolution, while inside, the HTC U11 comes loaded with 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. </p>
<p> In terms of the Galaxy S line from Samsung the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are no longer the main attractions. That doesn't, however, mean they are no longer worth considering. Generally speaking the newer models adopt a very similar design and look and so buyers of the now-older generation options will not be losing out in this respect. More so, due to the lower than expected launch price of the new models, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are likely to be subject to some great price drops in the coming days and weeks – making now a better time than ever to consider these two smartphones. As for their differences, like the Pixels, size and battery life is what you will mainly need to consider with the Galaxy S8 armed with a 5.8-inch display and a 3,000 mAh battery, compared to the S8 Plus which features a 6.2-inch display along with a 3,500 mAh battery. Otherwise, buyers of either model can expect 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US). As well as a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, Samsung Bixby, Samsung Pay, and of course, Samsung’s Edge technology. </p>
<p> For some, the Razer Phone is likely to be a great option. Though it is not one for everyone. Its design alone is something that will need to be overlooked as it does not come with the premium appearance offered with other smartphones on this list, resulting in a more dated look than it should have. On the other hand, this is arguably one of the most powerful Android phones currently available and it is here where certain buyers will find the value on offer. For example, the included 5.72-inch display not only comes with a 2560 x 1440 resolution but also a 120 Hz refresh rate. Adding to that, this is also a smartphone equipped with a dual rear camera setup consisting of two 12-megapixel cameras. The rest of the spec list is padded out with 8GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, a Quick Charge 4+-supported 4,000 mAh battery, stereo front-facing speakers, and more. </p>
<p> The Mate 10 Pro is one of those phones that feels much older than it is and especially in the US. As in spite of being announced some time ago, it has only recently become available stateside. That said, this is a highly-performing phone and one which you should take a moment to consider. Even more so if the camera experience is one of the primary requirements for you. As Huawei has made the camera central to the Mate 10 Pro and offers owners a wealth of additional and advanced features. That is not to say it is a complicated camera experience, as it is not. With this phone, you have the choice of making the camera as advanced as you want it to be. In terms of the numbers, the Mate 10 Pro sports a dual rear camera setup consisting of a 20-megapixel monochrome camera along with a 12-megapixel RGB camera. The display comes in at 6-inches and utilizes an 18:9 aspect ratio as well as a 2160 x 1080 resolution. Padding out the list is up to 6GB RAM and 128 GB storage, a Kirin 970 SoC, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 4,000 mAh battery. </p>
<p> In spite of not being a new phone, the LG V30 is already available in a number of variants. The latest of which was just announced at MWC 2018. However, if you are in the market for a phone right now then the standard version is the one to go for. There is a + model which offers more, but more is only worth paying for if you need it, as the standard model is a highly capable phone. This is even truer if you are interested in the audio or camera properties of a smartphone as the V30 specifically looks to cater to those two markets, boasting a number of OTT tweaks and software improvements. At the core level, the LG V30 features a 6-inch display along with an 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2880 x 1440 resolution. Inside, expect 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. Cameras consist of a dual rear camera setup (16-megapixel and 13-megapixel) along with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. </p>
<p> Arguably, the OnePlus 5T offers some of the best value for money when it comes to paper specs. However, it does come at a bit of a compromise with the phone being more generic than market-leading. This means you are not going to get a number of the features or design traits offered by other phones but will get a solid and reliable user experience. One area where the 5T is very much on trend though is the display department thanks to this model utilizing an 18:9 aspect ratio. Resulting in a 6-inch display along with a 2160 x 1080 resolution. Dual rear cameras are also included (20-megapixel and 16-megapixel), as is super fast charging through the company’s Dash Charge technology. The rest of the specs break down to include up to 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,300 mAh battery. </p>
<p> Although the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is no longer the newest Samsung smartphone, it is the newest Note model. So those looking for more of a stylus-compatible smartphone experience will want to consider this over everything else. Although, as the Note line has evolved the actual stylus has become more of a secondary feature due to the likes of the Galaxy Note 8 coming equipped with a ton of additional selling points. One of the most noteworthy is the cameras as this was the first flagship smartphone from Samsung to utilize a dual rear camera setup. This is in addition to a number of OTT camera software tweaks which further serve to improve the product. The display is another big selling point here – due to it being big – thanks to the inclusion of a 6.3-inch screen which is slimmed down through the adoption of an 18:9 aspect ratio. As for the rest of the specs, the Galaxy Note 8 features 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US). As well as an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,300 mAh battery that not only supports fast charging and wireless charging, but also fast wireless charging. </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have remained atop of this list ever since their launch and for some people, will still be the better option to go for. This is especially true of those who want a lighter but incredible smoth user experience as the Pixel launcher is very much Android personified. It is also highly tuned to the hardware resulting in two phones that perform to the best of their abilities, and in some cases, exceeding those hardware expectations. The cameras being a good case in point here, as in spite of sporting only one camera the software results in one of the best camera experiences on the market. It also worth noting that unlike their predecessors, the Pixel 2 and 2 XL are far more different to each other. For example, the XL model boasts an all-screen display thanks to the inclusion of an 18:9 aspect ratio. Compared to the standard Pixel 2 that adopts a 16:9 ratio resulting in more of a traditional looking device. This has a knock-on effect of the display being considerably larger on the 2 XL (6-inches) compared to the Pixel 2 (5-inches). Likewise, battery capacities are different with the 2 XL boasting a 3,520 mAh battery compared to the Pixel 2’s 2,700 mAh battery. Otherwise, both models come loaded with 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. As well as a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and Android 8.0 (Oreo) – with Google’s Pixel flavor including support for Google Lens, Google Assistant, Active Edge, and ARCore. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus are the latest smartphones to arrive and have instantly become the most sought-after. On the surface, they might not look like much of an upgrade compared to their predecessors but looks can be deceiving as these two models come with a much greater emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR). Which means they now pack in even more added value than the already feature-rich Galaxy S8 line did. Probably, most impressively, Samsung has done this without adding to the cost as the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus have arrived at almost exactly the same price points the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus did last year. So these really are bargain premium phones offering an unrivaled number of OTT features as well as the design cues made famous by the Galaxy S line. </p>
<p> Interestingly, these two phones are also more different to each other than previous sibling launch devices from Samsung have been. This is best seen in the camera department as the Galaxy S8 Plus sports dual rear cameras while the standard model features a singular rear camera. Likewise, the S9 Plus also comes loaded with a 6.2-inch display, 6GB RAM and a 3,500 mAh battery while the standard model features a 5.8-inch display, 4GB RAM and a 3,000 mAh battery. Those differences aside, both models features a 2960 x 1440 resolution, 64GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 (or Exynos 9810 outside of the US), an IP68 rating, Bluetooth 5, facial recognition, AR Emoji, Android 8.0 (Oreo), and a ton of additional features. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Smartphones – May 2018 </p>
<p> Although May has only just started it is already shaping up to be a busy month. Two new phones have already been announced and at least two more are set to be announced before the month is done. So by the time June rolls around this list could be looking very different than it has in the past few months. In either case, if you are in the market for a new phone right now, then here are our top 10 best Android smartphone picks for May, 2018. </p>
<p> 10. Nokia 6.1 </p>
<p> Typically speaking this list is comprised of the very best phones available and by association this normally also means the most expensive. However, every once in a while a new phone comes through which is not actually a flagship smartphone but does offer great value to consumers. Like the Nokia 6.1. At the superficial level this is more of a rebranded Nokia 6 (2018) although the fundamental difference is that it comes running on Android One. Which is good news for those looking for an affordable smartphone as the Nokia 6.1 basically employs a stock version of Android and is therefore guaranteed to receive regular updates and for at least the next two years. Besides Android One, the spec list is also not that bad as the Nokia 6.1 features a 5.5-inch display along with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. As well as 3GB RAM, 32GB storage and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 SoC. Best of all, though, is the Nokia 6.1 is now available to buy for only $269. </p>
<p> When it comes to Samsung flagship devices the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus have now been superseded by the Galaxy Note 8, which in turn, has now been superseded by the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. So strictly speaking, these are now considered to be older phones. Quick product cycle aside, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus remain very good options for those looking for a flagship smartphone experience and especially at a cheaper price than what the others currently go for. In fact, it can be argued that very little has changed between the Galaxy S8 and S9 lines, which means buyers can expect a very similar experience overall, but again at that cheaper price. The main choice will be which model to go for with their differences coming down to the display size and battery life. As the Galaxy S8 features a 5.8-inch display with a 3,000 mAh capacity battery while the S8 Plus features a 6.2-inch display along with a 3,500 mAh capacity battery. Otherwise, both models feature 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US), a 12-megapixel rear camera, and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. As well as support for Samsung's Bixby and Pay services. </p>
<p> The HTC U11 looks likely to be very soon replaced by the next HTC U phone considering the company has now announced an event taking place this month. So those who are more of the HTC persuasion may want to hold out to see what the next U phone from HTC offers. Although, with the new one arriving now might actually be a good time to consider the U11 as is undoubtedly will be (and already has been) the subject of a price drop. Even at the full price, the HTC U11 was never an ultra-expensive phone and this means it will only become better value for money as the days and months pass. As for the phone, this one quickly became an iconic Android phone due to its dubbing as ‘the squeezable phone.’ This was due to the U11 being the first smartphone to boast a squeezing action to initiate a pre-set command. While this feature has now migrated to the likes of the Pixel 2, its versatility still remains better on the U11 with HTC letting the user choose the action. Making this a great and convenient way to kick-start a specific feature, like for example, the selfie camera. Besides its squeezable nature, the U11 also features a 5.5-inch display, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,000 mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> The Razor Phone is one of those devices that buyers will either love or hate. On the one side, this is a phone that sports a rather dated and boxy design, resulting in a far less attractive look compared to its contemporaries. On the other hand, this is a smartphone built with gamers in mind and this means it is a fairly powerful phone and in some respects, far more powerful than everything else on this list. For example, one of its big selling points is its 120Hz refresh rate which makes its 5.72-inch display much more responsive than on other phones. Likewise, this is a phone featuring 8GB RAM, along with 64GB storage and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. A core spec combination that suggests it will perform very well. Add to that expected lengthy levels of battery life thanks to the inclusion of a 4,000 mAh battery and a dual rear camera setup, and this on paper shapes up to be a solid phone. </p>
<p> There is a new LG phone in town and so the V30 line is no longer the newer line. This also means the LG V30S ThinQ is not the company’s newest phone anymore. Although, it is still a phone worth considering and is still new in the technical sense as pre-orders for this phone in the US have only opened recently. As for the phone, this is the latest V30 series phone and as result comes with a number of features and design traits common to other V30 line in general. For example, the design and general build quality is almost identical, as is most of the main specs. However, the RAM did get a slight boost compared to the standard V30 with the S ThinQ model featuring 6GB RAM. Likewise, the storage has also gained some and now comes in at 128GB. Otherwise buyers can expect a 6-inch display, a Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 3,300 mAh capacity battery, Android 8.0 (Oreo), and a keen emphasis on AI. So while this is not breaking the mold in any meaningful way, it does remain a viable option. Unless of course, you would rather hold out for the LG V35 ThinQ? </p>
<p> The Huawei P20 and the P20 Pro represent the latest smartphones from Huawei, although unlike most of the others on this list, these two phones are not available everywhere. For example, neither P20 model is expected to make it to the US. So depending on where an individual buyer is located might determine whether these are viable purchases. Availability aside and the two P20 models seeme like solid options for those who prefer Huawei's take on design and the camera experience. Although, of the two, the Pro model is certainly the more premium option. This is again, more notable in the camera department as while the standard P20 features dual rear cameras, the P20 Pro features a triple rear camera setup. Therefore, those looking for an even more heightened camera experience will likely want to consider the P20 Pro first and foremost. As for the rest of the specs, the P20 Pro offers a 6.01-inch display along with an 18.7:9 aspect ratio and a 2240 x 1080 resolution. Inside, the P20 Pro comes loaded with 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, a Kirin 970 octa-core SoC, facial recognition, a 4,000 mAh battery, and Android 8.1 (Oreo). In addition to a notch. </p>
<p> The LG G7 ThinQ is another new arrival to the smartphone scene, seeing it was only announced on May 2. In fact, this phone is so new that it is still not even available to pre-order although that is going to change with pre-orders set to open in the last week of May. So if you are after a new smartphone this month and like the LG way of doing things then the G7 is definitely worth considering and holding out for – as long as you are not on AT&T. However, whether you opt for the LG G7 may come down to your preference on the notch issue – as the G7 is the latest smartphone to boast a notch. To try and ensure the G7 ThinQ remains an option for everyone, the company has made the notch somewhat optional due to the G7’s ability to fade-in the background to artificially create more of a bezel look. Notch-aside and the G7 is all about the camera experience and AI, and both of these have been combined to create what LG calls “AI Cam.” Meaning the camera is more smarter than ever before and can now better analyze the environment to help users make the most of the camera’s settings, and take the best pictures. The display is also a point to note as LG reckons it is brighter than other displays while also boasting an elongated aspect ratio resulting in its 6.1-inch display being taller and slimmer. This is all in addition to remaining a size that is suited to one-handed usage. Other than that, a minimum of 4GB RAM and 64GB storage is on offer, as is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, a Quad DAC, a 3,000 mAh battery and an AI shortcut button. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 remains one of the best phones you can buy, and especially for those who are looking for a device that can do more. After all, one of the staple selling points of the Note line is its productivity and the Note 8 continues this trend with a clear emphasis on a larger display, greater multitasking capabilities, and a highly-integrated user experience with a stylus. This is literally the original and the best ‘phone with a pen’ you can buy. However, even for those that are less interested in using a pen with a phone, the Note 8 offers a heightened user experience coupled with a premium design. This is most notable in the camera department as the Note 8 was the first major Samsung phone to come to market boasting a dual rear camera setup. So not only is it capable of making use of features like ‘Portrait mode’ but the camera experience is actually packed with additional features and settings that will suit both those looking for more granular control, and those looking for more of a point-and-shoot solution – it is literally a phone built for all kinds of users. As for the specs, the Galaxy Note 8 is feature-rich in every respect. The display measures in at 6.3-inches and utilizes an 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2960 x 1440 resolution. Inside, the Note 8 comes loaded with 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (in the US). In addition, fast charging support is included, as is wireless charging, and even fast wireless charging. Not forgetting the wealth of Samsung-specific features, including Bixby and Pay. </p>
<p> When it comes down to whether you should buy the Pixel 2/2 XL or the number one choice for this month, the crux of the decision should come down to whether you prefer a more stock-like user experience or one enhanced by the manufacturer. If the answer is more stock-like then the Pixel 2 and 2 XL are simply the best phones you can buy right now. These are, after all, ‘Google phones’ and therefore come with hardware Google has specifically chosen to make best use of the software. In other words, these are not just phones which feature the best-in-class hardware for the sake of it, and then are topped off with additional features. Instead, the two have been tightly integrated to ensure a smooth and solid user experience overall. Which is why for example the Pixel 2 and 2 XL feature only one rear camera. As the software is capable of utilizing a totally artificial ‘Portrait mode’ and therefore two cameras were just not deemed to be needed. This applies to other areas of the phone as well with the two Pixel 2 models employing a squeezing action which has been tightly integrated with Google Assistant. It is these small, but useful tweaks to the software and matching up with the hardware that makes the two Pixel 2 phones such worthwhile purchases at the moment. When it comes to choosing between the two models, things could not be any simpler. As the Pixel 2 XL features a larger screen, a greater capacity battery, and an 18:9 aspect ratio for a taller and slimmer feel. Otherwise both models come loaded with an identical spec list including 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, a 12.3-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and Android 8.0 (Oreo). </p>
<p> Once again, the Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus top this list as the best Android smartphones you can buy today. These two are not only the newest flagship smartphones from Samsung, but also the richest in terms of features and specs. Resulting in significant value for money for those looking for more of an OTT experience. However, even when taking away all their additional features and Samsung-specific selling points, at the bare-bones level these are both great smartphones featuring a highly competitive spec list and a premium design unmatched by everything else listed here. Between the two, the Galaxy S9 Plus is the more expensive option although even here you are getting more for your money. For example, the Galaxy S9 Plus not only features a larger display overall and a greater capacity battery, but also more RAM (6GB) and two rear cameras – compared to the one rear camera included on the standard model. </p>
<p> So, yes, while these are expensive smartphones, they do offer a ton of features and a premium design that makes their cost much more relevant to the product. Not to mention, even at their expensive price, they are not technically that expensive. As some of the devices on this list cost more and offer less. In addition, there has been effectively no increase year-over-year with the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus launching for almost the exact same price the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus did in 2017. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Smartphones – October 2018 </p>
<p> The industry has, quite appropriately, renamed the month of October 2018 to Phonetober. You'll also find plenty of trending hashtags like #phonepocalypse, which pretty adequately covers the crazy feeling taking the industry by storm this month. It's surely an overload of good phones, shown quite obviously by the number of new phone reviews, hands-on features, and everything we've been publishing this month. That said, a whole slew of new devices are now available to choose from, and it's changing up the list of must-have devices more than any other time of the year. Our lists aren't just to display the absolute best phone available they're also designed to help people looking for a specific niche. Ready to find your next phone? </p>
<p> Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL </p>
<p> Google's latest and greatest are a little less great than we initially thought they'd be, but that doesn't make them bad phones. Starting at $800 for the smaller Pixel 3, and $900 for the Pixel 3 XL, these phones represent some of the more expensive ones on the list, but don't have as many features or cutting edge specs as many others on the list. Even still, Google has put together phones with a fairly solid experience that will likely please folks looking for something simple and elegant, all while offering fast monthly security updates, unlimited photo and video backup, and support straight from Google. The Pixel 3 family is available unlocked on the Google Store, and is also sold through Project Fi and Verizon. </p>
<p> The HTC U12+ is easily HTC's most interesting phone in quite some time, and it represents an amalgam of ideas and new technologies from the once-giant Taiwanese manufacturer. The buttons on the side are unlike anything you've probably ever used, with a force-touch feedback provided by the advanced vibration motors inside instead of having normal click-in buttons. They've also outfitted the phone with four cameras, two on front and two on back, all of which are capable of some truly amazing imagery. Video recording also includes something truly special as well; the ability to zoom into the audio source as well as the video. Directional audio recording enables some pretty incredible quality that you won't find anywhere else, and that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to awesome features of this phone. Check out our review if you're interested in learning all about it, it's really something special. </p>
<p> Razer launched their first phone this time last year to somewhat mixed reviews, and they've taken the majority of the complaints and improved upon them in this year's release of the Razer Phone 2. The Razer Phone 2 still sports that amazing 120hz display from the original Razer phone, as well as the biggest and best front-facing stereo speakers in the business. Razer has updated the look pretty significantly around back, where a brand new glass panel houses those amazing RGB lights that gamers seem to love, furthering the idea that this is the only gaming phone you'll need this year. </p>
<p> While we're actively reviewing the Sony Xperia XZ3 at this very moment, it's hard to argue that it's going to be a better buy than the recently released Xperia XZ2, which features almost identical specs without the high price tag of the XZ3. With a choice of sizes, both several hundred dollars less than the Xperia XZ3, and nearly identical specs, it's hard not to recommend Sony's blazing fast flagship with its brilliant new design for this price. While Sony's skin isn't nearly as feature-rich as manufacturers like Samsung, it's got far more in the way of options and meaningful extras than stock Android, all while maintaining speed and reliability. It's also got a killer camera with features like 1080p 960FPS super slow motion, and the amazing Predictive Shot for when action scenes get a little crazy with movement. </p>
<p> LG blew us away with the V30 last year, the best phone LG ever made up to that point, and they've followed up this year with another substantial upgrade. Sporting a new design that's quite similar to the LG G7 ThinQ, the V40 ThinQ is a powerhouse phone with a Boombox speaker built into its chassis, 6GB of RAM and a whopping 5 cameras. A new telephoto lens sits on the back for 2x optical zoom, and the wide-angle 107-degree camera is still available for taking the whole scene in at once. There's even a new wide-angle camera up front, right next to the standard camera, and LG's content-creation abilities are better than ever. </p>
<p> OnePlus is announcing the mid-cycle refresh OnePlus 6T in just a few days, but it doesn't look like that phone is aiming to fully replace the OnePlus 6 in every way. With a $529 price tag, the OnePlus 6 represents some of the absolute best value in the mobile market, as it not only sports the same specs of super-premium flagships like the Galaxy S9+, but it also features a premium build, the fastest version of Android around, and a camera experience that's more than great. OnePlus's own OxygenOS skin of Android is constantly being updated and tweaked, with timely updates and meaningful feature inclusions, all while not slowing the experience down or compromising on user choice. </p>
<p> Listing the features the Huawei Mate 20 family is missing would be a far easier task than listing everything these phones can do. Huawei delivered the stellar P20 and P20 Pro earlier this year, and they're following that up with a fully reimagined camera configuration, including a brand-new wide-angle camera to complement that 3x telephoto lens, giving it the best optics in the business out of the gate. Topping this off is one of the most gorgeous designs we've ever seen in the Mate 20 Pro, which isn't just curved on all sides, but features a fancy new etched glass pattern on the back that helps with the slippery nature of glass. Huawei's phones are a little more difficult to get than the should be in the US, but everywhere else worldwide shouldn't have a problem finding their model of choice.

<p> Pocophone F1 by Xiaomi </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Best doesn't always have to mean "most expensive," and Xiaomi is here to prove that value is king with the Pocophone F1. This offshoot brand still holds the Xiaomi name on the phone, and it even runs Xiaomi's incredibly beautiful and feature-rich MIUI Android skin, all while keeping the top-tier specs you'd expect from a Xiaomi flagship. A 6.18-inch 2246 x 1080 resolution LCD display is up front, and the phone is powered by 6GB of RAM and a Snapdragon 845, all for an unreal $350. No, that's not a typo, something that's especially mind-blowing in the age of $1,000 flagships that sport all the same base specs, and some that are even missing features of the Pocophone F1 too. This is the best value flagship of all time, there's no doubt given the quality of the software and the overall experience and speed, and if you're not interested in a fancy glass build or the absolute top-of-the-line camera and don't want to sacrifice speed or features, this is the phone to buy in 2018. </p>
<p> Samsung's reign in the world of Android only continues to be solidified with stellar flagships like the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+, two phones that are not only as feature-rich as they come, but with incredible designs, build quality, support, customization, and a whole host of exclusive features and services to boot. Some have said Samsug Pay is worth the price of entry alone, and then there are others who just can't be without Samsung's never-ending array of options and features, all of which add up to create the most comprehensive experience you'll find anywhere. The only way you can find a device with more hardware options is by choosing Huawei, and even then you'll have to give up some of the valuable services and features that only Samsung offers. This one comes in two sizes with nearly identical specs to boot, so you won't need to compromise if you don't like giant phones. </p>
<p> The king of Android regains the throne the year with an undisputed set of features and options that rival any phone out there, not to mention the hardware power to out-do basically anything else on the market. You'll pay a pretty penny for it at full retail price, but nowhere else can you get 8GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, the new Bluetooth S-Pen with remote control features, all of Samsung's incredible services and options, Samsung Pay, industry leading cameras, and support that most OEMs simply can't compete with. It's a power user's dream, yet still a phone that the "everyday man" can also appreciate thanks to the best displays in the business, Dolby Atmos speakers built into the body, and productivity options for any occasion. Phone of the year? It certainly covers more niches than most phones could hope to achieve, and because of that, there's little reason to recommend anything else if you're willing to spend the cash. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Smartphones – September 2018 </p>
<p> Fall is soon to be upon us, and that means the hottest phone release season of the year. We're hot on the heels of Samsung's big Fall release, the Galaxy Note 9, and are expecting big things of flagships from Huawei, Sony, Google, Xiaomi and plenty of others too. If you're in the market for a smartphone now though it doesn't always make sense to wait, especially since there's not much in the pipeline for huge hardware improvements before the year is over. Let's take a look at what the best Android phones for the month of September 2018 are! </p>
<p> vivo NEX S </p>
<p> Looking for something a little different from the norm this Fall? How about a phone with no notch, no bezels, a pop-up camera, in-glass fingerprint scanner and killer specs to go along with it? vivo has produced one of the most stunning phones to come out in 2018, and it's a phone that has no real compromise in its design. It's got powerhouse performance, killer battery life with that huge 4,000mAh battery, an awesome camera and tons of user-friendly features, but it's definitely not the phone for everyone. 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage are near the top of the charts as far as specs go, and the Snapdragon 845 inside paired with an OLED display mean that you'll be enjoying gorgeous high-definition content without slowdown. It works perfectly on T-Mobile and AT&T's US LTE networks, and any GSM-based MVNO in the US as well. If you want the most cutting edge design and features that you'll find on any phone right now, this is absolutely the phone to consider. </p>
<p> LG continues to offer two of the most compelling flagships of 2018 with the V35 ThinQ on AT&T or Project Fi, and the G7 ThinQ on T-Mobile. Both phones are available unlocked as well and will work on virtually any network that utilizes SIM cards, and while both of these phones feature near-identical specs when it comes to processing and cameras, they each offer unique features that might make one more compelling than the other. LG's V35 ThinQ sports a gorgeous notch-less OLED panel up front and a super thin and light body all around. The LG G7 ThinQ Utilizes an ultra-bright IPS LCD display with smaller bezels all around, albeit a notch up top, and improves the speakers on body by adding in what LG calls a "Boombox speaker." The V35 features a 300mAh larger battery than the G7, but the rest of the specs are identical outside of this. Depending on your carrier of choice, LG has two fantastic phones to choose from this year. </p>
<p> HTC has been making incredible flagship Android phones since the original Android phone to hit the market, the HTC Dream. Often you'll find that HTCs phones sport at least one major feature that other OEMs simply don't have, and it's here where we find Edge Sense 2.0's shining example of innovation. While some scoffed at the "squeezable bezels" when HTC launched the U11 last year, this year's U12+ improves upon those features and adds in a new double-tap gesture as well. The HTC Edge Launcher is probably one of the single most convenient ways to launch up to 22 of your favorite apps or perform actions, and all the other little goodies HTC has packed inside are well worth the price of entry. It's also got class-leading video recording options, including silky smooth 4K 60FPS recording that's incredibly well stabilized too. Don't forget the amazing colors HTC is packing, including both the transparent blue we had for review, as well as the stunning Flame Red color too. </p>
<p> It's been quite some time since BlackBerry has made a show-stopping device, but the BlackBerry KEY2 absolutely fits that description in just about every way. Sporting a very uncommon form factor in 2018, the BlackBerry KEY2 focuses on speed, convenience and security to wrap up the package nicely, and it's these areas where the phone shines above and beyond others on the market. It's difficult to describe just how convenient that keyboard is in a short span of time, but it's not just about physical keys for typing. The new Convenience Key allows for instant launching of up to 55 apps or other shortcuts or actions by pressing it alongside any other key on the keyboard. It's this sort of amazing multi-tasking that brings the KEY2 into the limelight, making this phone one of the fastest phones on the market, not because of raw power, but because of ways to perform actions and get things done without having to fuss with the home screen or shuffling through apps for specific features, as this can all be done from that physical keyboard. </p>
<p> Huawei's P20 Pro is easily one of the classiest devices on this list, with a range of colors that will make even a jeweler blush. Huawei has just launched 4 new colors to coincide with the celebration of 10 million P20 units shipped. Between the two models, that's a pretty incredible number, and it shows that Huawei can still perform well under adversity, despite the issues it has seen when trying to enter the US market. Huawei's P20 family both sport top-of-the-line specs, including Huawei's own in-house Kirin 970 SoC, as well as class-leading cameras all around. EMUI 8 packs in tons of features, and the upcoming EMUI 9 update brings Android 9 Pie alongside a bunch of other major headlining features as well. With 2-day battery life and a sleek and slender build, the P20 Pro is easily one of the best phones you'll be able to buy this year, even with the Mate 20 just around the corner. </p>
<p> OnePlus continues to make its value-focused phone even more valuable with consistent updates and regular feature additions. The recently released Android 9.0 Pie beta further shows this, as OnePlus has been among the elite few who have had Android 9.0 Pie betas throughout the development period this summer, and now OnePlus's own OxygenOS skin is available in beta for the new Android version as well. Outside of this, the OnePlus 6 offers among the fastest experiences on the market, a feature-rich and gorgeous skin on top of Android, and a camera that's in the top of the charts for quality, not to mention sporting a software design that's faster and more intuitive than any other out there. It's OnePlus's most expensive device yet, but it's easily among the best devices they've ever produced. </p>
<p> Sony may have just announced the Xperia XZ3 at IFA 2018, but that doesn't make the Xperia XZ2 any worse of a buy right now, especially considering the significantly cheaper price you'll be able to get the XZ2 for when compared to the upcoming XZ3. Sony has absolutely hit its stride with the Xperia XZ2, a phone that debuted Sony's new Ambient Flow design language, and sports some of the fastest and smoothest operation of any flagship, as well as killer battery life and the only family of smartphones on the market with the ability to record in 4K HDR quality. Sony is also one of the elite few to have an Android 9 Pie beta during the summer beta period, and should have their official feature-filled update out soon as a result. </p>
<p> It's a no brainer that, when you think of buying an Android phone, buying one of Google's own Pixel phones certainly makes the most sense. As the creator of Android, it logically follows that buying Google's own phone would deliver the most pure experience possible, and it's this, combined with the camera prowess that Google commands, that puts the Pixel 2 XL in the running for best Android smartphone around. Monthly security updates, major OS updates without delay, excellent support from Google, and a handful of exclusive features like unlimited full-quality photo and video backup from Google are just the tip of what makes the Pixel experience one-of-a-kind. </p>
<p> In a survey asking people what company they first think of when the name "Android" is said, the likelihood is that Google wouldn't be the first, despite being the creator and proprietor of the business. Rather, you're more likely to hear Samsung than any other name, and that's with good reason. While Samsung's marketing muscle may have been what brought some folks to their flagship Galaxy phones, it's the features and wide compatibility with accessories and exclusive services that keep many on the Samsung train, and it's in these ways that Samsung has one-upped themselves once again with the Galaxy S9 family, which builds upon the strengths of the Galaxy S8's design, and packs a few more features in as well. It's the most feature-packed phone you can get, ouside of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, and it's these features that often put Samsung in a class of their own when it comes to phones. </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Note line has been the king of the hill for some time now, and this year is an exceptional entry into an already exceptional heritage of phones. Sporting a 30% larger battery, bigger screen with reduced bezels, and an S-Pen with Bluetooth technology inside, the Galaxy Note 9 is the phone that can do everything you need, and plenty of things you didn't know you needed as well. It's far easier to list the things this phone can't do rather than give the epic laundry list of options available, and Samsung is packing in more than ever, all while doubling down on sustained performance over the life of the phone with a new water-carbon cooling system inside. Bottom line is this: you'll pay a lot, but you'll get a lot, and it's here where the power users will find their niche in the Galaxy Note 9. </p>

<p> In our list below you'll find some that are a little more obvious and some which may have been hidden gems. But all of them have their own strengths and can provide hours of fun. </p>
<p> It all depends on what exactly it is you're looking for in a basketball game. You could browse through all of the games on the Play Store yourself and there's nothing wrong with that. A lot of the options are a waste of time though, which is why we put together this list of the best basketball games on Android. To save you some time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Android Basketball Games – Ranked List </p>
<p> 10. Swipe Basketball 2 </p>
<p> This one is a bit of an older title entry on the list. But, it's got a decent rating and seems to still have active players. </p>
<p> The graphics are also a little more cartoon-like, so the game is likely to be more fun than serious and could be a great time filler for when you have an extra five or ten minutes. </p>
<p> It features multiplayer mode so you can play against others. As well as a pretty large collection of challenges that you can complete. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can also customize your characters with tons of different options from outfit pieces to different hair styles. If you're looking for a simple but fun-packed basketball game on Android this is it and definitely one reason why we picked it for our best games list. </p>
<p> 9. Rival Stars Basketball </p>
<p> This is another older title but again another fun basketball game that won't require you to memorize loads of controls. </p>
<p> Developed by PikPok, Rival Stars Basketball gives you easy gameplay in the palm of your hands. It's a mix of player card collection and swipe controls for completing matches. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's a multiplayer mode so you can play against others or you can move through the single player mode to play by yourself. </p>
<p> While the main part of the game seems to be actions that happen based on the cards you pick and use, there will be times where you're shifted into a 3D view of the game and will need to take shots. </p>
<p> It's a fun and unique option that eared it a spot on our best Android basketball games list. And because it's different from most of the other basketball games it should feel very accessible on a smartphone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> 8. MyNBA2K20 </p>
<p> Price: Free </p>
<p> In-game purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Download: Google Play </p>
<p> This is less of a game and more of an app but there are some game-like features which makes it a suitable pick for our best Android basketball games list. </p>
<p> MyNBA2K20 is actually the companion app for NBA 2K20, and feature things like card battle modes where you can see your collection of cards battle it out on the court against other players. </p>
<p> There's also a cool feature that lets you scan your face into NBA 2K20 so your players in that game look like you. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It also lets you earn virtual currency for use in the main game on PS4 or Xbox One. So if you play the main game you will probably want this app installed just for the extras. </p>
<p> There are also weekly events you can compete in which give you rewards for use in-game. Some will even pop up daily. </p>
<p> 7. NBA 2K Mobile Basketball </p>
<p> If you're a fan of the 2K franchise and aren't keen on paying for the mobile adaption of the console game, then you'll want to take a look at this game instead. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> NBA 2K Mobile Basketball is about as close you will get to NBA 2K on a device other than the mobile version of NBA 2K20. </p>
<p> And it's actually quite good. You can compete in 5v5 matchups or in a PvP mode and build your team of players. You can also collect cards from a roster of over 400 different players across the league. </p>
<p> The game even features some pretty good graphics and really easy controls. So you won't be fumbling around with them for hours. </p>
<p> Best of all this game is free, so you're getting a high-quality basketball game on mobile at no cost. </p>
<p> If you're feeling on your game you can challenge other teams of three. And if you find yourself playing this often enough then you may not want to miss out on the daily log-in rewards. </p>
<p> 6. NBA Live Mobile Basketball </p>
<p> EA is, surprisingly enough, still keeping this game up to date. And why shouldn't it? It's a pretty decent basketball game on Android and why we picked it for our top 10 best list. </p>
<p> With NBA Live Mobile Basketball you get to take your team all the way to the championship from the start of the season. </p>
<p> There are live events in the game that happen every single week to go along with all of the normal gameplay content. You won't want to miss out on these as they can end up giving you some pretty useful stuff. </p>
<p> When you begin the game you choose which team you want to play as, and then you get to choose a superstar player to lead that team throughout the season. </p>
<p> This is a pretty cool draft feature that lets you sort of pick the best of both worlds when it comes to your favorite teams and players. Especially if you're favorite player isn't on your favorite team. </p>
<p> The graphics are also overall, pretty good and the controls seems fairly easy to get used to. If you want a game that's in-depth but not overly complicated this could be it. </p>
<p> 5. NBA NOW Mobile Basketball </p>
<p> Another somewhat simple basketball game with simple controls. NBA NOW Mobile Basketball was designed to offer you controls that you can play with one hand. </p>
<p> The one-touch controls make this an ideal game for on the go. If you're out and about and you have only one hand free, you can still play this. And that was the idea. </p>
<p> In addition to the gameplay aspects, NBA NOW also has some non-gameplay features. Such as daily updated stats. With this particular feature you can actually keep up on how your favorite teams and players are doing. </p>
<p> Then hop into a game and play yourself. There's also a prediction feature where you can predict which teams will win during the regular season. Guessing correctly will net you rewards so you won't go home empty handed for participating. </p>
<p> You can also play the game solo or match up against other players for a more competitive game match. </p>
<p> 4. NBA 2K League </p>
<p> This next entry in our list isn't a game but it does relate to them. This is an app that is dedicated to giving you all the information you need on the NBA 2K Esports league. </p>
<p> It has information on all of the teams competing in the league , as well as details on when matches are taking place so you don't miss a beat. </p>
<p> There's even links to Twitter posts from the official NBA 2K League account, as well as a Twitch tab so you can check out the streams from your favorite teams. There's a schedule as well, because what would an app like this be without a schedule to tell you when the matches are actually happening. </p>
<p> The app also features highlights. If you enjoy Esports and NBA 2K League is one of the leagues you follow, then this is a must-have app. It's also one of the reasons why we chose it for our best Android basketball games list. </p>
<p> 3. NBA Jam </p>
<p> NBA Jam is a classic and probably one of the best basketball games on Android. Not just for its nostalgia purposes but because it's just a quality-made game. </p>
<p> It's also made by EA, but from a time when the company was less about cash grabs and more about making great sports games that players would love for years. </p>
<p> NBA Jam still holds up today too, and it's a paid game with no ads or in-game purchases. So you buy it once and that's it. </p>
<p> For that money you get the original game with a few tweaks that were added in to fit the game better for touchscreens and mobile devices. </p>
<p> You can play it on Android TV too if you want that old school feel of playing it on your old console. There are also four modes of gameplay, including online PvP and local multiplayer, and many more features. </p>
<p> If you grew up when this game came out, this is a perfect basketball game for you on your device. </p>
<p> 2. Basketball Stars </p>
<p> This is a little bit different than many of the games on this list. Because it's not about NBA. It's actually about street ball. </p>
<p> The gameplay is also 1v1 multiplayer. It's real-time multiplayer at that which means you will probably need to think on your feet if you want to best your opponent. </p>
<p> Matches are designed to be quick so you can hop into and out of gameplay whenever you feel like it. It features some pretty good graphics that are 3D and somewhat realistic, instead of a more cartoon-like design. </p>
<p> Outside of the 1v1 match ups you can collect different character customizations and give your players a unique style. In fact there are over 400 different customization options for you to choose from. </p>
<p> Overall this might be one of the best options on this list. Because it's free, it has good graphics, offers quality gameplay and gameplay is fast. </p>
<p> 1. NBA 2K20 </p>
<p> Rounding out our list of the best basketball games on Android is NBA 2K20. Some would call this the pinnacle of basketball games on the platform. </p>
<p> That might be a little subjective as some may not care for this style of sports game. Perhaps you like yours to be a little more casual. And if that's the case there are still some good options that were presented earlier. </p>
<p> NBA 2K20 is a very good game though, and it has loads of gameplay content on offer that puts it at the top of this list. </p>
<p> For starters, you get careers and stories modes. Which focus on your running through an entire season of the NBA with your team of choice. There's also the new Run The Streets mode which lets you play against others in 3v3 street ball games. </p>
<p> So if you like the street ball game type, you'll now get it here. Of course there's also multiplayer if you have to have some real competition. The game will let you connect to other players in one of two ways. Either through Google Play Games, or through a LAN connection to play with friends locally. </p>
<p> NBA 2K20 is a $6 game and it has micro transactions. So you're getting a paid game experience but there are additional things you can buy, if you so choose. </p>
<p> Even if you don't, this is still probably the best basketball game on Android for anyone who wants a console-quality experience. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Gaming Headphones – List </p>
<p> SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless </p>
<p> We're kicking this list off with the Arctis 1 Wireless from SteelSeries because we think this is a fantastic headset. Not only for the quality that SteelSeries is known for but because the headset is extremely versatile. </p>
<p> It'll work with multiple platforms, including PC and PS4. It'll also work with the Nintendo Switch and even your mobile device thanks to the small USB C dongle that you can plug into your phone or Switch. </p>
<p> Simply plug in the dongle and play games on the go with high-quality sound. SteelSeries even promises lossless audio. Another really awesome feature is the detachable ClearCast noise cancelling mic. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you don't plan to use voice chat, leave it unplugged. But if you end up playing something like Call of Duty Mobile, Destiny 2, Call of Duty Modern Warfare or any other game that benefits from team communication, insert the mic and have team chat ready to go. </p>
<p> Other notable features that deserve praise include the on-ear controls and the steel-reinforced headband. Across the board this is just a great headset with plenty of excellent features. And it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. </p>
<p> If you want something wireless and quality-made but don't want to spend hundreds, give the SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless a shot. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Razer Nari Ultimate Wireless </p>
<p> Razer's Nari Ultimate is double the price of the Arctis 1 Wireless, but this is Razer so their products are already a little more expensive, and the Nari Ultimate is a really good wireless headset. </p>
<p> Right off the bat the biggest features hit you in the face. It comes with 7.1 surround sound and THX audio as well as haptic feedback, so you get a full spectrum of immersion in whatever you're playing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It has the signature retractable mic with a built-in mute button that you can find on multiple headsets from Razer. This makes it easy to hide the mic away when you don't need it, and pull it back out when you do. </p>
<p> The soft cloth cushions on the ears have cooling gel in them for starters. Gaming headsets tend to stay on for quite a long time if you're in a long session. And eventually you ears might get warm and start to sweat. The cooling gel aims to combat that by preventing heat buildup. </p>
<p> It's also another multi-platform headset. The wireless will only work with PC and PS4. But, if you're inclined to use it with the Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, or mobile devices, you can by plugging it in with via the 3.5mm plug. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It can even be wired with PC if you prefer. All your controls are on the ears as well so they're easy to access. </p>
<p> Corsair Void Pro RGB </p>
<p> Corsair makes really good PC products and this headset is no exception. While I'm not necessarily too hot on the design, it's a good headset that functions well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's also wireless, has RGB lighting if you're into that, and it comes in a matte black look which is rather sleek. If your setup is matte black, this will pair well with it. </p>
<p> Aside from the looks and style, the Void Pro offers on-ear volume and mic controls, a flip up boom mic, and Dolby 7.1 surround sound for immersive audio, which you'll appreciate during the biggest gaming moments. </p>
<p> This one is a PC-only headset, so it doesn't have the multi-platform appeal of the other two. It does however offer low latency audio and a 40ft range, so if you need to get up and go to the kitchen to grab a drink, you shouldn't have issues as long as your kitchen isn't beyond that range. </p>
<p> If there's one annoyance about wireless headsets, it's that some have to be removed before you leave the room because they'll disconnect. If you're in a chat and want to continue talking, you can't. So if you're looking for that capability these should do the trick. </p>
<p> Razer Kraken 7.1 V2 </p>
<p> The Razer Kraken is one of Razer's best-selling headsets which is why it's been around for so long. Razer just keeps making better versions of it. </p>
<p> The Kraken 7.1 V2 was also my go-to headset for a couple of years because of how amazing it was. It's wired, so you don't have the freedom of a wireless option, but at $100 or less you can't go wrong with this. </p>
<p> The retractable mic makes for easy storage when not in use, and of course the headset supports Chroma if you love your RGB. It also has 7.1 surround for immersive gaming audio, and it's quite comfortable thanks to how light it is. </p>
<p> Really the best thing about it though is the metal band. It doesn't feel cheap and like it will break if you accidentally bend it too much. Audio-wise it puts out some pretty good sound. It's just an overall great headset option and another one that won't cost you too much. </p>
<p> Sometimes you can even find it on sale for less than then standard $100 price tag. </p>
<p> Logitech G Pro X </p>
<p> Logitech's G line of PC accessories for gamers is a well-known brand and are some of the best you can get. They're also not too expensive compared to some of the other high-end options. </p>
<p> The Logitech G Pro X is one of the best pairs of gaming headphones for a few reasons. But the biggest is probably the inclusion of the Blue Voice technology embedded in the mic. </p>
<p> Blue makes excellent makes microphones that are used by plenty of streamers. So Logitech adding this into the mic for its headset is ensuring gamers that their teammates will always hear them. Loud and clear. </p>
<p> The mic is detachable too, so you don't always have to have it protruding from the earcup. If you're not using it, take it off and store it. Beyond the mic quality, the headset is wired, has 7.1 object-based surround sound, and it has large 50mm drivers for big sound. </p>
<p> It doesn't have any RGB lighting, but if you're more concerned about the sound than anything else these are a really good option. Especially for the price. </p>
<p> Astro A50 </p>
<p> If you're not opposed to spending a significant amount more, the Astro A50 are one of the more popular high-end models you can find. </p>
<p> They're wireless, the earcups are big, comfortable, and you get a big flip up boom mic that makes it easy for others to hear you. You also get Dolby Audio, a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 15 hours and a base station to set the headphones on. </p>
<p> This keeps them in a designated spot that not only makes them easy to grab when you're ready to game but they also look good among your setup. </p>
<p> With features like Voice Balance, you can control and adjust the volume of the game audio and chat audio individually so that you have just the right amount of sound for both. This is huge when you want to be able to hear your teammates but don't want to miss out on the game audio. </p>
<p> HyperX Cloud Stinger </p>
<p> If you're looking for a truly good value without compromising on features, the HyperX Cloud Stinger is one of the best pairs of gaming headphones you can find. </p>
<p> The best part? They only cost around $48. They have a fairly high rating on Amazon and there are over 6,100 ratings. That should tell you what actual consumers think about this headset. </p>
<p> It's a no frills option that isn't wireless, so if you want something wireless you will want to consider something else on this list. Or a wireless pair we may not have mentioned. </p>
<p> Wireless headsets do generally cost more though. Wireless aside, the HyperX Cloud Stinger is a great fit for anyone that has a focus on getting headphones with excellent quality sound. This headset ticks every box in that department. </p>
<p> It's also comfortable to wear, has a big adjustable boom mic (which has the swivel to mute function), and it's multi-platform. So for under $50 you can get a pair of gaming headphones that works with PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices. </p>
<p> It's the one headset for all your stuff. </p>
<p> Sennheiser GSP 670 </p>
<p> Sennheiser is one of those brands that you may not think of when you think of gaming headphones, but they make some of the best pairs of gaming headphones on the planet. </p>
<p> This is in large part because Sennheiser simply makes some of the best headphones in general. And the company has taken its expertise and applied it to gaming headphones. </p>
<p> The GSP 670 are a pricey pair of cans. But they're worth every penny thanks to the wonderful sound quality and wireless setup. </p>
<p> The headphones also feature separate volume wheels for the chat and the main system audio. Use the big wheel to adjust the volume for your games, and the small wheel to adjust the volume of your chat. </p>
<p> You can flip up the boom mic to mute the chat too if you need to step away for a second. It also isolates noise extremely well, and the adjustable fit makes these some of the most comfortable headphones ever. </p>
<p> These are now my daily drivers and I'd be hard-pressed to find a pair I like more. </p>
<p> HyperX Cloud Alpha </p>
<p> Take everything about the HyperX Cloud Stinger and upgrade it and that's essentially what you have with the Cloud Alpha. </p>
<p> It's got the same extreme comfort for longer gaming sessions and top-quality sound thanks to its dual chamber drivers. Where it takes a step up above the Cloud Stinger is the detachable braided in-line cable that you use to plug the headset into your devices. </p>
<p> It also has a detachable boom mic, which the Cloud Stinger does not have. Those upgrades though are going to cost you a little bit more. The Cloud Stinger is on this list because it's a great headset, but also because it's an even better value at under $50. </p>
<p> The Cloud Alpha is double the cost at $100, but you get a more durable headset (it has an aluminum frame) and better features. This headset is multi-platform too like many of the ones we picked, and can be used with PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices. </p>
<p> SteelSeries Arctis Pro </p>
<p> Rounding out this list is the most expensive option, but perhaps also the best option. At least for some users. </p>
<p> The SteelSeries Arctis Pro is packed full of premium features that will have you finding it difficult to want any other headset. It works with both PC and PS4 so you can flip between both your console and your computer with relative ease. </p>
<p> It's got a retractable mic for easy storage when you aren't in chat, and the wireless has a pretty darn good range on it so you can get up and move about. </p>
<p> These have 20 hours of game time on them so you can use them for quite a while. Once that battery dies though, you don't need to plug the headset back in. Because the Arctis Pro comes with two swappable batteries. </p>
<p> One goes in the headset for the 20 hours of game time, the other sits in the base station and charges. When you need to, simply flip the batteries and put the charged up one in the headset, while you charge the dead battery. Rinse and repeat as needed. </p>
<p> This allows you to essentially have a wireless headset that never dies. So long as you remember to keep one battery charged at all times. Long game sessions? Not a problem for the Arctis Pro. </p>

<p> Best Google Chromebooks – Updated October 2020 </p>
<p> Choosing from the best Chromebooks on the market has become a fairly complex process as the number of available devices has grown year after year. The market for the devices now includes low-end budget machines and top-tier workhorses. But it also includes a number of off-format devices. Chromebooks are no longer limited to just laptops and 2-in-1 convertibles. </p>
<p> The decision-making process has perhaps been made more challenging alongside improvements to Chrome OS itself. With each successive launch of a new version, the difference made by variations in performance becomes more prominent. </p>
<p> When the OS first launched, premium devices weren't necessarily a lot more capable than budget gadgets. Now, a high-end device can be utilized for everything from light browsing to Android development. But they can also be used for heavier tasks such as for image or video editing. So budget Chromebooks won't always fit the bill. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Chromebooks 2020 Summary </p>
<p> As the array of available Chrome OS devices has increased over the years, the number of plausible use cases has too. So not every Chromebook is going to be well suited to every user. In fact, most users averaging most of their time in the Chrome browser won't need more than a budget device. Those gadgets will typically run Android apps well enough too. </p>
<p> There are more powerful gadgets available for those who need to get more serious work done too. And Chrome OS offers access to Linux apps, Android apps, and web apps. So there's plenty of software to take advantage of the extra processing power available. </p>
<p> Fortunately, Android Headlines has spent a lot of time conducting reviews and research on Chromebooks. That's helped us to determine which devices really stand out from the pack. It also allows us to make an attempt at making the process of choosing a lot easier. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, not every great or deserving Chromebook will have made this list. And many of those that didn't will easily suit users as well as those that did. Bearing that in mind, here's our take on the best Chromebooks currently available to suit just about any need. </p>
<p> Best small budget Chromebook </p>
<p> Samsung Chromebook 4 </p>
<p> Price: From $229 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> The Samsung Chromebook 4 is one of the least expensive small form-factor Chromebooks on the market, starting at just $229 and maxing out at $279. But that doesn't mean this clamshell laptop is weak. Chrome OS devices tend to do a lot more with less power, to begin with. So anybody looking for a cheap device that's ultra-portable at just 11.6-inches would do well to start here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are three configurations for the Samsung Chromebook 4 on Amazon but each iteration packs a stalwart Intel Celeron N4000 processor. From there, Samsung includes either 4GB or 6GB RAM. The latter configuration comes with 64GB storage, while the 4GB variant comes with either that or 32GB. A battery that lasts up to 12-hours, conversely, makes this one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks too. </p>
<p> Setting aside internal specs, there's less reason to worry about ruining that investment here too — small, though that investment is. Samsung has ensured this little beast meets eight standards for military-grade toughness. </p>
<p> The MIL-STD-810G standards met include transit drop, vibration, high temperature, temperature shocks, freezing, dust, humidity, low pressure. There's no water-resistance rating, but that's not unexpected with Chromebooks and doesn't stop this from being one of the best around. The Samsung Chromebook 4 should survive just about everything else better than most of the competition. </p>
<p> Best full-size budget Chromebook </p>
<p> Acer Chromebook 514 </p>
<p> Price: From $338.49 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Without sacrificing too much, the Acer Chromebook 514 is another budget Chromebook that brings quite a lot to the table in a slightly larger form factor. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Not only is the Chromebook 514 loaded up with a 14-inch 1,920 x 1,080 display panel in a 0.7-inch thin lay-flat aluminum chassis with 6mm bezels, a backlit keyboard, and Gorilla Glass on both the panel and touchpad. A Noble lock slot, both standard ‘A’ and newer C-type USB ports, and a microSD card slot are part of the package too. </p>
<p> That’s an outstanding value already for between $338 to $499. </p>
<p> Inside, Acer has also equipped the Chromebook 514 with one of the best batteries in the business. That’s rated at 12-hours per charge and perfectly suited for whatever work needs to be done without the hassle of always searching for a charging port. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The processor found in this device may not be the most powerful around. But it does come with up to 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 64GB of storage — arguably the more important figures with Chrome OS — to back up the Intel Pentium N4200 chipset. </p>
<p> So, Acer gives buyers a solid design without the extra cost of a stylus, 360-degree hinge, and similar novelties. Instead, it opened up for consumers who need a device that just works and works well, while providing some great amenities and features to meet just about every need of an everyday user. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook 2-in-1 </p>
<p> ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 </p>
<p> Price: From $463.91 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> ASUS’s continuation of the Chromebook Flip lineup has been among the most popular series and that’s not without good reason. The most recent entry in the family is the Chromebook Flip C436. But that device starts at a higher price and only packs up to an Intel Core i5 chipset. </p>
<p> The ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 packs in up to an Intel Core i7-8500Y chipset, coupled with 8GB of memory and 128 GB for files and apps. The base model, with a still-powerful Intel Core M3-8100Y Processor, 4GB RAM, and 64GB storage starts out at a relatively low $489.99. </p>
<p> In terms of build, the Chromebook Flip C434 brings a 14-inch 1,920 x 1,080 resolution display to the table. That's in an ultra-slim-bezel-touting all-metal package that’s more about refinement than making massive changes to the series. </p>
<p> Dual speakers and a microSD card slot round things out for this touch-enabled 2-in-1 but a slightly more expensive model begins adding in the features users love, beginning with a backlit keyboard. That keyboard is where the Chromebook Flip C434 really gains its reputation. The comfort and productivity-focused keys deliver 1.4mm of key travel and a unique ergonomic lift at the back of the board as the lid is opened up. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook for students </p>
<p> Acer Chromebook Spin 512 </p>
<p> Price: From $499 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Acer </p>
<p> Acer’s second entry in our list is a device that’s built with students in mind but will serve just about anybody. The Chromebook Spin 512, on the student-friendly side of things, is a 12-inch 2-in-1 convertible laptop that features a microbe-resistant display coating and spill protection thanks to drain-through slots positioned over the keyboard. </p>
<p> Following in that same vein, this Chromebook can withstand a beating. Acer included a rubber trim and extra reinforcement with this gadget, so it’s going to survive falls from a reasonable height too. </p>
<p> The trim doesn’t take away from the aesthetics and the coating doesn’t interfere with touch interactions. On the former front, the ruggedization is melded into the build itself, keeping things slim and the overall bulk down. That means that although this laptop can be used without worry that it’ll be damaged by rough users, it also doesn’t take up a lot of room in a laptop bag or backpack. </p>
<p> The included EMR stylus makes productivity and creativity tasks a breeze, as does the up to 8GB RAM, 64GB storage, and the respectable quad-core Intel Pentium Silver N5000 processor. The starting cost of $499 for the more budget-friendly but still quite capable models isn’t bad either, despite featuring a slightly lower resolution than others listed here — 1,366 x 912. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook for tablet buyers </p>
<p> Google Pixel Slate </p>
<p> Price: From $799 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Google </p>
<p> Google’s Pixel Slate Chrome OS tablet didn't receive rave reviews. At least not initially. But changes being made to the underlying firmware have made the latter gadget a worthy entry nonetheless. </p>
<p> Priced to start at $799 and maxing out at just shy of $1600, the Google Pixel Slate stands as a testament to Chrome OS. Or, more specifically, it stands as a representation of where Chromebooks were supposed to go — before the search giant moved all of its own hardware efforts back to laptops. That means it's an absolute powerhouse at any level and for any configuration and that's where it stands out from the rest. </p>
<p> Pixel Slate ships with up to an 8th-generation Intel Core i7 available, backed by 16GB RAM and 256GB of storage, and packed into an all-metal frame. Google embeds that frame with a fingerprint scanner built into the power button. A “molecular” 3,000 x 2,000 resolution touchscreen in a super-slim 12.3-inch format comprises the main body. And an 8-megapixel camera sensor can be found at both the front and back. </p>
<p> Google sells both a keyboard and pressure-sensitive stylus for this tablet too. Those cost an additional $199 and $99, respectively, representing the only real drawback for those who really need this much power. </p>
<p> Best detachable Chromebook </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook Duet </p>
<p> Price: From $249 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Best Buy </p>
<p> Available from $249 directly from Lenovo or starting at $279 on Amazon, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet — often dubbed the Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Duet — is not what people probably think of when looking for a powerful new computing device. </p>
<p> Not only is the 10.1-inch device powered by a relatively paltry MediaTek P60T processor instead of Intel. Lenovo also equipped this tablet-like detachable laptop with just 4GB RAM and either 64GB or 128GB storage. The difference in cost between the two models is around $20. </p>
<p> It's minimal in the sense that there's only a single USB-C port and it ships with a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter instead of featuring one. There's no expandable storage either. But there's more to this all-metal Chromebook than meets the eye. </p>
<p> Lenovo designed the Lenovo Chromebook Duet to make computing on the go as straightforward as possible. For its size, it offers one of the best keyboard experiences around. And its processor is more than enough, coupled with well-optimized Chrome OS in both tablet and laptop configuration, to get real work done. </p>
<p> Lenovo includes a bright and vibrant 1920 x 1200 resolution display coupled with stereo speakers that give a lot of quality for the price. That's universal stylus compatible for even more productivity on the go at a slightly higher cost. </p>
<p> All of that culminates in a device that arguably represents what Chrome OS tablets should have been from the start. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook in the mid-range </p>
<p> Google Pixelbook Go </p>
<p> Price: From $649 Where to buy: Google </p>
<p> There's one device in particular that simply can't be left out of any discussion about the best Chromebooks on the market. That's Google's Pixelbook Go. Starting out at $649 up to $1,399, the Pixelbook Go is a testament of how far Chromebooks have come. </p>
<p> Google built Pixelbook Go with a grippy, ridged bottom and from magnesium alloy. That comes in either Just Black or Not Pink, just like the company's smartphones. </p>
<p> Google ships two base models for Pixelbook Go. It ships both of those with 8GB RAM but with a split between one device with 64GB or another with 128GB storage. The former, like the Google Pixel Slate above, utilizes an Intel Core m3 processor while the later is an Intel Core i5. Stepping up from there is a Core i5 model with 16GB RAM and double the storage at 256GB. </p>
<p> The top model for Google's best Chromebook ships with an Intel Core i7 processor. It backed that up with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage. The search giant also bumps things up from a Full HD display panel to a 4K screen. </p>
<p> Rounding out the package, Google includes all the ports that could be needed and a Titan C security chip. Ambient light sensors, a backlit Hush Keys keyboard, and an etched glass trackpad are part of the build too. And a 1080p 60fps webcam for video chatting or conferencing. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook for power and a long-lasting battery </p>
<p> HP Chromebook x360 14 </p>
<p> Price: $599 </p>
<p> Where to buy: HP </p>
<p> HP’s Chromebook x360 14 is an anomaly in that it brings both the stunning aesthetic of the HP Chromebook x2 as well as a more powerful build, sacrificing the detachable design for a 2-in-1. There’s no pen here either but users do get to keep the Bang & Olufsen speakers found on that other gadget. </p>
<p> The bezels to either side of the 1,920 x 1,080 resolution touchscreen too, providing for a lot more display in a relatively small, lightweight package. </p>
<p> The real selling point for this $599 Chromebook, however, is its high-clocked 2.2GHz Intel Core i3-8130U chip. That’s boostable up to a whopping 4GHz. 8GB of 2400MHz DDR4 RAM back that chipset up. That’s equipped with a UHD-capable graphics chip too, for better display output over USB-C. So there’s plenty of power despite the 13.5-hour-rated battery. </p>
<p> Storage falls in at 64GB, coupled with Chrome OS’s cloud-centric nature. That means there’s enough room for apps, files, games, or whatever else might be needed. </p>
<p> HP’s Chromebook x360 14 is a medium-to-large sized laptop that has a lot of bang for the price and lasts all day with extra to spare. Better still it goes a long way to catching attention thanks to its two-tone ceramic white on mist blue design. So if those things are important, this is the one to buy. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook at a premium </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Chromebook </p>
<p> Price: $999 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Best Buy </p>
<p> The branding of Samsung's recently launched Galaxy Chromebook is no mistake. Not only does this Chrome OS 2-in-1 pack in a housed S Pen stylus. The design and hardware meet a flagship Samsung expectation too. </p>
<p> The entire thing weighs just 2.2lbs. That's despite its 13.3-inch 4K Super AMOLED touch-enabled display — AMOLED here is a first for a Chrome OS device. And this all-metal Chromebook is just 9.9mm thin. </p>
<p> Samsung equipped the Galaxy Chromebook with up to 16GB LPDDR3 RAM and 1TB SSD storage. And up to an Intel Core i7 chipset will become available too. </p>
<p> For now, the 8GB RAM and 256GB PCI-e storage should prove more than ample. Especially paired with this device's Intel Core i5 10th Gen chip. And that's especially true since the turbo clock speed on that chip is up to 4.2GHz. </p>
<p> On the storage front, that's going to be aided by support for up to 2TB expansion via micro SD card and up to 512GB via UFS card. </p>
<p> A backlit keyboard, fingerprint unlocking, and both front- and world-facing HD cameras round out premium features. The sole drawback is that its thin design equates to a smaller battery than competitors. </p>
<p> Everything about this Samsung vision for Chromebooks screams premium, making it effectively the best device at the upper reaches of the cost spectrum that can currently be had. </p>
<p> Best Chromebook overall </p>
<p> Acer Chromebook Spin 713 (CP713-2W) </p>
<p> Price: From $629.99 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Acer </p>
<p> Acer has pushed itself back to the top of the stack when it comes to the best Chromebooks around. And that's all thanks to its new Chromebook Spin 713, sold with model designation CP713-2W. This device series effectively represents the best of what Chromebook can be. </p>
<p> In part, that comes down to value. Starting at just $629.99 and ranging up to $999, none of the entries are weak. At the bottom of the pile, things start with a 10th Gen Intel Core i5-10210U. Acer backed that up with 8GB DDR4 RAM and 128GB of NVMe storage. </p>
<p> The latter spec stays the same across the board. But the top of the pile is a 16GB RAM-backed Intel Core i7-10510U. And each of the gadgets packs a 2-in-1 build with a 13.5-inch 2K screen in an aluminum lid. Ruggedization up to MIL-STD 810G and an antimicrobial trackpad and screen round things out. </p>
<p> Regardless of which model is purchased, users are also given a backlit keyboard and every input/output port imaginable. That includes a full-size HDMI port. </p>
<p> Everything's backed by a fast-charging battery that should last 9-hours easily and 10-hours at max. </p>

<p> Android News / Top 10 Best Value Smartphones You Can Buy Right Now – October 2019 </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Value Smartphones You Can Buy Right Now – October 2019 </p>
<p> The world of the high-value smartphone continues its relentless push forward with the launch of new flagships from OnePlus and Huawei, among others. But not everybody either wants to or can afford to spend an exorbitant amount of money on their next smartphone. </p>
<p> The reality is that there’s no real reason to spend the cost of a new computer on a smartphone either. Most smartphones above a certain price and value point will more than meet the needs of most users. The majority of those will be replaced by users with a new gadget within just a few years' time. </p>
<p> Fortunately, the technology keeps moving forward too, whittling away at the contrasts between a ‘premium’ device and a ‘budget’ device. That shift offers potential buyers a bit more flexibility when it comes to brands and models. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But not every high-value smartphone is quite on par. There are still plenty of differences and caveats to consider for those looking for a great experience that suits their individual needs. Given the sheer number of OEMs and devices to consider, choosing one can be a daunting task. Here at Android Headlines, we do a lot of research and reviews to help make the decision easier. </p>
<p> That doesn't mean that every device that deserves placement here is going to have earned it. Device evaluations are subjective and there are dozens upon dozens of devices to select from. A significant portion of those may suit any single user's needs as well as the phones listed here. </p>
<p> With that in mind, here’s our take on the top devices available to buy now. Each offers a great value to users that we feel surpasses all others without breaking the bank. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> 10. Xiaomi Mi 9T </p>
<p> Anybody looking for an all-around great experience for around $300 is going to want to add the Xiaomi Mi 9T to their list. Not only does this 6.39-inch device sport an HDR-compatible AMOLED FHD+ (2340 x 1080) panel. That panel also packs in a fingerprint scanner and isn’t marred by notches, holes, or cutouts. Instead, the front-facing 20-megapixel snapper is hidden on a mechanical slider that activates only when it's needed. </p>
<p> That display is used to give users ready access to nearly stock Android 9 Pie — and later, it’s expected, Android 10. Powering that experience, apps, and everything else, Xiaomi incorporated a powerful Snapdragon 730 SoC coupled with 6GB RAM and 64GB storage. Conversely, the hardware’s powered by an 18-watt fast charging-compatible 4,000mAh battery. That should be more than enough to get just about anybody through a day on a single charge. </p>
<p> Those are all great features to have but aren’t the only features that are noteworthy here. The primary cameras Xiaomi placed in the Mi 9T’s gorgeous Flame Red, Glacier Blue, or Carbon Black frame are nothing to scoff at either. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Xiaomi includes a triple camera array that all centers around a 48-megapixel wide-angle camera. Backing that up is a pair of snappers at 8-megapixels and 13-megapixels. Those are telephoto and 124-degree wide-angle lenses, respectively. 4K video capture and slow-motion at up to 960 frames-per-second are part of that package too. </p>
<p> So, where this handset is available, it's absolutely a solid choice in the high-value smartphone portion of the Android spectrum. </p>
<p> 9. Razer Phone 2 </p>
<p> Android gamers who don’t mind waiting on Android 10 — actually the sole reason this phone is ranked so low in this list — need to look no further than Razer Phone 2. The manufacturer only just got around to finishing the Android 9 Pie rollout. So the latest firmware isn’t going to be the biggest selling point here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But this is a phone that’s made explicitly to play the biggest titles available on mobile. It has plenty of design and software touches to back that up. </p>
<p> That all starts with last year’s flagship SoC, the Snapdragon 845. The chipset is older but still going to be among the strongest performers in any smartphone. Razer packed in 8GB of RAM too, along with 64GB of expandable storage. Providing power to the package is a 4,000mAh battery with both wireless and wired charging. </p>
<p> The specs listed there are all good and well but do nothing without a good display. So Razer topped all of that with a QHD 5.72-inch LCD panel. That HDR-compatible screen drives graphics at a refresh rate of 120Hz. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Audio is on point here as well, propping up the experience further for gamers and making this a competition-ready phone. A large top and bottom bezel may seem a bit old school but dual front-firing speakers might just make up for that. Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 serves to make that all the more appealing. </p>
<p> For just $379 — down from a $799 MSRP — users also gain a customizable LED logo, dual 12-megapixel primary snappers, and an 8-megapixel selfie shooter in the IP67 rated frame. For a few bucks more on Amazon, buyers can pick up a silicone case or a screen protector bundled in too. The value here is high for smartphone gamers. </p>
<p> 8. Sony Xperia 10/10 Plus </p>
<p> At a respective price of just over $323 or $392, Sony’s Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus will be the top high-value-focused Android smartphones for fans of the brand. Not only does it represent an initial effort bringing all of Sony’s previously tech separated divisions together. The company has also begun the process of updating some of these gadgets’ assets to Android 10. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That means the hardware experience is well accented by a software experience that should be updated sooner than later with these Sony devices too. </p>
<p> On the former front, Sony has loaded up the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus with either a 6-inch or 6.5-inch FHD+panel. That’s featuring Sony’s tech to deliver cinematically accurate color in a 21:9 ultra-wide (or ultra-tall) format. The same joining of tech applies to Sony’s camera unit. The company includes a dual-lens 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel primary snapper with the latter being boosted to 8-megapixels with 2x optical zoom in the Plus variation. </p>
<p> Audio won’t be lacking either, thanks to DSEE HX and LDAC encoding being added by Sony’s audio division. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A Snapdragon 630, with 3GB RAM in the Sony Xperia 10. 4GB memory back up a slightly more powerful Snapdragon 636 in the larger model. Both models have ample storage at 64GB. That’s expandable to 512GB via a microSD card. The battery capacity in either is either 2,870mAh or 3,000mAh, depending on the model chosen. </p>
<p> 7. ASUS Zenfone 6 </p>
<p> While the flagship-level ASUS Zenfone 6 was already held back by limited carrier capability, the state of availability for the smartphone has actually worsened since it first appeared on this list of high-value devices. No longer available via Amazon, users are going to have to turn to less-well-known sites if they want to pick on up. </p>
<p> At just $499, however, it still unquestionably belongs here among its high-value smartphone counterparts. </p>
<p> A dual-camera packing a Sony IMX 586 at 48-megapixels can be found at the back, which flips forward on a hinge to act as a selfie shooter. That leaves the entire front of the device, at 6.4-inches, to the gadget’s FHD+ Gorilla Glass 6 display panel. ASUS built Zenfone 6 around a Snapdragon 855 SoC with ‎6GB or 8GB RAM and 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB storage. Storage is expandable. </p>
<p> The camera is going to be the primary selling point since it’s a primary snapper instead of a selfie shooter. That includes all of the expected modes that come with the main camera on a modern smartphone. But the biggest advantage is going to be the quality that delivers for selfies and wide-angle selfies. That experience is going to arguably be second-to-none on the simple basis that it's the main camera taking the images. </p>
<p> But the ASUS Zenfone 6 earns its place here with its flagship specs above all else, priced well below the expected price point. It currently runs Android 9 Pie and is expected to receive an update to 10 too. So that’s only going to get better going forward. Or at least it will where it can still be purchased for use. </p>
<p> 6. Samsung Galaxy A50 </p>
<p> Samsung’s splash in the high-performance mid-range segment comes in the form of the Galaxy A-series. The devices are intended to set a bar for testing and experimenting with new features with a wider audience than its flagships typically draw in. Among the best of those devices is the Galaxy A50. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy A50 continues falling in price, making it even more appealing. Last month it fell four dollars following a nearly $100 price drop before that. This month, that cost fell again to land at a starting point of just $238 on Amazon. Or, users can pick it up with a case and 64GB microSD card for just under $250. </p>
<p> Despite that price, the Samsung Galaxy A50 is a sum of plenty of top new features. That all starts with the in-display fingerprint scanner. A 6.4-inch slim-bezel Super AMOLED Infinity-U display tops that, delivering Android 9 Pie-based OneUI — expected to receive Android 10-based OneUI 2.0. </p>
<p> A feature-rich triple camera array adorns the back of this high-value smartphone. That comes complete with almost all of the same features found in the popular and reputation-building Galaxy S series. </p>
<p> Under the hood, that package is coupled with a larger than average 4,000mAh battery and in-house Exynos processor. </p>
<p> Three colors are available for this flagship-emulating handset. Those include a stately Black, Blue, or White. Samsung has ensured that each comes with ample RAM and storage to back the processor — on par or better than what most competitors in the cost bracket have available. </p>
<p> Fans of Samsung would do well to start their buying process by considering the Samsung Galaxy A50 or the next entry in place of its much pricier flagships. </p>
<p> 5. Samsung Galaxy A70 </p>
<p> Likely the reason for continued price drops for the Samsung Galaxy A50, the Galaxy A70 is a more powerful device following in the same vein. It’s also been getting its own price drops recently. In fact, it’s now available for $338.00 or just under a dollar over that, depending on the color that's picked. That’s nearly $30 cheaper than last month. </p>
<p> For that price, users are getting many of the same features as the Galaxy A50 via Samsung’s OneUI. That will be updated to a second-generation iteration at some point in the future but it’s the fact that the A70 is backed by considerably better hardware that sets it apart. </p>
<p> Here, users are getting the octa-core Snapdragon 675 SoC backed up by 6GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage. That’s double the capacity and 2GB more on memory than the smaller device. </p>
<p> The cameras are bolstered too, starting with the primary snapper. That sensor has been bumped from 25-megapixels to 32-megapixels. </p>
<p> Digging deeper under the hood, the 4,500mAh battery is 500mAh bigger thanks to the larger 6.7-inch display panel adding some room. That’s the same type of display found in the Samsung Galaxy A50 but 0.3-inches won’t go amiss for those who might need extra space. </p>
<p> All of those singularly minor updates stack to a much better device for comparatively little money. That high-value smartphone package is only made better by the fact that this is a Samsung-built device. As the world's top smartphone manufacturer, that brings a level of reputation not found with many competitors as well as plenty of support if anything does go wrong. Users can pick up the Samsung Galaxy A70 in Blue, Black, or White from Amazon. </p>
<p> 4. Moto Z4 </p>
<p> Motorola’s Moto Z4 is maintaining its position for three reasons. Chiefly, it’s because this device is 5G compatible, with some caveats. It’s also because of better specs than many competitors at high-value cost intrinsic in a top Android smartphone. Alongside that, there are some Pixel-like features and other value-added features too. </p>
<p> On the first of those highlights and the last, the Moto Z4 is a semi-modular handset. There are magnetic pins at the back which attach to add-on ‘moto mods’ to add functionality. The only available moto mod for 5G is through Verizon but as a leader in U.S. 5G, that’s not necessarily a bad deal. The somewhat expensive mod doesn’t take the cost quite as high as most competing 5G handsets. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, other mods extend things further. Mods exist for taking 360-degree photos, battery, projection, gaming, and more. </p>
<p> On software, Motorola has ensured the Moto Z4 is as close to stock Android as possible. The Lenovo-owned company didn’t take that quite so far as to enroll in the Android One program. Regardless, this handset will gain Android 10 at some point. </p>
<p> Part of the stock software includes a Pixel-like night mode that actually performs on a comparable level. That’s something not many OEMs have managed to match but Moto comes very close. The standard camera modes, conversely, shoot exceptionally well for a phone in this price bracket. </p>
<p> Driving the software, a Snapdragon 675 SoC, 4GB RAM, and 128GB of expandable storage are great to have. The average two-days of life via optimizations and an appropriately-sized battery are even better. </p>
<p> That’s all squeezed behind a 6.4-inch OLED display in a stylized frame that could only be a Moto. For just $499, the Moto Z4 can be had in either Frost White or Flash Gray. </p>
<p> 3. Nokia 7.2 </p>
<p> Now, Nokia didn’t go crazy when it iterated on its 7-series this year. The Nokia 7.2 is priced just above the previous iteration at $349.99 and effectively builds on everything great about the previous model. </p>
<p> To begin with, Nokia has kept its HD+ PureView display panel, powered by HDR 10-compatible technology. But that’s been boosted to a larger 6.3-inch full size and its large notch has been replaced by a dewdrop cutout. The camera above that has been taken up significantly to 20-megapixels. </p>
<p> Cameras at the back are improved but keep the same quad-pixel technology that made the 7.1 great. That’s a 48-megapixel primary snapper with an 8-megapixel wide lens and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. </p>
<p> Nokia used glass on both the front and back to create a truly premium in-hand feel but there are different colors this time around. Those are Charcoal Grey, Ice Silver, and Cyan Green. </p>
<p> On the inside, everything’s been pushed forward to prepare for near-stock Android 10. Nokia’s 7.2 is, like its predecessor, part of the Android One Program. So it should gain updates for a long time to come and quickly. The internal rework starts with a RAM boost with 4GB or 6GB options backed by up to 128GB storage. The storage can be expanded up to 512GB. </p>
<p> Nokia reinforced the memory and capacity to match the update to an octa-core Snapdragon 660 SoC. Battery life from the Nokia 7.1 was a multi-day affair and that should improve here with a bigger battery. The capacity is rated at 3,500mAh, up from the previous 3,060mAh battery. </p>
<p> Taken together, Nokia’s 7.2 is going to quite easily hold the device's place as a high-value Android smartphone worthy of its position in the segment. </p>
<p> 2. OnePlus 7t </p>
<p> OnePlus has now released a stellar update to its OnePlus 7. Dubbed the 7T, and costing just $599, the high-value new member to the company’s smartphone lineup can only be described as a flagship killer. </p>
<p> Although it's priced like a mid-range handset, the OnePlus 7T is a flagship through and through, fit to rival any other device on the list. There are dozens of reasons well beyond the price that value is so high for this smartphone. But everything starts with its update to a 6.55-inch, 90Hz “Fluid AMOLED” panel. That's HDR10+ with a peak brightness of up to 1,000 nits. </p>
<p> A nearly dead-even bezel surrounds that with a comparatively tiny waterdrop notch at the top. Underneath that facade — available in either Frosted Silver or Glacier Blue — the power provided by OnePlus 7T is exceptional. A revamped Snapdragon 855 Plus SoC underpins everything, backed by 8GB RAM. Storage doesn't fall short either at 128GB. </p>
<p> A 3,800mAh battery with 30W "Warp Charging" drives that hardware to deliver Android 10-based OxygenOS 10. That OEM variation on Android is widely touted as being better than stock while maintaining stock roots. So the OnePlus 7T should deliver an experience that's well worth the cost and then some. </p>
<p> Of course, all of that is stepping past one of this phone's most exciting aspects. Namely, those are its triple-arrayed 48 MP primary camera, 16 MP ultra-wide camera, and 8 MP 2X telephoto camera. </p>
<p> Enhancements to the now almost industry-standard Portrait and Night modes are present here. OnePlus also introduces a Macro mode capable of shooting at as close as 2.5 centimeters. The front camera is no slouch either at 16-megapixel with EIS, among other features. </p>
<p> 1. Google Pixel 3a/3a XL </p>
<p> In the leadup to this month’s announcement of the Google Pixel 4 lineup, Google’s budget-minded Pixel 3a lineup has seen price drops yet again. Or at least it has for most of those via Amazon. Available in Clearly White, Purple-ish, and Just Black, the cost is now going to depend on the version and color. </p>
<p> The Clearly White Pixel 3a, for instance, is holding its standard $399 price while the larger Pixel 3a XL in Purple-ish only fell by a few bucks to $459. Other versions are down but quite a bit more. The Pixel 3a price starts at just $349 while the larger XL device now starts at just $429. </p>
<p> Buyers are getting quite a lot for their money here too. One of the most solid mid-range Snapdragon processors around is included, alongside 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, for starters. That’s an octa-core chipset driven by an 18W fast-charging 3,000mAh or 3,700mAh battery depending on which version is selected. Of course, that presents users with the fastest-updating stock Android available anywhere. </p>
<p> At 5.6-inches and 6.0-inches, the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL both ship with FHD+ resolution OLED display panels. On the opposing side of that, the widely lauded camera features found in the larger flagship devices are packed behind similar sensors. Another sensor is embedded in the frame of the gadget that’s squeezable, adding more functionality. </p>
<p> There’s no glass rear-paneling and no IP incursion rating for Pixel 3a or 3a XL. There doesn’t seem to be any major software-based caveats like those initially found on the flagship counterparts either. Everything just comes together smoothly to present users with a near-perfect Pixel-branded Google-made Android experience in a seriously premium device at a low cost. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Indian Android Smartphones – April 2018 </p>
<p> Quite a few flagship smartphones launched on a global scale in the last couple of weeks, but most of them are still not available in India. Devices like the Huawei P20 Pro, Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S, and the Xperia XZ2 are missing for just that reason, even though most of these phones (if not all of them) will arrive to the country in the near future. Having said that, we have compiled a list of top 10 smartphones that are currently available in India, and considering that the three aforementioned ones are still not, you won’t find them on this list, naturally. </p>
<p> 10. HTC U11 Plus </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The HTC U11 Plus is still the company’s flagship handset, as the HTC U12 did not arrive just yet. The HTC U11 Plus was announced back in November, and it is made out of metal and glass, while it sports rather thin bezels. This smartphone is fueled by the Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core SoC, while it sports a 6-inch QHD+ display. The phone is IP68 certified, and it comes in both 4GB and 6GB RAM variants. A 12-megapixel snapper is included on the back of this smartphone, while you will find an 8-megapixel shooter on the phone’s front side. The HTC U11 Plus is available from Flipkart for Rs. 56,990 ($868), while you can also get it from Amazon.com for $669.99 (both are 6GB RAM variants). </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ1 is no longer Sony’s flagship handset, but the Xperia XZ2 is not yet available in the country. Having said that, the Xperia XZ1 is still quite a powerful smartphone, and it is now considerably more affordable than it was back when it launched. The device ships with the Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core SoC, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. A 5.2-inch fullHD display is included in this package, while the phone comes with a 19-megapixel camera.

<p> The Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S was announced quite recently, but the company did not bring it to India just yet. Having said that, its predecessor, the Mi MIX 2S is available. This handset is fueled by the Snapdragon 835, and it actually resemble the Mi MIX 2S quite a bit, though it comes with a single camera on the back. This handset also comes with a 5.99-inch fullHD+ display, and it is available in both 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. The phone’s 6GB RAM variants are made out of metal and glass, while the 8GB RAM model sports a ceramic unibody build. All the necessary links are available down below, and the phone’s pricing starts at $519 </p>
<p> The Honor View 10 is still the company’s flagship, though the Honor 10 is expected to arrive in a couple of days. Those two devices will actually be similarly powerful, though the Honor 10 will be noticeably smaller. The Honor View 10 is fueled by the Kirin 970 64-bit octa-core SoC, Huawei’s flagship processor, and the device sports a 5.99-inch fullHD+ display. The phone includes 4GB / 6GB of RAM and it comes with 16 and 20-megapixel snappers. A 13-megapixel shooter is included on the phone’s front side, while a 3,750mAh non-removable battery is also a part of the package. The device is available in India via Amazon, for Rs. 29,999 ($457). </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are no longer Samsung’s flagship handset, but they still deserve to be on this list. These two devices are still amongst the best-looking smartphones out there, and they’re still plenty powerful. Both devices are fueled by the Exynos 8890 64-bit octa-core SoC in India, while they both sport 4GB of RAM. The Galaxy S8 ships with a 5.8-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED display, while the ‘Plus’ model sports a 6.2-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED panel. The Samsung Galaxy S8 can be purchased in India via Amazon for Rs. 46,034 ($701) at the moment, while the Galaxy S8 Plus costs Rs. 57,700 ($879). The two phones are priced at $597.75, and $639.98 on Amazon.com </p>
<p> The LG V30 Plus is still LG’s most powerful handset in India, as the LG V30S ThinQ did not make its way to the country just yet. Having said that, these two handsets are extremely similar, so the LG V30 Plus is still a great buy if you’re looking to get the latest and greatest from the company. The device is made out of metal and glass, while it sports a 6-inch QHD+ P-OLED display, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of native storage. The device comes with Android 7.1.2 Nougat, and LG’s custom UI, while it is fueled by the Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core processor. The phone is currently priced at Rs. 44,990 in India, on Amazon India, while you can get it from Amazon.com for $644.50. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 5T is the company’s flagship handset, as the OnePlus 6 still did not arrive. The OnePlus 5T is made out of metal, it sports really thin bezels, while it comes with a rear-facing fingerprint scanner. This handset also come with a dual camera setup on its back, and it sports a 6.01-inch fullHD+ Optic AMOLED display. The phone comes in both 6GB and 8GB RAM variants, while it packs in a 3,300mAh non-removable battery.

Both OnePlus 5T variants are available on both Amazon and GearBest, and all the necessary links are included down below. </p>
<p> The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are Google’s most powerful handsets to date. The two phones looks noticeably different due to their design, but they include rather similar internals. Both devices are made out of metal, with a hint of glass on the back, while both phones also include a really powerful camera on the back. These two phones, needless to say, come with stock Android, while both are fueled by the Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core processor, which was Qualcomm’s flagship processor for last year. The two devices are priced at Rs. 50,618 and Rs. 58,400 in India, respectively. You can buy these two phones from Amazon.com for $519.99, and $798.82, respectively. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S9 handsets are Samsung’s new flagship devices, but the Galaxy Note 8 is still more than a compelling choice. This handset is fueled by the Exynos 8890 64-bit octa-core SoC in India, while it comes with 6GB of RAM. The device sports really thin bezels, while it is made out of metal and glass, and it offers a dual camera setup on its back. A fingerprint scanner is also included on the back of this smartphone, and the device features a 6.3-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED display, with curved sides. The Galaxy Note 8 is priced at Rs. 67,900 in India (on Amazon), while you can get it for $794.95 on Amazon.com. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus are the latest and greatest handsets Samsung has to offer. These two phones were introduced back in February, and they’re both made out of metal and glass. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus are fueled by the Exynos 9810 in India, while the two phones do resemble quite a bit, but the Galaxy S9 Plus comes with a dual camera setup on the back, and it’s more powerful in general, mainly thanks to extra RAM it packs in. The Galaxy S9 comes with 4GB of RAM, while the Galaxy S9 Plus offers 6GB of RAM. These two handsets are available both via Amazon India and Amazon.com, and all the necessary links have been included down below. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Indian Android Smartphones – June 2018 </p>
<p> The OnePlus 6 joined our top 10 smartphones in India list, but other than that, the list remains more or less unchanged. The Xiaomi Mi 8 did launch recently, but the device is not yet available in India, nor did we get a chance to test it yet. The LG G7 ThinQ is also not available in India yet, which leaves us with the phones that are listed down below. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus are still leading the pack, and are followed by the Huawei P20 Pro and the OnePlus 6. Samsung’s flagship for last year is in fourth place, followed by two Pixel phones, and so on. Check out the list down below if you’d like to know more. </p>
<p> 10. Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S is Xiaomi’s flagship along with the Xiaomi Mi 8. The Mi MIX 2S does not sport a display notch, unlike the Mi 8, and it’s made out of ceramic. The Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S sports a “chin” below the display. The Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S is fueled by the Snapdragon 845 64-bit octa-core processor, while it features 6GB or 8GB of RAM, depending on the variant. The device comes with a 5.99-inch fullHD+ display, and Android 8.0 Oreo comes out of the box, with MIUI 9.5. Two 12-megapixel cameras are included on the back of the phone, while it utilizes a 3,400mAh battery. 6GB RAM Xiaomi MI MIX 2S is available for $479.99 from GearBest as we speak. </p>
<p> The Honor View 10 is, next to the recently-announced Honor 10, Honor’s flagship smartphone. The Honor View 10 is fueled by the Kirin 970, Huawei’s most powerful processor to date. The device is made out of metal, while it features a 5.99-inch fullHD+ display, 4GB / 6GB of RAM and 64GB / 128GB of storage. The device sports 16 and 20-megapixel cameras on the back, while a single 13-megapixel camera can be found on the phone’s front side. Android 8.0 Oreo comes pre-installed on the Honor View 10, while Emotion UI (EMUI) 8.0 comes on top of Google’s OS. The Honor View 10 is priced at Rs. 29,999 ($445) in India, and it can be purchased from Amazon. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are no longer the company’s flagship smartphones, but if you’re looking for something similar to the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus, but more affordable, well, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus may be the right choices for you. These two phones are made out of metal and glass, and have extremely thin bezels, just like the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. Both phones feature a single camera on the back, while both sport curved displays. A rear-facing fingerprint scanner is included on both phones, and these two devices actually look the same as well, though the Galaxy S9 Plus is a larger phone. The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are now priced at Rs. 43,900 ($649) and Rs. 66,800 ($987) in India. </p>
<p> The Nokia 8 Sirocco is Nokia’s flagship smartphone, this device is made out of metal and glass, and it sports a curved display. The Nokia 8 Sirocco reminds us a bit of the Galaxy S7 Edge because of its display and frame, but this phone is a part of Google’s Android One project, which means it comes with stock Android out of the box. The Nokia 8 Sirocco features a 5.5-inch QHD P-OLED display, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The device is fueled by the Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core processor, and it ships with Android 8.0 Oreo. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is now available via Flipkart and it costs Rs. 49.999 ($740). </p>
<p> The LG V30 Plus may not be the latest smartphone LG had introduced, but it is still one of the best ones, if not the best one. The LG G7 ThinQ came with a number of issues, which maybe makes the LG V30 Plus a better choice still, plus this phone is not that old, to begin with.

<p> Top 10 Best Laptops For Back To School 2020 – List </p>
<p> Best Laptop </p>
<p> Dell XPS 15 (2020) </p>
<p> When it comes to getting the best laptop overall for your back to school needs, Dell has your number as the XPS 15 continues to be one of the best laptops period. </p>

<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course it's also got one of the best looking displays on of any laptop on the market. Not just in this price range but in general. </p>
<p> With the Dell XPS 15 (2020) you're getting a 15.6-inch screen with 4K UHD resolution and it's nearly edge to edge. It's also powered by a 9th-gen Intel Core i7 CPU, and it has a GeForce GTX 1650 GPU so it'll even handle some gaming. Though there are better laptops for that. </p>
<p> You're also getting plenty of RAM with 16GB, and plenty of storage with a 256GB SSD. It only weighs 4 pounds too. Definitely light enough to carry around all day. </p>
<p> Best Laptop For Gamers </p>
<p> Razer Blade 15 Advanced </p>
<p> Razer is the king of gaming laptops with its Blade line for numerous reasons. And one of those is the extreme portability thanks to its sleek and slim design. </p>
<p> If you're a gamer headed back to school and you want one of the best laptops that allows you to do everything you need plus play games at peak levels, there's no better option than the Blade 15 Advanced. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It comes with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super GPU so you can max out your settings on most games. All while keeping a relatively stable frame rate. </p>
<p> This particular model of the laptop also comes with 16GB of RAM (plenty for most of your gaming habits) and 512GB of storage. Though you can get get more in both of those areas for more money. </p>
<p> There's even the RTX 2080 Super model which comes with a 4K OLED display. Any way you slice it, this is a laptop that is perfect for any student who also plays games. It's your catchall laptop. </p>
<p> Best Budget Laptop </p>
<p> ASUS VivoBook </p>
<p> Not everyone is a gamer or has the extra income to blow out on a top-tier laptop for school. And while it is nice to have those things, it's not really necessary. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you just need a good laptop for back to school that allows you to complete your work, then the VivoBook from ASUS is your best option if you're on a budget. </p>
<p> It costs $249. So the entry point isn't much, and it comes with a respectable set of hardware specs for its intended purpose. It's got 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal flash storage, up to 10 hours of battery life, and it runs on Windows 10 so it's compatible with a wide array of software. </p>
<p> Did we mention it's extremely portable? It weighs about 2.2 pounds and has an 11.6-inch screen. So it's not only lightweight but it fits easily into most bags or backpacks. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You aren't going to be getting an absolute powerhouse here. But if that's what you need then there are other options on the list for that. This is definitely a great option for anyone who just needs a simple laptop that can do the basics. </p>
<p> Best Mid-Range Laptop </p>
<p> Acer Swift 3 (2020) </p>
<p> If you're looking for something a little more in the middle of the pack, the Acer Swift 3 2020 model is an option you should consider. </p>
<p> It comes with 8GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, Wi-Fi6, and a nifty backlit keyboard for when you're up late working on coursework that needs to be turned in by 8am. </p>
<p> It also comes with integrated Ryzen graphics which is capable of playing games, but it is integrated graphics so you won't be turning all your graphics up on games to max. One neat trick that this laptop offers that others don't is the built-in Alexa support. </p>
<p> You can talk to Alexa right through the laptop with its integrated capabilities. Which means if you have other devices powered by Alexa around your room, apartment, or home, you can easily manage it by speaking to Alexa through the laptop. </p>
<p> The battery life is pretty decent as well at 11.5 hours. So you could keep it on the charger if you wanted to but you wouldn't need to as it should last you all day (basically through all of your classes). </p>
<p> Lastly it only weighs 2.65 pounds so it's not too heavy. Which means it's easy to cart around and one of the best laptops for back to school. </p>
<p> Best Laptop For Creators </p>
<p> Microsoft Surface Book 3 </p>
<p> This is the perfect laptop for creators. Whether your schooling deals with video production, music production, web design, or digital art, this will be powerful and versatile enough to handle everything. </p>
<p> When it comes to the performance, it has an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660Ti GPU powering the graphics, and it comes with 32GB of RAM. That's more than enough to multitask and take care of all your applications. </p>
<p> This model comes with 512GB of storage, though you can bump that up if you need more. </p>
<p> One of the more useful functions is the ability to detach the display from the keyboard. In doing this you can use the laptop display like a tablet. Or you can detach the display and simply turn it around before attaching it again. This allows you to use it more like a touch display without having to hold it. </p>
<p> Microsoft says it has up to 17 hours of battery life. Which is definitely on the higher end of most laptops on this list. Basically, it'll last a long time. </p>
<p> Best Laptop For Battery Life </p>
<p> Dell Latitude 9410 </p>
<p> If your main concern is battery life, then this is the laptop you want. It's rated to last up to 27 hours on a charge. </p>
<p> That's an astounding amount of time for a machine with the specs that this laptop offers. Not to mention it can essentially last you two full days of use and then some if you were using it for about 10 hours a day. Or one full day if you used it for 24 hours straight. </p>
<p> Keeping that in mind, the battery life will certainly vary depending on how you use it. But however you use it, it'll still last longer than any of the other options on this list. </p>
<p> Battery life aside, the Dell Latitude 9410 also comes with 8GB of RAM, up to 2TB of hard drive space, a 14-inch screen, and it weighs about 3 pounds. This is a 2-in-1 laptop as well. So if the need arises you can flip the screen around and use the laptop in tent mode where you interact with just the touch display. </p>
<p> Best Laptop For Portability </p>
<p> Microsoft Surface GO 2 </p>
<p> If you want a full Windows 10 laptop option that's as light as it gets and is ultra portable, look no further than Microsoft Surface Go 2. Going back to school, you want something light and this is one of the best laptops for that. In fact it is the best option for portability. </p>
<p> Technically, this is a tablet PC and not a laptop. But because you can pick up the Surface Go 2 with the Type Cover keyboard dock (which is excellent by the way), and it comes with full Windows 10, it works like a laptop. </p>
<p> The screen is 10.5-inches. So it's small enough to fit in just about any bag pocket you would fit a school book in. Best of all, it only weighs about 1.25 pounds. Maybe a touch more with the Type Cover but still well below 2 pounds. </p>
<p> That makes it the lightest and therefore the most portable laptop option on this list. So if you're really looking for something that is easy to carry with you anywhere to the point that you can forget you have it, this is it. </p>
<p> This particular model comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage space, and is Wi-Fi only. An LTE option is available as well at a bit more money. The Type Cover also comes separate from the Surface Go 2, so that's worth keeping in mind. </p>
<p> Best Laptop For Apple Users </p>
<p> Apple MacBook Pro 13-Inch </p>
<p> So all of the laptops on this list have been Windows so far, but not everyone uses Windows PCs. If you're invested in the Apple ecosystem, then this is the one of the best laptops for you for back to school. </p>
<p> The most recent MacBook Pro with a 13-inch screen is pretty lightweight at just 3.1 pounds and it's just 15.6mm thin. And because of the 13-inch screen it's not very big either. Making it easy to stuff into a backpack or bag. </p>
<p> The display comes at a resolution of 2560 x 1600, with the laptop sporting a 10th-gen Intel Core i5 CPU. This particular laptop model also comes with a 1TB SSD for loads of internal storage, as well as 16GB of RAM for plenty of memory. </p>
<p> You can however dump the storage down to 512GB if you want to save a couple hundred bucks. It's also carrying Intel Iris Plus graphics, the backlit magic keyboard, the Touch Bar and Touch ID, and a battery life of up to 10 hours. </p>
<p> In short it can handle your school work and last for about a day off the charger, play some games, stream your movies and music and more. It'll be a solid choice with al of your favorite Apple services too. </p>
<p> Best 2-In-1 Laptop </p>
<p> HP Spectre X360 </p>
<p> 2-In-1 laptops can be highly underrated, but they're definitely worth your consideration because of their versatile configurations. </p>
<p> Use them like a regular laptop, or use them like a touch display with a kickstand. You can even flip the keyboard all the way back onto the back of the display and use the laptop like a tablet if you prefer. </p>
<p> So it more or less conforms to fit your needs instead of the other way around. The HP Spectre X360 is the best 2-In-1 around and aside from its versatility when it comes to configurations, it's pretty powerful too. </p>
<p> You get a 10-gen Intel Core i7 CPU, Intel Iris Plus graphics, 8GB of RAM, 512GB of storage via the SSD, a 13.3-inch display with a Full HD resolution, a fingerprint reader, and a battery life of close to 10 hours. It weighs just under 3 pounds (2.87 pounds), so it's fairly portable as well. </p>
<p> This is an all around great laptop and packed with nifty features if you need something that can be used in numerous configurations. </p>
<p> Best Chrome OS Laptop </p>
<p> ASUS Chromebook Flip C434TA </p>
<p> Chromebooks have come a long way over the years and are very capable laptops now. They were still decent in their infancy, but now they're much more equipped to be a solid replacement for something running on Windows or MacOS. </p>
<p> The ASUS Chromebook Flip C434TA sits at the top of the Chrome OS pack. And is available in multiple variations to fit your personal needs. The $599 model comes with 64GB of internal storage space, 8GB of RAM, a 14-inch display with Full HD resolution, and a pretty stellar battery life of up to 10 hours. </p>
<p> It's running an Intel Core m3 CPU, and although it can't play PC games traditionally, it can play games through Stadia. So this is still technically a good gaming machine if that's how you access your games. </p>
<p> This is also a 2-In-1 with a 360-degree hinge, and a touch display so you can use it like a tablet. Lastly it only weighs around 3 pounds. So while it isn't the lightest laptop of all the ones we've picked for this list, it's still very light and portable. </p>
<p> Making this one of the best laptops for back to school and the best Chrome OS option. </p>

<p> Top 7 Best Smartphones For Back To School 2020 </p>
<p> It's back to school season, even though it doesn't feel like it, and that means it's time for our annual buyer's guide on the best smartphones to pick up. While most kids are going to be staying home and doing classes online, a new smartphone is still going to be needed for a lot of people. There are lots of options available, as you might have expected. </p>
<p> We've rounded up the very best smartphones that you can pick up. Some of these are rather inexpensive, while others have the best battery life, the best camera, or just the best period. So there's something for everyone on this list. </p>
<p> Best smartphone </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S20+ </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S20+ is one of the best smartphones to pick up for back to school, even though it might be overkill for most people. But because this is one of the latest and greatest smartphones out there, it will be a good one to use for many years to come. You'll likely get around four to five years out of this one. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Galaxy S20+ comes with a 6.7-inch Quad HD+ 120Hz display, powered by the Snapdragon 865 chipset with 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It also sports a 4500mAh capacity battery that should keep you going all day long. Not to mention the fact that this also comes with 5G connectivity for all of the US carriers. This is also unlocked, so you can just pop in your SIM card and you'll be ready to go. </p>
<p> Best value smartphone </p>
<p> Google Pixel 4a </p>
<p> The Pixel 4a is the best value smartphone by a long shot. Coming in at just $399, you're getting a phone with one of the best cameras on the market. As well as the latest version of Android, pretty decent battery life, and of course the best of Google. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Pixel 4a is brand new, it just launched this week in fact and you can read our review right here. </p>
<p> It sports a smaller 5.8-inch display, with the Snapdragon 730 chipset, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage to boot. There is a somewhat small 3140mAh capacity battery inside the Pixel 4a. Which does a good job of keeping the phone running all day long, without any real issues, though. </p>
<p> Best battery life </p>
<p> Moto G Power </p>
<p> The Moto G Power is a really great option if you need something that is going to last all day and then some. Motorola claims around three days on a single charge here. But for power users, that might be closer to two days. </p>
<p> There is a massive 5,000mAh capacity battery inside the Moto G Power that is going to last a very long time. It also sports a 6.4-inch FHD+ display, and the Snapdragon 665 which is going to help conserve that battery to last even longer. The TurboCharger is also included in the box, it charges somewhat slow at 15W, but that also means the battery is going to last longer. </p>
<p> Best for note takers </p>
<p> Moto G Stylus </p>
<p> The Moto G Stylus is a pretty decent smartphone, but Motorola has included a stylus with it – hence the name. And that makes it a really great option for those that like to take notes. </p>
<p> Like the Moto G Power, this sports a 6.4-inch FHD+ display, and the Snapdragon 665. There is also 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage inside, that should give you plenty of storage. If not, there is also a micro SD card slot available for adding more storage. </p>
<p> While the battery isn't as big as the Moto G Power, the Moto G Stylus does also have a 4000mAh capacity battery that should keep it running all day long and then some. </p>
<p> Best quad-camera smartphone </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy A51 </p>
<p> Who would have thought that you could get a quad-camera smartphone at this price? Well you can. And that's why the Galaxy A51 makes the list for the best smartphones for back to school. </p>
<p> The Galaxy A51 features a 48-megapixel main sensor, 12-megapixel ultra wide sensor, 5-megapixel macro and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. Allowing you to take just about any shot you want. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It also sports a 6.5-inch FHD+ display, the Exynos 9611 chipset with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It's a really decent phone for the price, and having quad cameras definitely helps it out. </p>
<p> Best low cost smartphone </p>
<p> Nokia 5.3 </p>
<p> The Nokia 5.3 is a pretty incredible smartphone for the money – only $199. It is also unlocked and works on all of the US carrier networks. That includes AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Nokia 5.3 sports a 6.55-inch HD+ display, the Snapdragon 665 with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There is also a micro SD card slot available and there is support for Adoptable Storage. </p>
<p> HMD Global has outfitted the Nokia 5.3 with a 4000mAh capacity battery that should keep this one running for two days or more. </p>
<p> This comes with Android 10, and it will get Android 11. Which is due to launch next month. Since this is an Android One device, it should get the update pretty quickly. </p>
<p> Best inexpensive flagship </p>
<p> OnePlus 8 </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 is definitely the best inexpensive flagship, and one of only two smartphones on this list that has 5G support. </p>
<p> OnePlus 8 comes with a 6.55-inch FHD+ display, the Snapdragon 865 chipset, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It also has a 4300mAh capacity battery that does pretty well at keeping it going all day long. It also has Warp Charge 30T for some pretty quick fast charging. So even if it doesn't last all day long, you can charge it up pretty quick. </p>
<p> It also comes with a triple camera setup on the back. With a 48-megapixel main sensor, 16-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel macro sensor. So you can get some really incredible shots out of this camera setup. </p>
<p> It does also work with all three of the US carriers. Though it doesn't work with Verizon's 5G network, unless you buy it specifically from Verizon. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Value Smartphones You Can Buy Right Now – August 2019 </p>
<p> Choosing a new smartphone can be such a difficult task, especially when it comes to high-value smartphones. </p>
<p> With dozens of big manufacturers jostling to outdo others each passing year, only a handful of devices are deserving. Not all of them that might be worthy of a spot will land a placement, either. </p>
<p> Making matters more challenging, there is a growing gap between what smartphone manufacturers and smartphones users identify as price brackets. That's true for everything from the upper and middle brackets down to the budget end of the spectrum. Coupled with that discrepancy is a decreasing gap between those in terms of performance and features. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Of course, deciding which devices truly fit the descriptor "the best" comes down at least in part to opinion. The devices listed here are readily available to purchase and work in most regions, if not all of them. </p>
<p> Some brands, such as Huawei, simply aren't recommendable right now for a variety of reasons. For example, the challenges Huawei faces are driving it to step back from Android as its primary operating system. Its smartphones also not widely available and its future partnerships remain in question. So it just won't be appearing here for the time being. </p>
<p> Here at Android Headlines, we spend a lot of time examining and testing nearly every new smartphone that hits the market. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This list was built on a foundation of knowledge about reliability and other aspects that make for a truly great experience, pushing boundaries with respect to the value versus cost metrics. While not without subjectivity, it represents Android Headlines's top ten best smartphones falling below that ever-increasing "premium" cost barrier. </p>
<p> 10. Xiaomi Mi 9T </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Mi 9T is effectively the global variant of the Redmi K20 that launched in China back in May. Buyers can expect to pay just $300 on Amazon, it is primarily intended for Europe. There is also the possibility that it could work in the US — though not guaranteed and only on GSM carriers. That doesn't detract from its place among the best value smartphones around. </p>
<p> For camera and display gurus in the value segment, this is going to be an obvious stand-out. To begin with, that's because its 6.39-inch AMOLED FHD+ (2340 x 1080) panel is better-equipped than others in the segment. It also has a higher screen-to-body ratio than other devices because Xiaomi chose to use a pop-up camera. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> HDR content is supported as well as modern features such as an in-screen fingerprint scanner and 18-watt fast charging. </p>
<p> The front camera is a 20-megapixel snapper while the rear triple-sensor array includes a 48-megapixel standard wide-angle snapper, an 8-megapixel telephoto lens, and a 13-megapixel 124-degree wide-angle lens. For features during video capture, Xiaomi has incorporated 4K recording as well as up to 960 frames-per-second slow-motion capture. </p>
<p> Those who need internal specs and performance to match shouldn't be disappointed. This brings the same 6GB of RAM as others in the Mi 9 range and 64GB of storage. A 2.2GHz Snapdragon 730 SoC drives that and a 4,000mAh capacity battery powers the package </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Style isn't left by the wayside by Xiaomi here either. The company offers this gadget in Flame Red or Glacier Blue with a fiery arrow gradient. A Carbon Black version is available as well. That features a carbon fiber aesthetic, true to its namesake. </p>
<p> 9. Nokia 7.1 </p>
<p> The Nokia 7.1 will likely receive a followup this year and is the oldest handset on our top ten best value smartphones list. At just $299 on Amazon, with consideration for what it brings to the table as one of Nokia's most premium gadgets ever, it's also still an exceptional handset. That's just $249 for the Blue variant while the higher price is for a Steel coloration. </p>
<p> Behind the notched 5.8-inch full HD+ PureView display, buyers of this Nokia gadget are gaining a healthy but not remarkable 4GB memory and 64GB storage. That's backing up a more-than-capable octa-core Snapdragon 636 SoC. Android 9 Pie fills out the experience. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Android One is the big selling point here, setting aside USB-C, Bluetooth 5.0, a fingerprint scanner. Participation in the Android One program means that this device will receive plenty of updates to come both in terms of the operating system and security. Those should, in fact, be released on a timescale comparable to Google's own Pixel-branded handsets. </p>
<p> Android One also means a nearly-pure stock Android 9 Pie experience now with Android Q undoubtedly set to follow. </p>
<p> So despite only coming with reasonably decent cameras and moderate battery life, this is going to be a device that's still worth considering for those that don't want to spend quite as much as it will take to pick up other gadgets listed here. It also works with Verizon now, officially, so buyers aren't solely limited to those on GSM carriers any longer. </p>
<p> 8. Razer Phone 2 </p>
<p> Razer has built a reputation for gaming accessories and, more recently for gaming smartphones and add-ons related to that. It also happens to be listed at Amazon for $399.99, making it a prime fit in the value smartphone category. That only becomes a more prominent point with consideration for the over-$799 list price that seller gives the handset. </p>
<p> Looking past the price point, gaming is what this phone is very obviously for. A Snapdragon 845 SoC is nestled inside this smartphone's unique frame — built around two forward-firing stereo speakers. Razer packed in 8GB RAM and 64GB storage to back up the chipset. </p>
<p> The biggest drawback to that IP67 water-resistant design, despite being wireless charging-enabled, is its screen. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, the display does run at a mind-boggling 120Hz refresh rate but Razer chose an LCD panel rather than a newer OLED or AMOLED panel. So it isn't going to be quite as engaging as it might have been. It's 4,000mAh battery isn't necessarily going to be the longest-lasting either. Near-stock Android should help optimize the experience but that caveat is because it's made explicitly for gaming. </p>
<p> The addition of dual-12-megapixel snappers and an 8-megapixel shooter for selfies are just going to be the icing on the cake for anybody. For those who want a high-end gaming device on a budget, the Razer Phone 2 is the highest-value smartphones on the market. </p>
<p> 7. Sony Xperia 10/10 Plus </p>
<p> Sony finally brought its camera, display, and smartphone units together for smartphones this year under new management. The results of that, at the budget and mid-range side of things, are the Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus. </p>
<p> These are also some of the tallest handsets around if not the tallest, making them only slightly niche. By the numbers, the screens are rated at a ratio of 21:9. Sony set the screen sizes at 6- or 6.5-inches depending on the model and both come with a full HD+ resolution, made expressly for media consumption. They also serve well when using multiple apps at the same time. </p>
<p> Beyond watching movies, a more 'cinematic' experience can be had with this handset'ss 13-megapixel, 5-megapixel primary snapper too. On the audio side, Sony's experts have delivered with Hi-Res Audio backed by DSEE HX and LDAC encoding from the company. The larger Sony Xperia 10 Plus bumps the second sensor to 8-megapixels and adds in 2x optical zoom </p>
<p> The Sony Xperia 10 and 10 Plus aren't identical in specs either. Respectively, they use the Snapdragon 630 and 636 SoCs, coupled with either 3GB or 4GB memory. Both feature 64GB storage. The batteries are rated at 2,870mAh or 3,000mAh. So these probably aren't going to be the longest-lasting handsets or the most powerful among the value smartphone offerings available. What they do deliver, in terms of standing out, are a great display and cameras. </p>
<p> 6. Samsung Galaxy A50 </p>
<p> In the current world of mobile technology, leaving aside budget-friendly Android handsets, Samsung is the world's second-largest manufacturer. Its "Galaxy A" series lineup is a testament to its longevity in the market, bringing together the budget- and mid-range handsets under a single umbrella. The Samsung Galaxy A50 is a nearly-perfect example of an everyday mid-range smartphone with all the latest tech in tow. </p>
<p> Previously featured on the Android Headlines list with a price tag of $350, this handset is going to be among the least expensive here. Depending on the intended region for sales, warranty status, and color, Samsung's Galaxy A50 can be purchased online as low as $268.99. </p>
<p> That's going to come with a respectable amount of memory and storage too, comparable to other devices here, regardless of which version is purchased. Under the hood, a powerful in-house Exynos processor is in use here too. </p>
<p> Now, for the money, buyers aren't necessarily paying for those features though. The "A" series is a testing bed for Samsung. </p>
<p> That means users are getting a decent dual-aperture camera array with a 4,000mAh battery. Over the top of that and delivering Android 9 Pie-based OneUI, there's a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED Infinity-U display with a waterdrop notch. </p>
<p> An in-display fingerprint scanner helps round out the premium features. For those who want a new Samsung without spending an arm and a leg, this could be the one to buy. </p>
<p> 5. Samsung Galaxy A70 </p>
<p> Stepping up from Samsung's Galaxy A50 is the company's A70, priced right around $360. The latest in Samsung's "A" series lineup, the Galaxy A70 boasts a Snapdragon 675 SoC joined with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. That's compared to the 4GB memory in its more affordable sibling and equates to double the storage capacity. </p>
<p> Those aren't the only aspects that are better for just a bit more money though, although both should provide a similar experience. The primary camera in the Samsung Galaxy A70 has been bumped to 32-megapixels from 25-megapixels. The same screen style is in use but at 6.7-inches — for approximately 0.3-inches more real estate. </p>
<p> All of that is driven by a larger, faster-charging 4,500mAh capacity battery than can be found in its smaller counterpart. </p>
<p> This is a phone for those who want to spend a bit more for a slight boost almost across the board. While both smartphones represent a high value, the Samsung Galaxy A70 is going to be the better device from the top manufacturer on the planet. </p>
<p> 4. ASUS Zenfone 6 </p>
<p> Buyers looking for an amazing selfie experience without a punch-hole display or notches should not overlook the ASUS ZenFone 6. That's especially true now that it is officially supported in the US at a cost of just a penny under $500. </p>
<p> The first thing to be noticed about this device and its almost unremarkable design is that there's no camera to be found around its almost bezel-free 6.4-inch full HD+ Gorilla Glass 6 display. The primary camera is going to be the one a user accesses for selfies. </p>
<p> No second screen magic or guesswork is in place to make that possible, either. </p>
<p> A flagship-grade Sony IMX586 48-megapixel dual Quad Pixel snapper at the back of this device. The camera rests just above the fingerprint scanner mounted on a unique rocker mechanism. The rocker, at the touch of a button, flips that forward to any number of angles for quick and easy selfie shots complete with all of the specialty modes normally associated with the rear snapper on a smartphone. </p>
<p> That also means the display here is nothing to scoff at, at a screen-to-body ratio of 92-percent. </p>
<p> Under the hood, like the number two device on the list, 8GB RAM and 256GB storage designate this a flagship. So does the Snapdragon 855 SoC. While easy enough to purchase to be on our top ten value device list, limited carrier support and availability are primarily what hold this gadget from ascending here. </p>
<p> 3. Moto Z4 </p>
<p> Lenovo-owned Motorola's entry on this list is a gadget that has two major aspects setting it apart. Not least of all, at least on one carrier, the Moto Z4 is a semi-modular 5G-capable smartphone. For Verizon customers in the US who want bleeding-edge connectivity now rather than later, this $499 device is going to stand out among other smartphones on value. </p>
<p> The next big selling point is going to be that Android Q is, according to Motorola, a guaranteed update for the handset and that this smartphone is fully compatible with moto mods. At an extra cost, mods allow for a plethora of capabilities whether for photography, gaming, entertainment, connectivity, or much more. </p>
<p> A two-day battery and camera that comes close to approximating the Google Pixel's low-light photo mode round out the package. But those are hardly the only other noteworthy features. Aside from the 4GB memory, 128GB storage-backed Snapdragon 675 chipset, this smartphone also comes with an above-par display and a unique design that only 'Moto' could be responsible for. </p>
<p> 2. OnePlus 7 </p>
<p> From last month's listing, the OnePlus 7 — likely thanks to the overwhelming comparative favor shown the "Pro" variant — has been dropped in price yet again. It can now be purchased for just under $488 on Amazon. That's for the international variant. </p>
<p> Under normal circumstances, that wouldn't be enough for any device to hold onto its number two spot on our best value smartphones listing. Put frankly, the real benefit from that for consumers is that this technically isn't a mid-range device. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 7, for starters, features 8GB RAM and 256GB storage. That's backing the current top-of-the-line flagship chipset, the octa-core Snapdragon 855. That makes it, in a word, a flagship. </p>
<p> For drawback to this device, the biggest is its camera. That is now fixed via software updates but doesn't quite live up to its larger counterpart or the current number one value in smartphones. </p>
<p> There's also no guarantee since OnePlus doesn't seem to actually mention the gadget on the official US store site, that it will see any kind of real support for users in the US. There certainly isn't any warranty stateside for the variant that's currently priced at the above-mentioned low entry point. If those things don't matter, OnePlus 7 is going to be the best that money can buy for now. </p>
<p> 1. Google Pixel 3a/3a XL </p>
<p> Google's Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL are a return to near-Nexus form compared to flagship devices from the search giant. That's chiefly because the more 'premium' handsets have been met with staunch criticism and plagued with seemingly unending problems. By contrast, the series is a mid-range family of devices that will suit just about anybody. It does that without compromising where it's going to matter most to Pixel loyalists — namely, the cameras. </p>
<p> On software and hardware alike, the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL come equipped with the same best-in-class features as their much more expensive siblings. Simultaneously, Google has equipped the handsets with one of Qualcomm's best octa-core mid-range SoC with plenty of memory and storage. </p>
<p> Google kept most of the stylings of the larger, more expensive counterparts too. Key differences include the abandonment of the divisive notch and the return of the headphone jack. The latter feature is one that Google entirely dismissed for its Pixel 3 and 3 XL. </p>
<p> All of that is jammed into either a 5.6-inch or 6.0-inch smartphone with a fullHD+ resolution OLED display and a squeezable frame for added functionality. A respectable 3,000mAh or 3,700mAh battery powers the package too. For $399 or $479, what buyers get is the purest Android 9 Pie — and soon Android Q — experience around. At those prices, these smartphones simply ooze value. </p>

<p> Android News / Top 10 Best Value Smartphones You Can Buy Right Now – September 2019 </p>
<p> Top 10 Best Value Smartphones You Can Buy Right Now – September 2019 </p>
<p> Ordinarily, fall's IFA 2019 event provides a perfect opportunity to check out new high-value Android smartphones. This year, new offerings a bit on the slim side. Moreover, nothing really seems to land from that event until later on in the month at the earliest. </p>
<p> There will certainly be a few high-value devices from those that will be worthy of being included here. But this is, after all, the Android Headlines “Top 10 Best Value Smartphones You Can Buy Right Now.” User reviews, Android Headlines reviews, and other reports about those devices may change whether or not they can be dubbed truly great devices and included later on. </p>
<p> In the meantime, little has changed for Huawei in its ongoing struggle to spread its high-value offerings westward or to work with companies like Google. OnePlus, conversely, has apparently pulled down pages for its OnePlus 7 on its global site, among others. That effectively relegates the company to the flagship end of the market and off of this list. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As a result, there's been at least a slight stir in this admittedly somewhat subjective ranking, as has a recent review period spent with the Nokia 7.1. Without further ado, here is Android Headlines's top ten best smartphones that deliver the highest value at below the premium price mark for September 2019. </p>
<p> 10. Xiaomi Mi 9T </p>
<p> With a 6.39-inch AMOLED FHD+ (2340 x 1080) display with no punch-holes, notches, or waterdrop cutouts, Xiaomi’s Mi 9T is still one of the best devices to be found in the value segment. For right around $300, it's also among the best equipped Android smartphones on the market, making it an exceptional value at a price that's not too high. </p>
<p> That display does fully support HDR content and houses an in-display fingerprint scanner. But one of the most prominent features here is going to be the cameras. Around the back of the device is a triple camera with a 48-megapixel wide-angle primary snapper. An 8-megapixel telephoto lens and 13-megapixel 124-degree wide-angle lens back that up. The cameras not only take great photos but allow video shooting at 4K and up to 960 frames-per-second for high-detail slow-motion captures. </p>

<p> Another aspect that makes this handset great is the fact that Xiaomi includes a Snapdragon 730 SoC backed up by 6GB RAM and 64GB storage. A 4,000mAh, 18-watt fast-charging battery can be found powering that. All of that hardware is used to present users with a near-stock Android 9 Pie experience which is fully expected to be updated to Android 10 in the future. </p>
<p> There’s no notches or cutouts, conversely, thanks to Xiaomi’s decision to include its front-facing 20-megapixel camera on a mechanical pop-up mechanism. That keeps the aesthetic of the body, available in a stunning Flame Red or Glacier Blue, looking clean. Those who don't want a gradient can opt instead for a carbon fiber-inspired Carbon Black variant. </p>
<p> 9. Razer Phone 2 </p>
<p> There is at least one other smartphone here with a slightly better processor but, for those who are looking for a gaming-centric device, the Razer Phone 2 is going to be it. For anybody else, it’s going to be a hard deal to pass up anyway since it delivers one of the best display experiences around for around half its original cost. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Packed with a Snapdragon 845 flagship chipset from the last generation with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage, the Razer Phone 2 is an absolute powerhouse. The QHD 5.72-inch display pushes near-stock Android 9 Pie at a whopping 120Hz refresh rate. That’s only an LCD panel but the screen and dual-forward-firing speakers also deliver HDR and Dolby Digital Plus 5.1. </p>
<p> Underpinning that, tucked cleanly into a unique candy bar IP67-rated frame, is a 4,000mAh capacity battery. That can be charged via wireless or standard cable. </p>
<p> For cameras, buyers get two 12-megapixel cameras at the back and an 8-megapixel selfie snapper. Just below the primary cameras is a neat logo all lit up with LEDs and ready to be customized. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Upon close inspection, all of that should equate to a package that leaves the mid-range category well behind. In reality, it absolutely does. This is a phone that starts out on Amazon priced at over $799. It also happens to be on sale for right around $399.99 for a bit longer. For just a few bucks more, Razer will send a case along with that. </p>
<p> Razer hasn’t said whether the Razer Phone 2 will ever receive Android 10. But if all of that that doesn’t make the Razer Phone 2 one of the most high-value Android smartphones around, nothing will. </p>
<p> 8. OPPO Reno Z </p>
<p> Purely in terms of design, OPPO’s Reno Z is a masterclass-level device, with a high-contour Gorilla Glass 5 panel offering minute hints at the internal components and its overall value compared to other Android smartphones. That frame is available in both Aurora Purple and Jet Black. That's accented by an “O-Dot anti-abrasion structure” and a slightly off-color center stripe with branding. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The O-Dot is designed to protect two rear cameras with a 48-megapixel sensor and an LED flash, giving the device a unique look. The edges are all rounded too, for a great in-hand feel to match the aesthetic. </p>
<p> Aside from a water-drop notch, also housing a forward-firing speaker and earpiece, there are almost no bezels at the front. The camera in that is a 32-megapixel sensor. </p>
<p> At 6.4-inches, the OPPO Reno Z's AMOLED Full HD+ display panel delivers a screen-to-body ratio of 92-percent. A fingerprint scanner is found underneath the glass. Also under the hood, there's plenty of power to spare. That's thanks to a MediaTek P90 SoC with either 4GB or 8GB RAM. OPPO supplies 128GB of expandable storage. The battery is a 4,035mAh capacity unit with rapid charging via VOOC Flash Charge 3.0. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OPPO's biggest features in the Reno Z all come down to software, however. Looking past the Dolby Atmos-tuned speakers and "frame-by-frame" optimizations provided by Game Boost 2.0, this device is going to provide a great photography experience. MFNR and HDR algorithms couple with electronic image stabilization, multi-frame noise reduction, a plethora of modes and tools, and "Ultra Night Mode 2.0" for one of the best camera experiences around. </p>
<p> All of that makes the Reno Z a solid offering from OPPO at under $400. The only thing holding this handset back is its comparatively limited availability. </p>
<p> 7. Sony Xperia 10/10 Plus </p>
<p> Two mid-range smartphones that would go amiss on any value-focused Android device list are Sony’s Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Sony took the opportunity presented by the Xperia 10 and the “Plus” counterpart to bring together the latest from each of its previously split tech units. Now, because Sony opted for a much taller format, 21:9, these handsets are a bit on the niche side. But the 6- and 6.5-inch full HD+ resolution displays harbor something other phones don’t have. The screen here is not just media-friendly but which shows colors with cinematic accuracy. </p>
<p> Tech has also been brought over from Sony’s camera division. The unit is responsible for sensors in such a wide variety of phones that, without a wider recent entry into that space from Samsung, it would effectively be the smartphone camera supplier. In this case, that means a dual-lens 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel primary snapper in the Xperia 10. The secondary camera in the Plus version adds 2x optical zoom at 8-megapixels. </p>
<p> For audio, Sony's experts deliver Hi-Res Audio backed by DSEE HX and LDAC encoding from the company. </p>
<p> Setting aside that each is expected to receive Android 10 and its optimizations, both of these handsets already ships with capable Snapdragon SoCs. Either 3GB or 4GB of memory back that up, depending on the model, with 64GB storage in both. </p>
<p> So the display, camera, and audio here are coupled with plenty of power to drive a more premium experience to match the build. Prices start at $323 for the Sony Xperia 10 and $333 for the Xperia 10 Plus. The larger model in a Black coloration, with no U.S. warranty or CDMA support, costs just $327. </p>
<p> 6. Samsung Galaxy A50 </p>
<p> Samsung’s Galaxy A50 keeps on coming down in price and currently hits the wallet at just short of $264 on Amazon. That’s down $4 from last month’s nearly $100 price drop which coincided with the launch of the next entry. In fact, that doesn't just make it the least expensive of the ‘high-value’ Android smartphones here. It very nearly puts it ahead of that other handset. </p>
<p> Pricing isn’t everything but Samsung has made sure that its Galaxy A50 delivers where it matters too. At its surface, Samsung includes an in-display fingerprint reader and 6.4-inch near-bezel-free Super AMOLED Infinity-U display. Underneath, the OEM includes its own Exynos processor. That’s a capable Samsung-built chipset driving Android 9 Pie-based OneUI and driven by a sizeable 4,000mAh battery. </p>
<p> Now OneUI means that everything stays in reach of a thumb despite the large screen, making the Samsung Galaxy A50 easier to use overall. Super AMOLED means that blacks are created by turning pixels off for the darkest contrasts. But Samsung’s wallet-friendly mid-ranger also has a decent camera, informed by its flagships just like everything else. </p>
<p> The cost is decided based on warranty status, region, color, and storage options. Buyers can select from four different colors to match their personality and style preferences. </p>
<p> So what Android users get in buying a Samsung “Galaxy A” series device at the budget end here, is a list of the latest features with just enough hardware to keep things smooth. That experience should only improve with Android 10, if and when Samsung releases it to the A-series. </p>
<p> 5. Samsung Galaxy A70 </p>
<p> Samsung followed up its Galaxy A50 with a device that builds on what that other device started in pretty much every way. Dubbed the Galaxy A70, the company’s second high-value Android smartphone on this list isn’t too much more expensive either. </p>
<p> That’s because Samsung has redesigned its handset families to espouse everything that makes its smartphones great. Each successive increase in price, rather than delivering a completely new experience, bolsters what’s there with better specs. From the moderate chipset in the Galaxy A50, Samsung includes a Snapdragon 675 SoC in the Galaxy A70. RAM sees a boost by 2GB, landing at 6GB while storage is doubled up to 128GB. </p>
<p> The main camera, while keeping the software features delivered with Android 9 Pie-based OneUI, bumps from 25-megapixels to 32-megapixels. The display to showcase the user experience and any photos taken is 0.3-inches larger at 6.7-inches. OneUI also serves here to keep everything important within thumb’s reach. </p>
<p> Underlying all of that and powering the whole experience, the battery in the Samsung Galaxy A70 has been pushed ahead by 500mAh. That means it’s a 4,500mAh unit compared to the 4,000mAh unit in its smaller counterpart. Samsung’s Galaxy A90 might be a flagship that’s more comparable in price, size, and features to the Galaxy S10. But the Galaxy A70 is a true value offering that won’t disappoint those who need a great all-around experience. </p>
<p> 4. Nokia 7.1 </p>
<p> The HMD-built Nokia 7.1 may be among the older devices here and it may just be on the verge of receiving a replacement with the announcement of the Nokia 7.2 at this year’s IFA 2019. As our recent review of this device showed, it really does stand out beyond its gorgeous design language. Realistically, this smartphone should have occupied a higher placement here earlier on because it’s just a high-value Android option. </p>
<p> Not only will this phone certainly receive Android 10 in future and a plethora of security updates — as promised by its OEM. This Android One handset also only costs $299 for the Steel variant and $249 for the Blue. </p>
<p> Pricing can be deceiving though. This shouldn’t be viewed as a gadget just above the budget category. It features a capable octa-core Snapdragon SoC, 4GB RAM and 64GB of onboard expandable storage. That’s tucked into a two-tone frame holding a comfortable 5.8-inch PureView display with all the tech needed for an HDR-like experience that actually fits that description. </p>
<p> Cameras here stand apart as well, though it lacks some features of Google’s Pixel devices. But support for GSM carriers and Verizon too in the U.S. ensure wide network support. Bluetooth 5.0, USB Type-C charging, and a headphone jack set it above the crowd in most cases too. A case might be all but required with this slippery glass-sandwiched smartphone, but it’s one that can’t go unmentioned in terms of value. </p>
<p> 3. ASUS Zenfone 6 </p>
<p> The ASUS Zenfone 6 is, for all intents and purposes, a flagship. It’s also mostly held back due to limited carrier compatibility and availability. That’s true with many ASUS devices and not at all surprising. What may be surprising is that this device falls squarely into the mid-range in terms of pricing. </p>
<p> That’s because it packs the same great processor found in a Samsung Galaxy S10 in the U.S. alongside 8GB RAM and 256GB storage. There’s a Sony IMX 586 48-megapixel dual Quad Pixel snapper around the back. That's coupled with a near-unhindered bezel-less 6.4-inch full HD+ Gorilla Glass 6 display at the front. All of that costs just $549.99. </p>
<p> Now, obviously, there’s no traditional front camera in that display, with its 92-percent screen-to-body ratio. There’s no punch-hole, see-through portions, mechanical pop-up, slider, notch, or waterdrop incursion from the top bezel. But that doesn’t mean selfies can’t be taken and it doesn’t mean there’s no forward-facing camera. No second screen is needed for that either. </p>
<p> Rather than placing the camera on any of the mechanical solutions listed above, ASUS has put its flagship main shooter on a flip-up rocker. That means the main camera quality is also the quality of the selfie-snapper. At the touch of a button, the camera folds itself forward to a wide variety of angles. </p>
<p> The software allows for a variety of specialty modes to accent the camera — including all of the modes usually associated with a main dual-camera array. For anybody who wants a top-of-the-line selfie experience, in a flagship that’s over $400 below flagship pricing, this is the one to buy where carrier bands support it. </p>
<p> 2. Moto Z4 </p>
<p> For now, the Moto Z4 is going to be the only device on this list compatible with next-gen 5G networking. That does take away at least some of the ‘value’ aspect since it requires the standalone purchase of a 5G pogo-pin-attaching moto mod and only works with Verizon. But it is still likely the cheapest way to gain access to 1Gbps+ speeds. </p>
<p> Setting that aside, the semi-modular design of this $499 handset doesn’t only lend itself to mobile connectivity either. That is, in fact, a large part of what makes this high-value Android offering stand out among other smartphones. Buyers also have options for battery extension, screen projection, gaming controllers, and cameras from this flagship-killer. All of those attach via a back-plate and are hot-swappable. </p>
<p> Making the deal all that much sweeter, the Moto Z4 is slated to get access to a near-stock moto variant of Android 10. The Lenovo-owned company hasn’t provided exact details as to when that will be. But it is coming at some point. </p>
<p> The Moto Z4 comes packed with a Snapdragon 675 SoC, 4GB RAM, and 128GB of expandable storage driven by a two-day battery. Android 9 Pie, for now, is pushed across a better-than-average screen in a unique and stylish frame. Its camera, even without mods, stacks in a low-light photo mode that will rival the Google Pixel and is a very good camera even without that. </p>
<p> 1. Google Pixel 3a/3a XL </p>
<p> Presently priced at either $399 or $463, the Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL carry every hallmark of what it takes to make a great high-value Android smartphone. That all starts with one of the best-available octa-core mid-range Snapdragon processors with 4GB LPDDR4x RAM and 64GB storage. </p>
<p> The battery here is a USB-C charged — at 18W — 3,000mAh or 3,700mAh unit depending on whether or not the XL variant is chosen. But the specifications of these 5.6-inch or 6.0-inch smartphones with a fullHD+ resolution and OLED displays only tell part of the story. </p>
<p> Google’s Pixel 3a and 3a XL are true budget counterparts of their namesakes. For the cost, users are getting the same great cameras and software found in the “premium” versions of the Pixel 3 line coupled to pure Android. The squeezable frame has made its way down the line too for added quick-access functionality. </p>
<p> Even without any marketed ingress-protection against dust and water or top-end glass back panels, these are exceptional handsets. That’s setting aside that they don’t seem to have been plagued by the same software issues of the more expensive models. </p>
<p> Better still, Google included the 3.5mm headphone jack not found in the larger Pixel devices. And there aren’t any notches to contend with either. What users get is everything to love about the original Google Pixel 3 series, with none of the hassles. That's in a more affordable package with three colors available too. Those include Clearly White, Just Black, and Purple-ish. Each of those comes in the same two-tone configuration as the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. </p>

<p> Top 10 Best Google Stadia Games – August 2020 </p>
<p> Google Stadia is still a fledgling service/platform for gaming but over the last few months it's been coming more and more into its own by releasing more games and announcing others that are coming to the platform, so we decided to list the top 10 games you can pick up for it. </p>
<p> Worth keeping in mind is that this is list is entirely subjective. Everyone's top 10 may be different. Some may not even like ten games that Stadia has to offer. But that's partly why this list is fun. Because it gives a chance to see which games people like best. </p>
<p> With that being said, read on below to see which games were picked for our list. This list will change regularly and we'll update it as more games come out, and any games on it currently are games which are available. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We won't be including any games that have not yet been released. </p>
<p> Top 10 Google Stadia Games – Summary </p>
<p> Below is a summary table of which games are on this list. If you're short on time and simply want to see which games we picked, you can view them all directly from the table included here. </p>
<p> If you want to read a little more about each of our picks, as well as check out the associated game trailers, you can view the actual longer list below the summary table. </p>
<p> Top 10 Google Stadia Games May 2020 – List </p>
<p> Below you'll find the entire list of games for Stadia that we've ranked as our top 10. </p>
<p> Each game is listed with a short description along with the game's trailer, and a download button that takes your directly to that game through the Stadia web store. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The best game on Stadia for racing </p>
<p> MotoGP 20 </p>
<p> There aren't too many racing games on Stadia yet but the list is growing. For now though, the best one on Stadia is MotoGP 20. </p>
<p> From the outstanding graphical assets that include some gorgeous tracks and surroundings down to the hyper realistic-looking super bikes, it's hard not to look at MotoGP 20 with awe. </p>
<p> The game offers you the main play mode of a managerial career, where you play the racer and take control of your own career. It includes real teams and teams that were created specifically for the game too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There's some pretty decent customizations as well, letting you change the colors of various aspects on the bike, the riders suit and more. It even features a neural AI that can manage things like the wear and tear on your tires and how much fuel your bike consumes. </p>
<p> Perhaps best of all, is that the game has dedicated servers. Which should mean a very reliable gameplay experience with low latency. </p>
<p> The best game on Stadia for fans of looter shooters </p>
<p> Borderlands 3 </p>
<p> Borderlands is an iconic looter shooter franchise that many will be familiar with. And borderlands 3 is the latest iteration in the series. </p>
<p> While I personally enjoy Destiny 2 more than Borderlands 3, this is higher up on the list for a few reasons. One is that Destiny 2's community on Stadia is low right now. So some of the content is going to be harder to do unless you can always find a premade group. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Another is that Borderlands 3 is mostly focused on single-player content as well as co-op, as opposed to slightly open-world multiplayer. </p>
<p> Both are great games and both are worth your time, but at the moment Borderlands 3 deserves a higher rank for games on the Stadia platform. That's also saying something, considering Destiny 2 is free and you have to pay for this game. </p>
<p> With Borderlands 3, you'll get to play all new character classes, hunt down hundreds and hundreds of new weapons, and of course there's even more Claptrap. </p>
<p> The best game on Stadia for fans of battle royale </p>
<p> PUBG </p>
<p> PUBG is universally loved as one of the best battle royale games on the market, and understandably so. With its recent launch on Stadia, players are able to bask in the game's glory in more places than ever before making this a worthy pick for the top 10 Stadia games. </p>
<p> And first-time players on Stadia even get a bunch of cool free loot with the Stadia logo on it. </p>
<p> The base game is free, but if you grab as a Pro member this month, you'll get a bunch of freebies at no charge. Including the Survivor Pass: Cold Front, and themed skins. The best part about it though is that PUBG on Stadia supports cross-play with consoles. </p>
<p> So if your friends play on Xbox One or PlayStation 4, you can play with them while you play on Stadia. You don't have to be left out just cause you aren't playing on the same platform. Get out there and get that chicken dinner. </p>
<p> The best game on Stadia for fans of action MMOs </p>
<p> Destiny 2 </p>
<p> Few games are satisfying as Destiny 2 in numerous ways. It has some of the best gunplay of any FPS game out there, and there's just so much to do. </p>
<p> There's a huge universe to explore with plenty of backstory both through in-game cinematics and story missions as well as through lore books. </p>
<p> The game is best played with friends, and it's true that the Destiny 2 community on Stadia is at its lowest point ever in terms of player numbers. But that should hopefully change when Stadia Base hits. </p>
<p> When that happens, there's a lot to look forward to. Even now it's a game worth playing. Not only cause it's free with Stadia Pro, but also because the gameplay is just fun. </p>
<p> Whether you want to traverse all the solo campaign content or party up and join a strike or raid, there's a lot to acquire and achieve. If you love FPS games and you love loot, dive into this one. </p>
<p> The best game on Stadia for fans of hack and slash </p>
<p> Darksiders Genesis </p>
<p> This is a little bit of a departure from the other Darksiders games, as it's an isometric action RPG that looks similar to Diablo. </p>
<p> The gameplay though is still very much like the other games in the series and is probably the best title on Stadia right now. It's also the first game in the series to let you play two different characters. </p>
<p> One of those is completely new – Strife, as hes not yet shown up in any of the other games as a playable character. The other, War, was the protagonist and playable character in the first Darksiders game. </p>
<p> In Genesis you can freely swap between them at any time. Which gives this game a unique dynamic. Each character can be built out with various skills and abilities, and each character has strengths that will play better for certain situations. </p>
<p> So you'll want to spend time and effort to build them both up as much and as often as possible. If you haven't checked this game out yet, it's entirely worth it. </p>
<p> The best game on Stadia for Adventure/Simulation fans </p>
<p> Spiritfarer </p>
<p> There's so much to love about this game it almost feels like it's too hard to put into words. First off, the art style of the graphics is gorgeous. It is from Thunder Lotus Games, so that was to be expected as it's two previous games, Jotun and Sundered offered really neat visuals too. </p>
<p> Aside from the graphics, Spiritfarer is a beautiful story where you play Stella, a spiritfarer to the deceased who need to pass on. Your job is to ferry them between worlds, and in doing so you embark on some wonderful adventures. </p>
<p> During your travels, you'll meet plenty of unique characters with lively personalities. The world is largely explorable and there will be lots to see and do. As an example, you can fish, hunt, mine for resources, harvest crops, cook, and more. </p>
<p> All of this is cute and engaging, but the best part of the game is the story and the emotional connections you make. Spiritfarer asks you to learn to let go as you send those you meet to the afterlife. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll smile with enjoyment for the time you get to spend with your spirit passengers before they move on. </p>
<p> If you love story-driven games, do not miss this one. It's so different from all the other options on Stadia and is perfect for some relaxing game time that doesn't require you to be entrenched in too much action. </p>
<p> The best game on Stadia for fans of JRPGs </p>
<p> Octopath Traveler </p>
<p> Square Enix has spent many years mastering the craft of the JRPG. And Octopath Traveler is a testament to this effort making it an easy pick for our top 10 Stadia games list. </p>
<p> Sure, for many the Final Fantasy series is and will always be the pinnacle of what Square Enix has to offer in the RPG genre. I'm certainly included in that group. But Octopath Traveler is a very good game and a JRPG unlike any other. </p>
<p> In it you'll get to experience the adventures of eight different adventurers and play each of their roles in this harrowing saga. It features retro-style graphics but with more of an HD look. </p>
<p> Whether you grew up playing JRPG games or not, this is an excellent title in the genre and a great one to get your feet wet with if you're new to the space. </p>
<p> The best game on Stadia for fans of open world exploration </p>
<p> Assassin's Creed Odyssey </p>
<p> Though Assassin's Creed 2 is still beloved by many as the best game in the series, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is thought to be a close second for the title of best AC game. </p>
<p> It's also one of the largest if not the largest game in the series in terms of explorable space. You also get the option to choose between playing a male or female character. Opening up some of the gameplay narrative a little. </p>
<p> It features some of the best combat the AC games have ever had, without straying too far from the type of gameplay you would know and love from earlier titles. </p>
<p> It definitely isn't required to play earlier Assassin's Creed games before diving into this one, but it is fun to play them at some point as there will be little callbacks to those earlier games. </p>
<p> The best game on Stadia for fans of bullet hell shooters </p>
<p> Just Shapes & Beats </p>
<p> Just Shapes & Beats mixes two very popular and iconic genres of games with rhythmic music games and bullet hell shooters. </p>
<p> The basis of the game is a bullet hell shooter with some rhythmic flare. It's also co-op which means you can take on the challenges with a friend. Your goal is to avoid the onslaught of shapes that are being fired towards you like a barrage while you jam out to some awesome music. </p>
<p> Gameplay supports up to four players with co-op and you can play online or offline. You can also play the game solo in the campaign mode if you want or try your hand at completing any of the many different challenges all by your lonesome. </p>
<p> There are 35 different stages to beat, and over 20 different licensed tracks from chiptune and EDM artists. If you like rhythm games, shmups, and co-op gameplay, check out Just Shapes & Beats. You won't be disappointed, and it's one of the less expensive games on Stadia at $19.99, or free if you're a Pro member. </p>
<p> The best game on Stadia for fans of gory first-person shooters </p>
<p> DOOM Eternal </p>
<p> DOOM Eternal arrived on Stadia in all its glory back on March 20, the same day it launched on other platforms. </p>
<p> If you played DOOM 2016, then this is everything that game was and more. Complete with even more gory combat and graphics, harder levels, even more demons, and loads and loads of ways to kill them. </p>
<p> Plus, DOOM Eternal on Stadia is included in the Twitch Prime loot that Bethesda is releasing every month. So you can get some of those cool skins, like the Doomicorn Slayer that launched alongside the game, or the upcoming Mullet Slayer that lands at the end of May. </p>
<p> If you want a challenge when it comes to a first-person shooter, look no further than DOOM Eternal. It's full of wicked encounters that will test your mettle. </p>
<p> Stadia is finally starting to get a larger library of games, and so far DOOM Eternal is the best one that's on offer and why we chose it for the number one spot on our top 10 list. </p>
<p> This is a game you do not want to miss and, you can pick it up on a deal right now for just $44.99. Keep in mind that these Pro member deals don't last forever, so that could change rather quickly. If you want to save some cash, grab the game now while it's less expensive. </p>

<p> Top 5 Android Phones For Gaming – August 2019 </p>
<p> Looking for a gaming phone that makes the cut? These top 5 Android phones for gaming aim to help you play your best. They also come with some top specs and some of the latest Android features. </p>
<p> As gaming phones become more ubiquitous, we may start to see a shift in how many people choose a phone that is geared towards mobile gaming. At least outside of markets where mobile gaming and gaming phones are already popular. </p>
<p> Just a few years ago gaming phones weren't really much of a thing. While mobile gaming was big, there wasn't such a thing as an actual gaming phone. How quickly that has changed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now, top companies associated with gaming hardware have come up with dedicated gaming mobile devices. Well-know brands like ASUS and Razer tend to steal the spotlight. </p>
<p> But even smaller brands like OnePlus are making it known that its devices can hang with the best of them for mobile gaming sessions. Check out the list below to see which phones we found to be the best for "pwning newbs" and delivering great performance. </p>
<p> OnePlus 7 Pro </p>
<p> While not really a dedicated gaming phone in the same sense as a few others, the OnePlus 7 Pro offers excellent hardware that is great for mobile gaming. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Basically, it has the chops to perform very well during your gaming sessions. It even has some gaming-related specs and features that gamers will find useful. For starters, it has a 90Hz refresh rate. While that won't be the most of any phone available now, it's better than many devices when it comes to gaming. </p>
<p> It's also powered by the Snapdragon 855 processor, and can come with up to 12GB of RAM. This is the latest CPU and GPU tech save for the Snapdragon 855 Plus which has a few gaming tweaks to improve it that much more. The 12GB of RAM is also no slouch, and will help with any demanding game out there. </p>
<p> It's also got a liquid cooling system and a bright, beautiful display. When it comes to the features, the included Gaming Mode will help you stay in the game by blocking notifications. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It disables automatic brightness too, and even enhances the haptic feedback. If you're looking for a stellar mobile device for gaming, you can't really go wrong here. </p>
<p> Black Shark 2 </p>
<p> Moving into the territory of a true gaming phone, the Black Shark 2 has just about everything you might need. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It comes with up to 12GB of RAM, is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, and features a large 6.39-inch display. Like the OnePlus 7 Pro, it also comes with liquid cooling. </p>
<p> Black Shark calls its setup Direct Touch Liquid Cooling 3.0. It's designed to lower the CPU core temperature by 14 degrees Celsius to bring big improvements. Black Shark says this will increase efficiency by 20 times and increase the maximum CPU frame rate run time by 800-percent. </p>
<p> Out of the box it should be a beast for mobile gaming, but it does feature what Black Shark calls Ludicrous Mode if you need even better performance. Simply max this out, and get a noticeable boost to your gaming performance and frame rates. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And, while not bringing any gaming functionality to the table, the phone's Gaming Light adds that touch of RGB lighting that you'll see on many gaming machines these days. </p>
<p> There's a host of gaming features too. Such as the in-game Game Studio and Game Dock features for tweaking your game settings. It can even be linked to the big screen for gameplay and you can connect the Black Shark game controller. </p>
<p> Razer Phone 2 </p>
<p> It wouldn't be a gaming phone list without the Razer Phone 2, which is still one of the best gaming phones out there. </p>
<p> Its major claim to fame is the screen which comes with a 120Hz refresh rate. Currently, it's the only gaming phone that you can actually buy which has one, and that gives it an edge. </p>
<p> The screen isn't the largest as it comes in at 5.7-inches, but the refresh rate and clarity more than makes up for that. Naturally, the Razer Phone 2 also comes with RGB lighting. Not just any RGB lighting though, Chroma lighting, which is Razer's signature customizable lighting setup. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you love Chroma on your other Razer stuff then you'll love it here too. You can sync the lights with your notifications for some extra special effects. </p>
<p> One of the best parts though is the vapor cooling chamber, which helps keep the device thin and running at peak performance during your gaming sessions. It also comes with dual front-facing speakers that are powered by Dolby Atmos 5.1 digital surround sound. So even if you're not using headphones you can still expect some epic audio while you play. </p>
<p> ASUS ROG Phone </p>
<p> This one's a little bit older as it officially released last year, but it's still viable thanks to its mainly gaming focus. Until the ROG Phone II is released, the original will have to hold its place for ASUS. </p>
<p> The ROG Phone comes with nearly everything you might want in a gaming smartphone. It's powered by a Snapdragon 845 which, while not as good as the 855, it still performs well. </p>
<p> The phone also comes with 8GB of RAM and a 6-inch AMOLED display that supports HDR so colors are vibrant and clarity for games is great. The screen also has a 90Hz refresh rate for smoother frame rates. </p>
<p> What sets the ROG Phone apart are the air triggers. Just like the triggers you'd find on a controller, the ROG Phone features touch sensitive spots along the edge that you interact with in the same way. This in itself is a major boost for gameplay and should help ease the transition to using touch controls for many games. </p>
<p> If you still prefer physical controls, the ROG Phone has a huge array of available accessories, some of which are controllers. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Note 10/Note 10 Plus </p>
<p> Rounding out this list is Samsung's latest. If you're going all out, then the Galaxy Note 10 Plus is the one you want. It comes with a bigger display and has the capacity for more RAM compared to the Note 10. </p>
<p> In terms of specifics, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus has a 6.8-inch display compared to the Note 10's 6.3-inch. Both are large and provide plenty of room to see every bit of game detail while also using the touch controls. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Note 10 Plus both come with a vapor cooling chamber to keep the CPU and GPU cool while running games. This will help the performance a lot and help prevent your hands from getting uncomfortable due to your phone getting hot. </p>
<p> Feature-wise both phones are also loaded with gaming extras. You can use either device with the PlayGalaxy Link app to stream games from your PC to the phone. This is a big win if you also play games on PC. </p>
<p> In addition, Samsung struck a deal with Discord which integrated Discord into the Game Launcher app. With this you can play your games and still interact and chat with your Discord friends without having to leave the game. Neat right? </p>

<p> Top 5 Best Casual Basketball Games </p>
<p> Casual games are great for passing the time if you don’t have a lot of it to spare, and if you’re a basketball fan then what better to fill that time with some of the best casual basketball games available? </p>
<p> We’ve already put together a list of the best casual soccer games, so we’re doing one for basketball fans too because there are some really great and fun options out there. </p>
<p> These won’t be games like NBA 2K as these are meant to be casual options. If you’re looking for something along those lines, we have a list that includes those types of basketball games that you can check out here. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you like sports betting and would rather spend that casual time making bets on some of your favorite sports, then these 1xbet apps for Android and iOS will do the trick. </p>
<p> Best Casual Basketball Games </p>
<p> BIG WIN Basketball </p>
<p> Kicking off our best casual basketball games list is BIG WIN Basketball, which lets you create a team and play a full game with easy to use controls. </p>
<p> BIG WIN has multiple modes for you to play through too so if you get a little bored with the regular game modes you have options to help switch things up a little bit. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For instance, there’s the Friends mode which lets you challenge your Facebook friends to regular games. This will include dribbling down the court, taking shots, attempting to block and basically anything else you might find in a regular basketball video game. </p>
<p> There’s also Quick Match mode, Events mode, and Trophy mode. If you want the most casual of the casual, Quick Match is the way to go. This is sort of like a training mode in that it will let you practice your shots and other skills. </p>
<p> You get full team and player customization options, and there’s even a chance to win some in-game rewards if you play through the Events mode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> World Basketball King </p>
<p> Do you remember those basketball games they have at arcades like Dave and Busters? Where you have a set amount of time to shoot and make as many baskets as you can? This game looks and feels kind of like that. </p>
<p> It even features a realistic physics engine to make things more life-like. So if your shot is off by any margin there is a chance you’ll miss. That should make things much more interesting, and less likely to get boring because you’re always hitting every shot. </p>
<p> The more you play the more you can upgrade different aspects of the game. Such as the balls you use, and even different environments to play in. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The game does support multiplayer so if you’re getting a little bored playing by yourself you can venture into this mode. The one thing to keep in mind is that this is all there is for this game. </p>
<p> It’s just shooting baskets to see how high your score can go. And that’s the beauty of it. It’s a simple approach to a fairly complex and competitive sport. Perfect for any downtime if you only have a little of it to spare. </p>
<p> Five Hoops </p>
<p> This basketball game has a little more flair than the last game. It’s essentially the same kind of gameplay as it’s just shooting baskets, but you have a little more to get in your way of success. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You play with other people around so there’s a chance that your ball could hit theirs and miss the basket. Or you could time the shots wrong and hit the obstacles like the sign with a giant X on it that will spin around the basket to throw you off. </p>
<p> There are some fun elements to enjoy here too. Such as the unlockable outfits for your characters, as well as new balls and new locations to play on. The more you play the more you’ll be able to unlock. </p>
<p> There are leaderboards to compete in and other players from around the world to play against. So if you fancy yourself a god among mortal human beings in this game, see how well you stack up against other top players. </p>

<p> Blocky Basketball </p>
<p> Price: Free </p>
<p> In-game purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Download: Google Play </p>
<p> This comes from the same development studio that made Blocky Soccer, so you can expect some decent quality in this one and some lovely retro-inspired blocky graphics to give the game a niche that other games on this list don’t have. </p>
<p> This also isn’t just a basket shooting game, and instead utilizes easy swipe controls to move down the court and score. You can even pass the ball to your teammates and dunk the ball if you feel like being flashy. </p>
<p> Just like in Blocky Soccer there are also a ton of different character costume unlocks. From gorillas to sea captains you name it this game has it all. Or so it feels. Because there’s over 65 characters to acquire for your next game on the court. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Overall it’s a well-rounded basketball game that gives you a little of everything without being too complex. It’s nowhere near as in-depth as games like NBA 2K, but it isn’t quite as simple as something like World Basketball King. This is a hidden gem indeed, and one of the best casual basketball games you’ll find on Google Play. </p>
<p> Ketchapp Basketball </p>
<p> Price: Free </p>
<p> In-game purchases: Yes </p>
<p> Download: Google Play </p>
<p> Rounding out this list is Ketchapp Basketball, another shooting game that has simple controls and mechanics that are really easy for just about anyone to get used to. But still a little challenging to master. </p>
<p> As this is just a basket shooting game you can expect what you would think in terms of gameplay. You flick the ball up to try and make your shots, but there are some good levels of variety here. </p>
<p> For one, the basket can begin moving up and down or from side to side to make things more difficult for you. You also sort of have trick shots that you will end up needing to make from time to time. There are four different modes to play through, and you can play solo or compete with other players from around the globe. </p>
<p> There are no costumes to unlock for characters here but you can acquire new balls. You can unlock new balls by acquiring more stars, which you get from playing and completing stages and racking up more points. </p>
<p> This is nearly as simple as they come, so if you just want something simple, but still has to do with basketball, this or any of the other games on this list should suffice. </p>

<p> Top 5 Best Casual Football Games </p>
<p> When you think about football games you’re probably thinking of Madden, but more casual football games can be some of the best. Madden is definitely more recognizable, and that’s fair because it’s a household brand that has been growing for more than two decades. </p>
<p> Games like Madden also have a lot going on and they aren’t always the best options for killing ten or fifteen minutes, unlike casual football games which don’t require a lot of your time or concentration because there’s usually a lot less mechanics to deal with. </p>
<p> We’ve picked out some of the best casual football games on Android and have laid them out for you here so you have something to do now that you may have all this extra time at home. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you like sports betting you can also check out bet365 application for Android, which is an online casino app that lets you bet on more than just football. </p>
<p> If you’re just interested in the casual football games, you can view the list of games below. </p>
<p> Best Casual Football Games </p>
<p> Blocky Football </p>
<p> If this game looks and sounds familiar it’s because we’ve talked about versions of it that are themed around different sports in some of our other lists. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You may know the drill then with this game. It has easy to learn controls that are designed to have you swipe across the screen and up and down the screen for running down the field, passing the ball, and the like. </p>
<p> A big draw here with Blocky Football and really any of the other blocky sports games is the characters. You have loads of them to unlock in this game and most of them. With Blocky Football in particular there are over 80, so you’ll have to play quite a bit to get them all if you want to collect every single one there is. </p>
<p> Beyond the character unlocks, the game is simply fun to play and is pretty darn casual. It’s a no-stress game option that centers around a fun sport. And one of the best casual football games around. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Boom Boom Football </p>
<p> With Boom Boom Football you’re not only getting one of the best casual football games but also one that’s a little more interactive than the first game on this list. The graphics aren’t half bad either, which only adds to the allure and the fun. </p>
<p> The core of the gameplay is card-based here. It’s not a card game, but you do collect player cards which you can play at certain points during the game and they have an impact on what transpires. </p>
<p> There are also five different card classes, with all-star being the best so keep an eye out for all-star cards if you want the best players on your team. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Speaking of teams you’ll create one in Boom Boom Football and attempt to take that team to victory against your opponents. The aim here is one-on-one gridiron matches, with cool little elements like tapping on the screen at the right time for better passes or kicks. </p>
<p> These are called the highlight reel gameplay moments and they basically look visually just like a little highlight reel. It’s a cool and fun little measure that was added into the game and makes for a nice change of pace from the rest of the game. If you’re on the hunt for a good casual football game definitely give this one a try because it’s one of the best ones. </p>
<p> Football Dash </p>
<p> Football Dash is basically a football-themed endless runner, and honestly it’s a lot more fun than you might think. </p>
<p> As with any endless runner the goal is to see how far you can get before you lose the round. As this is a football-themed game, you lose as soon as you’re tackled to the floor. So dodge any opponents from the enemy team that you can. </p>
<p> Your score increases as you score touchdowns, which will pop up throughout the run. There are also lightning bolts to pick up on the field that can help give you a little boost. If you grab enough lightning bolts you can trigger the Power Dash boost, which lets you lay your opponents out like they were nothing. That will teach them to stand in your way. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Until you get the lightning bolts though, you definitely want to move around the field and avoid any opponents. Controls are super simple as you’re doing is touching the screen to start and then dragging your finger around the whole time. </p>
<p> Definitely don’t pass up the opportunity to try this game if you like football games and have wanted something a little more casual. It does have leaderboards, which is nice, if you want some form of competitiveness added. </p>
<p> Football Heroes Online </p>
<p> This is a real-time multiplayer game, but it’s casual enough that it fits in this list. The one thing that feels a little out of place is that you can actually punch your opponents. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, and adds some variance to how you get things done and score those touchdowns. </p>
<p> There are a lot of different super moves you can do as well. In fact there are over 100 different super moves for you to unlock such as rocket shoes and fireballs, and more normal ones like perfect pass and spear tackles. </p>
<p> Your players are also capable of being leveled up. Giving them better stats and access to more powerful abilities. There’s cross-device play too. So you can easily move your game from device to device without losing any of your progress. Play on your tablet one minute and then on your smartphone the next. </p>
<p> While the main bulk of the game might be played online against players from around the world, Football Heroes Online does support local Wi-Fi, which means you can play against your friends while hanging out. This is certainly one of the best casual football games out there, and worthy of looking into. </p>
<p> Football Field Kick </p>
<p> Last on our list is probably the most fun, and it could even be the most casual game on the list. It’s called Football Field Kick and all you do is attempt to kick the ball through the field goal posts. </p>
<p> The controls are really simple here and don’t require a lot of concentration. Making this super casual and easy to pick up and play as well as easy to learn. </p>
<p> In addition to kicking field goals and making them, you’ll also be able to play a mode where you just see how far you can kick the ball. </p>
<p> There are trick shots to complete as well, and the more you play and level up the more you can unlock to improve your stats. Which in turn will allow you to kick the ball further. Thus letting you reach higher scores. </p>
<p> The game offers pretty decent graphics for as simple as it is, and you have various other things to chase and unlock like other characters as well as new footballs with wildly different designs. </p>

<p> Brutal Hockey </p>
<p> Brutal Hockey feels like a highly underrated game in the hockey genre, but it shouldn’t be because it looks and feels good and offers quite a lot to the player in terms of features and quality. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is a top-down hockey game, giving it a slightly different feel from the view alone. Don’t let that fool you though because you can still see all of the crazy action that has the chance to unfold as you play. </p>
<p> Brutal Hockey is a fitting name since you can bash your opponents into the walls and break the glass. </p>

Definitely check this one out if you want a simple but fun hockey game that still feels like a hockey thanks to the fights. </p>
<p> Hockey Stars </p>
<p> Rounding out our list is a game called Hockey Stars which looks and feels more or less like an air hockey game. So if you’re familiar with air hockey you’re likely going to get the hang of things in this game pretty quick. </p>
<p> There’s quite a lot going on here with Hockey Stars as it has over 80 teams to unlock with the developer stating that there will be more added in at some point in the future. </p>

<p> This is a super casual soccer game and one of the best ones there is. Definitely give it a shot. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tika Taka Soccer </p>
<p> In Tika Taka Soccer you actually get to play a full match with your team just like you would expect in a fully fledged game like FIFA. Though the graphics are nowhere near as realistic, it’s still a fun game that earned it a spot on our best casual soccer games list.' </p>
<p> To start you will need to create a team and choose your players. From there you can play matches in your soccer career and take the team all the way to victory at the end of the season. </p>
<p> This game is based on European Club soccer, and beyond playing actual matches it throws in some other elements to give it some complexity. Like hiring accountants and trainers to help your players and your team advance. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It offers some easy to use controls that were designed specifically for touchscreens, and although they may take a little getting used to at first, once you have them down they’re rather quite easy and the game is much simpler to play. </p>
<p> Once you play a little bit more and make some money, you can even buy the best players for your team and better your chances of winning more matches, so you can dominate the league. </p>
<p> Tika Taka Soccer is just casual enough to be one of the best casual soccer games you’ll find, but it also has some depth to it if you enjoy that in your games. </p>

<p> Crazy Kick! </p>
<p> If you want a soccer game that’s extremely casual, look further than Crazy Kick! The name of the game says it all. You just kick the ball towards the goal and that’s essentially it. </p>
<p> There is of course more to the game than just kicking the ball. You’ll have some obstacles to get by in order to make it to the goal. </p>
<p> Some of those obstacles will of course be other players. But there are some wild obstacles you wouldn’t normally find in a soccer match too. Such as giant pits and brick walls. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You’ll need to kick the ball either around, between, or over these obstacles that are in your path in order to get to the end of each stage. Not before scoring the goal though. Naturally. </p>
<p> There’s not much more to it than that. Just kick the ball through a crazy obstacle course of sorts and make it to the goal to advance to the next stage. </p>
<p> It’s simple, controls are simple, and matches are fast which makes this one of the best casual soccer games out there, and perfect for when you may not have a lot of time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Football Strike </p>
<p> Switching things up a bit, Football Strike is our next game on the list. This lets you get some multiplayer action in but it isn’t a full-on soccer game so you won’t have to worry about contending with too many controls. </p>
<p> Instead it’s a simple casual soccer game that has you either trying to score the goal or defend against the score. It features basic flick controls, so you just swipe up on the screen to kick the ball where you want and if you’re the goalkeeper then you just have to swipe to the left or right to attempt a block. </p>
<p> You can play against friends or random players online, and there’s even a career mode if you want to expand the gameplay a little. You can choose which team you want to represent and you can unlock costumes for your players to wear in-game as well. </p>
<p> And if you haven’t already noticed, the graphics are also really good. This is a super simple game where you play as the striker or the keeper and that’s really all there is to it. </p>
<p> It’s still tons of fun and because the entire game is about kicking the goal or blocking it, playing is quick. This is what makes Football Strike one of the best casual soccer games available. Plus it’s free like all of the other options. </p>
<p> Blocky Soccer </p>
<p> Last but not least on our list of best casual soccer games is Blocky Soccer. Here you’re getting another retro-inspired soccer game that offers super simple controls and some endearing visuals. </p>
<p> Unlike the previous game on this list, Blocky Soccer actually has you playing full matches as you control your player, having them run down the field and trying to make it to the goal to score. All the while dodging other players from the opposite team. </p>
<p> The game even has some fun features like weather effects. You can play it solo or play against friends online, too. While the aim of the game is to win your matches and advance your team, there are other things you can do that are almost like mini games. Such as penalty shootouts. </p>
<p> You have trophies to collect too so there’s almost an achievement factor included here. Which gives you something to chase and gives the game some more replay value. </p>
<p> If you were looking for one of the best casual soccer games to check out, Blocky Soccer is definitely one of them. It’s also developed by Full Fat games which makes some pretty decent games. So you know it will be a quality title. </p>

<p> Top 5 Best Star Wars Android Games – May 2020 </p>
<p> It's Star Wars Day, and to celebrate there's a good few deals on some of the best Star Wars games on Android. Some games are even doing some special content updates. </p>
<p> If you're a fan of Star Wars, you definitely should check out some of these mobile titles. Some of them are mobile-only games, while others are ports to mobile of old classics from different platforms. </p>
<p> There are more Star Wars games on mobile than you might think, too. Though this list is only going to focus on the officially licensed offerings. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Top 5 Best Star Wars Android Games – Summary </p>
<p> Below is a summary table of which games are on this list. If you're short on time and simply want to see which games we picked, you can view them all directly from the table included here. </p>
<p> If you want to read a little more about each of our picks, as well as check out the associated game trailers, you can view the actual longer list below the summary table. </p>
<p> Top 5 Best Star Wars Android Games – List </p>
<p> LEGO Star Wars: TFA </p>
<p> If you've never tried any of the LEGO adaptions of the Star Wars games, you're truly missing out. Star Wars on its own is a fun romp, but LEGO Star Wars is a whole other beast and really makes things more fun. </p>
<p> It's probably the fact that the LEGO theme brings an unapologetic kid-like charm to the story. LEGO Star Wars: TFA is the LEGO retelling of The Force Awakens. The first film in the most recent Star Wars trilogy. </p>
<p> Unlike the original LEGO Star Wars game which was released quite a while ago, this version is free. You can jump right in and experience some of the action without having to drop any money on it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It also brings in some features that have never been used in a LEGO game. In particular the blaster battles. Plus, you get to play that scene in The Force Awakens where Rey is flying the Millennium Falcon trying to escape. </p>
<p> This is an adventure game so expect there to be lots of exploring for you to do. </p>
<p> Star Wars: Jedi Challenges </p>
<p> Jedi Challenges is definitely one of the cooler Star Wars games that users can dive into. The thing is, you need the Jedi Challenges AR hardware for it to work. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While that equipment costs money, the game itself does not. You can grab it from Google Play and it makes you feel like a Jedi who wields a lightsaber. </p>
<p> You can explore the galaxy in hologram form and engage in lightsaber battles against fearsome opponents. </p>
<p> If you need a break from the lightsaber battles, you can play holochess instead. That's right, a playable version of holochess is included in Jedi Challenges. It's a really cool nod to the holochess seen in the Star Wars episode IV film. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And there's no better way to play it then to experience it as if you were playing with actual holograms. </p>
<p> Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic </p>
<p> Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic was one of the more cherished video games in the Star Wars franchise, and some years ago it was ported to Android in a very faithful recreation that really didn't change anything. </p>
<p> Much to the delight of fans old and new, because the game was already very good and didn't need any changes to be made. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Star Wars KOTOR is a role playing game with a massive amount of hours of gameplay. That alone might be a great reason to pick this up. But a better one is that it's half off right now. So while it normally costs $10, you can pick it up for $5. </p>
<p> Probably because it's Star Wars day. As you play through the game you can learn over 40 different force powers, meet all manner of unique characters, and even travel across the galaxy in your own star ship. </p>
<p> The game even has full HID controller support so you can play with traditional controls if you prefer them. Though, the on-screen controls are still pretty good. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> LEGO Star Wars: TCS </p>
<p> This is really two games in one for one incredible price. For the cost of $7 you'll end up getting LEGO Star Wars and LEGO Star Wars II. </p>
<p> Say goodbye to any free time you had for other games for the rest of the week. Because this is going to take up all of that time and then some. Altogether there are 36 story mode levels to play through and on top of that a fair amount of bonus content. </p>
<p> There's also a wide variety of characters across both games, including Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, Han Solo and more. There's 120 characters in all, so take your time getting to meet all of your favorites. </p>
<p> Since this is two games in one you don't just need time you also need about 1.5GB of space on your device for the game files. That shouldn't be a huge problem though these days with how much storage comes on phones. </p>
<p> If you try out the LEGO Star Wars: TFA listed above and you like it, it's highly recommended to spend the $7 and get this duo here. Because it's definitely just as good if not better. </p>
<p> Star Wars: Galaxy Of Heroes </p>
<p> This is another role playing game in the Star Wars franchise, and, a very good one at that. To celebrate May The 4th, EA put out an update that adds in content from The Mandalorian. </p>
<p> With Galaxy of Heroes there's no one single story to follow like there is in KOTOR, but there's a lot more gameplay elements involved and you get to play as a bunch of different characters. </p>
<p> Combat is turn-based, so you get to take your time with your decisions and make sure that you unleash the right moves. </p>
<p> The game also features star ship battles, and has plenty of playable content that includes moments, characters, and lore from across the entire Star Wars franchise. </p>

<p> Top 7 Best Android Game Controllers – April 2020 </p>
<p> As Android games become more and more advanced the need for controllers becomes more and more intense, and we've set out to track down the best game controllers for Android games. </p>
<p> We've found a good selection of them and have put them together in this list. Some of them will be on here for different reasons than others. However there is at least one constant between all of them. </p>
<p> And that's that every single one is one of the best game controllers you can get to use with Android games. </p>

<p> Top 7 Best Android Game Controllers – Summary </p>
<p> Below is a summary table of which Android game controllers are on this list. If you're short on time and simply want to see which game controllers we picked, you can view them all directly from the table included here. </p>
<p> If you want to read a little more about each of our picks, you can view the actual longer list below the summary table. </p>
<p> Top 7 Best Android Game Controllers – Ranked List </p>
<p> 8Bitdo SN30 Pro </p>
<p> The 8Bitdo SN30 Pro is perfect not only for those that love retro games but really anyone who plays modern games and just loves a controller with a retro look and feel. </p>
<p> The style of the controller is almost identical to that of an original SNES controller, save for a couple elements. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> First, it has dual joysticks so that you can easily play games where these might be more beneficial than a d-pad. Like PUBG MOBILE for example. </p>
<p> The controller also has left and right trigger and bumper buttons. So you get two extra buttons here on the top that the SNES controller never had. In addition to connecting to Android phones via Bluetooth, it can also be connected to Android phones and tablets through USB C. </p>
<p> The USB C connection works for Windows and Mac computers as well. And, it's compatible with Steam and the Nintendo Switch, too. Overall it has some pretty wide compatibility, which makes it one of the best Android game controllers on the market and on this list. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One other notable feature is the battery life. It takes about an hour or two to charge up. But it'll last you up to 20 hours of gameplay before you need to recharge it. </p>
<p> Glap Controller </p>
<p> If you're looking for a more modern and functional controller setup, you may want to consider the Glap controller. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Not only does it have all the buttons you're probably used to but it holds your phone as well. With the Glap controller you won't have to prop your phone up in front of you. And this is a controller you can easily use in situations where you wouldn't have the opportunity to do so. Such as on public transit or in the car. </p>
<p> The Glap controller supports multiple types of phones of varying sizes. Whether you've got a 5-inch device from a couple of years ago or a newer device like the Galaxy S10+, it'll fit inside of the Glap controller. </p>
<p> Want to switch from playing games on your phone to playing them on your PC? No problem. The Glap controller supports that too. You just need to plug the controller into your PC's USB port. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additionally, you could play PC games wirelessly instead by using the Steam Link app. This way you don't have to plug the controller in and you can still play games from your PC game library. </p>
<p> You get a travel case with the controller too, so you can keep it stored and protected during travel when it's not in use. </p>
<p> HyperX ChargePlay Clutch for Mobile </p>
<p> So this isn't really a controller, at least not in the same sense as the others on this list. The HyperX ChargePlay Clutch for Mobile is more of a grip in the controller style. </p>
<p> But because it's in the controller style, we've included it. It lets you play mobile games with the comfort of a mobile controller but still allows you to use the touchscreen controls. </p>
<p> For some games the touchscreen controls are better than the feeling of the mapped controls to a set of physical buttons. But clawing the phone doesn't always feel comfortable after longer play sessions. </p>
<p> That is precisely where the ChargePlay Clutch for Mobile comes in very handy. </p>
<p> On top of all of that, it acts as an actual charger for your phone while you play. There are two ways to charge the phone while you're using this. Either through the wireless charging pad that your phone sits on while clamped in, or through the traditional plugin method. </p>
<p> Of course your phone needs to support wireless charging for the Qi charger to work. If not you can still just plug it in with a cable. Once you're done playing you can even use the removable battery pack to charge your device. </p>
<p> If you like touchscreen controls but want a controller feel in terms of grip, you can't go wrong with the HyperX ChargePlay Clutch for Mobile. </p>
<p> Xbox Wireless Controller </p>
<p> This option isn't technically a mobile controller but because you can connect it to your mobile device for wireless play, it deserves a spot on our best android game controllers list. </p>
<p> It's also one of the best controllers period, so it's a win/win. The Xbox Wireless controller is a versatile piece of equipment that works with Android smartphones and tablets, as well as PCs, and of course the Xbox One console. </p>
<p> If you're use to playing on an Xbox when you do play on console, then this might the best controller option for you. Because it'll be familiar. You'll know how much travel each button has. You'll know the weight. </p>
<p> The only change in weight really could come from attaching a clamp to the controller so you can hold your phone in front of you while playing. Even then, the controller should still feel good when holding it because it's your main console controller. </p>
<p> Of course if you need to plug it in you can. You just need the USB cable to do so and then you can plug it in for play on PC. Even if you don't own an Xbox, this is a really good controller option for PC and mobile, or just mobile. </p>
<p> It's also cheaper than something like the Glap controller so you get a versatile, quality-made controller that costs about half as much. </p>
<p> Razer Raiju Mobile </p>
<p> Razer has been making mobile controllers for a little while, and one of its best is the Raiju Mobile. It's also one of the more worthy Android controllers on our best list. </p>
<p> The Raiju Mobile takes the popular Raiju gamepad that Razer makes for consoles like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and gives it some mobile-centric features. </p>
<p> One of those being the built-in phone clamp that lets you prop your phone up in front of your face so you can easily play with the screen close to you. </p>
<p> That clamp also comes with a 60-degree tilt. Meaning you can adjust the angle of your phone for the perfect viewing. The Raiju Mobile is built for wireless gameplay. So it works on Bluetooth and will connect to your device this way. </p>
<p> However, you can also plug it in with a USB C cable and play this way too. Making it usable for PC play as well. </p>
<p> While this does work for proper mobile games, it's also certified for use with GeForce NOW. And it's probably one of the better controllers for that particular service. The Raiju Mobile is a bit more expensive, but it'll be worth it if you want a controller that is about the same size as one you'd find for a console. </p>
<p> Razer Junglecat </p>
<p> It shouldn't be a surprise that Razer is on this list again because they make some pretty great peripherals for gaming. </p>
<p> The Razer Junglecat is a perfect example of this because of its dedicated mobile focus but versatility for use with other platforms such as PC. It takes a different approach with the way it holds your phone, but it does still hold your phone. So long as it's one of the three that are supported for this particular function. </p>
<p> The one downside is that it only supports three phones. The Galaxy S10+, the Galaxy Note 10, and the Razer Phone 2. Beyond that it can be used without the Nintendo Switch-style setup via Bluetooth with really any Android phone. </p>
<p> It's more compact than the Raiju Mobile making it easier to carry around with you. Plus it doesn't cost as much. Being that it retails for $100 instead of $150. This will make it more accessible to more people. Without breaking the bank. </p>
<p> It features some really excellent, tactile buttons that feel good and seem to have some great response. You also get all the buttons you really need, with a d-pad, dual joysticks, start and select buttons, bumper and trigger buttons, and your four-button ABXY setup. </p>
<p> It works with GeForce NOW and xCloud too. So if you have access to either of those game streaming services, this controller can pull double duty for those in addition to your mobile gaming habits. </p>
<p> Sony DualShock 4 </p>
<p> We've reached the end of our list and that means we're at the last controller option for you to choose from. </p>
<p> Sony's DualShock 4 is to many, the best controller ever made. With a perfect comfort factor for long gaming sessions. Good weight, excellent button feel, and pretty decent battery life. </p>
<p> It also works with not only the PS4, but also PC, as well as with Android smartphones. In fact for games like Call of Duty Mobile, the DualShock 4 is one of the only supported controllers. Proper support that is, without having to really adjust or change any button mapping. </p>
<p> Plus, let's be honest. The DualShock 4 really is one of the best controllers ever made. It comes in a very wide variety of colors so you can personalize it to your taste. And they can be had for around $52 and up. </p>
<p> Sometimes you can even find them on sale for as low as $35. If you're lucky enough to find one at that price, don't hesitate to snag one. </p>

<p> Top 9 Best Telemedicine Android Apps 2020 </p>
<p> If you've ever had the need to communicate with a doctor online, without going to see him / her face-to-face, you're in the right place.

Thanks to these apps / services, you can get medical care (mainly consultation) without ever seeing your doctor in person. In this article, we're bringing you the very best telemedicine apps for Android. </p>
<p> Telemedicine apps are, in no way, a replacement for real doctors, not at all. They can be quite useful in some situations, but there are limitations as you're talking to someone over the internet. Most of these Android telemedicine apps offer more than one way of communicating with doctors, at least the best ones do. You can chat with them using text messages to ask your question(s). You can opt for an audio call, or video call, it's up to you. </p>

<p> Price: Free to download </p>

<p> Maple says that all of its doctors are Canadian licensed and practice family or emergency medicine in the country. With Maple, you also get access to specialists and other healthcare providers. You can chat with dermatologists, mental health experts, endocrinologists, sleep therapists, naturopathic doctors, and so on. </p>
<p> Best telemedicine Android app for patients with insurance </p>
<p> PlushCare </p>
<p> Price: Free to download </p>
<p> In-app purchases: No </p>
<p> Android version: 6.0+ </p>
<p> This is one of the best telemedicine apps for those of you who have insurance. PlushCare takes appointments every 15 minutes, and it has great reviews in the Play Store. People seem to be really happy with both the app and the service, which is the best recommendation you can get. PlushCare's doctors come from the top 50 medical schools and are both licensed and board-certified. All of the doctors here are also from the US. </p>
<p> The service is available 24/7, and it can provide you with both prescriptions and treatment for ongoing conditions, such as: acne, anxiety, asthma, back pain, depression, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, insomnia, migraine, and so on. Urgent care for allergies, bronchitis, cellulitis, cold, dental infection, and various other ailments is also available. You can also use PlushCare if you don't have insurance, though you'll have to pay for everything, of course. </p>
<p> The company emphasizes that even kids can use PlushCare, as there are pediatricians on staff. The application itself offers a really simple design, much like most other apps on the list. That is, in this case, also a good thing. The app's UI is predominantly white, though there are splashes of other colors applied, just to keep it interesting. </p>

<p> There are tons of fitness trackers out there though. Amazon is swimming in them. How do you separate the ones you should consider from the ones that aren't worth your time? </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>

<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Below the summary you'll find a slightly longer description of each item along with the where to buy links. </p>
<p> Best fitness tracker for Samsung users </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Fit </p>
<p> Price: $99 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Fit is perfect for any Samsung device user. Samsung wearables will work with basically any Android device. So it doesn't need to be from Samsung. </p>
<p> However they do tend to work a little better with Samsung phones. That being said the Galaxy Fit is also a great buy at its price. Because it can now be picked up for just $79, so it's a great value. Especially if you've already spent quite a bit on a new Samsung phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the Galaxy Fit you're getting a full color AMOLED display for showcasing all of your stats. From steps to calories burned and more. </p>
<p> It also comes with a swim-ready design and Samsung says it features "military-grade" durability. What this means is that it should be more than capable of taking a beating. To some degree. You probably shouldn't go out of you way to test how durable it is. </p>
<p> But should you accidentally drop it or occasionally bang it up against stuff, you won't have to worry. The best feature of course is the automatic fitness tracking. Simply slip the tracker onto your wrist and start your activities and it'll track things like walking, running, cycling, and more. </p>
<p> The best fitness tracker for most users </p>
<p> Fitbit Inspire HR </p>
<p> Price: $98.95 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Fit is a great option for a tracker, but the Inspire HR is easily the best option for the majority of users. </p>
<p> It's low $79 price point and various style options mean it will likely appeal to a larger group of people. Not to mention it pairs with the best health and fitness app and dashboard of anything out there. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Hands down Fitbit's companion apps are the best, with deep insights into your health and fitness goals, a robust community of other users for motivation, and more. </p>
<p> The Inspire HR also comes with most of the features you'll find in some of Fitbit's more expensive devices, but at a lower price. Fitbit wanted a more accessible option for consumers, and this is it. </p>
<p> The best tracker for Fitbit fans that want a smartwatch </p>
<p> Fitbit Versa 2 </p>
<p> Price: $194.86 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> If the Fitbit Inspire HR is the best tracker for most users, then the Fitbit Versa 2 is the best option for anyone who wants to go with a Fitbit device but get something with more features wrapped up in a smartwatch package. </p>
<p> The Versa 2 is filled with capable functionality and it comes with a nice, bright, big display for interaction. This is of course a touch screen, though it does have one button on the side as well. </p>
<p> It also comes with Alexa built-in, meaning you get smart assistant interaction by voice similar to Google Assistant on Wear OS watches. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The watch will track your heart rate 24/7, track your steps, distance, calories burned, floors climbed, active minutes, and hourly activity. And it comes with a 6-day battery so you don't have to charge it every night. </p>
<p> Best tracker for measuring blood oxygen saturation levels </p>
<p> Garmin Vivosmart 4 </p>
<p> Price: $97.63 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> The Garmin Vivosmart 4 is a little bit of an older tracker as it was officially released in 2018, but when it comes to Garmin this is the latest tracker the company has released that isn't a full-on watch. </p>
<p> It's also still a very capable tracker with all the necessary fitness-related features you'd need for keeping track of your exercise. </p>
<p> It comes with built-in Pulse OX sensor as well so you can measure your blood oxygen saturation levels, if that's a feature you were looking for. </p>
<p> Garmin offers this device in a range of different color options just in case you wanted something other than the standard black model. And as long as you're not using the Pulse OX sensor, the battery should last up to seven days. </p>
<p> The best tracker if you want a smartwatch </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 </p>
<p> Price: $299 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> In the market for a smartwatch that has fitness tracker features? Look no further than the Galaxy Watch Active 2. </p>
<p> We thought it was a great smartwatch and consider it the only smartwatch you should buy. If you want the best, Samsung has you covered. </p>
<p> From a simple and sleek design to meaningful and functional features like advanced sleep tracking and the touch bezel, the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the perfect companion to anyone who wants to get into shape. </p>
<p> It can measure your stress levels too. Which is important if you have a busier life with a hectic schedule. Not to mention it's comfortable. And it comes in a few different color options, with the added benefit of swapping out your band for something more stylish if the event calls for it. </p>
<p> Want to swap out your watch face? It can do that too. You can even take pictures and easily add those as your custom watch face through the companion app. </p>
<p> The best tracker for Amazon Music users </p>
<p> Garmin Forerunner 245 Music </p>
<p> Price: $299 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Garmin has more than a few fitness trackers and smartwatches available, and the Forerunner 245 Music is one that you should keep an eye on if you use Amazon Music to stream your tunes. </p>
<p> More than a few of Garmin's devices are now compatible with Amazon Music, a feature which it introduced back in 2019. The Forerunner 245 Music however is a good mix of value and features. </p>
<p> Since it's compatible with Amazon Music you can easily use the watch to sync up to your Amazon Music playlists and track libraries. Only Garmin's watches have integration with this particular service, while most others focus on Spotify, Google Play Music and others. </p>
<p> Aside from the Amazon Music support the watch also features optional guided training plans from Garmin Coach, as well as GPS capabilities, and even a seven-day battery life. </p>
<p> The watch features incident detection too. Say you're on a run and you suddenly end up in an accident. The incident detection will alert emergency contacts to the situation along with your real-time location. </p>
<p> The best tracker for multisport </p>
<p> Garmin Fenix 6 Series </p>
<p> Price: From $449 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Most of the trackers on here are priced at a relatively affordable cost. None of those are the Fenix 6 series from Garmin though. </p>
<p> This is a premium multisport GPS watch and is the tracker to buy if you want the best of the best with nearly every feature under the sun. </p>
<p> The Fenix 6 comes in a series of different models, each having something a little different. They're relatively close in features though. </p>
<p> For example all of them offer Garmin Pay so you can make mobile payments, Meanwhile the Fenix 6 Pro Solar allows you to charge the battery with solar energy. Meaning you can charge it as you wear it outside during exercises and adventures. So long as there's enough sun around to provide the energy it needs. </p>
<p> The Fenix 6 series also offers mapping features, music integration, and PacePro technology for grade-adjusted pace guidance during your runs and outings. You can track your heart rate and measure your blood oxygen saturation levels too thanks to the integrated PulseOX and Heart Rate sensors. </p>
<p> The price for this one is steep. But if you're serious about your fitness and want something that offers features that you won't find elsewhere, the Fenix 6 is where to look. </p>
<p> The best tracker for consumers on a budget </p>
<p> Xiaomi Mi Band 4 </p>
<p> Price: $32.19 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Fitness trackers aren't usually insanely expensive, but they can be a little more than anticipated. They don't have to be though. There are some trackers out there that offer excellent tracking features without breaking the bank. </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Mi Band 4 is the best of those budget trackers. It costs under $50 and you get things like full color AMOLED touch display that's easy to see in direct sunlight. Keep in mind you'll need the brightness up for this which will deplete the battery life faster, but the option is there. </p>
<p> The good news is that this has a battery life of up to 20 days. Which is much more than many trackers out there. And so far more than any tracker on this list as most are up to seven days. </p>
<p> It's got more than just good battery life though. It also has six different workout modes including treadmill, exercise, outdoor running, cycling, walking, and swimming. It'll also count your steps, your distance, and how many calories you burn while you exercise. </p>
<p> It comes in various color options too so you can pick the color that fits your style best. There's heart rate monitoring incorporated as well, just in case you wanted this feature. The Mi Band 4 might not be as advanced as some of the other options on here, but if what you want is a more simplistic tracker, you can't go wrong with the Mi Band 4, especially at this price. </p>
<p> The best tracker for guided training and nightly recharge insights </p>
<p> Polar Ignite </p>
<p> Price $196 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> Most trackers will offer your basic fitness features like step counting and caloric burn, as well as a number of fitness or sport modes to track specific types of workouts. </p>
<p> The Polar Ignite does those things, but it takes a heavy approach to giving you guided training so you can make the most of your exercises. </p>
<p> The Daily Training Guide feature attempts to give you the best workouts for you, aimed at helping you reach your fitness goals. </p>
<p> Polar also knows that after a good workout you need a good night's sleep. This is where the Ignite's 'Nightly Recharge' feature comes in. It was designed to help you see deep insights about your recovery overnight. </p>
<p> With these insights you can make decisions about how to perform better in your workouts the following day. </p>
<p> The Ignite also comes with integrated GPS for speed, distance, and route tracking without need to connect a smartphone to it. </p>
<p> The best fitness tracker overall </p>
<p> Fitbit Charge 4 </p>
<p> Price: $150 </p>
<p> Where to buy: Amazon </p>
<p> The Fitbit Charge 4 is the new upcoming tracker from Fitbit and while it doesn't really look much different from the Charge 3, it has a handful of notable improvements under the hood. </p>
<p> It's these improvements that make it one of the best fitness trackers you can get your hands on, and why we picked it as the best fitness tracker overall. </p>
<p> First, it has built-in GPS now. Which is a first for any Fitbit tracker and a boon for anyone wanting GPS features without having to link their phone up to the tracker. </p>
<p> It also comes with a new Active Zone Minutes feature. This targets your heart rate zones during exercise and praises you with alerts once you've hit those targets anytime during a workout. If you get additional Active Zone Minutes outside of exercise you'll get extra praise along with them. </p>
<p> It has a new Spotify app too, so if you do keep your phone on your person while you exercise, you can easily control your songs and playlists from the Charge 4. </p>
<p> The best part about all of the improvements is that you don't really lose anything from the Charge 3. You simply get more functionality for the same exact cost of $150. Making this tracker a steal and the best overall tracker. </p>

<p> TSMC Gets US License To Supply Chips To Huawei, But There's A Twist </p>
<p> Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC has obtained a special license from the United States Department of Commerce allowing it to supply chips to Huawei. However, before you jump to the conclusion that Huawei may now see a turn of fortunes, this license essentially does no good to the beleaguered Chinese smartphone maker. </p>
<p> According to a new report from Sina.com (via PhoneArena), the chips that TSMC is allowed to supply to Huawei will have to be produced using more "mature" process nodes. People familiar with the matter told the Associated Press that the license only covers 28nm and higher process nodes. </p>
<p> This essentially means Huawei still can't obtain any modern-day chips from TSMC. The Taiwanese company's latest flagship chips are based on 5nm process nodes. It's now moving on to 3nm and 2nm chips. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, as things stand, TSMC can't supply any of its modern chipsets to Huawei. Those include chips based on 16nm, 10nm, and 7nm process nodes as well. Since 28nm or older chips are of no good to the Chinese electronics and telecommunication giant as far as its smartphone and networking businesses are concerned, this license doesn't really help it much. </p>
<p> TSMC is reportedly building a manufacturing facility in the US to please the American government. The company hopes to win the Trump administration's trust and get approval to supply Huawei with its latest chips. However, the US reportedly has not made any such guarantees to TSMC. The facility in Arizona will likely be operational by 2023. </p>
<p> TSMC obtains "the" license but that's of no real use to Huawei </p>
<p> The latest amendments to the US-imposed trade restrictions on Huawei, effective 15the September 2020, has cut the company from all its chip suppliers. Any foundry around the world that makes use of anything remotely American in the manufacture is barred from supplying chips to the Chinese company. Such companies would require to obtain a license from the United States Department of Commerce if they want to continue doing business with the Chinese behemoth. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While almost every major chipmakers including Samsung, HK Hynix, Qualcomm, MediaTek, TSMC, and SMIC have applied for the license, there's little chance of getting the approval. And if they do get the license, it seemingly comes with some major caveats that essentially render it useless. </p>
<p> Apparently, the US government doesn't want to completely block Huawei from receiving semiconductors. This is evident from the Commerce Department granting licenses to TSMC as well as AMD and Intel. However, with all the limitations in place, those intentions appear to be a mere formality. </p>
<p> Huawei's still doing pretty well overall. It recently reported a 21.65 percent year-over-year growth in revenue in the third quarter, setting a new single-quarter record. The reported revenue of 84.488 billion yuan ($73.9 million USD) is also up 14.7 percent from the previous quarter. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Reports suggest that Huawei has also stocked enough chips for its upcoming Mate 40 series flagships. However, things don't look brighter for the company post that. Its smartphone business is still in threat unless we see some dramatic changes and developments in the coming months. </p>

<p> You Can Watch TV & Movies With Your Favorite Twitch Creators </p>
<p> Twitch has always been a place to watch your favorite creators livestream their gameplay as well as a variety of different things, but now it's also a place to watch movies with them. </p>
<p> Of course it doesn't have to be movies, you can also watch TV with your favorite creators on Twitch. It seems like a weird thing to offer, but think of it like a virtual movie theater. Or a get-together with friends to watch a TV series you're currently into. Just digitally. </p>
<p> The new feature is called Watch Parties. Technically, Watch Parties isn't really "new" new, but it is new to some creators today. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Watch movies on Twitch with your favorite creators across the globe </p>
<p> Twitch officially rolled out Watch Parties in October of 2019 but at the time it was only available in beta. </p>
<p> And on top of that it was only available to smaller number of creators that Twitch likely handpicked and worked with directly. Naturally this would be so it could work out any bugs and get things into full swing when it was ready for a full release. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It's ready for a full release as of today and Watch Parties is available to all creators on the platform worldwide. If Twitch is available in your country, and you're a creator, you can now use Watch Parties and engage with your community of subscribers in a whole new way. </p>
<p> The content has to be available on Prime Video </p>
<p> If there's one major caveat to mention, it's the requirement that content has to be from Prime Video. </p>
<p> Twitch is owned by Amazon. So it only makes sense that its own video streaming platform is where the movies and TV shows come from for Watch Parties. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If it's available on Prime Video though, it can be streamed live to your community. This includes hit series from Prime Video like The Boys, or any other popular TV shows or movies. Whether it be an Amazon original or not. </p>
<p> Creator webcams also display above the chat so viewers get a full screen of the content. To view whatever's being shown on-screen, community members need to have a Prime or Prime Video subscription, and that particular content has to be available in their country. </p>
<p> For example, if The Boys isn't available in the country you live in, then you can't watch it through Watch Parties if a creator you follow or subscribe to is streaming it. </p>

<p> Twitch Prime Gets A New Name But Keeps The Same Perks </p>
<p> Earlier this morning Amazon officially announced that it would be giving a new name to Twitch Prime. </p>
<p> The service, which is a gaming-focused division of Amazon's Prime subscription, gives out perks to gamers based on some of the most popular titles across PC, console, and mobile. </p>
<p> While Twitch Prime will have a new name going forward from today, the perks will still be the same. Basically Amazon isn't taking away any of the special bonuses you get. It just wants to call Twitch Prime something different so it comes off more streamlined. </p>

<p> The new name of Twitch Prime is 'Prime Gaming' </p>
<p> As of today Twitch Prime is now Prime Gaming. The move is one which shouldn't surprise anyone. </p>
<p> After all, the collective of Amazon's other Prime-related services all have Prime in front of the name. Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Now. It only makes sense that it would eventually make the change to Prime Gaming. </p>
<p> There's also a chance that Amazon is making this change in preparation for the launch of rumored cloud gaming service. If and when that happens, it would be more streamlined under the moniker of Prime Gaming. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Especially since it would be Amazon's own service. Prime Gaming is another step for Amazon in bringing all of its gaming offerings under one singular umbrella. Which would probably include the rumored cloud gaming service as well as Amazon Games. Its in-house game studio responsible for the free-to-play shooter Crucible and the upcoming New World MMO. </p>
<p> You won't lose any of the benefits </p>
<p> Twitch Prime might be changing but the perks aren't. If you already subscribe to what is now Prime Gaming, you'll still have access to everything that was there yesterday. </p>
<p> Including new in-game loot for games like DOOM Eternal, as well as a huge collection of free games from SNK as parts of its 40th anniversary. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you're not already subscribed to Prime Gaming, not to worry. All of those bonuses will still be there should you decide you want to check out the service. Save for any that might have already expired. The loot from Destiny 2 is a good example of this as you can't really claim the past content. only the content for the current loot package. </p>
<p> There will also be no price change with this new title. As Prime Gaming will be just one of the perks you get for subscribing to Amazon Prime every month. </p>

<p> Twitter Cracking Down On Mindless Retweeting Ahead Of Election Month </p>
<p> Limits on mindless retweeting are on the horizon; Twitter is no stranger to reinventing itself but the looming presidential elections in the United States are truly pushing it to the brim. Of course, that's hardly a surprise following years of pressure for its lackdaisical approach to the past election cycle. Well, that's definitely not the case this time around. Even to the point of Twitter crippling core platform functionality in its pre-emptive efforts to combat misinformation. </p>
<p> Any misleading election-related tweets will start seeing much less virality potential from Tuesday, October 20th, Twitter announced. Whether someone's falsely claiming a premature victory for either candidate or is talking nonsense about mail-in ballots, the company will attempt addressing those honest-to-god mistakes with some serious-looking labels. Here's how that will look like in practice: </p>
<p> Seems familiar? It should, if you're a somewhat regular Twitter user. These kinds of labels have been adorning the 45th's tweets for a while now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Twitter's rules against mindless retweeting will be going live globally </p>
<p> But anyway, Twitter will urge you to inform yourself on any particular matter before you start spreading what it deems misinformation. Another change will see the platform prompt you to quote tweets instead of just resharing them. The thinking here is that much more subtle; i.e. by getting some users to ponder controversial topics, Twitter is hoping to lead them to enlightenment. Which sounds ironic but really isn't, it's just that Twitter's train of thought is probably just a tiny bit naive. </p>
<p> Still, this civic integrity is important to a healthy democracy, even one that started half-believing freedom of speech means freedom from speech you dislike. </p>
<p> Another key tidbit here is that the majority of these changes will be going out globally. At least until the Election Day, November 3rd, is behind us. Managing essentially two different platforms would probably be too massive of a development nightmare for Twitter; this way, they're pretty much just running an experimental Git repository until the elections are behind us. Back to the changes at hand, the final difference in how the microblogging platform works in the coming weeks will reflect on how much third-party content from accounts you don't follow it serves. The target, as far as politics are cocnerned, is none, Twitter said. </p>

<p> While we wait for the breads and circuses season to be over, expect the 45th to attack Twitter on a few more occasions. You know, for old times' sake. </p>

<p> Ulefone Armor X8 Shines In The Company's Durability Test </p>
<p> Ulefone has decided to show off how tough the Armor X8 is, by performing a durability test. Well, the company actually submitted this phone to a series of durability tests, and showed all that off in a video format. </p>
<p> The Armor X8 is the company’s newest smartphone, and the aforementioned video has a duration of about two minutes. The video is embedded down below, and we’ll talk more about it in the following paragraphs. </p>
<p> In the first test, the Armor X8 had a meeting with a set of stairs. The phone was thrown down those stairs, and that didn’t really damage it at all. The phone is well-protected all around. The company’s employee threw the phone twice, actually. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Ulefone Armor X8 gets used as a shovel in the company's durability test </p>
<p> Following that, the Armor X8 got thrown in some sand, which is mixed with a bunch of small rocks. In the third test, the phone was used as a shovel, basically, as it was scraped against some sand, and rocks, both big and small. </p>
<p> You can easily wash the Armor X8, as it comes with IP68/IP69K certification for water and dust resistance. That was also demonstrated in this video. The phone was also submerged in the process. </p>
<p> The Ulefone Armor X8 is not the most powerful rugged phone we’ve seen, not even close. This is a budget phone, but if you need a rugged device for whatever reason, this may be a good choice… especially if you don’t want to break the bank to get it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The device includes an octa-core SoC, along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. A large, 5,080mAh battery, is also included. There are three cameras included on the back, lead by a 13-megapixel unit. </p>
<p> A single 8-megapixel camera can be found on the front. This phone does include an NFC chip as well, and ships with Android 10 out of the box. </p>
<p> The Ulefone Armor X8 can be purchased for $119.99 as we speak. This is its discounted price tag, as it’s usually $80 more expensive. You can purchase it from AliExpress, if you want. The link is included below. </p>

<p> Amazon / US Antitrust Subcommittee Accuses Google, Facebook, Apple & Amazon Of Market Abuse </p>
<p> US Antitrust Subcommittee Accuses Google, Facebook, Apple & Amazon Of Market Abuse </p>
<p> The US Antitrust Subcommittee has accused Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon of market abuse. The antitrust subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee said that Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon should not control and compete in the same business. </p>
<p> According to them, those four companies are abusing their market power. They are using “killer acquisitions” to destroy rivals, all in the name of profit, reports Reuters. The panel said that these companies should be restructured, but it didn’t go into detail on that. </p>
<p> The US Antitrust Subcommittee accuses four tech giants of market abuse </p>
<p> The full report, which you can read here, is 449 pages long. You will find suggestions for expansive changes to antitrust law. On top of that, the report describes “dozens of instances where companies misused their power”. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The report also goes into detail as to how companies did everything in their power to dominate the competitors in order to control large portions of the Internet. One of the examples is Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012. </p>
<p> The Subcommittee did suggest quite a few changes in the report. One of those concerns Google’s ad business. It suggests that Google should stop both run the auctions for online ad space, and also participate in them at the same time. </p>
<p> Another change concerns Amazon. It says that the company should stop operating on markets where it also competes with other retailers. This report also calls for the US Congress to give antitrust enforcers more freedom to stop purchases of potential rivals. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tons of information is included in this report, needless to say. This is quite an important event, and it remains to be seen what will happen from this point. Things are not looking good for Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, though. </p>
<p> If the US Congress ends up listening to these recommendations, the days of purchasing rivals in the market may be over for all four companies. We’ll see what will happen. </p>

<p> Did The US Just Grant Intel A License To Sell Chips To Huawei? </p>
<p> Intel has a US government-granted license to sell chipsets to Huawei, according to new reports. The reports, stemming from China, indicate that the news was confirmed by Intel on September 21. </p>
<p> Reports haven't indicated the extent of the license. So, as of this writing, it's not clear when the cut-off will be. Or exactly when Huawei will release devices built on the chips. </p>
<p> How will the Intel license and chips be used by Huawei? </p>
<p> If accurate, Intel may actually be the second such company to gain a license from the US government. AMD was also granted a license to continue working with companies on the US Entity list. That's a list of companies that have been banned from interaction with US companies or companies using US parts. And companies that cannot operate in the US either. In each case, due to ongoing concerns said to center around national security. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Huawei is on that Entity list and that's been impacting its global presence, but it isn't immediately clear whether AMD will work with Huawei either. None of its partners have been revealed. </p>
<p> In either case, this license deal from the US for Intel could really only mean one thing for Huawei. And, as noted by the source, that's laptops. </p>
<p> Now, Huawei only recently launched its most powerful laptop to date, the Huawei MateBook X. The announcement may, in fact, have given away Intel's agreement with the US government in advance. That device is powered by 10th-Gen Intel Core i5 and Core i7 chips. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Conversely, AMD and Intel may be utilized for future devices, depending on the length of the license agreement. </p>
<p> Intel isn't in the business of making mobile phone chips though, so Huawei will likely need to look elsewhere for that. Neither is AMD. Although, as already noted, there's no confirmation that AMD is involved with Huawei at all. </p>
<p> What does this mean for US buyers? </p>
<p> For now, there's no indication whether or not Huawei's future laptops, built on Intel processors, will be able to run Windows. Microsoft would also need to obtain a license from the government for that to happen. And that doesn't leave the company with many options. But it is entirely possible that Huawei plans to bring its Harmony OS to larger, non-smartphone platforms. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Harmony OS is an open-source, free, microkernel-based operating system Huawei revealed back in 2019 as a potential replacement for Android — since Google is also disallowed from working with Huawei. </p>

<p> Smartphone Carriers News / 5G / Verizon Promises 5G Ultra Wideband & Nationwide Capability For Motorola One 5G UW </p>
<p> Verizon Promises 5G Ultra Wideband & Nationwide Capability For Motorola One 5G UW </p>
<p> Motorola One 5G is not a new smartphone but it will be for the Verizon customers. Because the carrier has made the Motorola One 5G UW available for purchase and that too with Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband support. </p>
<p> One thing to note here is that Verizon Motorola One 5G UW customer would have to pay $100 extra than AT&T. For the unaware, AT&T has priced the device at $444.99. But the AT&T phone only has sub-6GHz. </p>
<p> The $500 price tag for the Verizon Motorola One 5G UW is because of the fact that it will support Verizon's 5G ultra-wideband and nationwide capability. The UW moniker attached to the name confirms mmWave 5G support. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Notably, this will allow the Verizon Motorola One 5G UW customers to download any file 25x faster than 4G LTE. However, users should note that 5G Ultra Wideband available only in select regions. </p>
<p> So, in order to experience this high-speed connectivity speeds, Verizon Motorola One 5G UW users should make sure they are residing in the 5G ultra-wideband capable area. </p>
<p> The Motorola One 5G went live for purchase on Verizon starting October 15. It is available for $500 or $22.91 per month for 24 months. And it is live for purchase from the Verizonwireless.com and in the My Verizon app. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Verizon Motorola One 5G comes with Snapdragon 765G and a 90Hz display </p>
<p> For the 5G support, the Motorola One 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor and is coupled with 4GB of RAM. Besides, it offers 128GB of onboard storage. </p>
<p> Moreover, the phone has a 6.7-inch CinemaVision HD+ 90Hz display. Talking about the cameras, it has a quad-camera setup with a 48MP primary lens. Under the hood, the phone is juiced by a 5,000 mAh battery. </p>
<p> With the Motorola One 5G, users can charge their phones at high-speeds with the included TurboPower charger in the retail box. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Additionally, new and existing Verizon customers can also pick up the device with Verizon's Do More, Play More or Get More Unlimited plans to make the most of the 5G support. </p>
<p> With the Verizon's Do More, Play More, or Get More Unlimited plan, users will get up to $550. This is provided towards a purchase with a trade-in of a qualifying smartphone. Note that the discounts will be applied via 24 billing credits monthly. </p>
<p> Basically, all the UW branded Verizon phones cost more than the non-UW branded devices. And the difference is, at the most, $50. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But for the Motorola One 5G UW, Verizon has hiked the price by $100. Which is almost 23% of the original price of the phone. </p>
<p> Ultimately, it is a matter of choice whether the user is okay paying a premium for using 5G service or not. </p>

<p> Android News / Verizon Is Getting The BlackBerry KEY2 LE Soon, But There's A Catch – CES 2019 </p>
<p> Verizon Is Getting The BlackBerry KEY2 LE Soon, But There's A Catch – CES 2019 </p>
<p> TCL announced at CES today, that the popular BlackBerry KEY2 LE is going to be making its way over to the largest wireless carrier in the country, Verizon. It'll be available in "the coming weeks", TCL nor Verizon is committing to a firm release date just yet. Though, with this being a CES announcement, getting an availability for "the coming weeks" is more than most products will get. The BlackBerry KEY2 LE has been certified to use on Verizon since it launched late last year, so it's a bit surprising that it wasn't available for Verizon at launch, but it is now. Verizon has not yet announced pricing for this smartphone, but the unlocked version sells for $449, so expect a price similar to that. </p>
<p> Announced at IFA last year, the BlackBerry KEY2 LE is a decidedly mid-range smartphone from TCL. It sports a 4.5-inch 1080p display, which might seem rather small in 2019, but this is due to the physical keyboard on the bottom half of the phone. Inside, you'll find the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 chipset, paired with 4GB of RAM, and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. BlackBerry does have a micro SD card slot available for expanding storage if you wish to do so. Finally, there is a large 3000mAh capacity battery inside which should keep the KEY2 LE going all day long. Camera-wise, the KEY2 LE isn't the best, but it does sport a 13-megapixel sensor on the back with a 5-megapixel secondary sensor and then a 8-megapixel front-facing camera. </p>
<p> BlackBerry KEY2 LE comes to Verizon, but it won't be available to all </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 LE is going to be coming to Verizon for its Enterprise and Small Business customers. That means that normal customers that are on their unlimited plans won't be able to purchase it. Though, nothing is stopping them from purchasing it from Amazon and putting their SIM inside. BlackBerry has always been a business-focused smartphone, even before it was running the Android operating system, so seeing this available for business customers is not that big of a surprise. And Verizon actually has a fairly significant market share of the business market, when it comes to smartphones. This is because many companies choose Verizon for their employees smartphones due to the coverage that Verizon provides. So if there's one carrier that TCL and BlackBerry Mobile should be choosing for its business-focused smartphone, Verizon is the one. </p>
<p> BlackBerry Mobile is slowly but surely getting back onto each of the four major US carriers. With the KEYone it launched on AT&T, then the KEY2 on Sprint, and now the KEY2 LE on Verizon. The only one missing here is T-Mobile, and that will likely be the next target for BlackBerry Mobile and TCL in 2019. BlackBerry used to have a pretty tight relationship with all of the carriers, not too long ago. It was releasing new phones on each carrier pretty consistently, and they were selling. But that was around 2010. Now in 2019, the reaction by many is "BlackBerry is still in business?" It is, though it has undergone some changes as you might expect. While the KEY2 LE is only going to be available for Enterprise and Small Business customers, TCL still sees this as a major step forward for the brand. </p>
<p> With BlackBerry, you're in control of your privacy </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One of the main selling points of a BlackBerry – even back in the day when the company was known as RIM – is the security and privacy aspect of the phone. BlackBerry Mobile has made it super simple to keep your phone private, so that you aren't sharing data with companies that might misuse that data, but also so that your phone isn't compromised when it is stolen. Thanks to the DTEK app that is installed on all BlackBerry smartphones, you can see just how secure your smartphone is. On top of that, BlackBerry Mobile has done a great job at keeping its smartphones up-to-date with the latest security updates from Google. Typically releasing them the same day, or within a few days of when Google does so. </p>
<p> That's what makes this such a great option for businesses. As employers don't want to worry about dealing with their employees getting hacked or being careless with their data. BlackBerry takes care of all of that themselves. The BlackBerry KEY2 LE is also a pretty productive smartphone to pick up for employees, partly because of that full-sized physical keyboard, making it easier than ever to send out emails to everyone while on the go. </p>

<p> Verizon Rolls Out Its Low-Band 5G Support To Some Phones </p>
<p> A tweet by Verizon PR Manager George Koroneos confirms that Verizon is now rolling out support for its low-band 5G to some smartphones. </p>
<p> Well, 5G is something that the world is waiting for. 5G would drastically improve the connectivity speeds that we are used to right now. And Verizon is taking its first step in delivering 5G support to some phones. </p>
<p> Notably, T-Mobile is also pushing a lower-band nationwide 5G support. Moreover, it seems like Verizon also did not want to miss out on this race and it has followed in the footsteps of T-Mobile. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Select 5G phones will be picking up an update that will bring low-band 5G support to the device. This will help the device stay connected and have access to a more far-reaching network. </p>
<p> Besides, the upcoming 5G phones, soon to be launched, will have this feature out of the box. This nationwide 5G network uses DSS to share the existing LTE spectrum with 5G. </p>
<p> As per Verizon, this network would cover around 200 million users. Android phones are fully capable of supporting this network. Additionally, as per reports, a bunch of Samsung devices has already updated with this access. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Verizon Low-Band 5G Support is live for Galaxy Note 20, S20 series, and more </p>
<p> Verizon PR Manager George Koroneos further confirmed the names of the Samsung Galaxy Phones that are receiving this Verizon nationwide 5G access. </p>
<p> The list includes Samsung Galaxy Note 20 5G series, Galaxy S20 5G UW, Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G UW, Galaxy S20+ 5G, Galaxy A71 5G UW, and Galaxy A51 5G UW. </p>
<p> The customers of the above-mentioned phones will be receiving a software update notification over the next few days. Once the notification pops up, hit the download button to get nationwide 5G access from Verizon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> However, note that the new 5G network support is not limited to these mentioned phones. Other 5G Verizon models will also receive an update in the coming weeks. So, keep an eye on your software update. </p>
<p> We expect the phones with the "5G UW" moniker will see this feature getting enabled via subsequent updates. Speeds will probably vary by market, and over time the speeds will get a boost. </p>
<p> This is not a good sign, initially, as users are already paying a premium for using the 5G services. And if the services are not matured, there is no point in rolling out support for its low-band 5G. </p>

<p> Video: BlackBerry KEY2 Camera Review – The Sweetest Yet </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 marks the first BlackBerry phone with a dual-camera setup, and some seriously good looking sensors as well. The main rear camera is a 12-megapixel sensor with 1.28-micron size pixels and Dual Pixel Phase Detection Autofocus, behind an f/1.8 lens with 79.3-degree FoV. The secondary rear camera is also a 12-megapixel sensor, but with smaller 1-micron pixels and standard PDAF, situated behind an f/2.6 lens with 50-degree FoV (which is basically 2x optical zoom). A single 8-megapixel camera resides up front with no notable specialties. Since this is a dual-camera setup, BlackBerry has included a portrait mode alongside the usual suite of photo and video recording modes. </p>
<p> That nice wider-angle lens on the main rear camera is quite noticeable when directly comparing it to a number of other smartphones out there. This helps pull in more visual information without looking like a wide-angle lens, and BlackBerry is offering a 50mm lens on that secondary sensor to help with zooming into details as well. This secondary lens can be used for portrait mode as well, which gives the background an extra level of blur to create a bokeh-style effect, commonly found on photos shot on a DSLR camera. The main sensor features dual-pixel phase detection autofocus (DPDAF) to achieve near-instant focusing times, making sure that your shots are always in focus, and focusing on the right thing, every time. </p>
<p> 4K recording at 30FPS is supported, and slow-motion recording in 720p resolution at 120FPS as well. This isn't super slow motion recording as we've become accustomed to with many 2018 flagships, and unfortunately, it's not even full-HD slow-motion either. The standard 4K recording mode is quite good though, as it has excellent dynamic range and detail levels, but doesn't offer the same rate of image stabilization that we've seen on other flagship smartphones, notably the OnePlus 6 or the HTC U12+. You'll find the camera is definitely the best found on a BlackBerry phone though, and only helps to add to the already excellent overall package found in the BlackBerry KEY2.

<p> Video: BlackBerry KEY2 Review – Security, Speed, Convenience </p>
<p> The BlackBerry KEY2 is here, and it's pretty clear that this is easily the most unique phone in 2018 by a long shot. When BlackBerry re-entered the smartphone market with its first Android-powered phones a few years ago, it became clear that the company was working to differentiate itself by offering up a more secure and private version of Android than anyone else. On top of this, it's got a physical keyboard that makes it immediately recognizable as a BlackBerry device, even at a passing glance. But it's not just the physical keyboard that makes this phone different either, it's also the speed and convenience factors found throughout the design. </p>
<p> Customization has been a big part of the Android experience from day one, and parent company TCL is taking the BlackBerry name to new heights with the KEY2, a phone that's more customizable than most other phones could even dream of. It all starts with the physical keyboard, namely the new Speed Key, which transforms the letter keys on the keyboard into a way to quickly launch any app, shortcut or action on the phone. A total of 52 shortcuts are available, with short and long-press actions available for each and every letter key on the keyboard. That's some insanely fast multi-tasking, and it's not the only way to quickly launch apps or shortcuts either. </p>
<p> Since security and privacy are more of a concern these days than ever, and it's any wonder with rogue apps that steal contact data or listen in on conversations without being asked to, so BlackBerry's has improved its DTEK software with more granular information than ever. This includes per-app permission tracking that provides full audit trails on what information has been accessed by every single app on the phone, including a timeline graph of when each permission was requested and a general look at the data accessed. There's even a way to have DTEK notify you about apps that ask for permission in the foreground or background, including the ability to specify which permissions and apps you'd like to be notified about. All this is just the beginning of what's offered on the KEY2, so be sure to check out our review video below and don't forget to subscribe to us on YouTube to get the latest as it's released! </p>

<p> Shots Fired As HBO Max Chief Pressures Amazon Over AWOL Fire TV App </p>
<p> WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar took some jabs at Amazon this week amid ongoing discussions geared at getting HBO Max onto its Fire TV devices. The statements were made during a long-form Bloomberg interview with the CEO regarding the state of the business and other related topics. </p>
<p> Specifically, Mr. Kilar was questioned about the sincerity of his statements regarding putting the consumer first. The question was asked in the context of the wider internet-based market. Namely, as something that "all the big internet companies say" even though they then conflate putting the company's interests with consumer needs. </p>
<p> The executive confirmed a belief that many companies do that when questioned about whether or not it's "bad for society." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But he went a step further too when asked to provide an example. Mr. Kilar pointed directly to Amazon. "If Amazon were truly focused just on the consumers with Fire devices," he noted, then HBO Max would be on those devices. Because that's something consumers want. </p>
<p> Why isn't HBO Max on Amazon Fire TV devices? </p>
<p> The chief executive went on to explain that there are other alternatives to Amazon's Fire TV for HBO Max. More poignantly, Mr. Kilar notes that it's going to be up to 'the Seattle folks' to make a deal happen. When HBO Max Launched, as with at least a couple of other new services, it did so without any support from Amazon. And it didn't have support from Roku either. </p>
<p> Despite that, it managed to garner over a million new users in a matter of weeks, Mr. Kilar says. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In the interim, it has struggled to gain a footing on either of those platforms. In particular, that's reportedly been the result of stalled discussions over exactly how distribution will be handled. HBO Max wants greater control while Amazon has reportedly sought to maintain its own control by launching it via Prime Video Channels. </p>
<p> Amazon stands to lose Fire TV consumers or traffic </p>
<p> But the time for leisure on Amazon's part is effectively over, according to the WarnerMedia executive. With the approach of the holiday season, not hosting HBO Max becomes a more "material situation" for viewers. Especially when they can turn to Chromecast devices or Apple TV for streaming the service directly from the respective app. </p>

<p> This is history making tonight. It's only the second time in UFC history where two unbeaten fighters have fought for a title. The last time this happened was at UFC 98, way back in May of 2009. Where Rashad Evans and Lyoto Machida faced off for the light heavyweight title. </p>
<p> Needless to say, this is sure to be an epic battle. </p>
<p> There are four other fights on the main card tonight as well. With Dominick Reyes vs Jan Blackowicz, Kai Kara-France vs Brandon Royval, Ketlen Vieira vs Sijaara Eubanks and Haleem Daodu vs Zubaira Tukhogov. </p>
<p> What time does UFC 253 start? </p>
<p> UFC 253 will technically start at 6:15pm ET with the early prelims which will be broadcast on ESPN+. </p>
<p> At 8pm ET the prelims will start, and they will move over to ESPN. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With the main card starting at 10pm ET, and that will be exclusively on ESPN+. You will also need to purchase the PPV to get the main card, which consists of five bouts this time around. </p>
<p> To purchase the PPV through ESPN+, just open the ESPN app and you should see a pop-up for buying the PPV. It'll cost you $64.99 if you are an ESPN+ subscriber and $84.99 if you are not. The $84.99 price includes a year of ESPN+ for $20 (that's the difference), which is a really incredible deal. As you'd normally be paying $5/month for ESPN+. </p>
<p> The early prelims and prelims can sometimes be entertaining, but the real fights don't start til 10pm ET when the main card starts. </p>
<p> Preliminary card </p>
<p> Early prelims </p>
<p> Juan Espino vs. Jeff Hughes </p>
<p> Khadis Ibragimov vs. Danilo Marques </p>
<p> How do I watch UFC 253? </p>
<p> UFC 253 will be available exclusively on ESPN+. You'll need to be an ESPN+ subscriber, and you also need to purchase the PPV. Otherwise, you'll only be able to watch the early prelims. </p>
<p> If you are an ESPN+ subscriber, the PPV is going to cost you $64.99. If not, you're going to need to pay $84.98, which includes the PPV as well as a year subscription to ESPN+. At $20 for the first year, that's nearly a third of what ESPN+ would normally cost you. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> UFC recently went up on the price of its PPVs by $5. Which is why it is now over $60 for the PPV. But the good thing is, there is an extra fight included with the main card now. Making it worth the extra cash. </p>
<p> With the yearly subscription to ESPN+, you are also getting access to a ton of other content. Including UFC Fight Night, which also happens once a month. Other UFC shows on ESPN+ include Dana White's Contender Series, UFC Post Shows and exclusive analysis on "Ariel and the Bad Guy". </p>

In fact, Kobe Bryant, Peyton Manning and Kevin Durant are just a few of the athletes that have their own shows on ESPN+ right now. And there are always more coming to the platform. Not to mention some live games as well. It's worth the $5 per month, though at $20 for the entire year, it makes it a steal. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And with ESPN+ you also get the ability to watch the PPV on just about any platform you wish. Whether that is Android, Android TV, Chromecast, iOS, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or Samsung and Vizio smart TVs. It's everywhere you are.

<p> How To Watch The Vice President Debate Online: Pence vs Harris </p>
<p> After President Trump and former-Vice President Joe Biden took the stage last week in their first debate, it's now time for their running mates. </p>
<p> Current Vice President Mike Pence will be debating Senator Kamala Harris in their first, and only debate of this election cycle and here's how you can watch it. And it's bound to be a good one. </p>
<p> Particularly after President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis last week. Vice President Pence has continued to test negative for the virus since then, but the Biden-Harris campaign isn't taking any chances. For the Vice President debate, there will be at least 12-feet between the two candidates, and there will also be plexiglass between them. Everyone in the audience will also be wearing a mask. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This debate should be more of a conventional debate, as you have two candidates that are actually politicians, unlike President Trump – who did famously bad in the first debate. You have a very religious Mike Pence (who tried to pray the LGBTQ community straight), and the former attorney general for the state of California, Kamala Harris. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but it should lead to a much more enjoyable debate for both sides. </p>
<p> It is taking place at the University of Utah, in Salt Lake City, Utah. There will be a limited audience. Basically limited to those that are part of the campaign. As we saw with the first debate, the two candidates' families were present, along with top campaign officials. Much smaller audience than we would normally see at a presidential debate. </p>
<p> What topics will be covered in this debate? </p>
<p> Similar to the presidential debate, the vice presidential debate will be 90 minutes long, with no commercials. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There will be nine 10-minute segments. They have not yet disclosed what topics will be covered. But you can pretty much guess that they will be similar to what Trump and Biden covered in their first debate. That includes the economy, COVID-19, civil unrest and more. </p>
<p> USA Today's Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page will be moderating this debate. As was the case with the first debate, there is only one moderator, due to COVID-19 concerns. As mentioned, the two candidates will be at least 12-feet apart, and there will be plexiglass barriers between them and the moderator. </p>
<p> Page should be a pretty good moderator for this debate. She's had a 47-year career in the industry, and has covered 10 presidential elections and six administrations. Page has also interviewed nine sitting US presidents. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What time does the debate start? </p>
<p> The debate will start at 9PM ET, and end around 10:30PM ET. It'll also be 90 minutes long and with no commercials, like the first presidential debate. </p>
<p> When the debate wraps up around 10:30PM ET, you can expect to see post-debate analysis on almost every channel that has live streamed it. The only exceptions are likely Fox, since it cuts to local news at 10PM. If you want extended analysis, then you'll want to watch cable news – CNN, MSNBC or Fox News. </p>
<p> How can I watch the Vice President debate? </p>
<p> There are many ways to watch the debate tonight. If you live in the US and have cable or an indoor antenna, you can watch the debate on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and C-SPAN. If you are using an antenna for OTA channels, then your choices are a bit more limited to ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC. But still plenty of places to watch. Since there is only one moderator, the coverage of the actual debate will be the same on every channel. The differences will be on the pre- and post-debate analysis. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you are a cord-cutter, you can watch the entire debate on YouTube. Just about every network will also live stream on YouTube, and there will be no TV login necessary to watch. </p>
<p> Those that do subscribe to any of the many streaming TV services, you'll also be in luck. </p>
<p> Sling TV </p>
<p> Sling TV costs $30 per month and does have CNN, Fox News, Fox, MSNBC and NBC included in its Sling Blue plan. You also have the ability to DVR the debate to watch later on, if you wish to do so. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can sign up for Sling TV here. </p>
<p> Hulu with Live TV </p>
<p> Another great option is Hulu with Live TV. Which costs $54.99 per month and gives you access to ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. It also includes a number of other channels, as well as the entire Hulu catalog. </p>
<p> AT&T TV Now </p>
<p> AT&T TV Now is the same price as Hulu with Live TV, and it includes 45 live TV channels. These also include ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox, Fox News, MSNBC and NBC. So you'll be able to watch the debate tonight. You can also upgrade and get more channels as well as HBO MAX included. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> FuboTV </p>
<p> This is a really great option for sports fans and costs $64.99 per month. It does have over 114 live TV channels available, as well as those that are needed to watch tonight's debate. That includes ABC, Fox, Fox News, MSNBC, but it does not have CNN, unfortunately. </p>
<p> Full debate schedule for the 2020 Presidential Election </p>
<p> There are a total of four debates for this election cycle, three presidential debates and one for the vice president candidates. Here's the full schedule: </p>
<p> First presidential debate – Tuesday, September 29 at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. </p>
<p> Vice presidential debate – Wednesday, October 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah. </p>
<p> Second presidential debate – Thursday, October 15 at Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, Florida </p>
<p> Third presidential debate – Thursday, October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee </p>

<p> Weird LG Is Back And I Couldn't Be More Excited </p>
<p> LG has a history of making some weird and quirky products, but in recent years, the company became a bit more conservative. </p>
<p> The LG G7, G8, and even the V50 and V60 smartphones were kind of cookie-cutter smartphones. They were what you'd expect from a high-end smartphone. Nothing really stood out on those devices, not even the specs. </p>
<p> Now, with the Wing, LG is looking to bring back its history of being weird. And I love it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You've seen nothing like the LG Wing </p>
<p> You've probably seen nothing like the LG Wing. That's unless you've seen the LG VX9400 from 2008, which was made for Verizon and VCAST TV (remember when that was a thing?). This is basically the 2020 version of that phone, and it looks incredible. </p>
<p> This isn't going to be a popular smartphone, it won't be the iPhone killer. And that's okay. The industry needs something different, and that is what we are getting with the LG Wing. LG is thinking outside of the box, and we welcome that kind of thinking. </p>
<p> With the Wing, you will be able to hold your phone in portrait and watch movies and videos in landscape mode. Which is pretty cool, when you think about it. As the phone kind of has a built-in handle. But that's not the best use-case for the Wing, that we've seen so far. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Use-cases for the LG Wing </p>
<p> There are a few use-cases that we've seen for the LG Wing already, and some of the best use-cases include using the larger display for navigation and the smaller 1:1 display for phone calls, or music playback. </p>
<p> As well as using it for capturing video. This is what LG really wants us to do with this smartphone. As it built a freaking gimbal into the phone. So on the smaller display, you get the controls for the camera, with the viewfinder taking up the entire main display, which is really useful. LG is not just being weird, but going back to the roots of the V-series. Making this phone for creators. Particularly with the gimbal controls that are included here. </p>
<p> Another use-case we've seen is just using multi-window here. And where LG decided to use Android's multi-window and not their own implementation, it means most apps will be supported. That was a very smart decision for LG to do with the Wing. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Why weird LG is a fun LG </p>
<p> When you're in the smartphone industry and cover nothing but smartphones everyday, for years, you get kind of bored of the same phones coming out. And let's face it, that's what we have had for the past few years. </p>
<p> All smartphones mostly look the same. Just a slab of screen, and they are getting larger. Sure we have foldables coming out now, but even those are starting to get a bit boring, and the tech isn't quite there. But LG is going in a totally different direction. </p>
<p> With LG going in this totally different direction doesn't mean it's going to be successful, but it is going to get talked about. Quite a bit. I mean look at us, we can't stop talking about it here at AndroidHeadlines. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is just the first-generation of this type of product too. Just imagine how great this is going to look after a generation or two. </p>
<p> LG has made some weird and interesting phones in the past. We talked about the VX9400 before, which is basically a dumb phone version of the Wing. But there was also the LG G5. Which was a "modular" phone. Now it didn't work out as well as LG had hoped, but it took a chance. And tried to preserve removable batteries. There was also the LG V20, which was one of the first phones to sport a second display. It sports a second ticker-like display at the top of the device, for showing notifications and such. Now that wasn't as weird as some other things LG has done, but still different. </p>
<p> We're fairly confident that the LG Wing isn't going to become a best-seller, but it shows LG is thinking outside of the box, and we're excited about what the future might hold for LG with the Explorer project. As it does have other devices launching in the Explorer Project. With at least one more coming this year. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/what-are-android-carriers" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484862" filename="what-are-android-carriers">
<p> What Are Android Carriers? Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> What are Android carriers? The short answer here, is that they are wireless carriers that offer Android smartphones or devices. Obviously the majority of wireless carriers worldwide offer Android phones, and other Android devices. </p>
<p> So the real question that we'll be answering here, is what are wireless carriers. Which is pretty simple, they offer wireless services to your device. </p>
<p> What are Android carriers? </p>
<p> While Google might sell you an Android device, you are going to need service to be able to use that device. And that's where carriers come in. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A wireless carrier is going to provide you (the user) with service for that phone – or tablet, smartwatch, laptop, or any other device. This includes talk, text and data usage. </p>
<p> Not all carriers or networks are the same, and not all Android smartphones are available on each carrier. Which is where things start to get a bit interesting. For example, Verizon carries the Moto Razr foldable, but that is not available on other carriers. T-Mobile has a slower 5G network with more coverage versus AT&T or Verizon, is another example. </p>
<p> What are postpaid Android carriers? </p>
<p> There are essentially two types of wireless carriers. One is postpaid, while the other is prepaid. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In the simplest terms, the difference between the two is that with Postpaid you pay for your usage a month after the fact. And Prepaid, you prepay, hence the term "prepaid". </p>
<p> Postpaid has some other advantages, even though it is normally a bit more expensive than prepaid. Which includes the fact that it is going to get first dibs for speed on a tower. Wireless carriers give priority to postpaid customers, then prepaid, then MVNO customers. Basically, those paying the most, will get the best speeds. </p>
<p> Normally, postpaid carriers will allow you to buy phones in a monthly installment plan. This means that instead of paying $1399 (plus tax) for the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra up front, you can spread it out over 24 or even 36 months. Making smaller payments. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Typically, postpaid customers will get features that prepaid customers do not. For example, on T-Mobile, postpaid customers on its Magenta plan can get Netflix and Quibi for free. That's a $13 value, and a ton of free content that you can watch. Over on Sprint, postpaid customers get free Hulu, Tidal and Amazon Prime, depending on their plans. </p>
<p> For carriers, postpaid customers are usually those that are not living around the line of poverty. Those users usually go for prepaid. Which means that they are less likely to default on their bill. This is why carriers prefer postpaid customers over prepaid. In addition to the fact that the profit margin is higher in postpaid. </p>
<p> In the US, postpaid carriers include AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What are prepaid Android carriers? </p>
<p> As mentioned already, prepaid carriers normally make you pay for your usage ahead of time. So you might pay on April 1 for the entire month of April, and so on. But the good thing about that is, that when you decide to leave your prepaid carrier, you won't have a big bill that is prorated. </p>
<p> Prepaid is normally used by those that don't make a lot of money. Prepaid plans are typically close to $30 per month, on average. Whereas postpaid is over $70 per month on average, for a single line. </p>
<p> With prepaid carriers, you can still get an Android phone, but what you won't get is an installment plan. So if you choose to get a Galaxy S20 from a carrier like Metro By T-Mobile, you're going to have to pay the full amount up front. Prepaid carriers do often times offer more mid-range and budget smartphones, because of the clientele that they attract. If you aren't willing to pay $70 per month for your phone service, then you likely aren't willing to pay $1000 for a new phone. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Prepaid customers don't typically earn wireless carriers a lot of money, but seeing as most are auto-pay, they do get their money when it is due. Instead of having to spend money on customer service reps chasing down customers to pay their bills. So there's good and bad, there for wireless carriers. </p>
<p> In the US, prepaid carriers include Boost Mobile, Metro By T-Mobile, Cricket Wireless, Verizon Prepaid, and AT&T Prepaid. </p>
<p> What's the difference between postpaid and prepaid? </p>
<p> The biggest difference between postpaid and prepaid is, when you pay for your usage. As mentioned, postpaid charges you at the end of the month and prepaid is at the beginning of the month. But there are a few other differences between the two. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Postpaid will get the best service. This is because you are paying more and therefore are a more valuable customer to the carrier. It also gets priority on its network. With faster speeds, and more data usage before getting slowed down. Prepaid is next, followed by MVNO carriers, in terms of data speed priority. </p>
<p> Often times you will get a better value out of postpaid plans. But if you need something cheap, that just works, then a prepaid plan is going to be better. With postpaid, carriers often throw in things like free Netflix, free Disney+ for a year, or even free Amazon Prime. As well as discounts on auto-pay. Which carriers prefer, because they know they'll get paid, and will sometimes discount up to $20 per month if you use auto-pay. </p>
<p> Another key difference is the fact that prepaid normally comes with taxes included in the price. Postpaid, normally doesn't. With the exception of T-Mobile's Magenta plan, where taxes and fees are included in the $70/month price. This means that with prepaid, you won't get bill shock. Because your bill will be exactly what it was advertised to be. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The bottom line is that if you are a heavy user (you use your phone a lot on the road or where there isn't much WiFi accessible), then postpaid is the route to go. If you work from home, or use WiFi a ton, then prepaid might be the better option, as it is cheaper and gives you lower limits for talk, text and data. </p>
<p> What is an MVNO? </p>
<p> Another term you might hear about a wireless carrier is "MVNO". Well, this is a carrier that is not owned by a major carrier like AT&T or Verizon, essentially. MVNO stands for Mobile Virtual Network Operator. </p>
<p> In the simplest explanation, an MVNO is an operator that does not own the network that it is operating on. You see, Boost Mobile does own the network it's operating on, since it works on Sprint and is owned by Sprint. But Simple Mobile does not own AT&T's network, that it operates on. Making it an MVNO. </p>
<p> Typically, an MVNO would enter into a business agreement with a mobile network operator (like AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile or Verizon) and obtains bulk access to network services at wholesale rates. You can think of it as Simple Mobile going to Costco and buying access to AT&T's network at a lower price. Then the MVNO will sell it independently to customers. </p>
<p> Normally, MVNO's do offer their own customer service, billing support systems, marketing and sales personnel. But they can also get those services from a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler or MVNE. </p>
<p> It can really get pretty confusing, but for most people, it's essentially the same as a prepaid carrier. With MVNO's you do prepay for your service, however, it is normally cheaper than prepaid carriers. For instance, Google Fi, you can get for as low as $20 per month. That's cheaper than Boost Mobile, and Cricket Wireless. </p>
<p> Here are some examples of MVNO carriers: Google Fi, Simple Mobile, Straight Talk, Consumer Cellular, FreedomPop, Republic Wireless, just to name a few. There are hundreds of MVNO's currently in service in the US. Other countries do use MVNOs, but it's mostly limited to the US, UK and Japan. </p>
<p> Can I switch wireless carriers? </p>
<p> Yes. Of course you can switch. </p>
<p> But before you do, there are a few things to think about. </p>
<p> Not all wireless carriers are interoperable. What this means is that your phone may not work on the new carrier that you are looking to switch to. For instance, a Verizon-branded phone that you bought from your Verizon store, may not work on T-Mobile. So you may need to buy a new phone when you switch. However, most phones these days do support all four carriers, but your carrier might have the SIM locked. Meaning that unless you have paid off your phone, you can't get it unlocked, and use it on another network. </p>
<p> Another thing to look at is coverage. Not all carriers have the same coverage. Depending on where you live, AT&T might have better coverage, or Sprint might be better. So it's a good idea to do your homework in that regard. </p>
<p> The third thing is to check your bill. Now that wireless contracts are mostly a thing of the past, many of us do financing plans with our carriers for our phones. Especially with phones costing $999 or more these days. So when you cancel your service with your carrier, you are going to owe the remaining amount, and it needs to be paid a lot sooner. On top of that, if you got any bill credits, you will be forfeiting those. So if you took advantage of a BOGO deal with your carrier, those bill credits will be gone, and you'll owe the remaining amount on both phones. </p>
<p> So yes, you can switch. But it's not a good idea to just wake up one morning and decide to switch from T-Mobile to Verizon. You are going to need to do some homework before you do so. But if you bought your phone outright – for example, you bought an unlocked Pixel 4 from Google – you'll likely be fine and can switch. </p>
<p> Which one has the best plans and phone selection? </p>
<p> Now it's time for the big question. Who has the best phones and the best plans? Well it really depends on what your needs are. But it's going to be postpaid for the majority of people. </p>
<p> For those that are heavy users, and want to take advantage of some of the freebies that postpaid carriers toss in, than postpaid is definitely the route to go. And if you live in a popular area like Chicago, New York City or Los Angeles, where there's a lot of people on the same network, postpaid is also going to be the best choice. as you'll be more likely to get faster and usable speeds. </p>
<p> But, if you are living paycheck to paycheck, then prepaid is a better deal. Though, prepaid isn't just for those that don't make a lot of money. If you're like me, and work from home, then prepaid can be a good way to save some money. Since people that work from home are normally on their WiFi network all the time, and are using less mobile data. If you're using only 2GB of mobile data a month, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to be paying $70 per month for an unlimited plan. </p>
<p> MVNOs are also good for those that are looking to save some cash. If you just want service, and don't want to have to think about your data usage or having to buy your phone from a specific carrier. Then yes, MVNOs are a great option. Particularly Google Fi, since it uses many networks together, and gets you the best signal in your area. </p>
<p> Now, when it comes to phone selection, postpaid carriers have the best phone selection hands down. However, most smartphone makers do sell their phones unlocked now and they do support all four wireless networks in the US (with a few exceptions, like OnePlus). Allowing you to buy a Galaxy S20+ from Samsung.com and take it to Boost Mobile, T-Mobile, Cricket Wireless, or even Straight Talk. </p>
<p> It comes down to what your needs are. Prepaid, Postpaid and MVNOs can be good for everyone. </p>

<p> What Are Android Foldables? Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> What exactly are Android foldables? To put it in as simple a form as possible, it's an Android smartphone that can fold. This article is going to be going more in-depth about what Android foldables truly are, and why they are so important. </p>
<p> As of March 2020, there are two different types of foldables, primarily. There are foldables that are clamshell style. And they look similar to the flip phones we used about a decade ago. The other style is a phone that folds out into a tablet. Two very different form-factors, from each other, let alone regular smartphones. </p>
<p> What operating system do foldables run on? </p>
<p> Currently, every foldable runs on Android. However, like with other smartphones, these do have different skins on-board. For instance Samsung's smartphones run on One UI, which is put on top of Android. And that's where all of the features really come in, for that specific form factor. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Android is a popular choice for foldable devices for one big reason. It's open. Allowing smartphone makers to use Android almost anyway they like. Google does have a few requirements, but for the most part, smartphone makers are free to do whatever they want. With smartphone makers able to use their own skins on top of Android, to add features and such for their foldables, it makes it much easier than having to build an entire operating system from scratch. Not to mention Android is hugely popular. With over 90% market share worldwide. </p>
<p> What smartphone makers are producing foldables? </p>
<p> Most smartphone makers are working on foldables as we speak, but only a couple have some that are available to purchase. However, they are not going to be easy to get a hold of, many are out of stock quite often. These include Samsung, Huawei, Royale, and Motorola. </p>
<p> Foldables are still fairly expensive, and that's because the tech is still brand new. The cheapest foldable available right now, is the Galaxy Z Flip, which is still pretty pricey at nearly $1500. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Other smartphone makers have announced that they are working on foldable smartphones like LG, ZTE, and others. Even Apple is working on a foldable, but don't expect theirs to be available anytime soon. </p>
<p> Foldables are still currently first-generation, so they are not perfect. Filled with bugs and other issues, not to mention that they can still break very easily. And are not waterproof or even water resistant. </p>
<p> What are the benefits of a foldable smartphone? </p>
<p> There are many benefits to both styles of foldable smartphones. And as this part of the market progresses, we'll likely see even more different form factors available. But let's break down the benefits by form factor. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Clamshell benefits </p>
<p> The main benefit of having a clamshell smartphone, is the ability to have a larger smartphone in a smaller footprint. This is especially important for women. As their clothes don't generally have pockets in the front and when they do, they are pretty small and not that wide. That is why the Galaxy Z Flip and the Motorola Razr are so popular right now, compared to the likes of the Galaxy Fold. </p>
<p> Now this isn't quite a benefit, but it is something that brings back some nostalgia. Being able to flip the phone close and hang up on someone. Like we could with flip phones in the 2000s and early 2010s. </p>
<p> Most clamshell phones also have small displays on the front, that can show you the time as well as your notifications. So you can see what notifications you have, without needing to flip the phone open. Which can be very helpful and conserve some battery life. </p>

<p> Smartphone to Tablet size benefits </p>
<p> There's more benefits for a foldable smartphone that can unfold into a tablet-sized device, than a clamshell. And it's all in that sentence. Imagine having a phone in your pocket, that you can then unfold when you need a larger display. To read a book, or use Google Maps and there are other use-cases too, but those can be infinitely more useful on a larger tablet like display, versus a small smartphone display. Especially since tablet displays are wider. </p>
<p> On top of that, you could get one device that replaces two devices. And this is likely going to be how tablets exist in the future. As foldables that are actually smartphones. </p>
<p> Right now, this does mean that your smartphone is going to be about twice as thick and heavy as normal. Due to the fact that it is essentially two phones, with a hinge. But it also means a much larger battery inside. And that's going to keep the phone running longer. </p>

<p> Does Android support foldables? </p>
<p> In short, yes. Google added support for foldables with Android 9 Pie in 2018. Google added even more support for foldables in Android 10, which includes better support for multi-window and multiple apps being used at the same time. It also better supports changing from the outside screen to a larger inner screen on a foldable, like the Galaxy Z Fold. Where the screen is not only a different size, but also a different aspect ratio and resolution. So it's not as simple as just redrawing the app on the second display. Which would also take more time and resources, instead of it being instant when you open the phone. </p>
<p> Google has support for App Continuity, starting with Android 10. What this means is that if you have an app open on the main display, then open your foldable smartphone, the app will open on that screen, where you left off. Samsung has already done this with the Galaxy Fold, ahead of Android 10. </p>
<p> On top of all of this, Google is also adding support for more screen aspect ratios. Since foldables could use anything from 1:1 to 21:9 and everything in between. Which would result in a much different experience, compared to the usual 16:9 or even 16:10. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Finally, Google has also added Multi-Resume in Android 10 and later. Essentially what this does is allow all apps that are currently being used in multi-window to be resumed at the same time. Prior to Android 10, only the 'active' app would resume when the phone is turned back on or opened. </p>
<p> Over the next few versions of Android, Google will continue to better support foldables as it and its partners make more foldable devices, and learn more about what consumers want from foldables. </p>
<p> What are the most popular Android foldables available? </p>
<p> Currently, there are really only three foldables that you can actually buy. Huawei does have the Mate Xs, but it's not available in many countries, and Royale's Flex Pai 2 is also limited in availability. But Samsung and Motorola offer their foldables in the US and a few other countries. And are somewhat easy to get your hands on. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Z Flip </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip is the company's second foldable smartphone, but it's first clamshell. It has a tall 6.7-inch display, which folds in half. There is a tiny, 1.1-inch AMOLED display on the front which will show you notifications, as well as the time and battery percentage. However, that small display doesn't do much more than tell you what notifications you have. You can't really archive emails, or reply to text messages from that screen. But there is a cool feature where you can use it as a viewfinder for a selfie. </p>
<p> There's a dual-camera module on the backside which sports two 12-megapixel cameras. One is a wide-angle or main sensor and the other is an ultra wide angle camera. Inside the clamshell, there is a third camera, which is a 10-megapixel sensor. The Galaxy Z Flip is powered by a 3300mAh capacity battery. Along with the Snapdragon 855+ chipset, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. </p>
<p> Retail price for the Galaxy Z Flip is $1380. </p>
<p> Motorola Razr (2019) </p>
<p> The Motorola Razr (2019) is very similar to the Galaxy Z Flip. It's also a clamshell device, that has a 6.2-inch display inside. On the outside, there is a much more usable 2.7-inch square display. Which has Motorola's very good, always-on display. Motorola was the first to do an always-on display, and still has the best. With the outside display on the Motorola Razr (2019), you're going to be able to deal with your notifications, like archiving emails. And also read them. For instance, if you get a message through WhatsApp, you can actually read the message from that outer-display and determine whether you need to respond to it now, or wait til later. </p>
<p> Internally, the Motorola Razr (2019) is running some older hardware – this is because Motorola was working on this phone for quite a few years. This includes a Snapdragon 710 chipset, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. There's also a tiny 2510mAh capacity battery. The reason for this small battery is simply, nostalgia. Motorola was trying to recreate the Razr flip phone, which was the most popular phone of the 2000s. Which was a very thin device – razor thin some might say – and that means a small battery. </p>
<p> The retail price for the Motorola Razr (2019) is about $1499 </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Fold </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Fold was one of the first foldables to get announced, and it had a rough start. The Galaxy Fold was set to go one sale in April 2019, but it was delayed almost six months, while Samsung worked on some issues with the Galaxy Fold. Which included the plastic over the screen (which literally protects the display and removing it, kills the display) as well as adding some endcaps to the hinge so that debris don't end up underneath the display. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, it is now available, and it's the most expensive model on this list. The Galaxy Fold has a 4.6-inch display on the front, and it opens up to a 7.3-inch display. Going from a small phone to a small tablet size. It also boasts six cameras. On the back, there's two 12-megapixel cameras and a 16-megapixel camera. Inside there is a 10-megapixel and a 8-megapixel camera. While the front has a 10-megapixel sensor. </p>
<p> Internally, Samsung put the best specs available at the time, in the Galaxy Fold. That includes the Snapdragon 855, 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. This is powered by a 4380mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> Retail price for the Galaxy Fold is $1980. </p>
<p> Foldables vs 'Dual Screen' smartphones </p>
<p> While some companies are doing true foldable smartphones, there are others that are simply doing "Dual Screen" smartphones. These include LG and Microsoft. And both companies are doing it a bit differently. </p>
<p> The definition of a folding phone, however, is having a single screen that can fold in half. Without any sort of bezel along the hinge. If there is a bezel in the middle of the screen, then it's a dual screen smartphone. </p>
<p> LG has made three dual screen smartphones so far. The LG V50 ThinQ 5G, V60 ThinQ 5G and G8X ThinQ. It's not a bad idea. Essentially what LG is doing here is giving you a flip case that has a screen attached to it. And when you attach it to your phone, you get a second display. Which can take multi-tasking to another level. However, the big downside here is that the phone is then much larger, thicker and heavier. But the good news is, that you can remove the case whenever you want. So there's good and bad here. </p>
<p> Microsoft's dual display smartphone, the Surface Duo, is a bit different. In fact, Microsoft is not even calling it a smartphone, just a "dual display device". It has two 5.6-inch displays that are connected by a hinge, and when you unfold it, becomes a 8.6-inch display. Now obviously, 5.6-inches plus 5.6-inches does not equal a 8.3-inch display. And this is because when it's unfolded, it is more like a square aspect ratio instead of rectangle. One of the main use cases for this is using one display as a software keyboard and the other as a monitor. Making it a very tiny, but usable laptop. The Microsoft Surface Duo isn't slated to come out until the end of 2020 though. </p>
<p> Is an Android foldable right for me? </p>
<p> Android foldables are still in their infancy. Many of these are still first-generation devices that smartphone makers and Google itself, are looking to work the kinks out of first. This is part of the reason why they are so expensive. Smartphone makers don't want these devices to be available to the masses. </p>
<p> However, if you are an early adopter and want to live on the bleeding edge, then an Android foldable is probably a good choice for you. For most people, a clamshell will be the better bet. </p>
<p> Foldables will continue to get better and better in the coming years. So if you can hold out on getting one, we'd recommend doing so. As these are going to progress pretty quickly, and it wouldn't be surprising to see successors coming less than a year after the predecessor is announced. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/what-is-5g" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484860" filename="what-is-5g">
<p> What Is 5G? Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> What is 5G? Well in the simplest of terms, it is the next evolution of the mobile network. Which is being touted as offering faster speeds and lower latency. And will be the future of just about everything. </p>
<p> However, 5G is more than just faster speeds for downloading Netflix shows, and lower latency for playing multiplayer games online. There's a lot more that it entails. In fact, there are two different types of 5G networks right now. So let's explain what exactly 5G is. </p>
<p> What is 5G? </p>
<p> It is the fifth-generation of the mobile network. Following on from 1G, 2G, 3G and 4G. It is essentially a straight upgrade from 4G LTE. Instead of an entirely new system (like 4G LTE was, coming from 3G). Which is going to make the build-out go faster. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are essentially three aspects that we need to remember. It is going to bring bigger channels that will give you faster data. As well as lower latency so it is more responsive. And it will give users the ability to connect a lot more devices at once, without slowing down the network. Think of smart home devices, sensors, autonomous cars, etc. </p>
<p> Right now, the actual 5G radio system, which is known as 5G-NR, isn't the same as 4G. However, all 5G devices need this, for now, in the US. That is because it needs 4G to make the initial connections, before trading up to 5G where it's available. This is often referred to as "non-standalone" or NSA. Now later this year, carriers will rolling out standalone 5G networks, so that they won't need 4G coverage to work. </p>
<p> However, 5G smartphones will still support 4G LTE networks for the foreseeable future. As 5G is nowhere near available everywhere, and phones will need to fallback onto 4G so you don't lose coverage entirely. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What is the difference between Sub-6 and mmWave 5G? </p>
<p> There are technically three layers of 5G: low-band, mid-band and high-band. But it is commonly referred to just two types. Either Sub-6 or mmWave. </p>
<p> Sub-6 is referring to the use of spectrum that is below 6GHz. That would include mid and low-band spectrum. This is the type of 5G that most carriers around the world are starting off with. However, Verizon is starting with mmWave or millimeter wave, which is short-range, high-frequency network technology. </p>
<p> The main differences between the two is that with Sub-6, you get better coverage and slower "5G speeds". While mmWave gives you a lot less coverage, but blazing fast 5G speeds, we're talking Gigabit per second speeds. Meanwhile Sub-6 is just a bit faster than 4G LTE, depending on the area. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The idea here is to mix both Sub-6 and mmWave networks together. Giving you the coverage that is needed, along with the speed and capacity that is needed. Verizon will likely be the first carrier to do this, as it plans to launch its Sub-6 network in late 2020. However, because Verizon is doing mmWave first, we're seeing more "special" versions of 5G phones made specifically for Verizon. Since others are going with Sub-6 first. </p>
<p> So if you're wondering why T-Mobile 5G is slower than Verizon 5G, that is why. And this is also why T-Mobile covers most of the US, while Verizon is still street corners and some full streets – and it also doesn't work indoors, yet. </p>
<p> What devices run on 5G networks? </p>
<p> The first 5G smartphones started launching in 2019. With Samsung, LG, Motorola and OnePlus being among the first to launch 5G devices. However, in 2020, they have become a lot more prevalent. Mostly because of Qualcomm. Getting a bit off topic here, but Qualcomm's flagship chipset – the Snapdragon 865 – is only available with a 5G modem. Meaning that if smartphone makers want the best silicon available, they need to add 5G support too. This makes carriers happy, but it unnecessarily raises the prices on flagship phones, even more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So in 2020, the entire Galaxy S20 lineup is 5G capable in the US. There are also a number of other devices that work with 5G. As of right now, these are the best 5G devices available. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra is one of the most expensive Android smartphones (that doesn't fold) and it's sort of worth it. This one sports a 6.9-inch Quad HD+ AMOLED display, the Snapdragon 865 chipset, 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It also has a massive 5000mAh capacity battery inside. Which, is needed for 5G, as it can really drain the battery. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This smartphone is available from all four US carriers, and from Samsung.com. It also works on all of the 5G networks in the US, even Verizon's mmWave network. </p>
<p> LG V60 ThinQ </p>
<p> The LG V60 ThinQ is actually one of the cheaper smartphones you can get with 5G capability. This one comes in at around $700 – or $900 if you get it with the dual display. This is a high-end device, with a 6.7-inch FHD+ OLED display. It has the Snapdragon 865 chipset inside, with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage available. It also has a 5000mAh capacity battery which worked really well while we were reviewing it. </p>
<p> LG V60 ThinQ is also compatible with all of the networks in the US, and is available from all of the carriers. But it is not available unlocked, unfortunately. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> OnePlus 8 </p>
<p> Then there is the OnePlus 8, which is a bit more complicated. There is an unlocked OnePlus 8 that works on T-Mobile's network. And then a Verizon-exclusive model that works on its network. However the unlocked model does not work on AT&T or Sprint, at least not yet. It could in the future though. It's just a matter of them certifying it. </p>
<p> This smartphone comes with a 6.55-inch FHD+ OLED 90Hz display, with the Snapdragon 865 chipset inside, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. You can also spend another $100 and get the 12GB/256GB model here. This is all powered by a 4300mAh capacity battery. </p>
<p> What are the benefits of 5G? </p>
<p> The main benefit of 5G is going to be speed and capacity. One of the big issues that some carriers – like Verizon for example – are having with 4G LTE right now, is that they have too many connections on their network. This happens when you are the largest carrier in the country. But with 5G, that won't be an issue. As it will be able to handle more connections without affecting the speed of the network. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But the big selling point for everyone is going to be the speed. We've all seen those speed tests that get over a Gigabit per second download. That's cool and is great for downloading Netflix movies real quick before jumping on a plane. But the real-world applications for 5G won't be around until at least 2022. Similar to the real-world applications for 4G LTE. </p>
<p> With 5G, autonomous cars are going to be able to run entirely off of the network. Instead of needing to have a computer in the car, it can all be done in the cloud. This is due to the latency being almost non-existent. Which means it can send instructions down to the car instantly. </p>
<p> Another big use-case is going to be on-board storage for your smartphone. That could be a thing of the past. And keep all of your data in the cloud. With data being accessed instantly, we may only need enough storage on our phones for the actual operating system. This would take the Nexbit Robin to an all-new level. </p>
<p> Finally, perhaps the use-case that is going to be the most popular is, high-quality video chat. Right now, mobile video chat is still pretty low-resolution. We're taking maybe 720p on most phones. Though the Galaxy S20 range does have 1080p quality. With 5G, you'll be able to do this in 4K, without any sort of buffering at all. </p>
<p> How do I know if 5G is available in my area? </p>
<p> The easiest way to know if 5G is available in your area is to pop your SIM card into a 5G device. Now obviously, not everyone has a 5G device laying around like I do. So the next bet is to check out the coverage maps for your carrier. But these are not always updated quickly. So 5G might be available in your area, even if the coverage map hasn't been updated yet. </p>
<p> T-Mobile covers the majority of the US with its Sub-6 5G network right now. Sprint has its mid-band network available in about 10 cities and it's being refarmed to work with T-Mobile's network, since their merger has now completed. Verizon and AT&T are a bit more scattered. Verizon, you will really want to take a look at the coverage map. As they do cover a number of markets, but the coverage in those markets are very limited. We're talking just a couple of streets. </p>
<p> Is 5G the same as 5G E? </p>
<p> No. </p>
<p> 5G E is a marketing term that AT&T is using on its 4G LTE devices, and it means "5G Evolution". It is not 5G. 5G E is simply 4G LTE with a new icon. Which is why you'll see that the speeds on 5G E are still painfully slow. </p>
<p> It's very misleading by AT&T to add this to their smartphones, and they have actually had a few lawsuits brought against them for doing this. </p>
<p> AT&T is actually beginning to remove 5G E from its smartphones in the next few weeks, as it has given up on this false advertising, after plenty of backlash. </p>
<p> Will 5G affect my health? </p>
<p> Also no. </p>
<p> While there are many conspiracy theorists running around saying that 5G caused Coronavirus, and will affect your health. There has been no proof of that being the case. </p>
<p> Remember, that it is not using new radio frequencies. In fact the low and mid-band networks are using frequencies that have been used for decades. While low-band uses UHF TV bands, and those have been used since 1952. </p>
<p> But the biggest worries with 5G and your health, is around the high-band, mmWave. This is short-range frequencies that require a lot of small cell sites. It's new, but common sense will tell you that it won't fry your brain cells. </p>
<p> And the reason for that is because mmWave is just too weak. If you have used Verizon's mmWave network, then you know what we mean. If the wind blows the wrong way, you'll be knocked off of the mmWave network. So no, it is nowhere near strong enough to fry your brain cells. And the best thing here is that it's so ironic. </p>
<p> On top of all of this, there have been multiple studies showing that it won't cause any damage to your health. And this is why it's important not to believe everything you read on the internet. </p>
<p> When will I be able to use 5G everywhere? </p>
<p> It'll be a few years before it is available everywhere. If we look at the timeline for 4G LTE, it really wasn't available everywhere until around 2014 or 2015. And even then, many that lived in the middle of nowhere, had trouble finding 4G LTE. </p>
<p> Now, while it is true that the use of more low-band frequencies means that carriers can build this out faster than 4G LTE, it doesn't necessarily mean that it will be built faster in the long run. </p>
<p> If you want to buy a 5G device to be future proof, it is still going to be wise to wait a year or two. As the modems that we currently have are still not that mature. Qualcomm, Intel and others are going to be working to improve the modems, so they use less battery and are more efficient. And since we are in the early stages still, things are going to progress pretty quickly. </p>
<p> The short answer is, don't expect these networks to really be vastly available until at least 2022, if not later. And of course, this still depends on your carrier and where you live. </p>
<p> However, once the 5G dream becomes a reality, we may no longer see traditional ISPs. As the 5G dream is about replacing your home internet. Since 5G is going to be much faster than your traditional WiFi. But that is still many years down the line, still. </p>

<p> What Is Android Mobile? Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> What is Android mobile? Basically, it is the operating system that runs on your smartphones and tablets. This article is going to go more in-depth about what Android mobile really is. </p>
<p> There are really only two mobile operating systems out there: Android and iOS. There are still some companies that are using proprietary software for some phones (mainly flip phones), but for the most part, there are only two options. </p>
<p> Android is of course, Google's option. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What devices run Android mobile? </p>
<p> For the most part, smartphones and tablets run Android mobile. Most smartphone makers are using Android – with the exception of Apple – for their smartphones. So as long as you don't have an iPad or iPhone, you most likely have Android mobile on your device. </p>
<p> Samsung uses Android for the majority of their smartphones and tablets. Though there are a few tablets that run Microsoft's Windows, as well as a few smartphones that run Samsung's own proprietary Tizen operating system. </p>
<p> What are the benefits of Android mobile? </p>
<p> One of the main benefits to using Android mobile is the flexibility of the operating system. Android mobile allows for almost endless customization. And that also means that smartphone makers can customize the operating system to their liking. Don't like your home screen? You can download a launcher to change it. Don't like Google keyboard (and its terrible name, "Gboard")? You can download a new keyboard to use, like Swiftkey. These are just some of the customization features that Google offers. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Since Android runs on over 75-percent of smartphones in the world, it means that if your next smartphone is not from the same company as your current smartphone (i.e. you have a LG G6 now, and you upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy Note 10), it won't be a huge difference in the experience, since it is running the same software at its core. Which would be Android. </p>
<p> For users, there are millions of apps available to download from the Google Play Store. No matter what you're looking for, there is most likely an app for that. In fact, there are probably several apps for that. The Google Play Store (starting with Android 10) will also push out platform updates for your device. Making it easier to update your smartphone or tablet and keep it up to date. </p>
<p> There are many features that Android has that just makes using your smartphone much easier. Like Quick Settings. Instead of it being a swipe up gesture like on iOS, it's in the notification pull-down. Making it easier to check notifications and turn off WiFi or adjust the brightness. These are also customizable. So if you don't need the location toggle, you can get rid of it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Android also has dark mode. This has been available in Android 9 Pie for a little while, but Google made it system-wide in Android 10 (released in 2019). If you toggle on dark mode or "night mode" you'll get a darker interface, which is not only better on the eyes but better on your smartphone's battery. Many apps are now updating for dark mode too. </p>
<p> If you've ever missed a moment because it took to long to open your camera, well Android has solved that. Double-tapping your power button will automatically open the camera. So that you won't miss that moment. Really important for those with kids. </p>
<p> These are just some of the very many features that Android has. Google is constantly making new features and improving the features it already has, to make life easier. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What are Android "skins"? </p>
<p> Android "skins" or more commonly known as "overlays", are an overlay that a manufacturer can put on top of Android on their device. Think of Android mobile as the cake and the overlay is the frosting. </p>
<p> For instance, Samsung has One UI. It has undergone a few name changes over the years, and now it's simply One UI. With this overlay, Samsung decided to push a lot of the buttons and controls towards the bottom of the phone. This was to meet the demand of displays getting larger and larger. Which in-turn makes it tougher and tougher to actually use them one-handed. Samsung also has a number of its own features backed into One UI, which you won't find in Android. That includes things like Air Gestures for the S Pen, a recycle bin in the gallery, to name a few. </p>
<p> Though, many prefer OnePlus' Oxygen OS. This is a mostly stock Android overlay, that has a few features added in. OnePlus has decided to just add to Android, instead of trying to make it look hugely different. With Oxygen OS, you do get even more customization features, like theming that is available system-wide. There's also an "App Locker" which will lock away apps with sensitive data in them, so when you hand your phone to people, they don't see that data. It's also a very fast overlay, compared to Google's Android. This is due to OnePlus removing a lot of the animations that Google has included. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are other skins out there too. Huawei's Emotion UI or EMUI is also a pretty heavy skin like Samsung's One UI. LG has its own overlay called LG UX now. It's also fairly heavy, and not that great. Motorola, ASUS and ZTE have all adopted a more stock-like skin for their smartphones, similar to Oxygen OS, but even lighter. </p>
<p> How do I know if I have the latest version of Android mobile? </p>
<p> To check and see what version of Android mobile you're running, head into the Settings of your smartphone. Scroll down to "About Phone" and then scroll down to the section that shows the software status. Depending on the phone you're using, you may have to tap on "Software Info" or something similar to get this information. </p>
<p> As of right now, the latest version of Android is Android 10. It was released on September 3, 2019. Chances are, your device is not running that version of Android though. Seeing as manufacturers are typically pretty slow (compared to iOS) in pushing updates to new versions of Android. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google has started releasing developer previews of Android 11, available for Google Pixel smartphones. Android 11 is slated to be available for everyone starting in Q3 2020. Going by recent history, that likely means a late August/early September release. </p>
<p> Google usually releases a new version of Android each year. With the first beta coming out around February/March. Google will release a new beta almost every month (usually released in the first week of each month) until the final version is released around August/September. It has typically been released around mid-August, but Android 10 was a bit later. Releasing on September 3, 2019. </p>
<p> What are the most popular Android devices? </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus </p>
<p> The most popular Android smartphone right now is the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus. It is also one of the more expensive smartphones. Coming in at a price of $1099. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung is well-known for putting cutting-edge tech into its flagship smartphones, and that is the case with the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. It's one of the most powerful smartphones on the market right now, with a huge and beautiful display to match it. </p>
<p> You can find out more about the Galaxy Note 10 Plus by reading our review. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S10 </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S10 was the most popular smartphone until it released the Galaxy Note 10 Plus in August. It's still pretty popular though, and it's cheaper than the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. </p>
<p> It doesn't have as many features as the Galaxy Note 10 Plus, largely because it does not feature the S Pen. But still a very impressive smartphone. You can find the Galaxy S10 for around $899 on Amazon. </p>
<p> You can read more about the Samsung Galaxy S10 in our review. </p>
<p> Google Pixel 3a </p>
<p> Now, the Google Pixel 3a is actually pretty popular for a reason that does not apply to the Galaxy Note 10 Plus or Galaxy S10. It's price tag. The Pixel 3a is actually a very affordable smartphone, coming in at under $479 (depending on the size you choose). But still offering the same performance and features of a flagship like the Pixel 3. </p>
<p> It has been very popular because you're getting an amazing camera for about half the price of a flagship smartphone. You can find the Pixel 3a on Amazon for $399 (or $479 for the Pixel 3a XL). </p>
<p> You can read more about the Google Pixel 3a in our review. </p>
<p> AOSP (Android Open Source Project) vs Google's Android mobile </p>
<p> There are actually two versions of Android mobile. There's Android Open Source Project or AOSP, and then there's Google's Android. </p>
<p> Google's Android includes GMS or Google Mobile Services. That's what brings all of Google's services into Android. Like the Play Store, Gmail, Chrome, etc. Manufacturers can use either version of Android, but Google's version is the better bet. </p>
<p> The big reason for Google's Android being better is because manufacturers get earlier access to the code, as well as help from Google in getting Android working on their smartphones and tablets. It also gets all of Google's services, which are ubiquitous around the world. And if you're looking to sell a smartphone, you're going to need Google's services, or its dead in the water. With the exception of selling it in China. </p>
<p> AOSP exists still, because Google wanted to make an open source mobile platform that anyone can use. And that is still true in 2019. Even though Google's Android is the better version to use, as it has all the bells and whistles, anyone can use AOSP and not even need to use Google Mobile Services on their devices. Amazon is one of those that does use AOSP without Google's apps and services. </p>
<p> Is Android the best fit for me? </p>
<p> To be honest, you likely already have a smartphone running Android. About 75-percent of smartphones around the world are running Android right now, meaning that you are very likely to be using one to read this article. </p>
<p> Is is the best fit for you? Well that really depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for the best software Google has to offer, then Android is going to be the best for you. Even though all of Google's apps are also available on iOS, they don't integrated into the phone as well as they do on Android. </p>
<p> iOS is really the only other choice when it comes to smartphone operating systems right now, even though there are others trying to take a slice of the market share. </p>

<p> What Is The Android System? Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> What is the Android System? Essentially, it’s everything that is included in Android Open Source Project, which is available for anyone to use. </p>
<p> The Android System is pretty much just the core of the operating system that’s on your Android phone. Think of it as the skeleton of what’s running on your smartphone. And One UI, Oxygen OS and others as the skin of that skeleton. After all, they are called skins anyways. </p>
<p> Now, if you want to know what Android is all about, you can read this. In this article, we'll be going far more in-depth about what the Android System actually is. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What are Google Core Services? </p>
<p> The Google Core Services, which are actually called Google Mobile Services, houses all of the Google apps and underlying services that are included in your Android device. This is not bundled with AOSP, and is only part of the Android System if Google has certified the device. </p>
<p> For instance, Huawei smartphones use Android, but they are not certified by Google and therefore do not have Google services. </p>
<p> Apps that are included in Google Mobile Services include: Gmail, Chrome, Drive, Duo, Play Store, YouTube, YouTube Music, Maps and Photos. These are all pre-installed on any Google-certified Android device. There are other Google apps available, but these are pre-installed on every single device that Google has certified. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now under-the-hood, there’s even more. Mostly, Google Play Services. This is the underlying software that works with Google to bring all of its services to your smartphone. It’s basically the glue that holds everything together, with your Google account. </p>
<p> What is Google Play Services? </p>
<p> To put it simply, Google Play Services is a background service that runs on any Android device that has been certified by Google. </p>
<p> This helps Google push out updates to devices too, helping with its much documented fragmentation issue. It won’t send you new versions of Android. But any crucial changes being made to APIs and such, can be updated using Google Play Services. And Google is able to update all Android devices at the same time, via this method. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It also helps integrate advanced functionalities with other apps. Google Play services is an API for developers that developers can use to enhance communication between apps. There are a number of other API’s included in Google Play Services, that can help aid a user. </p>
<p> Some of the APIs included in Google Play Services include: Google Maps API, Location APIs, Google Drive API, Google Play Game Services, Google+ platform, Google Cast Android API, and Google Mobile Ads. Thanks to all of this being included in a single service, users are also able to adjust what information each of these APIs have access to, from the Google app on their Android device. </p>
<p> What features are included in the Android System? </p>
<p> Every year, with every new version of Android, Google gives users many new features. Some are user-facing features and some are not. But there are a good amount of features that are included in the Android System that are worth learning more about. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Keep in mind that these features are part of Android as a whole. Which means that any Android smartphone that has a skin on it – from OnePlus, LG, Samsung, and others – will have these features. These are the core features that might be used as building blocks for other manufacturers. </p>
<p> Gesture Navigation </p>
<p> Google introduced Gesture Navigation with Android 9 Pie back in 2018, and has refined them every year since. The idea behind Gesture Navigation is to make it easier to use these phones. With smartphones getting larger and larger every single year. </p>
<p> With Gesture Navigation, you get more screen real estate, as you don't have the buttons at the bottom of the screen. The basic set of gestures include swiping up from the bottom to go home. Swiping up and pausing to open up your recent apps. And swiping in from the left or right to go back. To get to the Google Assistant, you can swipe in from the bottom left or right corners. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While Google does force all of its partners to use its own Gesture Navigation, partners aren't limited to just offering Google's option. Samsung, for example, offers their own gestures, along with Google's, on its latest devices. Giving users the ultimate choice of which gesture navigation they prefer. </p>
<p> Dark Mode </p>
<p> One of the most popular features in Android in recent years, has been Dark Mode. Google had went through a period where it made the entire operating system bright, with loads of white space. Which is fine and all, but when you're using your phone in the dark – like in bed or at night – that white space can really blind your eyes. And that's where dark mode comes in. </p>
<p> With Dark Mode, you can make the entire operating system dark. Now dark mode in the Android System does not use true black, instead it's a dark gray most of the time. Though partners are able to adjust this for their phone smartphones, and Samsung does use a true black for its dark mode. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All smartphones running Android 10 or later have support for Dark Mode. It's a feature that Google has forced all of its partners to use on its smartphone. </p>
<p> Multi-Window Mode </p>
<p> With smartphones getting larger and larger, Multi-Window Mode is getting more and more popular. As this allows you to have two apps on the screen at once. This feature is particularly useful with foldables. </p>
<p> Having two apps open at once can be very useful. For example, if you are looking for directions while you're walking around San Francisco, but also want to catch up on Twitter, you can have both of those open on your screen at the same time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung was actually first to do multi-window, with the Galaxy Note smartphones. But Google since then added it to the Android System. </p>
<p> In recent years, there's been some changes to multi-window mode, making it even more useful. Which is picture-in-picture. This works in apps like YouTube, Netflix and Google Maps. Allowing you to keep watching a video, while you're in another app. With Google Maps, it means you can still have navigation open while you're checking your email or doing something else. </p>
<p> Digital Wellbeing </p>
<p> Many of us spend way to much time on our smartphones these days. Which is why Android now has Digital Wellbeing. This lets you know just how much time you're spending on your phone everyday, and breaks it down by app. </p>
<p> But, Digital Wellbeing is more than just telling you how much time you're spending on Twitter. It's also a set of tools to help you use your phone less. Digital Wellbeing can set a limit on screen time, and also help you wind down faster when getting into bed. </p>
<p> Initially, Digital Wellbeing was only for Pixel devices, but it is now part of the Android System and is included in non-Pixel smartphones as well. And while it might seem like a silly feature to include, it's very vital in today's world. </p>
<p> What security and privacy features are included? </p>
<p> Android has many security features built into the system. Google has been at the forefront of offering enhanced security for its over 2.5 billion users. And are introducing new measures, behind-the-scenes to make the Android System as safe as possible. </p>
<p> This includes protecting users from downloading malware with Google Play Protect, protecting users from exploits with monthly security updates and even using a secure lock screen so that thieves can't get into your phone as easily. </p>
<p> Google Play Protect </p>
<p> Google Play Protect is a service that mostly runs behind-the-scenes. It is part of the Android System since it is built into Android, but it only works on devices that have Google certification. </p>
<p> One of its primary features is to check out the apps and games that you are downloading from the Play Store. To ensure that you are not downloading anything that could be malicious. It scans and verifies over 50 billion apps every single day. Instead of only scanning apps when they are uploaded to the Play Store, Google scans them when you download them as well. To make sure that nothing fishy happens. </p>
<p> It also includes Safe Browsing Protection in Chrome, which will keep you from entering some fishy websites, or those that aren't secure. It will show you a red screen telling you the website is unsafe and telling you to go back. But you can still proceed if you know the site is safe. </p>
<p> The last major feature of Google Play Protect is, Find My Device. With this feature, you can open up your laptop and sign into your Google account to find out where your phone is. It'll be shown on a map, so you can see if you left it at home, or possibly at your significant other's house. It also allows you to lock the device, ring the device, and even show a message on the device. So if someone finds it, they know who to return it too. Now, if you think its lost for good, you can erase all of your data from it too, all done remotely. </p>
<p> Monthly Security Updates </p>
<p> The Android System does also get monthly security updates, the first Monday of each month Google releases them. These are typically small OTA updates, that mostly patch exploits found in the software. By updating smartphones every single month with patches for these exploits, users are safer than ever before. So they don't have to worry about someone gaining access to their phone from a text message. </p>
<p> Google pushes these updates to the Pixel lineup every single month. Other manufacturers have different schedules. But for the most part, most smartphones get a security update once a quarter (about every three months). So instead of getting more frequent small updates, you're getting less frequent larger updates. </p>
<p> Secured Lock Screen </p>
<p> Starting with Android 7.0 Nougat, all smartphones have support for hardware secured lockscreen. This means a fingerprint sensor, for the most part. With the exception of the Pixel 4 series which just uses face unlock. </p>
<p> This is all part of the Biometrics API that Google released with Android Nougat – it was the Fingerprint API, then updated to Biometrics API with the addition of Face Unlock on the Pixel 4 in 2019. This API can be used by apps for authentication, which is safer than a password, as only you have your fingerprint, or face. </p>
<p> It works for lock screens, to secure all of your data, but also for other apps. Like password managers and banking apps. </p>
<p> How do I get updates for the Android System? </p>
<p> Google controls the Android System, and usually puts out one major update each year. Usually the update goes out around August or September. With the early betas starting back in February or March. </p>
<p> Once Google releases the code for the new version of Android, it is sent to AOSP and also sent to its partners. These partners include Samsung, LG, Xiaomi and others. Their partners then begin getting the new version of Android working on their existing smartphones. And integrated in with their skin and other software. </p>
<p> In recent years, Google has been giving its partners the code early for upcoming versions of Android. Which allows the updates to come out sooner for non-Pixel smartphones. </p>
<p> Prior to Android 10, Google named each version of Android after a dessert. Going from Cupcake to Pie. The first two versions did not receive a dessert name, as they were Alpha and then beta. Starting with Android 1.5 Cupcake, Google began using desserts for their names. Which helped Android stand out, and made it easier to remember what version of Android you were on. Google even did a brand deal with Nestle for Android 4.4 KitKat, which rolled out Android-shaped KitKat bars. </p>
<p> The only thing a user can do to get a new Android system update would be to head into the settings. Then tap on About Phone, tap on System Updates and finally “Check for new Update”. </p>
<p> What is the Android System? </p>
<p> Well, basically, the Android System is basically the skeleton of the operating system that is on your smartphone. Google creates the skeleton and its partners create the skin, which results in what Android has become today. Many features that are part of the Android System came from partners like Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, OnePlus and others. All of which have made Android better with each passing year. </p>
<p> There's a lot of things happening behind-the-scenes in the Android System. So the next time you see "Android System" in your battery stats and wonder why, well that's why. A lot of things are happening without you noticing it happening. And that's actually a good thing. </p>

<p> What Is Google Play Store? Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> What is Google Play Store? Well, from the mobile standpoint, it’s an app, though it’s actually a platform. So, it’s essentially far more than that, which is something we’ll get down to in a minute. In this article, we’ll talk about the Google Play Store, and try to answer quite a few questions, most of which are quite basic. That is the point of this article, to share as much information about Google’s Play Store platform as possible. So, let’s get started. </p>
<p> What is Google Play Store? </p>
<p> So, what is Google Play Store? As mentioned in the introduction, it’s a platform. It’s Google’s platform for offering various digital content to its consumers. Contrary to what some people may think, the Google Play Store is not just an app store, not at all. You will find all sorts of content available here. The Google Play Store is home to music, movies, books, and games… in addition to your regular Android applications. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google is offering a huge collection of music from all around the world, though that requires a subscription, or a one-time payment, as you can digitally purchase content. Movies and books are available to purchase, while there are tons of free apps and games available. Some of those apps / games require payment, some do not, but everything is clearly stated in app listings. </p>
<p> Do all Android smartphones come with Google Play Store pre-installed? </p>
<p> No, they do not. The Google Play Store is pre-installed on smartphones that ship with Google Mobile Services (GMS). Granted, those are the vast majority of phones out there, and the vast majority of phones you can purchase. We are talking about Android as a platform here, and Android is open-sourced. It’s free to use, and manufacturers are not forced to pre-installed Google Mobile Services if they don’t want to, not at all. </p>
<p> Consumers are used to Google Mobile Services, which include a number of pre-installed apps by Google. For that reason, pretty much every smartphone manufacturers which sells Android phones will pre-installed. There are some exceptions, though. Huawei, once of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world is banned from pre-installing GMS on its phones by the US. There’s a long story behind it, but that was the case at the time of writing this article. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What sort of content can be found on the Google Play Store? </p>
<p> The Google Play Store is home to not only apps and games, but some additional digital content as well. You can find movies, books, and music in the Play Store. Google basically launched the Play Store as a hub for its users to get all sorts of digital content. The main content would probably be apps and games, as the Play Store was mainly launched for Android smartphones. The service grew quite a bit since then, though. </p>
<p> Many people are using the Play Store to get access to the newest music in the market, or get a book to read. Movies are still quite pricey, at least in the vast majority of regions, but that is an option as well. From this point on, the Google Play Store library can only grow further, and who knows, Google may even add TV shows to the mix at some point. The service has been around since late 2008, though it wasn’t called the Google Play Store at first. More on that later, though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Do I have to download apps from the Google Play Store if it’s pre-installed? </p>
<p> Google recommends that you download all your Android applications from the Play Store, especially if it comes pre-installed. The company does its best to vet all the apps that are submitted to the Play Store. In other words, the company tries to make sure that no malware makes its way to the store. The Google Play Store is not the only source to download Android applications, though. </p>
<p> We’ll talk about that in the next paragraph. But before that, let’s just say that the vast majority of users should use the Play Store, and only the Play Store. If you opt to use a third-party store, you should use a legit one. If you sideload Android applications, you should also use a source that is reliable. Otherwise you could get malware in the package with an app you’re getting, and that’s certainly something you want to avoid. </p>
<p> What are Google Play Store alternatives? </p>
<p> There are actually quite a few stores that come to mind. Huawei’s AppGallery is the company’s very own app store, while Samsung has its app store for Android applications as well. There is the Amazon app store as well, while some other smartphone manufacturers offer their own iterations as well. Now, there are some legit Android applications out there that are not available via the Play Store. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The main reason for that is because they’re breaking the rules, even though those specific apps are not dangerous. Some of them are allowing you to access features Google is blocking, like playing YouTube videos in the background, for example. Good examples of such app stores are F-Droid and XDA Labs. You’ll find a ton of interesting apps there, apps that are not available in the Play Store. The best of all, those apps have been vetted for security issues as well. </p>
<p> What about sideloading? </p>
<p> Well, sideloading is also an alternative to the Play Store, kind of. If you really want to get the latest version of an Android app that you know is out, but it still did not arrive to your phone, you can always sideload it. Or if you want to install an app that is not available in your region, and thus not visible in the Play Store. You can download the .APK file (Android app file), and install manually on your device. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The procedure is quite simple, as all you have to do is install it, enable your phone to install apps from unknown sources, and that’s it. Just make sure to download those .APKs from sources you trust. The best way to go about it is to visit APKMirror. That website has been around for a long time, and it always verifies signatures for specific Android applications. This is also a great way to get alpha and beta versions of some applications, if you want. </p>
<p> How do I update apps via the Google Play Store? </p>
<p> Updating applications via the Play Store is really simple, and you need to do that via your smartphone This is not even something you have to do manually, as your phone is set by default to update apps automatically. It will do so when you’re connected to Wi-Fi, and check if new updates are available automatically as well. If you’d like to keep it that way, you don’t have to do anything. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If, for some reason, you’d like to update manually, that is an option. Perhaps you’d like to see the changelog before updating, or something of the sort. First, you’ll need to go to the Play Store options on your phone, and disable automatic updates. Your phone will let you know when an update is available, if you do this, after which you can navigate to the hamburger menu of the Play Store, hit ‘My apps & games’ option, and you’ll see what updates are available. Alternatively, you can hit the notification that let you know updates are available. </p>
<p> How do I uninstall apps via the Google Play Store? </p>
<p> Chances are you already know how to uninstall apps from the app drawer, or your phone’s settings. Well, you can uninstall them via the Google Play Store as well. They can be uninstalled from the same menu that you’d use to update your apps. So, you need to open the app, open the hamburger menu on the left, and then hit the ‘My apps & games’ option. There you’ll see three tabs at the top, Updates, Installed, and Library. </p>
<p> You need to aim for the ‘Installed’ tab, where you can see all your installed apps. You can either open an app from here, or tap on it to be able to uninstall it. This will essentially do the same thing you’d do directly from your phone’s settings or the app drawer. You can even sort apps here to see which ones you’ve installed most recently, check out their reviews, check out how much phone storage your apps take up, and so on. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Does Google Play Store support a dark theme? </p>
<p> Yes, the Google Play Store does support a dark theme. It was first made available to Android 10 users only, in 2019. In March 2020, Google pushed it to everyone, basically. There is a physical switch in the Play Store settings. Once you enter settings, you will see the ‘Theme’ menu. Tap it, and there you’ll be able to select System default, Dark, or Light themes, depending on your preference. </p>
<p> The Google Play Store dark theme is now pitch black. It follows Google’s design from its other apps. Google opted to use a really dark gray color here, not exactly black. That’s Google’s choice, and it works, though perhaps it would be a better idea to go all black. It is what it is, though, at least there are options. </p>
<p> Can I uninstall Google Play Store from my phone? </p>
<p> Well, chances are you cannot. If the Google Play Store app came pre-installed on your phone, it’s quite possible that the device won’t let you uninstall it. You can do it if you root your phone, and get admin privileges by doing so, but that’s about it. That goes only if you’ve purchased a phone that is not pre-rooted or something of the sort. If it’s second-hand, it is possible that someone already messed with it. </p>
<p> If you root your phone, you’ll be able to remove the Play Store, but that’s not exactly recommended. Before you do, however, make sure you have another app store on hand, so that you can download applications. That is not a requirement, but it sure is recommended, so that you don’t have to manually download them from the APK Mirror website, or something of the sort. </p>
<p> How does Android Market relate to the Google Play Store? </p>
<p> Android Market = Google Play Store. Confused? Well, the Google Play Store was initially called the Android Market. Back then it launched, in October 2008, it was called Android Market. Back then, only applications and games were available via that app. </p>
<p> Google opted to rename the service years later, in 2012, when it started adding music, books, and so on. It considered that to be a more appropriate term, and that’s probably true, as it’s not focused on Android only. </p>
<p> Are non-Android apps available via the Google Play Store? </p>
<p> No, they’re not. The Google Play Store contains applications for the Android system only. As already mentioned, other content is available, but as far as applications and games are concerned, only Android is supported. You can utilize music, movies, and books on other platforms, though. Chances are that this will not happen, as the Play Store has been made mainly for Android. </p>
<p> How many applications are there in the Google Play Store? </p>
<p> As of March 2020, there are over 2.8 million applications available in the Google Play Store. At one point, the Play Store was home to over 3.5 million apps, but that changed in the summer of 2018. Google has decided to remove large quantities of applications from the Play Store at that point. Why? Well, mostly due to an updated version of the company’s Developer Policy. When the company did that, the number of apps dropped from over 3.5 million, to just over 2.5 million. Since then, however, the Play Store grew quite a bit, to its current numbers. So, in less than two years, it gained around 300,000 new apps. </p>

<p> What Is Google Stadia? Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> What is Google Stadia and how does it relate to Android? In short, Stadia is Google's cloud gaming platform. As for its relation to Android, the Pixel 2, 3, and 4 are some of the Android devices you can play Stadia games on. </p>
<p> If you're looking to learn more about Stadia and what it offers, we've laid out everything here to answer all your questions. </p>
<p> When is Google Stadia available to play on Android devices? </p>
<p> Stadia was launched on November 19 officially. As of launch day, there was support for the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, the Pixel 3a and 3a XL, and the Pixel 4 and 4 XL. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As of February 18 of 2020, Google announced that support would be expanding to more Android smartphones. This includes the ASUS ROG Phone and ROG Phone II, the Razer Phone and Razer Phone 2, and various devices from Samsung. </p>
<p> The Samsung devices include the Galaxy S8, S8+, and S8 Active, the Galaxy S9 and S9+, the Galaxy S10, S10e, and S10+, the Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra, the Galaxy Note 8, the Galaxy Note 9, and the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+. </p>
<p> These devices officially gained support on February 20, which is when you will be able to use them to play games on Stadia. The app can be installed on those phones now though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At its OnePlus 8 event, OnePlus announced that its brand-new OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro would also come with support for Stadia. As will some of its older devices. Support for this went live sometime around April 23. </p>
<p> Besides Android, how else can you play games on Google Stadia? </p>
<p> You can play Stadia games on desktops or laptops with a Chrome browser. This means Chromebooks, and even Windows-based budget laptop and desktop computers. </p>
<p> Basically if it's a PC of some kind and it has a recent version of Chrome, you can play Stadia on it. Even on Mac. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In addition to computers and phones, you can also play Stadia games on Chromecast Ultra. Simply plug the device into a TV or monitor with an HDMI port and you're good to go. After you complete the setup of course. </p>
<p> What are the requirements to play games on Google Stadia? </p>
<p> Now that the free Base tier of Stadia has officially launched, the requirements for Stadia are that you have a compatible device and the minimum speed for internet. You can still be a Pro member if you like, but it's no longer needed. </p>
<p> When it comes to controls, you can use the Stadia controller, DualShock 4, Xbox One gamepad, or similar Bluetooth controllers. Additionally you can also use a mouse and keyboard if you're playing on PC. If you're playing through Chromecast Ultra, you will need to use the Stadia controller. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Then there's the network. According to Google, you will need at least 5Mbps down if you want to have 720p resolution at 60fps and stereo sound. Google recommends at least 10Mbps though. </p>
<p> Google also says that you will need at least 20Mbps if you want 1080p, 60fps, HDR video and 5.1 surround. If you want 4K, you'll need at least 30-35 Mbps. </p>
<p> Something to keep in mind is that experiences will vary. During the review period, many people had wildly different experiences with quality. Our review was based on a pretty decent experience, though visual quality was not 4K, even with over 200Mbps down. And there was a noticeable latency in some situations. </p>

<p> Lastly, you will also need to be a Stadia Pro subscriber to play games at launch. Google plans to change this in the future when it launches Stadia Base, the service's free tier, which comes out sometime in 2020. If you're a Founder or have the Premier bundle, then Pro comes with that for three months automatically. </p>
<p> How many games does Google Stadia have available? </p>
<p> As of launch day, Stadia had 22 games available for users to play (though there are a lot more now). Two of those games could be played at no cost since they're part of being a Stadia Pro subscriber. Those included Destiny 2: The Collection, and Samurai Shodown (Samurai Shodown is no longer a Pro game for those who didn't claim it). </p>
<p> In addition to those two games, you have access to other big hits like Red Dead Redemption 2, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, NBA 2K20, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Final Fantasy XV, and more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Altogether there are now 73 games available on Stadia, including Darksiders Genesis, Borderlands 3, Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, and Ghost Recon Breakpoint which launched December 17 and December 18 respectively. </p>
<p> Some of the more recent titles to join the Stadia roster were DOOM (2016), West Of Loathing, SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE, Rock Of Ages 3, PGA Tour 2K21, and the most recent – Spiritfarer from Thunder Lotus Games, which is the studio behind Jotun and Sundered. </p>
<p> There's also more games coming to the platform on September 1, including Hitman, Super Bomberman R Online, Hello Neighbor, and Gunpoint. All of which will be Pro games too, which means you can claim them for free if you like. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Is there any first-party content? </p>
<p> Not yet, no. It will though in the future. Google announced that it created a first-party studio called Stadia Games & Entertainment, located in Montreal. </p>
<p> It also wants to have a studio in the UK as well as Japan. It will however probably be a while before any first-party content is released for the service. That being said, this week on July 15, Stadia Games & Entertainment announced partnerships with multiple big-name studios for first-party content. </p>
<p> This includes partnerships with Harmonix, the studio behind Rock Band, as well as Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games, and Uppercut Games. So far there's no word on what games the studios will be creating together. But this is likely the first hint at something that may be available for Stadia which is only available on Stadia. And not just as a timed exclusive, but for good. </p>
<p> Are there any free games? </p>
<p> Stadia will provide Pro subscribers with at least one free game per month, similar to PlayStation Plus. </p>
<p> As long as you subscribe to Stadia Pro, you will always be able to play those games. You do lose access though during anytime you aren't subscribed. </p>
<p> You will also miss out on any free titles that are given out during any months your subscription is inactive. </p>
<p> Does Google Stadia work with mobile data? </p>
<p> Yes. Initially, Stadia did not work with mobile data and could only be played when connected to Wi-Fi. The only workaround for this was to tether your devices to your mobile phone so it was essentially Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> That's no longer needed though. Earlier this year Stadia launched the Experiments feature in settings for the Stadia app. In it is an option for mobile data connections. </p>
<p> If you have this toggled on, you can play games on your smartphone using mobile data. Properly. That being said, it is available as an experiment. So that means Google has not launched the mobile data capability officially yet and it may not always function flawlessly. </p>
<p> Still, you can use it now. So experiment or not it is available which is a big step up. </p>
<p> What sorts of features does Google Stadia have? </p>
<p> Stadia in general has plenty of features that were advertised both that would be available on Android and other devices. Many of those features are not quite available, but they are coming. </p>
<p> As of launch, Stadia on Android will support gameplay with the controller and buying games through the store. A couple of other features have been introduced now as well. Like the capture feature. </p>
<p> You can already use this particular feature on the PC or on Chromecast Ultra, but not in phones just yet. Other features include things like Stream Connect, which is basically Stadia's version of split screen and launched alongside Ghost Recon Breakpoint on December 18 (it is also now available in The Division 2), Crowd Choice, State Share, and one of the more exciting ones, Crowd Play. </p>
<p> With Crowd Play, gamers can hop into a game with their favorite streamers. The way it works is it puts you in queue if there's a wait. Stadia will then tell you when it's your turn to jump in. You can then automatically pop into the game you were just watching. </p>
<p> State Share launched alongside Crayta back at the end of June. And Crowd Choice and Crowd Play will be launching a little bit later this year with games like Dead by Daylight and Super Bomberman R Online. Both of which are releasing this Fall. Dead by Daylight specifically is stated to launch in September. </p>
<p> Stadia also now supports things like wireless Stadia controller connections for mobile and for Chrome. So there's no longer a need to wire it with a USB. </p>
<p> What are the benefits of Google Stadia? </p>
<p> There's a pretty large list of benefits for this platform. For example, Stadia allows you to play games in the cloud, and because of this you don't need to buy a bunch of expensive hardware. </p>
<p> That means you don't need to spend hundreds on a console. Or upwards of a thousand or more for a really good gaming PC. You also don't have to deal with downloads for games. </p>
<p> When you buy a new game you can simply log onto Stadia, and hit the play button. That is literally it. You can jump into games super quick and never worry about downloading patches or updates. </p>
<p> One of the best benefits though is playing AAA, big budget game titles on your smartphone. You do need a Pixel device for this right now, but eventually that will expand. The point is that you can now take your game to a new screen. </p>
<p> Perhaps you're playing on the TV but then your better half wants to watch a show. No problem, simply pause the game and start where you left off on your Pixel device. Or in a Chrome browser. Stadia saves your game state too for around five to ten minutes, so you have time to grab a snack before you start playing again. </p>
<p> Another benefit is playing games at higher quality without the need for an expensive gaming rig. Now, this one is a little touch and go, as we didn't get any 4K for games during our review testing. At least not when we tried it through our Chromecast Ultra. </p>
<p> But Stadia does claim to offer it, and some users have reported really high-quality graphics. So, your mileage may vary with this one. </p>
<p> Are there any downsides to Google Stadia? </p>
<p> That all depends on what you perceive to be a downside. There are some. </p>
<p> The one that most people can agree on is latency. Not everyone will notice it, but even those that are experiencing it can agree that this is a major pain point if it pops up and it's bad enough. </p>
<p> In our review, we noted that there was noticeable lag in multiplayer gameplay during our sessions. Single player gameplay was great with no noticeable latency or input lag issues. Your best chance of avoiding this particular problem, is making sure you're playing on a device that's hardwired to your router. </p>
<p> Where can I buy Google Stadia? </p>
<p> Stadia is officially available in 14 different countries at the beginning of its launch from November 19. </p>
<p> This includes the US, UK, Germany, Finland and others. Though it would technically be possible to buy Stadia equipment and bring it to a country not on the list, the service wouldn't be supported there. </p>
<p> As for what storefronts you can make your purchases at, Stadia is only available through the Google Store right now. This means you have to order online and have the Premier Bundle or Stadia controller shipped to you. </p>
<p> Eventually, Google may end up selling Stadia bundles and controllers in other retail outlets. It hasn't mentioned any plans to do so however. </p>
<p> Is Google Stadia right for you? </p>
<p> There are plenty of factors to consider when asking this question to yourself. </p>
<p> If you hate large game downloads, patch or update downloads, or expensive hardware, then you should probably think about buying into it. There were some notable issues that might make this something you should wait on for a little while. </p>
<p> Your network plays a lot into this. If you don't have a very strong network, you may experience more lag and latency than others. Also worth considering is how you want to play. From your phone? As long as you have a Pixel, then it's a good buy. We noted in our review that playing on the phone was an excellent experience. </p>
<p> Then again, Stadia is only the right choice for you right now if you want to play some of the games that are available. If you're waiting on some specific titles, then you may want to wait. Then again, Stadia is now available in the free tier, so you could always check it out without paying the monthly fee for Pro. </p>
<p> Overall, Stadia is a great gaming option if it fits into your lifestyle. And there are many reasons why it can and should. Though some people had terrible experiences with the service initially after launch, it seems many more people are having positive ones. Especially now that it's been out a lot longer. </p>

<p> What Is Luna? Everything You need To Know </p>
<p> Luna is Amazon's new cloud gaming service that was just announced yesterday during the company's large product event. </p>
<p> What exactly is Luna, though? Should you care about the service and is it worth your time? Maybe one of the other cloud gaming services is a better fit? </p>
<p> In this guide we'll walk you through exactly what Luna is and what it offers, so you can make the decision on whether or not you should be interested in it and give it a try. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What is Luna? </p>
<p> Luna is a cloud gaming service that will be offered by Amazon. It was announced September 24, 2020, and is the company's entry into the space that already contains major players like Stadia, GeForce NOW, Shadow, and Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. </p>
<p> Amazon was rumored to be entering the cloud gaming space last year, but little was known about it back then. Now, a lot more detail has been shared about it. Including what it costs, what games you can play, and where you can play them. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Amazon hasn't given out all the details on Luna yet, but it has shared quite a bit following yesterday's announcement. The idea is to offer people a slightly different model for cloud gaming than what's currently available from competitors. </p>
<p> Luna will offer a variety of different games from publishers you know and love. Some of them will be new and some of them will be a bit older. </p>
<p> The whole point of Luna, much like with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Stadia, is that you don't need to download games. There's no having to wait for games to install. you simply find a game you want to play and you launch it. Boom. Done. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If that sounds appealing to you, then you may want to consider keeping an eye on Luna and signing up to request access to it. </p>
<p> What games are available on Luna? </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Like Amazon says, Luna has something for everyone when it comes to games. As for what games are available, that's something that's not completely clear at the moment given the service was just announced. </p>
<p> Amazon has confirmed some games that will be available as part of the service from the start though. These include Resident Evil 7, the Panzer Dragoon Remake, A Plague Tale: Innocence, The Surge 2, Yooka-Laylee and The Impossible Lair, Iconoclasts, GRID, ABZU, and Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons. </p>
<p> Other games are listed on the Luna landing page. As of right now though, these have not been confirmed to be available when Luna opens up to players. Some of those games include what you see in the image above like Control, Shadow Tactics, Metro Exodus, and even Assassin's Creed Valhalla. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> More games are going to be added post launch of Luna too. So keep an eye out for new additions. As we'll update this post when new games are confirmed to be coming or added. </p>
<p> Amazon is also offering games in what it calls "channels." Each channel will have something different. Luna+ for example holds a variety of top games in a growing library. Then there's the Ubisoft channel which is the only other channel that's been mentioned so far. And will hold a collection of top Ubisoft titles, likely similar to Uplay+. </p>
<p> What devices can I play on? </p>
<p> Amazon's big thing here is letting you play games on the devices you already own. This is going to be limited to begin with, but it will probably expand quickly. Or at least we hope. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once the service opens up to players, you'll be able to access it on Fire TV (any TV or device that has Fire TV baked into it), Mac, iOS via web apps, and PC. It will be available on Android at some point as well. Amazon has not yet confirmed when though. It simply stated that it was coming soon. </p>
<p> How do I get access to the service? </p>
<p> At the moment Amazon has made Luna an invite-only service. This means you can't quite yet sign up and create an account to play games whenever you want. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can however sign up to request access, as it's going to be going into its early access program sometime in October. </p>
<p> Sign up for access will not guarantee you a spot to play. It is however your best shot right now at trying Luna out. As early access continues following its availability going live, Amazon will eventually open it up to more people. Perhaps anyone that cares to test it out. </p>
<p> If you're interested in trying the service, make sure to request access by signing up. </p>
<p> How much does Luna cost? </p>
<p> The service is going to be available at an introductory cost of $5.99 a month during early access. </p>
<p> Since this is only the early access price though, it will probably cost more when it launches fully. Open to everyone and not just those invited. </p>
<p> Amazon also hasn't announced the prices for its separate channels yet. Right now only the Ubisoft channel has been officially announced. And it's listed as coming soon but doesn't have an associated monthly fee. But players who want these extra channels will have to pay for them a la carte as package add-ons. </p>
<p> $5.99 is the only price Amazon has thrown out right now. With no mention of whether or not bundle pricing of any kind will ever be available, or if there will be a free tier. </p>
<p> What controllers work with the service? </p>
<p> Amazon will support a handful of different controllers from the get-go. This includes the Luna controller, the Xbox One wireless controller, and the DualShock 4. </p>
<p> You can also use a mouse and keyboard if you're playing games on your PC. Which might be the preferred input method for some. </p>
<p> There will undoubtedly be more compatible controllers down the line, but in the beginning Amazon is starting small with the most popular and most used controllers out there. And it makes sense. </p>
<p> Now, that isn't to say that other controllers won't work. They might. But Amazon doesn't list anything else as officially supported. So anything other than what was mentioned here may not work at all. </p>
<p> What features does Luna have? </p>
<p> You might be surprised at what's available. Then again maybe not. Since this is Amazon-owned, it naturally has integration with Alexa. </p>
<p> You can ask Alexa to play games and it'll launch the game you mention. Not unlike Google has done with Stadia and Google Assistant. Luna also has integration with Twitch. Another Amazon-owned brand. </p>
<p> You can watch Twitch livestreams on Luna and then from those streams launch into a game on the service yourself. </p>
<p> What sort of resolution does Luna support? </p>
<p> Amazon says that the service will support up to 1080p resolution for most games. </p>
<p> Some games will support up to 4K, but none of those are going to be available during the early access period. Amazon says 4K is coming soon, so this is expected to pop up once early access is over. </p>
<p> What internet speed do I need? </p>
<p> The recommended internet speed is 10Mbps for your download speeds for everything that is streaming at 1080p. </p>
<p> If you're going to stream in 4K, which isn't available at the moment and probably won't be during early access, you'll need a minimum of 35Mbps download. As always though, the faster and stronger your internet connection, the better your streaming experience will be. So keep that in mind. </p>
<p> Where is Luna available? </p>
<p> The service is pretty limited for the early access period. </p>
<p> To start, Luna will be available in the US only. This excludes Hawaii, Alaska, and any US territories. Amazon hasn't announced any plans for expansion outside the US at the moment. Though it likely will expand after early access, and perhaps even during. </p>

<p> What Is NVIDIA GeForce NOW? Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> What is GeForce NOW? To put it simply, it's NVIDIA's cloud gaming platform. You use it to stream games to other devices using NVIDIA's hardware. </p>
<p> Letting you play games with high graphics settings without needing a high-end PC. </p>
<p> If you're looking to learn more about NVIDIA GeForce NOW, this guide breaks it all down and attempts to answer any questions you may have. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This is an ongoing piece of content and will be updated accordingly when there are changes to the service. </p>
<p> What is NVIDIA GeForce NOW and when is it available? </p>
<p> As noted above GeForce NOW is NVIDIA's answer to a cloud gaming platform. It's been working on it for a few years now, though it has only ever been available as a closed beta. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That all changed this month when NVIDIA finally launched the service out of beta and made it available to everyone. </p>
<p> So when is it available? Right this very moment. You can sign up for the service whenever you have time and immediately start playing games. Keep in mind that GeForce NOW may not be available in your region. </p>
<p> Officially, the service has only launched in the US and in Europe. Though NVIDIA also states that the service is up and running through alliance partners in Russia, Korea, and Japan. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How much does it cost? </p>
<p> There are two tiers of GeForce NOW that are available. One of those tiers is free of charge. So you can sign up and enjoy games at absolutely no charge. Save for the cost of the game itself. </p>
<p> There is also the Founders tier. This tier costs $5 a month but gives you extra benefits over the free tier. So in addition to paying for your games, you also have the $5 monthly fee to pay. You do however get the first 90 days of access for free. </p>
<p> Compared to Stadia Pro at $10 a month, it might be a little more cost-friendly for some users. This is also considering that GeForce NOW doesn't require to buy into the service with a $130 bundle like Stadia. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It works off of your existing hardware. Whether that be a phone, a PC, or a tablet. </p>
<p> What devices does GeForce NOW support? </p>
<p> Quite a few, actually. GeForce NOW was designed to work with a wide range of different hardware. </p>
<p> That means you can use it on just about anything. Including a potato PC. Specifically, you can use it on Windows-based desktops and laptops. So, if you've always dreamed of your computer playing high-end games but it just didn't have the specs, now that doesn't have to limit you. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It can also be played on Android smartphones. It'll work on the NVIDIA SHIELD and on Mac desktops and laptops too. </p>
<p> When it comes to Android phones it's also worth noting that almost any Android phone will work. The only requirements are that it have at least 2GB of RAM, support OpenGL ES 3.2, and run on Android 5.0 or later. </p>
<p> You will also need a supported gamepad. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What gamepads work with GeForce NOW? </p>
<p> This is a sort of broad question as it kind of depends on where you play games. If you play on PC, then any gamepad that is supported by that PC should work. I.E. the Xbox One controller, the Steam controller etc. </p>
<p> If you play on Android phones then the list is probably a little bit shorter. With Android phones you can officially use the Razer Junglecat, the SHIELD controller, the Razer Raiju Mobile, the Glap, the SteelSeries XL, the SteelSeries Stratus Duo, the DualShock 4, and the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers. </p>
<p> NVIDIA's FAQ page says you need to use a USB OTG cable with the DualShock 4 if you're playing on the phone. This isn't true though. And if you dig a little deeper and go to the support page you'll see that it says both wired and Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You should be able to connect the DualShock 4 to your phone wirelessly through Bluetooth. As that's what I did personally and it worked just fine. </p>
<p> Optionally, you can also likely hook up a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to your device and that should work for games that require a keyboard and mouse to play. </p>
<p> What games are available on GeForce NOW? </p>
<p> This is a very large list so not all of them will be listed here. The short answer is most games. </p>
<p> GeForce NOW supports a wide variety of games through Steam, Uplay, and other launchers on PC. This is how it accesses games. It pulls from the games you already have in your existing library. </p>
<p> Furthermore, that should also answer any questions about cost. You don't pay NVIDIA directly for game titles. But it will not let you access any games you didn't buy. So if you want to play it, you would need to have purchased through Steam or elsewhere. </p>
<p> When it comes to accessing games from Steam, some will not be shown or listed in the GeForce NOW app on Android. However, once you log into your Steam account through the GeForce NOW app, you can select from one of the titles that are shown, and then simply back out to your Steam library and select any game you wish. </p>
<p> This is because NVIDIA is simply accessing your Steam account through the Steam remote play feature. As for games from other launchers, you can play titles like The Division 2, Fortnite, Kingdom Come: Deliverance and more. </p>
<p> Is there first-party content? </p>
<p> No. You won't find any first-party content with GeForce NOW because it in itself is not really the platform. Not in the way that Stadia is technically a new platform. GeForce NOW is merely the vessel, letting you access the games you already own from other stores. </p>
<p> If there's first-party content for that store, then it may be available through GeForce NOW. Borderlands 3 is a good example of this. It's currently only available from the Epic Games Store. You can play it on GeForce NOW. </p>
<p> So in a round about way there are first-party exclusives. But not like PlayStation 4 or the Epic Games Store have exclusives. </p>
<p> What are the requirements to use the service? </p>
<p> When it comes to requirements there isn't a massive list, but you will still need to hit the basics. </p>
<p> You obviously need an internet connection for it to work. Connection speeds need to be at least 15Mbps for 720p resolution with 30fps for the frame rate. If you want 1080p resolution with 60 fps for the frame rate, then you need a connection speed of at least 25Mbps. </p>
<p> You also need to connect the device physically with an ethernet cable, or, you can play using wireless if you're connected to a 5GHz wireless router. This means you may not be able to play games on GeForce now on some public Wi-Fi hotspots if the router isn't 5GHz. At the very least the experience may not be as good. </p>
<p> That's pretty much it. If you're playing on Windows there are no software requirements really or hardware requirements. Meaning you don't need to use a specific type of display and you don't need a minimum of 16GB of RAM. </p>
<p> Android does however have some requirements as noted above. You need a device with at least 2GB of RAM, and the device has to run Android 5.0 or later and support OpenGL ES 3.2 or later. </p>
<p> Do you need any special equipment? </p>
<p> Yes and no. It is recommended that you have a 5GHz router. And of course you will need a PC or Android smartphone to connect to the service from. </p>
<p> You do not however need any specialized equipment that is meant for GeForce NOW only. The service was designed to work with your existing hardware. So you likely already have a controller that's compatible and a device to play games on. </p>
<p> Many routers are also 5GHz these days, so plenty of users will be set here too. </p>
<p> How do you set up GeForce NOW? </p>
<p> Setup is pretty simple and doesn't take long to do. We put together a nice little guide on how to get everything going here. </p>
<p> You'll need a few things, like an NVIDIA account, a controller or some form of peripheral for controlling the games, and you need to sign up for a GeForce NOW membership which you can do from the main website. </p>
<p> You also need to have the Android app installed on your phone if you're playing on your phone, or the program installed on your PC of choice. Once you have everything in place you can start playing games right away. </p>
<p> What are the features? </p>
<p> The feature list is pretty small. But, there are some nice perks to look out for. </p>
<p> If you're a Founders member, you'll get the RTX ON feature. Which lets you play games that take advantage of ray tracing through NVIDIA's powerful 2080 graphics cards. </p>
<p> GeForce NOW also utilizes an NVIDIA feature called NVIDIA Highlights. This will automatically save exciting in-game moments. Once saved, you can choose to share these highlight videos across various social channels. </p>
<p> Such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and more. Founders also get six-hour long gameplay sessions before they need to log out and log back in to continue for a new session, and they get priority access. </p>
<p> Free tier members are limited to one-hour long gameplay sessions, and have standard access. Which means Founders will get to connect first if servers are full or reaching capacity. </p>
<p> What are the benefits? </p>
<p> The main benefits are clear and concise. You can play just about any of your PC games, just about anywhere you like, and just about on any device. </p>
<p> So there are some exceptions there. But those limitations are pretty minimal. Essentially you get the availability to play all of your already-owned games on your phone or PC. And if it's the phone you want to use so you can play the games on the go, you get a wide selection of devices to choose from. </p>
<p> Compared to Stadia which initially only supported Pixel phones (new phones are being added on February 20), you have options. So if you prefer to use a Samsung Galaxy Note 10, you can. And that's a wonderful consumer-friendly option. </p>
<p> Another benefit is that you can spend less on a PC. Maybe you want to play high-end games with tip-top graphics, but you can't afford a PC that is powerful enough to support this. Now that's not an issue. </p>
<p> Are there any downsides? </p>
<p> Yes. There are a few. GeForce NOW isn't perfect. Just like Stadia isn't perfect. Just like Stadia though, the tech works and the service works. Especially under optimal conditions. </p>
<p> As for the downsides, GeForce NOW is limited on some games. While it has a vast array of available options, it still misses out on games from some publishers. Namely Activision Blizzard. Prior to the launch the games were officially available through the service. </p>
<p> After the launch however, Activision Blizzard requested that the games be pulled. This means no more Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm, Call of Duty, or other games from either company on GeForce NOW. </p>
<p> Another downside is the play session limits. With the Founders tier you are limited to six hours. If you reach that point then you will need to log out. Then log back in, and start a brand new play session. This may not affect some people, especially if you don't usually play for longer than six hours at a time. </p>
<p> Some people do though. The bigger downside is with the free tier. Free tier members only get one-hour long play sessions, and this might feel a lot more constricting. It'll basically make it a lot more challenging to play any sort of MMO or ongoing game. </p>
<p> If it's a multiplayer game that has longer content, such as raids that can take at least a couple of hours to finish and require a group of players, using the free tier isn't exactly convenient as you'd have to stop every hour and log out. </p>
<p> You'd also have to hope that you got back in immediately so that your group isn't waiting on you. Case in point, if you're planning using GeForce NOW with an MMO or MMO-like game, pay up for the Founders tier. </p>
<p> Is NVIDIA GeForce NOW right for you? </p>
<p> It's certainly right for someone. For a lot of people really. But, it won't be right for everyone. </p>
<p> If you're asking yourself this question, then there are a few things you want to consider. Are you ok with the limitations, like the one-hour and six-hour play sessions? Are you ok with the lack of games from Activision Blizzard? </p>
<p> Do you mind not having iOS support? If you're not ok with these things, then GeForce NOW may not be for you. Something similar to GeForce NOW that would allow access to games like Overwatch and WoW and support iOS would be Shadow. </p>
<p> Though your monthly fee is quite a bit higher. So you'd need to consider that too. You gain a few things but you also pay more. With GeForce NOW you have a really low monthly cost to keep up with. </p>
<p> For that, you'll get access to just about any game you may have ever purchased or will purchase on PC. Thinking ahead, the service will end up allowing you to play newer games that have yet to release too. </p>
<p> If you have an Android device, then GeForce NOW may be the right choice for you as it supports a huge variety of Android devices. </p>
<p> I wouldn't necessarily recommend this if you don't have a 5GHz router and don't have a strong internet connection. Notice I didn't say fast, because your internet speeds can be really good but the connection strength could still be weak. </p>
<p> Which would more than likely cause issues with any cloud gaming experience. All of these factors are worth mulling over. In the end though, GeForce NOW is a great gaming option if you have strong, fast internet with the proper router and an extra $5 to spare every month. </p>

<p> What Is Cloud Gaming With Xbox Game Pass Ultimate? Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> What is Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate? The short of it is that it's the new streaming service from Microsoft's Xbox team. It used to be available in a closed beta that required an invite, and allowed you to stream games to your Android smartphone. </p>
<p> There's a varied collection of titles to choose from. Both new and old. If you want to learn more about Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, this guide aims to break it down for you with more detail. </p>
<p> What is Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and when is it available? </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is Microsoft's cloud gaming platform that allows users to play games from a curated Xbox catalog. </p>
<p> It works by streaming the games from Microsoft's servers (which are a massive collection of Xbox units) on your device of choice. Which at the moment is limited to just Android smartphones, in addition to iOS with a little more limitation. </p>
<p> The service officially launches on September 15. So if you already have an account with Game Pass you can login and play games on your phone anytime you like starting tomorrow. It is worth noting though, that Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is still going to be in a beta status. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It won't be closed anymore though, and anyone can use it after signing up for Game Pass and paying the subscription fee. </p>
<p> Though Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is still going to be in beta, it'll officially be part of a bundle with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and it won't cost anything extra. Meaning you'll pay the same $15 a month you'd always pay. On top of that, you can even sign up for $1 for the first month if you're a new subscriber. </p>
<p> Where is Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate available? </p>
<p> At launch on September 15, Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will be available in 22 countries around the globe. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This includes the US, the UK, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czechia (Czech Republic), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. </p>
<p> How much does Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate cost? </p>
<p> Now that Cloud Gaming is officially going to be part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, it'll be $15. </p>
<p> But what you're paying for isn't really the Cloud Gaming. You're paying for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and the cloud gaming service is now just part of that. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So technically, it's still free like it used to be when it was available as xCloud in the closed beta. You can also sign up for $1 for the first month if you're a new subscriber. </p>
<p> So the value there is really pretty good. Keep in mind the $15 pricing is based on US cost. And the actual cost may change depending on what country you're subscribing in. Even in the US, you'll still want to factor in your local state sales tax as most states will have them. </p>
<p> What devices are compatible with Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate? </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Virtually anything running on Android is the shortest answer here. And, it's not really far off the mark. </p>
<p> You can use Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on an Android smartphone or tablet as long as it meets the basic requirements. The first of those basic requirements is that the phone needs to be running on Android 6.0 or later. </p>
<p> This means if your device isn't on Marshmallow (it should be as most devices have been for years) the service won't be accessible. The other thing your device needs is Bluetooth 4.0 support or later. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> That's really it. If your device meets those two things, you can play games through Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. And it does work with both phones and tablets. </p>
<p> Compared to Stadia and GeForce NOW, it's still available across less devices. But that may change down the line. </p>
<p> What are the supported gamepads? </p>
<p> While the list of supported gamepads is not as big as with GeForce NOW, it's not limited to just one gamepad. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Optimally you might want to use the Xbox One controller, as these are Xbox games you're playing and they might work best with that. You can use others though. The Razer Junglecat is a supported gamepad, for example. As is the more recently launched Razer Kishi. </p>
<p> You can also use the DualShock 4 as Microsoft added support for it earlier this year. It may also work with other Bluetooth gamepads, but Microsoft hasn't confirmed this. </p>
<p> Officially, Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate actually supports the smallest number of controllers of the four cloud gaming platforms that are out there. As both Stadia and GeForce NOW officially support more than three gamepads, and Shadow basically supports any peripheral you can think of as long as it's Bluetooth. </p>
<p> The good news for most people, is that they likely already have an Xbox One controller or a DualShock 4. The only catch with the Xbox controller is that it needs to be a Bluetooth model and not all of them are. </p>
<p> What games can you play on Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate? </p>
<p> Many, many games. Some of the heavy hitters include Black Desert, NieR: Automata, Halo 5: Guardians, Borderlands 2, Destiny 2, Forza Motorsport 7, and Gears 5. Those are just a handful. </p>
<p> Altogether, Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will have over 150 games that you can play at launch. In addition to the titles listed above, this includes Bloodstained: Ritual of The Night, Darksiders III, Dead by Daylight, Dead Cells, Fallout 76, Halo 3: ODST, Minecraft Dungeons, Xeno Crisis, The Elder Scrolls Online and much, much more. </p>
<p> 150 games is also too many to list out entirely. So if you want to see the full list of launch titles, you can do so by going here. </p>
<p> Also worth noting is that some of the newer games are titles which retail normally anywhere from $40-$60. So again, this shows that Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has some pretty insane value. We'll continue to state this. If you aren't signed up for the service, and you like playing games, do yourself a favor and sign up. </p>
<p> It's also highly likely that the number of games will increase as time goes on. Microsoft has confirmed that this is a multi-year project. Which leaves a lot of room for more games to be added as it continues to test the service and move it from a beta to a fully launched offering. </p>
<p> Can you stream games over mobile data? </p>
<p> You should be able to play over mobile data without any issues. Though right now there's no option to select mobile data within the Game Pass app, which is where you'll access the cloud gaming from September 15 onward. </p>
<p> Playing over mobile data or Wi-Fi was an option that was allowed with the Game Streaming Preview app when the service was just xCloud. So there shouldn't be any changes there once things are live tomorrow. </p>
<p> It's also possible that Microsoft won't have any toggles at all. And the service may just work whether you're on mobile data or not. And to be quite honest that would be ideal. </p>
<p> Because it would mean less for the player to have to deal with. Simply open the app, find a game you want to play, and launch it. Without having to worry about whether or not you have the right internet connection type selected. </p>
<p> Are there any additional features? </p>
<p> You should have access to most features you'd get with Xbox. Whether you're playing on the console or on PC. </p>
<p> Which means achievements, chatting with friends online, earning rewards points for completing quests, and much more. You should also be able to play over mobile data, adjust your online visibility if you want to play games in private without interruptions, and even play games online with friends. </p>
<p> Not necessarily at launch, but perhaps later in the year, Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will even have access to EA Play. </p>
<p> Earlier this year Microsoft announced EA Play was coming to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at no additional charge. And it confirmed that this holiday season (at some point), that users playing games over the cloud on Android would get access. </p>
<p> So there's no clear time frame on that one, but it is coming sometime in the near future. It's just a matter of when. There's also cool playlist feature that lets you keep track of which games you're wanting to play. If you like to have any sort of organization set up for your gaming. </p>
<p> What are the requirements to use the service? </p>
<p> The list for this is pretty small and mostly lenient. You do need to have these four components to play, but there is some variability to them. </p>
<p> You'll need to have a smartphone or tablet that can run the app, which needs to have Android 6.0 and Bluetooth 4.0. You will also need to have a compatible controller, whether it be an Xbox One Wireless controller, or a DualShock 4 or any of the supported Bluetooth gamepads. Such as the Razer Kishi. </p>
<p> Of course you also need internet. If you're playing via WiFi then you will need to be connected to a 5GHz internet connection. If you're playing via mobile data, then your connection will need to have at least 10Mbps download speeds. </p>
<p> This isn't too hard to achieve as many major metropolitan areas have speeds that are way faster than that. And to be honest the faster the better. You don't want to be shooting for the bare minimum here where cloud gaming is concerned. </p>
<p> Lastly, you need to have the Xbox Game Pass app installed on your device and you need to be logged into it, and you also need a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Meet all of those requirements and you're good to start playing games. </p>
<p> (Note: you do not need the Game Streaming app picture above now that the service is part of Game Pass. You need the Game Pass app instead.) </p>
<p> What are the benefits of Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate? </p>
<p> In general? Games, virtually anywhere. Over other services? Again, games. There's a ton of value here because it's available as part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now. </p>
<p> It's no longer free (technically, since you need to be subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate to use it), but if you already had Game Pass Ultimate then you aren't paying anything extra. So you could consider it to be free. The biggest benefit of course is the large game list. </p>
<p> Arguably, the game library on GeForce NOW is bigger. But only if you have purchased the games. Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will offer over 150 games at launch. And more will be added down the line. </p>
<p> Another benefit is the ability to play over mobile data properly. This part of the service should just work. So if you're not connected to Wi-Fi, games should still be playable over the cloud as long as you have a mobile internet connection. </p>
<p> You may not have the best experience if the mobile data connection isn't very strong or fast, but it's there nonetheless. </p>
<p> Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also works with Android tablets in addition to Android phones. Obviously, if you have an Android tablet, this might be ideal as the screen is bigger. But the phone is more portable, and it allows you to truly play it anywhere you have an internet connection as you can slap on a controller like the Razer Kishi. </p>
<p> What are the downsides? </p>
<p> There aren't many really. You could argue that a fair portion of the games are older. But, Microsoft is always going to be adding more in and there are still plenty of newer games available too. </p>
<p> One downside is that it's not available via iOS, thanks to Apple's regulations. So if you have an iOS device you unfortunately can't enjoy this awesome service. </p>
<p> It's also possible that the streaming quality may not work that well. This depends mostly on your connection conditions, but there are times where that doesn't matter. Gears 5 for example didn't work well for me on my 5GHz connection with a 350Mbps download speed. </p>
<p> The only other notable issue is that there aren't many gamepads that are supported. Officially the service works with the Razer Junglecat, the Razer Kishi, the Xbox One wireless, and the DualShock 4. This will expand over time more than likely, but right now you're limited to just those options. </p>
<p> Is Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate right for you? </p>
<p> Unless you absolutely hate being able to play AAA games for free, then yes. Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is perfect for any gamer. </p>
<p> There's a ton of stuff on offer with it. From over 150 games to compatibility with multiple types of Android devices. And, soon enough you'll get even more games thanks to the inclusion of EA Play. </p>
<p> All for the same monthly $15 cost that many were likely already paying just for Game Pass Ultimate for PC and console game access. Even if you never plan to play games on an Xbox, this still allows you the ability to play games on PC and on mobile. And that alone is enough of a reason to check it out. </p>

<p> What Is Shadow? Everything You Need To Know </p>
<p> What is Shadow? It's a cloud gaming service that allows you to play games on just about any device. It was available before the likes of xCloud and Stadia, and around at the same time GeForce NOW was in beta. </p>
<p> For the most part it helped pioneer the modern state of cloud gaming. And the industry is better for it. If you want to learn more about Shadow and what it has to offer in comparison to other similar services, we've laid everything out here to answer your questions. </p>
<p> When is Shadow available? </p>
<p> Right now! You can actually sign up for the service at this very moment if you wanted to. In fact Shadow has been up and running for the better part of a couple years. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It also just recently changed up its rates. Prior to that change, Shadow was available in most states across the US. Though there were a few that you couldn't yet access it from. Such as Arizona. </p>
<p> Where is Shadow available? </p>
<p> Altogether Shadow is now available in eight different countries. These are countries that have proper support. </p>
<p> This includes the UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, and the US. In the US, the service was available only in most states. But with the recent announcement that Shadow made about its new pricing plan structure, it expanded the service to those previously locked out states. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> These states are where the service works in "Exploration Mode," which means the service may work with varying degree, but it still works. Where previously it did not. </p>
<p> States where the service is in Exploration Mode include Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Washington, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Every other state has the service fully rolled out. </p>
<p> How much does Shadow cost? </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There are a few plans so it really all depends on which one you choose. Each one will come with a different set of features, and the associated monthly cost varies based on how powerful you want your cloud gaming experience to be. </p>
<p> As it stands only one of the three plans are available right now. With the two more expensive plans not launching until sometime in 2021. </p>
<p> Boost Plan </p>
<p> The starter package now costs just $12 a month, called Boost. Though worth noting is that this is only the price if you sign up for the annual Boost plan. If you go month by month then the cost goes up to $15. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With this package you end up getting a pretty decent setup for cloud gaming. It comes with Full HD resolution for clarity, it uses a GTX 1080 (equivalent or better), a 3.4GHz 4-core CPU, 12GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage. </p>
<p> This is more than capable enough for the demanding graphics of current games at the highest settings. Though you may not get the best refresh rates. Still, likely more than acceptable. </p>
<p> Ultra Plan </p>
<p> First things first, this plan won't be available until 2021. Users can sign up to be notified once it hits though. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As for what it offers, it bumps up RAM and storage to 16GB and 512GB respectively. You also get 4K resolution with Ray Tracing thanks to the move from a GTX 1080 to the RTX 2080 (Equivalent or better). </p>
<p> The CPU is also now a 4GHz 4-core instead of a 3.4GHz 4-core. As for the cost, it's $29.99 a month if you do the monthly plan, and $24.99 a month if you do the annual contract plan. </p>
<p> Infinite Plan </p>
<p> With the Infinite Plan you're getting a nice bump up in computational and graphical power. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You get up to 4K with Ray Tracing, a Titan RTX GPU (Equivalent or better), a 4GHz 6-core CPU, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage for all the space you could ever need for your games. </p>
<p> You'll pay the most for this plan at a monthly rate of $50. If you go for the annual contract option though you'll pay $40 a month instead. </p>
<p> Expanded Storage </p>
<p> While each plan comes with a dedicated amount of storage, you can upgrade to more. Right now the only plan available is the Boost Plan. Which initially comes with 256GB of storage. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you want more than that you can pay an additional $2.99 a month to upgrade to a larger amount. This will let you install more games and programs so you don't have to start swapping out your games. </p>
<p> As this costs an additional $2.99 a month, your monthly cost will change depending on how much more storage you upgrade to. If any at all. </p>
<p> What are the connection requirements? </p>
<p> There's a small set of requirements for Shadow when it comes to the internet. Mainly you should have either FTTH or FTTB high-speed connections. </p>
<p> The service might also work with ADSL broadband connections but there is a chance that they may not. </p>
<p> The bigger requirement to pay attention to though, is the internet speed. Shadow recommends that you have at least 15Mbps, though your experience will likely be better if your speed is at least 25Mbps. </p>
<p> When it comes to internet speeds, this isn't a very demanding prerequisite. In fact it's quite low and matches up with what's more or less required by Stadia. </p>
<p> If you think your internet may not be fast enough, chances are it is. </p>
<p> The service will also work on both hardwired and Wi-Fi connections. Keep in mind that if you're using Wi-Fi though your connection will need to be stronger to ensure minimal latency. </p>
<p> What devices does Shadow work on? </p>
<p> Shadow works on a multitude of devices making it a very powerful method for gaming. </p>
<p> Do you have a potato PC? Not a problem. Shadow will work for you because it handles everything. It works on Windows desktops and laptops, Mac desktops and laptops, Ubuntu desktops and laptops, and even on Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. </p>
<p> It even works on TVs, though you will need an extra piece of equipment for that. It's called the Shadow Ghost, and it's required to plug into the TV so it can access your Shadow account and gaming rig. </p>
<p> This makes Shadow a versatile gaming platform that works for just about anyone, anywhere. And it's very easy to start playing a game at home on your desktop, then pick it back up later on your smartphone if you leave the home. </p>
<p> What games does Shadow have? </p>
<p> The list is only limited by your imagination. Truly. Since Shadow basically runs a full Windows PC running Windows 10 on whatever device you log in with, it has access to any game that can run on a PC with a GTX 1080 GPU. </p>
<p> You can install whatever programs you want on your Shadow rig. So that means you can install Steam and any other clients and access/install any games that are available in those clients. </p>
<p> The only one you may have trouble with or may want to avoid is battle.net. It is against the terms of service in games like World of Warcraft to use cloud gaming services to access the game. This means it could be the same for any other game that you can play through battle.net. </p>
<p> In most cases though, games from other stores should be fine. As always though you may want to check each game specifically as they come up. </p>
<p> Is there first-party content? </p>
<p> No. Not really. Because Shadow is essentially just a powered up gaming rig in the cloud, there's no first-party content that can only be played on Shadow. </p>
<p> If there's first-party content for game stores like Epic or Steam, then you will technically have first-party content that way. But there isn't and never will be any first-party content that you will need Shadow to play. </p>
<p> How do you set up a Shadow account? </p>
<p> This is a pretty simple process. First you'll have to subscribe to the service and choose the plan you want. </p>
<p> After that, make sure you have the Shadow software on whatever devices you want to play games on. If you're playing on the PC, then make sure to install the Shadow program for the correct operating system (Windows, Mac, Ubuntu). </p>
<p> If you're also planning on playing on Android then you'll want to install the Shadow app there too. This can be found in the Google Play Store. It's a free download as well, as you're only paying for the monthly access to Shadow and not the apps or programs. </p>
<p> What input methods are supported? </p>
<p> This will depend on which device platform you play games through Shadow on. If you're on Android, then you should be able to use Bluetooth mouse and keyboard combinations. But you'll be generally be limited to only Bluetooth options. </p>
<p> You can also choose to use gamepads like the DualShock 4 or Xbox wireless controller or any other number of gamepads that support Android. If you're on a PC, then expect to be able to use just about anything. Gamepads, dedicated gaming mice and keyboards, you name it. </p>
<p> As long as your device supports a specific type of peripheral, it should work with Shadow. </p>
<p> Can you use programs like Discord for chat? </p>
<p> Yes. Discord works with Shadow and doesn't really have much of a noticeable latency between you and other users. </p>
<p> You will still need a pair of headphones to use that have a mic so you can talk to others. Or at the very least hear what other are saying. This will be important for games that have multiplayer and may either require or recommend team chat for certain activities. </p>
<p> Because Shadow allows you to install any program you can install on a local Windows desktop, Discord will work just fine as should other chat programs. </p>
<p> Are there any downsides to Shadow? </p>
<p> There are likely a few for some individuals. A big one is the lack of availability. Right now Shadow is only available in eight countries (mentioned above). </p>
<p> If you don't have access to it then you can't use it and that would be a large downside. It's also possible that you may not have the absolute best setup for minimal latency and the best resolution. </p>
<p> While Shadow requires a relatively low base internet connection speed, just like Stadia the best configuration is going to be an ethernet connection. If you're playing on a phone then you simply need to make sure your Wi-Fi connection is strong enough to handle the streaming without having latency issues. </p>
<p> Shadow is also the most expensive of any of the available cloud gaming services. And some may find that it's not affordable for them. </p>
<p> What are the benefits of Shadow? </p>
<p> For starters you can play on just about anything. Nearly any Android device is supported instead of being limited to a handful of devices. </p>
<p> You can also play on just about any desktop or laptop and you can play on tablets. This opens up gameplay to a ton of users and makes it possible for anyone to afford a high-end gaming experience if they can afford the monthly cost. </p>
<p> Because of the mobile device versatility you can also play games on Shadow just about anywhere. If you have a strong enough connection then you should be totally fine. Though again, your best experience is likely to be with your phone connected to a strong and fast Wi-Fi network. </p>
<p> Shadow is also scalable. Just like with GeForce NOW and Stadia, Shadow will be upgraded as needed. When new, more powerful hardware comes out, the Shadow team will deploy the new parts. Eventually making everyone's cloud gaming rigs more powerful too. </p>
<p> This cuts out the need of having to upgrade your PC. Which can become pretty costly depending on how high-end the parts are that you're buying. </p>
<p> Naturally, some users will prefer the physical PC and enjoy upgrading their rig every few years or however often they do it. For those that want something more simple yet just as powerful, Shadow provides this and the rig will never be exceedingly outdated. </p>
<p> Is Shadow the right service for you? </p>
<p> Shadow is the right service for many people. But, unfortunately it isn't available everywhere yet. So for those who can't access it a similar option is your best bet. </p>
<p> Anyone who also prefers to have their own physical rig so they don't have to rely on Shadow for hardware upgrades or worry about the extra latency, is better off sticking with a physical gaming PC. Or even a console. </p>
<p> If you want some freedom though. The freedom to choose which device you play your games on without giving up quality of games, Shadow is a fantastic option. Especially now that it's available nationwide in the US. </p>
<p> Any negatives about Shadow, which are going to be mostly subjective, are far outweighed by the positives. The biggest positive about Shadow is that you have your own Windows 10 gaming computer in the cloud. </p>
<p> There's no Shadow-specific library of games. You can install any game or program on your Shadow rig, so if you can access it on PC or Mac or Ubuntu, then you can access it on Shadow. </p>
<p> This is a big improvement over Stadia, GeForce NOW, and xCloud. All of which have their own strengths and weaknesses and are just as exciting. But they're more limited on games. Content is king. And in this particular area Shadow is winning. </p>
<p> It is however more expensive monthly then any of the other services. So that's something you'll need to consider along with everything else. </p>

<p> What Is Wear OS? All You Need To Know To Get Started </p>
<p> What is Wear OS? In its simplest definition it's Google's smartwatch operating system. Wear OS is more than just a platform for wearables, though. And, for anyone looking to learn more about the platform, this article aims to answer all your questions. </p>
<p> Does Wear OS run on all smartwatches? </p>
<p> No. While many smartwatches do run on this operating system, there are a number of them that don't. For example, all of the smartwatches available from Samsung run on the company's own wearables operating system. </p>
<p> In the same vein, the Apple Watch, smartwatches from Fitbit, and other wearable brands run on their operating systems as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google's smartwatch operating system is probably the most expanded though. There are more available smartwatches which operate of this software than any other. Not too unlike Android with smartphones. </p>
<p> This could be both a good and a bad thing, depending on how you look at it. For the most part though, it stays true to a core component of Android, which is consumer choice. </p>
<p> With so many smartwatches running on Wear OS, consumers have plenty of options. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What apps are available for Wear OS? </p>
<p> There are loads of apps that are available on the platform. </p>
<p> Many of them are the same apps that you can download on Android. Apps like Google Fit, Strava, Telegram, and even Uber can be installed. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can even find more obscure apps that are specifically for smartwatches. Facer is one of these apps, and lets you customize your watch faces easily. </p>
<p> Where do you get apps? </p>
<p> Just like with Android smartphones and with Android TV, apps on Wear OS are downloaded from the Play Store. You can even install apps directly from the watch. </p>
<p> In the early days of Android Wear, which is what Wear OS used to be, apps were installed through the phone </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you wanted an app installed on your watch, you’d simply find the app on the phone, install it, and then sync it with your watch to transfer the app </p>
<p> These days, the with the Play Store being available on watches, no syncing is involved for the installation process </p>
<p> You just scroll the Play Store on the watch instead and install everything you want. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How much do the watches cost? </p>
<p> This all depends on the brand you pick and the features it comes with, though most Wear OS watches come with just about all the same features. </p>
<p> What it mostly comes down to is the brand, and whether or not the watch comes with LTE capabilities. Meaning, it can be used with cellular data so you don’t need your phone to be connected to it. </p>
<p> For the most part Wear OS watches will usually run in the range of $250-$400. Some of the high-end watches, like those from TAG Heuer or Mont Blanc can cost quite a bit more. </p>

<p> What are the more popular smartwatches on this platform? </p>
<p> There are a lot of different models available from numerous brands, such as DIESEL, Michael Kors, and more. But when it comes to more popular options, Fossil's watches might be some of the most popular out there. The Fossil Sport in particular is probably the most popular out there right now. </p>
<p> Fossil Sport </p>
<p> As mentioned the Fossil Sport is one of the most popular Wear OS smartwatches out there right now. One of the main reasons was its use of the Snapdragon Wear 3100. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While a lot of the more recently announced watches will be coming with this processor, the Fossil Sport was one of the first watches to offer it, and this gave it a boost in popularity. In addition to the newer processor it's also fairly sporty making it great for exercise. </p>
<p> What sorts of features does Wear OS have? </p>
<p> Wear OS offers tons of features that can be useful to your everyday life. </p>
<p> Platform features </p>
<p> You can receive incoming notifications from your smartphone, and even make and receive calls on some models. Calls can be made through a Bluetooth-connected phone, or completely on their own if the watch has LTE. </p>
<p> Beyond calls and notifications, all Wear OS watches come with Google Assistant these days. This will allow you to interact with other smart devices like lights and power switches, fans, or really anything that has Google Assistant integration. You can even ask it questions if you just need an answer to something. </p>
<p> Some of the more common uses for Wear OS though revolve around fitness. Most or all Wear OS watches will have the ability to keep track of things like step counts, distance run or walked, and even your heart rate. </p>
<p> There is literally a plethora of fitness-related features, it all depends on how you personally exercise. Some watch models even have water resistance and can be worn while you swim. </p>
<p> All watches also come with an always-on display, which allows you to quickly glance at information. This feature basically wakes the screen just by sensing your wrist movement, so if you lift it up, the watch knows and wakes the screen up so you can see information. </p>
<p> Apps </p>
<p> Naturally, since this is a smartwatch platform, apps are available to install on the watch to help augment its capabilities. </p>
<p> How do you use Wear OS? </p>
<p> Like touchscreen smartphones, Wear OS watches are interacted with through the display. They’re touch sensitive, so using features, installing apps, and managing notifications is all done through touching the screen. </p>
<p> Some watches may have buttons or crowns which can be used navigating the interface though, and Google Assistant can even add some hands-free functionality depending on what it is you’re trying to do. </p>
<p> When you boot up your watch, you’ll load up to the home screen every time. After unlocking the watch, you can swipe up to view notifications. Swiping down brings up the quick settings menu, which is where you’ll find things like brightness and other settings functions. </p>
<p> Swiping to the left though is where you’ll find all of the most useful stuff. Like apps. This is where you’ll also find tiles, a useful feature that was added earlier this year. </p>
<p> What are tiles? </p>
<p> Tiles is the new feature that Google started rolling out to Wear OS back in May. Tiles act as a sort of quick glance at features of the apps you have installed. </p>
<p> As an example, you can have a tile for the weather, your weekly or daily fitness goals and results, timers, and even your next event as well as news headlines you may follow. There aren’t tiles for everything, as Google isn’t trying to make things over complicated. So you’ll still need to open up some apps to access their features. </p>
<p> Do Wear OS watches use the same batteries as regular watches? </p>
<p> No. All Wear OS smartwatches are going to come with internal batteries that will be rechargeable. Sow when it needs juice, simply toss it on the charger and let it be. </p>
<p> This means you’ll never have to worry about replacing the batteries within it. Though you will need to replace that thing to remember with a different one. Which is charging it, as smartwatch batteries won't last as long as regular watch batteries. </p>
<p> That being said, if you think about it like a phone accessory, this may help to prevent from forgetting to charge it when needed. For the most part at least. </p>
<p> Most smartwatch batteries will run on average, 24 hours before you need to recharge them. Though, more often now there are brands claiming watches will last for around two days on a single charge. </p>
<p> What are the issues with Wear OS? </p>
<p> There aren’t too many, but Wear OS is not a flawless system. It’s biggest issue is that it’s been struggling to show how useful it can be, and is a big reason why the Apple Watch and Samsung’s smartwatches have a bigger piece of the smartwatch market. </p>
<p> Tiles has helped with this, making the platform the most useful it’s ever been. Things feel less convoluted and more accessible. Like any piece of tech it might take a few days to get truly used to it, but that will fade. </p>
<p> Another issue, is that not all Android apps are available on Wear OS. This means you find that the app you want to use on the watch can’t be installed. If you think about it, though, that might not be such a bad thing. </p>
<p> Wear OS is not meant to be a replacement for your phone. It’s simply there to help you access some of the features so you don’t have to pull it out of your pocket all the time. </p>
<p> Whether that’s checking an incoming message or using Google Pay to buy stuff at the store. Though the watch will need to have NFC for this feature to work, and not all do. </p>
<p> Where can you buy Wear OS smartwatches? </p>
<p> Pretty much anywhere. If the store sells electronics, they likely sell Wear OS smartwatches. </p>
<p> Online </p>
<p> Obviously, you can buy just about every single Wear OS smartwatch online. Some of them can be found on Amazon, some on eBay. You can also find the watches from each brand specifically at their own online stores in most cases. </p>
<p> BestBuy & other electronics retailers </p>
<p> BestBuy will be one of the bigger electronics retailers to sell Wear OS devices, and they’ll probably be mixed in with other smartwatch options, or at least close by the same section. You can also find some options at Fry’s Electronics, or whatever your big electronics retailer is. </p>
<p> Carrier stores </p>
<p> Some carriers will sell smartwatches along with smartphones and other smart devices. Usually these will be the LTE options, but if that’s what you’re looking for then your carrier might be the best place to look, since you can handle other business there at the same time. </p>
<p> Department stores, malls, and stores like Target </p>
<p> Believe it or not, some department stores will sell smartwatches too. Especially the more fashion-oriented brands. </p>
<p> You’ll also find smartwatches options at Fossil stores. </p>
<p> Last but certainly not least, some stores like Target, Fry’s Marketplace, Fred Meyer, and similar stores may sell these devices as well. </p>
<p> Does Wear OS only work with Android? </p>
<p> Nope. You can use an Apple iPhone and still use a Wear OS smartwatch, as the platform works with both Android and iOS devices. </p>
<p> That being said, you will probably have a little bit more functionality with Android, but most of the features will be there if you are on iOS. </p>
<p> Is Wear OS customizable? </p>
<p> Both Wear OS and the watches themselves are customizable to an extent. With the platform, you can customize the watch with the tiles feature and by selecting the watch face. </p>
<p> Watch faces are already pre-installed and there will be a handful of choices. If however you use something like Facer, the watch faces are infinitely more customizable and there a lot of really cool options out there. This is something you should explore of you like to customize your devices. </p>
<p> With the watches themselves, you can customize the watch case depending on the brand and the model, as many watch options offer varied choices for watch case colors. </p>
<p> Most of the watches now also support removable watch straps so you can choose the one that best fits your style, or simply swap it out based on the activity. For example, silicone straps for when you’re exercising, and a leather or metal option for just about everything else. </p>
<p> Does Wear OS get updates? </p>
<p> It will get updates from time to time. Probably not as often as Android phones, though. Updates are also fairly hands-off. When you power on your phone, it will check for Wear OS updates if the Wear OS app is installed. </p>
<p> If there is one available, it’ll send that update to the watch the next time you connect it. If you have an LTE-capable Wear OS watch, then updates will come through to the watch as it will have a constant connection. </p>
<p> What are the benefits of Wear OS? </p>
<p> There are a ton of benefits, not the least of which is all the hands-free functionality you’ll have. Wear OS also helps you get fit, and it does this with various fitness-related apps. </p>
<p> They can also be a fashion statement if you simply like to have a watch on your wrist. It’ll just be more functional than a regular watch too. </p>
<p> Really though, the benefits depend on what you want out of having a smartwatch. If it’s for the voice capabilities, then Wear OS is perfect thanks to Google Assistant. </p>
<p> If you want at a glance notifications and other information, this is another big benefit as you won’t have to reach for your phone. Simply lift your wrist and take a peek at what you need to see. </p>
<p> Is Wear OS the right smartwatch for me? </p>
<p> If you use an Android phone, it’s probably the right option, but that will entirely depend on your and what you’re looking for. </p>
<p> Since there are so many Wear OS watch options out there, you won’t want for choice. That’s a certainty. You will need to be mindful though, of if you will get any use out of all the functionality. </p>
<p> If you’ll never use the Google Assistant, or want to use apps, you may be better off with a fitness tracker as many of these also offer heart rate sensors and notifications. </p>
<p> If you do indeed want a smartwatch, you may also want to consider whether or not Wear OS would be a better option that Samsung’s Gear line of smartwatches, which are fully compatible with non-Galaxy devices, and use Samsung’s own proprietary smartwatch OS. </p>

<p> Here's When Your Samsung Galaxy Device Will Update From Now On </p>
<p> The most recently released Samsung "Galaxy" devices have now been officially added to its update schedule, reports indicate. That's based on a recent scheduling change released by Samsung. </p>
<p> The biggest news here is, of course, changes in which devices will get updates and when. Namely, the company is moving some devices to monthly updates and others to other schedules. Some of the changes aren't necessarily surprising given the South Korean tech giant's recent promise to deliver more frequent updates. Regardless, the other changes may not be entirely expected. </p>
<p> Of course, this is only for security updates. But those do sometimes include wider firmware changes. So this could have broader implications as well. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What's new with the Samsung Galaxy Update schedule? </p>
<p> Samsung has promised a much longer update cycle for devices, now set at 3 years. Or at least for some of its devices, such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 series. Other devices such as the Samsung Galaxy A family are expected to move to a longer cycle too. So it shouldn't come as a shock that both the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra are included in the updated list for monthly updates. And that includes the 5G variants of both. </p>
<p> Other new devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Z Fold 2 5G are included in the newest addition to monthly updates as well. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the company is also adding devices to a quarterly update cycle. That includes tablets such as the new Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+. But it also includes the Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 and at least one phone — the Galaxy M51. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What's new with older handsets in Samsung's update cycle? </p>
<p> Other, previously-released handsets are moving cycles as well. For instance, the company is shifting the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active away from monthly updates. That will now receive new software and security on a quarterly cycle. And still, other devices are moving away from the quarterly schedule to Samsung's "Other Regular" cycle. </p>
<p> In that latter list, the Samsung Galaxy J2 Core, Tab A 10.5 (2018), and Tab S4 will no longer see quarterly updates. Those will be updated regularly, in keeping with Google policy. But not as regularly as other gadgets. </p>

<p> LG / World's First Rollable TV Coming Soon To Prepare Us For A Rollable Smartphone </p>
<p> World's First Rollable TV Coming Soon To Prepare Us For A Rollable Smartphone </p>
<p> LG is expected to announce the world’s first rollable TV next month, ahead of the rollable smartphone. According to media reports that are coming from Korea, it will happen in October, but we don’t know when exactly. All we know is that late October is mentioned. </p>
<p> LG will release the very first rollable TV soon, and a smartphone will follow next year </p>
<p> This TV will allegedly be called the LG Signature OLED RX, and it will feature a 65-inch display. That display will rise from a box, and you will be able to get it to roll back inside. </p>
<p> LG actually showed off this technology at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) last year. At that point, it was not even close to launching, but LG seems to be ready to release it now. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The LG Signature OLED RX TV will allegedly be priced at over 100 million won. That translates to $85,400. So, needless to say, this will be an extremely expensive TV, a luxury TV, if you will. </p>
<p> Not many people can afford this TV, but we’re sure some of those who can will be happy to get it. The LG Signature OLED RX TV will be the first of its kind, no doubt about that. </p>
<p> This enormous price tag raises some questions when it comes to a rollable smartphone. That device is expected to arrive in the first half of next year, by the way. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The world’s first rollable smartphone will launch as part of LG’s Explorer Program, and LG teased it already. The LG Wing launched as the first phone in that program, by the way. The company’s swiveling phone managed to attract a lot of attention since it launched. </p>
<p> LG is looking to change things up with its 'Explorer Program' </p>
<p> LG seems to be ready to release more such devices. Devices that are not exactly following today’s trends, or anything of the sort. LG is clearly aiming to explore new designs and technologies with such phones. </p>
<p> That is always nice to see, that’s for sure. Who knows, maybe one of those designs will mark a path for upcoming generations of smartphones. The company’s rollable smartphone sure sounds interesting. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We don’t really know much about it, other than the fact it will sport a rollable OLED display. The fact that it’s expected to arrive in H1 2021 wasn’t revealed by the company itself. That information came from Ross Young, a well-known analyst. </p>
<p> Mr. Young is actually a display analyst, and his information is usually spot on. So, we do believe that this particular piece of information is legit as well. The whole idea of this phone is to look like a regular phone, and that you’re able to extend its display when needed. </p>
<p> So, the usage scenarios should be similar to those of foldable smartphones. Instead of folding a display, you’d be extending it, of course. We’re just not sure what route will LG take on this. It all depends on what technology allows it to do. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The company will hopefully go with a smaller display that becomes considerably bigger when extended. Rumors are claiming it will sport a 6.8-inch display that extends to a 7.4-inch panel, though. We’ll see what will happen. While we’re waiting for more information, check out this concept design that surfaced earlier this month. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / Xbox Series X and S: Release Date, Specs, Design, Price & More – Updated Oct. 8 2020 </p>
<p> Xbox Series X and S: Release Date, Specs, Design, Price & More – Updated Oct. 8 2020 </p>
<p> The Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S are on their way to consumers and will be here in the near future, just in time for the holidays, and both with a price that reflects what they offer to the user. </p>
<p> Whether you're someone who considers yourself a seasoned gamer who is used to buying consoles or you're a parent looking to brush up for gifts, there's lots more than price to learn about the Xbox Series X and its counterpart. </p>
<p> In this guide, we'll break down everything there is to know about the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S, including price, release date, the specifications that power each console model, and more. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> At the end of the guide you'll be as well informed about each version of the next-gen Xbox as anyone else. Which should help in making a decision on which one to buy. If you haven't already made that choice. </p>
<p> What's the price of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series? </p>
<p> Each console has a different price based on what they offer. In this case, the Xbox Series X (not to be confused with the Xbox One X) comes in at a price of $499, while the Xbox Series S is coming in at a price of $299. </p>
<p> There are some fairly significant differences between each version of the console. Hence the price gap. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The good news is that each version of the console was engineered in a way to deliver a great gaming experience. So even if you go for the less expensive Xbox Series S, there's still plenty of fun to be had. </p>
<p> Microsoft is also offering consumers the option to pay for the console over a series of monthly payments. Using a system called Xbox All Access, you can pay for the Series X in monthly payments of $34.99. </p>
<p> When do the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S release? </p>
<p> Both consoles will launch on the same day – November 10. Both consoles are also currently available for pre-order if you can find a retailer who has any in stock. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Just like with the PS5, the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S were notoriously hard to secure a pre-order for. Due to the nature of limited stock. </p>
<p> Retailers will be getting more stock in, though it's entirely possible that again, like the PS5, that won't be until release day when stock is allocated for the actual launch and not for pre-orders. </p>
<p> When that time comes you'll either need to be in line at your local retailer of choice, or be quick with the mouse should you be purchasing online. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What comes in the box? </p>
<p> Not a whole lot, honestly. You're getting the basics here. But, it's still everything you need to get the console up and running and start playing games right away if you want to. </p>
<p> In the box you'll get the console, one Xbox Wireless Controller, and an ultra high speed HDMI cable. </p>
<p> Do the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series have any accessories? </p>
<p> Yes. There are a number of accessories that you can pick up for both consoles. All of the accessories are interchangeable as well because they were designed to work with both. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You of course have additional Xbox Wireless controllers you can pick up. In a variety of different colors no less. This includes new colors that were launched in conjunction with each next-gen console. </p>
<p> There's also the new charging solution with the Xbox Rechargeable Battery + USB-C Cable. A new wireless adapter is also coming. And there's now officially licensed expansion slots from Seagate that add extra storage to your console of choice. </p>
<p> There will also be a range of third party accessories coming from numerous brands. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What games are available at launch? </p>
<p> There are around the same number of games available at launch it seems as the PS5. Which is still plenty to get gamers through those first few weeks after release day. </p>
<p> On November 10, gamers with the Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S can play Bright Memory, NBA 2K21, Dirt 5, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Yakuza: Like A Dragon, Watch Dogs: Legion, The Falconeer, Observer: System Redux, Tetris Effect: Connected, Marvel's Avengers, and Fortnite. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War releases on November 13. So while not on release day, it's only a few days later in the same week. There's also a number of Xbox One games that will be enhanced for Xbox Series X through the Smart Delivery feature that will be available on release day as well. </p>
<p> This includes Gears Tactics, Gears 5, Forza 4, Sea Of Thieves, and Ori And The Will Of The Wisps. So far these are the only games that are confirmed for availability on the November release date. But there could always be some that weren't mentioned. </p>
<p> What are the main features? </p>
<p> Starting with what some are going to consider one of the best features of the console, the Series X and Series S come with smart delivery. </p>
<p> This is Microsoft's way of saying that you only have to buy your games once. This is for Xbox One games, and it won't necessarily work for every game. But it should work for quite a few of them whether they're disc or digital. </p>
<p> Both Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S are also backwards compatible with thousands of games from Xbox One, Xbox 360, and the original Xbox as well. And will support the full library of games that were backwards compatible on the Xbox One. </p>
<p> The Xbox Series X will also support 4K gaming, with gaming capabilities up to 8K if you have an 8K TV and are playing games that support 8K as well. The Series S doesn't offer these fidelity options, but it does still come with the 3D Spatial audio which is another big feature of both consoles. </p>
<p> With the 3D Spatial audio players can feel more immersed than ever in the world of the games they play. There's also support for 120fps gameplay. </p>
<p> What will the price be for Xbox Series X games? </p>
<p> The games seem to be following the same price range as they do on PS5. Which is $70 for some and as low as $40 for others, like the Falconeer. </p>
<p> This means you can expect the prices to be the same across the board, just like they were for the last generation of consoles. As mentioned before, $70 is the new normal for big budget AAA games on consoles. And there doesn't seem to be any getting away from that. </p>
<p> Keeping that in mind, games will always go on sale. And if you get the Series X, you can search for used games to save some more money. </p>
<p> What are the specs? </p>
<p> Let's start with the Xbox Series X, because both versions are coming with slightly different specifications. The Xbox Series X comes with an 8-core AMD Zen 2 3.8GHz CPU, an AMD RDNA 2 1.825GHz GPU, 12.15 TFLOPS of power, 16GB of GDDR6 RAM, support for 4K games at 60fps and up to 120fps, a 1TB PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD, support for 1TB expansion card slots, a 4K UHD Blu-ray drive, and HDMI 2,1 support via one HDMI port. </p>
<p> It also has 3 USB 3.1 ports, an ethernet port, Dolby Digital 5.1 support, DTS 5.1 up to 7.1 with L-PCM, and Dolby True HD with Atmos. </p>
<p> When it comes to the Xbox Series X, it uses the same CPU and GPU though they are clocked slower. It has 4 TFLOPS of power instead of 12, 10GB of GDDR6 RAM, a 512GB PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD, support for 1TB expansion cards, no disc drive, and all the same ports as the Xbox Series X. </p>
<p> It has all the same sound capabilities, though it will only support up to 1440p resolution. </p>
<p> The Xbox Series X reportedly runs hot </p>
<p> The Xbox Series X may be more than a month out from release, but some press have already gotten their hands on early units for review. </p>
<p> Giving them the ability to test out the new console and see how it performs. While not a lot of detail has been shared yet, some information from new reports states that the console runs really, really hot. </p>
<p> What that means for anyone picking up the Series X is that you should make sure you have proper space for the console. Give it room to breathe so it can get as much air flow as possible. Tighter spaces with little air flow capabilities is not necessarily a good idea. Should these reports on heat production be accurate. </p>
<p> Expandable storage cards will come in varying sizes </p>
<p> Right now the only officially confirmed brand for the expansion cards for the Xbox Series X is Seagate. The card will hold an additional 1TB of games for your Series X or Series S. It'll also cost $219.99. </p>
<p> In a recent podcast, Xbox's Larry Hryb confirmed that more manufacturers would be making these expansion cards. And that they would come in varying storage sizes. </p>
<p> This means you won't be locked in to buying a 1TB card. And ultimately that means you can spend a little less money to get more storage for games. The expansion cards will also go above 1TB. So there will be more expensive cards for those that want the most storage possible for their console. </p>
<p> Just be prepared to pay a pretty penny for it. Because with the 1TB cards already at $219.99, any cards that are more than 1TB are going to be vastly more expensive. That's the price you pay for a vast amount of storage. </p>
<p> The minor bits </p>
<p> How big are the consoles? </p>
<p> Each console is featuring a different design, but both are noticeably smaller than the PS5. </p>
<p> The Xbox Series X will measure 301mm tall, and 151mm wide and 151mm long. The Xbox Series S is a different story. It will be much smaller and take up quite a bit less space. The Xbox Series S will be 275mm tall, 151mm wide, and 65mm long. Keep in mind that these dimensions are based on the consoles standing and not laying down on their sides. </p>
<p> Can I transfer my save data? </p>
<p> Yes. Microsoft has confirmed that the Smart Delivery feature will allow save data to be transferred between Xbox One and Xbox Series X versions of games. </p>
<p> So your save data is safe, and you can play as much as you want on Xbox One. Knowing full well that you can move it over to the Xbox Series X version. </p>
<p> Can I use my old controllers? </p>
<p> Yes. There shouldn't be any problem with using the old controllers. They use the same connection technology as the ones that come with the new consoles. Though the new ones do have an updated design and one or two new features. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Shows Off World's First 80W Fast Wireless Charging </p>
<p> Xiaomi has just shown off the world’s first 80W fast wireless charging. This is a considerable improvement from the 50W fast wireless charging that the company was able to provide in the past. </p>
<p> For comparison’s sake, competing brands have not yet crossed the 30W mark in that area. The OnePlus 8 Pro, for example, offers 30W fast wireless charging. Needless to say, Xiaomi’s new offering is much faster. </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s 80W fast wireless charging can recharge a 4,000mAh battery in only 19 minutes. The company has demonstrated its new charging technology in a video, which got published on YouTube. That video is embedded down below. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Xiaomi introduced 80W wireless charging than fully recharges 4,000mAh battery in 19 minutes </p>
<p> You’ll notice that Xiaomi was able to charge a 4,000mAh battery from 0 to 10-percent in only one minute. It took it only 8 minutes to reach the 50-percent mark, which is incredibly fast. At the 19-minute mark, the phone was fully charged. </p>
<p> The company’s CEO. Lei Jun, said this is the new world record when it comes to wireless charging. He mentioned the company’s 50W wireless charging which is available with the Xiaomi Mi 10 Extreme Edition as well. </p>
<p> Lei Jun also said that the company believes that wireless charging will completely replace wired charging. He did not give out a prediction when might that happen, but… he seems confident it will happen at some point. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Mr. Jun also did not say when will 80W fast wireless charging become available. He said that the company was able to get it to work, but it’s not yet ready for primetime. </p>
<p> We’re not sure if the company is near completion, or not. If it is, one of the Xiaomi Mi 11 variants may offer it next year. That’s just a wild guess. If the technology is nowhere near ready yet, we may have to wait until 2022. </p>
<p> We’re only guessing here, of course, we’ll have to wait for the company to share more information regarding all this. For the time being, we can only look at the provided video and wait for more information. </p>

<p> The Xiaomi Mi TV Stick Could Launch Any Day Now </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Mi TV Stick has just been certified by Google, which means that it could launch any day now. </p>
<p> We've been hearing about the Xiaomi Mi TV Stick for quite some time, mostly through leaks and other certifications. So we still don't know a ton about it. But we do know some of the important aspects. </p>
<p> This is going to be an Android TV HDMI stick, and it'll also run content at up to 1080p. This is confirmed by the fact that there is an Amlogic S805Y chipset inside. That chipset is capable of up to 1080p content. Which means no 4K support on this particular model. Though there has been rumors of a second model that would feature 4K – a lot like the Fire TV Stick being available in two models. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When can we expect the Xiaomi Mi TV Stick to launch? </p>
<p> Honestly, it could be tomorrow. It has gone through just about all of the certifications it needs to do before it can launch. So now it's all up to Xiaomi as to when it will be made available. But I'd put my money on sooner rather than later. </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Mi TV Stick is expected to be pretty inexpensive too, likely under $50. Which would make for some good competition with Google's own Android TV/Chromecast dongle that has been making its rounds on the rumor mill as of late. Not to mention, competing with Roku and Amazon Fire TV with their own HDMI sticks. </p>
<p> Xiaomi is one of the only OEMs that is really putting out Android TV devices. It has the Mi Box S, as well as its own Android TVs that are running in India and in China. So if you want Android TV, and don't want to spend $150 on the NVIDIA SHIELD TV, Xiaomi is your only other option right now. So it is not surprising to see this device coming out soon. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Google may start pushing HDMI sticks for Android TV </p>
<p> With Google rumored to be putting out its own HDMI stick or dongle in the very near future, and the Xiaomi Mi TV Stick being on the horizon. It looks like Google may be pushing for smaller devices for Android TV, as opposed to the big set-top boxes like the NVIDIA SHIELD TV and even the Nexus Player from many years ago. </p>
<p> Don't expect NVIDIA to give up its set-top box style though. As the SHIELD is used for more than just Android TV, but also as a full-fledged gaming console. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi TV Stick Official Pricing And Specs Revealed </p>
<p> Xiaomi is yet to officially announce the Mi TV Stick but there's little to surprise. The Android TV dongle has been leaking extensively over the past few weeks and we now have its official pricing. The 1080p version of the dongle is listed on the company’s official Portuguese store with a price of €39.99. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi TV Stick specs </p>
<p> Along with the official pricing, the listing on Xiaomi's Portuguese website has also revealed the spec details of the upcoming dongle. It's not like we didn't know any of it, but it's still an official confirmation. </p>
<p> The 1080p version of the Mi TV Stick offers a 1920 x 1080 resolution output at 60fps. It comes with 1GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, a Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU, and an ARM Mali-450 GPU. </p>
<p> The device supports Bluetooth 4.2 and dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac. Xiaomi is offering one Micro USB port and one HDMI port with this Android TV dongle. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Running Android TV 9.0, the Mi TV Stick comes with Google Assistant integration for voice control. It supports all Mi Smart Home devices. Xiaomi has also included support for Dolby Audio and DTS Surround Sound with MP3, WMA, AAC, Flac, and OGG audio formats. </p>

<p> The description also mentions Chromecast and Google Play Store support. In addition to a Google Assistant button, the remote also features dedicated buttons for Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So your favorite show is just a click away. Measuring 92.4 x 30.2 x 15.2 mm, the Xiaomi Mi TV Stick weighs 28.5 grams. </p>
<p> Xiaomi also has a 4K version of the Mi TV Stick. It is slightly better specced with Xiaomi offering more RAM (2GB), more powerful processor, a USB Type-C port, and 4K output, obviously. </p>
<p> The pricing details of this model are not yet known. But with Xiaomi expected to launch the Mi TV Stick soon, it won't be a too-long wait now. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi TV Stick Appeared In Unboxing Photos Ahead Of Launch </p>
<p> Xiaomi has long been rumored to launch the Amazon Fire TV Stick alternative. The Mi TV Stick has already been featured in several leaks. Now, it was also listed on a couple of benchmarking websites. </p>
<p> Additionally, the leaked unboxing photos of the Mi TV Stick have also surfaced online. Apart from the pricing, we knew everything about it before the official announcement. </p>
<p> Mi TV Stick unboxing photos leak out in all its glory </p>
<p> Regarding the in-box content, there's a Mi TV Stick itself along with a voice-enabled remote controller, an adapter, and a MicroUSB cable. The remote comes with dedicated buttons for Netflix, Prime Video, and Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It looks identical to the remote controller offered with the Mi Box S. The maximum resolution output on the Mi TV Stick is limited to 1080p at 60 FPS. Under the hood is the Amlogic S805Y quad-core processor coupled with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. </p>
<p> As per the earlier leaks, the company might also launch a 4K version of the Mi TV Stick at a slightly higher price point. </p>
<p> It will also include double the amount of RAM. Like the previously launched Mi Box 3 and Mi Box S, the Mi TV Stick also runs on the stock Android TV interface. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Benchmark test suggests it might support Dolby Vision </p>
<p> With Widevine L1 certification, it will offer HD playback on popular streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video. </p>
<p> As per the DRM Info app, the Mi TV Stick supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision. However, this information is nowhere mentioned on the box. It supports both DTS-HD and Dolby Stereo Sound for superior audio output. </p>
<p> On Geekbench, the Mi TV Stick with the model number "MiTV-AESP0" scored 547 on single-core and 1,482 on multi-core tests. Coming to Antutu, it scored an overall 36,436 points. For comparison, the Mi Box S has scored 31,669 points. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Since the device can't be activated before July 15th, the tests have been done in offline mode. Apart from the popular Fire TV Stick 4K, the new Mi TV Stick is also expected to compete with the upcoming Android TV stick from Google codenamed Sabrina. </p>
<p> With a cheaper price tag, Xiaomi might have an advantage when compared to other feature-rich alternatives. </p>
<p> If not with the Full HD version, we expect the Mi TV Stick 4K to come with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support. These features are available on the two-year-old Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K. </p>

<p> Xiaomi On The Rise As The US Sanctions Paralyze Huawei </p>
<p> It's no secret that Huawei's smartphone business is under threat because of the US sanctions. The effects of those restrictions have now started to show up in the company's sales figures. After briefly overtaking Samsung as the world's largest smartphone vendor in April, when lockdown measures against the COVID-19 pandemic had hampered Samsung's sales, the beleaguered Chinese giant is now falling steeply down the ladder. </p>
<p> According to a recent report by market research firm Counterpoint Research, Huawei's global smartphone market share fell to 16 percent in August. The company had captured 21 percent of the market in April. The firm estimates Huawei's sales to fall further in the future, as the Trump administration tightens its grip on the company. </p>
<p> Samsung, on the other hand, saw its market share increase from 20 percent in April to 22 percent in August. The South Korean conglomerate is now back holding that No. 1 crown it has held for years. Apple's market share remained unchanged at 12 percent, as it was largely an off-season period for the iPhone maker. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Samsung's growth was pretty much expected given its sheer global brand value. But it's Xiaomi that's benefitting significantly from Huawei's unfortunate situation. The Chinese company was the fourth-largest global smartphone maker in August this year, following Samsung, Huawei, and Apple. Its market share grew from eight percent in April to 11 percent in August. </p>
<p> According to the report, Xiaomi is making big inroads in markets where Huawei had a strong presence. The company is showing a significant increase in markets such as Central Eastern Europe. </p>
<p> The US sanctions on Huawei playing into the hands of Xiaomi and others </p>
<p> Huawei's steep decline doesn't come as a surprise. A string of US-imposed restrictions has paralyzed the Chinese company to an extent that the immediate survival of its smartphone business is now under threat. The Mate 40 series could well be the last big Huawei smartphone launch unless some major changes happen over the next few months. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The global smartphone business could see double-digit growth in 2021 after slow sales this year. However, analysts expect the opposite for Huawei. According to a DigiTimes Research report earlier this month, the company that was at the very top a few months ago could fall all the way down to the seventh spot next year. </p>
<p> Counterpoint Research expects the US sanctions on Huawei to help existing big companies more, rather than paving way for new entrants to make inroads. "Geopolitical policies and political affairs among nations are affecting the smartphone market in many ways. There will be heightened marketing activity to seize opportunities in these regions and segments. As a result, the concentration of top players in the smartphone market will be much stronger. We see players like Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi and OPPO benefiting the most," said analyst Minsoo Kang in a press release. </p>

<p> Xiaomi's Fire TV Stick Killer Just Leaked Again </p>
<p> The upcoming Mi TV Stick from Xiaomi was already listed on Chinese reseller websites a while ago. Now, the updated listing hints the Xiaomi's streaming device will be coming in two different variants — Mi TV Stick FHD and Mi TV Stick 4K. </p>
<p> As the name suggests, the Mi TV Stick 4K will support streaming in 4K resolution. On the other hand, the non-4K variant will be limited to Full HD streaming. Coming to the pricing, the Full HD and 4K variants will reportedly cost $49 and $133 respectively. </p>
<p> Xiaomi to launch Mi TV Stick in Full HD and 4K variants </p>
<p> The search page on the Gearbest website earlier showed the price of the Mi TV Stick as $80. We don't think the Mi TV Stick 4K will cost more than double of the Full HD variant. The official pricing will be known only when Xiaomi officially launches it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the Full HD variant will feature 1GB of RAM, the 4K variant packs double the amount of RAM, i.e., 2GB. Other specifications remain the same on both the variants. The Mi TV Stick comes with Chromecast built-in and supports Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Moreover, the Bluetooth remote control features dedicated buttons for Google Assistant, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video. It also supports Dolby Audio and DTS Surround Sound. The unboxing video of the Full HD variant of the Mi TV Stick also surfaced online. </p>
<p> The streaming stick runs on stock Android TV OS </p>
<p> Unlike the Mi TVs, which run on the custom PatchWall UI, the streaming devices from Xiaomi comes with stock Android TV OS. Even the new Mi TV Stick runs on Android 9.0 TV OS out of the box. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In terms of performance, the 4K variant seems to sport a superiors quad-core processor than the one found on the Full HD variant. Both the variants offer 8GB of eMMC storage. Also, the Full HD variant lacks the dual WiFi support. </p>
<p> It includes an HDMI port for connecting to the TV and a MicroUSB port for supplying the power. The specifications of the Mi TV Stick are similar to that of the Mi Box S launched in 2018. </p>
<p> Since the Mi Box S was officially launched in the US, we also expect the company to launch the upcoming Mi TV Stick as well. It competes with the Amazon Fire TV Stick and Google's upcoming Android TV dongle codenamed Sabrina. The successor to the Chromecast Ultra also comes bundled with remote control. </p>

<p> Yeelight And Razer Team Up For Colorful Game Lighting </p>
<p> Razer makes some of the most colorful gaming products around and now Yeelight can be a part of that. </p>
<p> The former is gaming's premiere lifestyle brand. The latter is a smart home lighting solution. Now the two are working together to make your gaming setup more colorful. How you ask? Through Razer Chroma. </p>
<p> Earlier this month, Yeeelight officially announced that its color light bulbs and lightstrips would be compatible with the Razer Chroma Connector. Allowing you to sync those products up with your gaming experience and other Razer Chroma-powered peripherals. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The more Razer Chroma peripherals you have, the better the lighting experience. Especially with room lights to help make your gaming sessions more ambient and more immersive. </p>
<p> Yeelight color bulbs and lightstrips now support Razer Chroma </p>
<p> While the Yeelight color products are now compatible with Razer Chroma, things don't just work right out of the box. </p>
<p> There are a few things you need to do to get everything set up and working properly. Also worth noting is that this compatibility doesn't just include Yeelight's color bulbs and lightstrips. It also includes Yeelight's color lamps. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In terms of the setup, you have to integrate the lights with the Chroma Connector and make sure you're on the latest version of the Synapse 3 software. Which is how all of Razer's peripherals and settings are managed. At least for any of the newer products from around 2017 onward. </p>
<p> Announced at RazerCon 2020, available now </p>
<p> To get this entire setup working, everything you need is already available. </p>
<p> Razer and Yeelight announced the compatibility at RazerCon 2020. And all the tools are available as of right now. The Yeelight products have been available on the market for a while. Razer Synapse 3 has also been available for a few years. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> All that wasn't available was the Chroma Connector for Yeelight. That was however just recently launched. Which means if you've got a mind to sync up your game lights, there's not a whole lot holding you back. </p>
<p> Worth mentioning is that Yeelight color bulbs and lightstrips are a fraction of the cost of competing products. Both Philips Hue and LIFX RGB lighting products are much more expensive. </p>
<p> So thanks to this partnership between the two companies, you can get Chroma lighting for your entire game room for a lot less than before. A single Yeelight color bulb runs for about $30. Meanwhile the lightstrip kit runs for about $70 but it's on sale right now on Amazon for $53. Both also work with Alexa and Google Assistant. </p>

<p> You Can Now Link Your AT&T Number To Your Amazon Echo </p>
<p> As part of a new partnership, you can now link your AT&T phone number to your Amazon Echo. As reported by The Verge this allows you to turn your Echo into a phone. </p>
<p> AT&T has recently made its low-band 5G network available nationwide across America after it met FCC standards. The Amazon Echo is also currently heavily discounted to under $75 dollars making it a much more attractive prospect. </p>
<p> This partnership should allow users to link their phone numbers to an Alexa account. Thus making it possible to make and receive calls via Alexa connected devices. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Alexa partnership links your AT&T phone number to devices </p>
<p> This move is an expansion of the existing Alexa calling feature. This first launched back in 2017 but now is a more useful and efficient prospect. </p>
<p> Back then it allowed users to use their Echo devices to call mobiles and landlines for free. The difference now is that Amazon is working much more closely with AT&T to use its Echo devices much more similar to how they would use their mobile phones. </p>
<p> This is not the first time we have seen this feature. It rolled out overseas in the UK and Germany for Vodafone OneNumber customers. If you live in the UK you can also use this feature if you are a customer of EE. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> This, however, marks the first time the feature has become available in the United States. The reason for the slightly haphazard rollout is that it requires a close partnership with a mobile phone carrier to work properly. </p>
<p> Linking your AT&T number is a very simple move </p>
<p> Amazon claims that linking your AT&T phone number to an Echo device is a very simple process. To make it happen you have to go onto the Alexa App on your phone. Then head to settings, select the communication sub-menu, hit the AT&T button, and then just follow the instructions. </p>
<p> After you have linked your account you can dial numbers through voice commands. They would take the form of instructions like “Alexa, call Mom”. Alternatively, you can specifically dictate a phone number. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When you have an incoming call on your Alexa it will come complete with caller ID. To receive you can use voice commands like “Alexa, answer". </p>
<p> Calls can also be snoozed with by activating Amazon’s Away Mode. This is an existing feature the Echo already possesses. Using Alexa routines you can also toggle specific times calls can be made and received. </p>
<p> Overall, this looks like an exciting move for AT&T customers. Whether this partnership is exclusive is currently unknown. So at this stage we cannot say whether this feature will come to any other carriers at any stage. </p>

<p> YouTube Continues To Tackle Misinformation By Targeting QAnon </p>
<p> YouTube has announced a partial ban on the content which QAnon produces to curb the spread of misinformation. As announced by a company blog post this mostly relates the mass delusion under the company's hate and harassment policy. </p>
<p> YouTube can have a significant impact on the way misinformation and hate speech spreads on its platform due to its suggestions system which has negatively effected QAnon on the platform. The company began actively fact-checking in the U.S back in April with some success. </p>
<p> YouTube has also introduced a Covid-19 news shelf full of trustworthy content. This is another move to try and curb the spread of misinformation. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now the company has gone one further with a ban on much of the content QAnon produces. This ban does not cover all of QAnon's content unlike the bans imposed by Facebook and Twitter more recently. </p>
<p> However, YouTube believes that this targeted system is more appropriate. The company also believes that it has successfully decreased QAnon's views by removing it from any suggestions. </p>
<p> YouTube introduces partial QAnon ban </p>
<p> As reported by Buzzfeed, QAnon possesses a wide-ranging set of beliefs. Some believe that a cabal of satanic elites rule the world whilst many are opposed to coronavirus restrictions or do not believe the virus exists at all. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> YouTube has put a ban on any of their content which can be "used to justify real-world violence." The company announcement uses the example of "content that threatens or harasses someone by suggesting they are complicit in one of these harmful conspiracies". </p>
<p> For a long time now YouTube has been a key platform for QAnon believes to voice their beliefs and spread them. However, now some of the biggest accounts have begun to disappear as a result of this ban. YouTube said it would continue to enforce in the coming weeks. </p>
<p> The main reason for this focus on QAnon so recently is its association with several violent acts both across the US. The FBI has described them as a domestic terrorist threat. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> YouTube more successfully fighting misinformation </p>
<p> Many social media companies have struggled to stop the spread of misinformation on their platforms. Taking down posts is fine but it often spreads to fast for moderators to stop. </p>
<p> However, due to the nature of YouTube, it is able to limit the views certain content gets without having to remove the post. YouTube claims that over the last two years, content it claims to contain misinformation has seen a 70% drop in views. </p>
<p> Since January 2019 views from non-subscribed recommendations to prominent Q-related channels dropped by over 80%. This demonstrates how YouTube can more effectively hide content compared to other platforms. </p>

<p> This Isn't The YouTube Music For Android TV You Were Looking For </p>
<p> YouTube Music is finally available for Android TV but it may not be what users expected or hoped for. That's because Google has effectively snuck the app into the standard YouTube app as a server-side update. That's good news for those who were waiting for it. All that's required is an update to YouTube for Android TV. But, as reported by Android Police, the integration is not necessarily clean or user-friendly. </p>
<p> What are the problems of YouTube Music integration for Android TV? </p>
<p> The biggest caveat, of course, is that the integration leaves a long list of features that are missing from the primary YouTube Music app. But there's also a problem with the fact that it isn't a standalone app. Instead, YouTube Music is just a "Music" tab in the YouTube app. That even has the former app's logo. That means that users can't exit the app and continue playback, as they can with a premium subscription to the YouTube Music app for mobile. </p>
<p> It also means that none of the playlist management features are available at all. Users can't even create new playlists or add songs to a playlist. And selecting a playlist that's already been created for playback doesn't show everything in the playlist. It only shows the currently-playing song and upcoming tracks are laid out below. Trying to add songs only offers options from the associated YouTube account, not YouTube Music. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The UI is almost identical to that used for upcoming videos in a playlist. There's no way to reorganize or remove titles. </p>
<p> Similarly, there's no way to shuffle or repeat songs. No toggle is present for toggling off videos. And users aren't given access to all of their songs either. That includes uploaded music or libraries. </p>
<p> Lastly, lyrics don't show and can't be played back by users on Android TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So what exactly does this offer users? </p>
<p> Now, it's not all bad news for YouTube Music subscribers here. Google may plan to roll out a wide-spanning update to bring all of the missing features over. Or it could plan to release a full YouTube Music app. This current iteration could simply serve as a way for users to listen at least in the meantime. And there are plenty of features that YouTube Music users will appreciate too. </p>
<p> For starters, the page is organized into categories. That includes playlists from users that are subscribed to, an algorithmically created set of playlists — including music the user has "liked" — and mood- or genre-based stations. Playlists that were already made on the dedicated app elsewhere. And stations based on artists. </p>
<p> There's also the fact that YouTube-integrated Music starts playback instantly, without the need to select tracks first. Users just need to highlight a selection and playback starts. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / YouTube Music Playlists Are Available To Download As A Free User </p>
<p> YouTube Music Playlists Are Available To Download As A Free User </p>
<p> YouTube Music will now allow free users to download playlists that contain uploaded songs. As reported by Android Police, this adds another dimension to being a free user of YouTube Music. </p>
<p> YouTube Music has been adding new features left, right and center since the migration over from Google Play Music. That process did not prove to be as successful as hoped so some of these features have acted as a bit of a sweetener to new users. </p>
<p> Some of these new features have included some new additions to make its TV experience more satisfying. The platform also began working on a new setting to separate liked videos from the Music and the main client. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Now it looks like YouTube Music is trying to add more functionality for its free users. In an attempt to capture a wide audience. This new feature will give them more freedom over what they can download and listen to offline. </p>
<p> YouTube Music free users can now download playlists with uploaded tracks </p>
<p> Previously, free users could download uploaded music but had to do so with each song individually. This meant that even playlists containing your own music transferred from GPM. Downloading playlists was not supported but now that has changed giving greater freedom to these users. </p>
<p> The reason why this will please so many is the fact that personal uploads were a central part of Google Play Music. Making a similar sort of functionality available to free users on YouTube Music is a big step as it brings the platform in line with what was previously offered with Google Play. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> YouTube added support for uploads last year but the system was quite lackluster in many ways. Google Play Music offered much more in the way of options and customizations. Now it looks like YouTube Music has turned this around somewhat. </p>
<p> The new feature appears to work in both iOS and Android which is pleasing to see. Often these sorts of updates take quite a while to roll out and do some in a haphazard way which can be annoying. </p>
<p> However, this does not appear to be the case in this situation with it available to all right way. Hopefully, YouTube will go further with this feature and make it possible to edit uploaded track metadata as Google Play used to. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Given YouTube's current trajectory with the number of new features coming out, this may well happen soon. It will also be interesting to see what else the platform offers in the near future as it has shown no signs of slowing down as yet. </p>

<p> Android Apps & Games / YouTube Music Finally Supports Google Assistant & Android TV </p>
<p> YouTube Music Finally Supports Google Assistant & Android TV </p>
<p> Last month, Google made YouTube Music available on Android TV through its YouTube app. The company has now announced a dedicated YouTube Music Android TV app along with a few new features. </p>
<p> Google is set to wholly replace Google Play Music with the new YouTube Music service. Though it lacked several features initially, the company is gradually updating the app and its features. </p>
<p> Google Assistant now works with YouTube Music </p>
<p> First off, YouTube Music gets support for Google Assistant. Using the command "Hey Google, play recommended music from YouTube Music," the users can play favorite songs on their smartphone or smart speaker. Based on the user's listening history, the app offers personalized music suggestions across favorite artists and genres. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Speaking of the YouTube Music app for Android TV, it's merely a shortcut to the Music section of the YouTube app. Furthermore, it still lacks basic features for any music app like search and background playback. Google has to come up with a full-fledged Android TV app to compete with rivals like Spotify. </p>
<p> Youtube Music gets a dedicated Android TV app </p>
<p> The company should note that a video streaming app is not the preferred choice for a music streaming service. This new app could be a temporary solution until Google comes up with a completely redesigned YouTube Music app for Android TV. Waze got the YouTube Music integration in August 2019. Now, in August 2020, Google is bringing a similar integration to Google Maps. </p>
<p> However, this integration for Google Maps and Waze will only be available to YouTube Music paying customers. With this, the user can quickly pause or skip the song while navigating. Google first introduced media playback controls within the Maps app in 2018. It supports multiple streaming services like Google Play Music, Apple Music, and Spotify. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> YouTube Music support for Google Maps was first spotted in June this year. Now comes the official confirmation for the integration within both the Google Maps and Waze apps. A few days back, Google also added the "Recent activity" section which shows the history just like the “Recents” section in Google Play Music. </p>
<p> Even with all these newly added features, YouTube Music still misses key features in comparison to Google Play Music. In the last few months, Google has added several new features to YouTube Music from Google Play Music. However, it needs to do a lot more to make YouTube Music stay in competition with Spotify and Apple Music. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2020/10/youtube-testing-new-share-menu-app.html" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483597" filename="youtube-testing-new-share-menu-app.html">
<p> YouTube Is Testing A New Share Menu Within The App </p>
<p> Joining the likes of Google Photos and Twitter, YouTube is also spotted testing the new share menu within the application. It seems like YouTube did not want to be left out in this new feature. </p>
<p> The company has recently been spotted testing a new YouTube Share Menu. It basically pops-up when you want to send a link to a video via the YouTube app. </p>
<p> Interesting this is that, while Google Photos and Twitter adapted a long list of options under the share menu, YouTube has reduced it to a few. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Notably, the current YouTube share menu lets you send video links via all supported apps. In fact, it also includes options like copy-link, Bluetooth, and Nearby Share. </p>
<p> However, the current YouTube share menu is although identical to what we have, but it gets rid of several options. Some people have reported seeing only options like copy-link, Bluetooth, and Nearby Share. </p>
<p> While others have reported seeing one or two of the supported apps along with the copy-link, Bluetooth, and Nearby Share options. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As Android Police highlights, a few apps that they were able to see where Firefox and Firefox Nightly, Synology DS File app. So, it seems like the apps are appearing randomly. </p>
<p> YouTube share menu is showing up for some via a server-side update </p>
<p> Before you hop onto your phone and check for this new share menu, note that this is showing up for some users. Moreover, it has been triggered via a server-side update. </p>
<p> Meaning that the testing is being done with a small number of people. Whatever it may be, the reduction of share menu options seems an unintentional change. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Because, why would YouTube like to limit user's options of sharing the videos? Besides, there is no option to show up the native share menu or expand the list of share items. </p>
<p> If you have received this server-side update and you are not at all happy with the new share menu, then you can always switch back to the old version from sources like APK Mirror. </p>
<p> Make sure to download the YouTube app version 15.40.40. We only expect this reduced share options to be a bug and fixed as soon as possible by YouTube. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Recently, we have reported that Google wants YouTube into a shopping destination. Creators will be given control to showcase which products they want to showcase on their channel. For more info, you can head here. </p>
<p> We hope that YouTube remains as sane as it is today. And the share menu gets a bit of tweaking to show more menu opinions rather than this compressed one. </p>

<p> YouTube TV: Price, Supported Devices, Channels, Cloud DVR & More </p>
<p> YouTube TV is Google's own streaming live TV service. And it offers over 85 channels, live. </p>
<p> This product was designed for those that are looking to cut the cord from cable and be able to still watch cable channels. Without being tethered to their cable box, and be able to watch it anywhere. </p>
<p> YouTube TV is heralded as one of the best streaming live TV services on the market right now, despite the pretty regular price increases it has seen. It now costs $64.99 per month, after costing just $35 a few years ago. It's the only streaming service that has PBS, and it is also the only one with an unlimited cloud DVR service. Making this a really incredible service for those that are looking to cut the cord from Comcast, Cox, AT&T, Verizon and other cable operators. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What is YouTube TV? And should you ditch cable for Google's TV service? We'll attempt to answer that, as well as other questions, like the cost, cloud DVR limitations, multiple screen limitations and more. Here's everything you need to know about YouTube TV. </p>
<p> Table of contents </p>
<p> What is YouTube TV? </p>
<p> YouTube TV is Google's attempt at capturing the cord-cutting audience. It's a streaming Live TV service that offers 85+ channels, and continues to add more every few months. It also has YouTube Originals available. </p>
<p> YouTube TV initially launched in 2017, and it was restricted to a handful of markets in the US. The reason for the slow rollout, was gathering all local channels. Google did not want to launch in a market that did not have all of the locals. That includes ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX. Initially, Google was offering around 60 channels for $35 per month. In 2018, ahead of its nationwide launch, it increased prices from $35 to $40, but those that got in on the $35 price were grandfathered in. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In 2019, Google made YouTube TV available in all 210 markets in the US. It also added nine networks from Discovery, and raised the price from $40 to $50 per month. This also ended the grandfathered-in pricing for those that were paying $35. Google forced everyone to start paying $50. </p>
<p> In 2020, YouTube TV was able to strike a deal with ViacomCBS to bring over their channels to the service. Bringing over all of their channels meant another price increase. Going from $50 to $65 per month, and bringing the total number of channels to 85+. </p>
<p> YouTube TV is pretty unique for a couple of features that it offers and most of its competitors do not. The biggest one being an unlimited Cloud DVR. Allowing you to record just about everything. The other big feature is it's availability. It's available on almost any platform. </p>
<p> How much does it cost? </p>
<p> YouTube TV costs $64.99 per month for the base package. That includes 85+ channels, and all of its features. </p>
<p> There are some premium networks you can add-on, as well as the Sports Plus package. Sports Plus is priced at $10.99 per month and gives you an additional eight networks. The premium networks that are available include HBO and HBO MAX for $14.99. Showtime for $11/month, STARZ for $7/month, Cinemax for $10, Epix for $6/month, Curiosity Stream for $3, AMC Premiere for $5, Shudder for $6, Sundance Now for $7, Urban Movie Channel for $5 and AcornTV for $6. These all come with a free trial, anywhere from five days to 14 days. So it's pretty easy to check out these premium channels before paying for them. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What devices are supported? </p>
<p> YouTube TV is available on a large variety of devices right now, and it is still adding more to its list. </p>
<p> As of today, YouTube TV is available on Android, iOS, Android TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, Fire TV, Roku OS, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. As far as smart TVs go, it is available on many smart TVs from LG, Samsung, Hisense, Sharp, TCL and VIZIO that are 2016 and newer. Not to mention the fact that any TV that has Android TV, Roku or Fire TV built-in will also work – which includes almost every Hisense and TCL Smart TV from recent years. </p>
<p> On September 30, Google announced that the new Chromecast with Google TV will have a pretty tight integration with YouTube TV. With a new "Live" tab on the home screen that shows the current TV listings for what is live. At launch, only YouTube TV works with this tab, but Google plans to add more to that tab in the future. Like Sling TV, FuboTV and others. </p>
<p> What channels are offered? </p>
<p> YouTube TV has steadily been adding new channels to its service since its inception in 2017. Currently it has over 85 channels, and covers the majority of the top 100 most popular cable channels. </p>
<p> Recent YouTube TV changes </p>
<p> YouTube TV added ViacomCBS channels: BET, CMT, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network, TV Land, and VH1. Five of the 14 ViacomCBS channels have not yet arrived on YouTube TV, but will be very soon. Those include BET Her, MTV2, Nick Jr, Nicktoons, TeenNick and MTV Classic. </p>
<p> YouTube TV lost all Fox regional sports networks on October 1: After trying to renegotiate with Sinclair following its extension, YouTube TV lost access to all Fox regional sports networks. These include: Fox Sports Arizona, Fox Sports Carolinas, Fox Sports Detroit, Fox Sports Florida, Fox Sports Indiana, Fox Sports Kansas City, Fox Sports Midwest, Fox Sports New Orleans, Fox Sports North, Fox Sports Ohio, Fox Sports Oklahoma, Fox Sports Prime Ticket, Fox Sports San Diego, Fox Sports South, Fox Sports Southeast, Fox Sports Southwest, Fox Sports Sun, Fox Sports Tennessee, Fox Sports West, Fox Sports Wisconsin, SportsTime Ohio, and the YES Network. It's worth noting that Fox, FS1 and FS2 will remain on YouTube TV though. </p>
<p> NFL Network came to YouTube TV in September 2020: Without any sort of price increase. </p>
<p> YouTube TV debuted new Sports Plus package in September 2020: YouTube TV debuted its first add-on package in September with Sports Plus. For $10.99 per month you can add NFL RedZone, Fox College Sports, GolTV, TVG, MAV, Stadium and Fox Soccer Plus. </p>
<p> What features does YouTube TV have? </p>
<p> YouTube TV has a number of great features, some of which none of its competitors even have. As a result, it really helps make it stand out among the competition. Here are some of the bigger features for YouTube TV. </p>
<p> Cloud DVR </p>
<p> By far the most popular feature for YouTube TV is its unlimited Cloud DVR. Which is included in the $64.99 price. </p>
<p> Because it is unlimited, you can record virtually anything and everything on YouTube TV, and watch it later. You can also record as many shows at the same time as you want. Something that is not possible with traditional TV. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Finally, with YouTube TV, you can also opt to start from the beginning or join live, if it is a show that you are recording. So if you come home late to watch The Masked Singer that starts at 8PM, you can start from the beginning and fast-forward through commercials until you catch up to the live recording. It is a really useful feature to have. </p>
<p> Multiple Users </p>
<p> Another feature that sets YouTube TV apart is multiple users. Most streaming services do have multiple users support, but not quite in the same way. </p>
<p> With YouTube TV, you can invite up to five people to your subscription. So instead of sharing your password with other people, they can sign in with their own Google account. That is much smarter than sharing passwords, especially for something like your Google account, which is used for almost everything on the web. </p>
<p> While you can have up to five accounts on your YouTube TV account, you are still limited to only three simultaneous streams on YouTube TV. So not everyone can watch at the same time. But three screens is also more than its competitors offer, without paying for an upgraded plan. </p>
<p> Voice Control via Google Assistant </p>
<p> As expected, YouTube TV is integrated with Google Assistant. So if you have a Google Assistant device like a Nest Mini or Nest Audio, you can use it to start YouTube TV on your TV. If you have a Chromecast or Nest Home Hub, you can tell the Assistant to start playing YouTube TV on that screen. </p>
<p> You also have the ability to control other functions, like selecting a TV channel to watch live, starting a show, recording a show and even using playback functions like pause, resume and rewind. </p>
<p> On-Demand </p>
<p> YouTube TV does have an on-demand section of different movies and TV shows. If something you recorded is available as on-demand, you can choose between those two options. For example, if election coverage interrupted your recording of Ellen's Game of Games, you can opt to watch the on-demand version instead. </p>
<p> The main difference between on-demand and DVR though, is that you cannot fast-forward through commercials on on-demand content. Though some won't have commercials – like FOX shows for some reason. On DVR content, you can fast-forward or rewind to your heart's content. </p>
<p> Picture-in-Picture on Mobile </p>
<p> Surprisingly, most other streaming live TV services do not offer this feature, but YouTube TV allows you to do picture-in-picture on mobile. So you can continue watching your show while you are on Twitter or Facebook, or replying to your friend's text message. </p>
<p> This works on Android smartphones and tablets. However, it doesn't yet work on iOS. It'll work on iPads and iPhones starting with iOS 14. </p>
<p> Dark Mode </p>
<p> As with everything these days, there is a dark mode for YouTube TV on both desktop and mobile. This can be very useful for when you are watching TV or scrolling through the app at night or in a dark room. </p>
<p> Mark shows as viewed </p>
<p> Since you can't "delete" shows from your DVR – they will auto-delete after nine months, and be replaced with a newer recording if that show played on TV again – mark as viewed is really useful. </p>
<p> You can "Mark as Watched" on any movie or TV show on YouTube TV, from the desktop or mobile versions of the service. This means that it won't show up as "new" in your library any longer. As a result, it makes it easier to view your new shows in your library, to catch up on what's new. </p>
<p> No offline viewing </p>
<p> This is likely no real surprise, but YouTube TV does not allow for offline viewing. Most streaming Live TV services do not allow for this, since it is live. But it would be nice to be able to download your DVR'd content to watch offline, if you are going to be flying somewhere with no internet, or taking the subway to work. Hulu with Live TV does it, but there are some serious caveats to it. </p>
<p> Is YouTube TV worth it? </p>
<p> When you look at the channels and the pricing of YouTube TV, it is a pretty good deal. The only downside here is that there's no telling when the price may go up again. But if the recent Sports Plus package addition is anything to go by, it looks like Google is planning to add some more premium packages. Instead of giving everyone, every single channel and just raising the price. </p>
<p> I am a subscriber of YouTube TV and have been since almost the beginning, so my opinion here is a little bit biased, but I feel that this is the best value. There's over 85 channels here, including the majority of the top 100 cable channels available. As well as cloud DVR, where you can save literally everything (and I do) to watch later. Not to mention the fact that it is available on almost every platform you can think of. </p>
<p> If you're looking to check out YouTube TV, use this free trial to check it out before paying for it. Google gives everyone a free seven-day trial. But right now, if you sign up before October 15, 2020, you can get that doubled to 14 days. </p>

<p> Reviews / Zhiyun Smooth XS Review – A More Affordable Mobile Gimbal For The Rest Of Us? </p>
<p> Zhiyun Smooth XS Review – A More Affordable Mobile Gimbal For The Rest Of Us? </p>
<p> Zhiyun Smooth XS is a great tripod and gimbal for smartphones, designed to take on the biggest names in the industry at a fraction of the cost. </p>
<p> Lightweight plastics and squishy buttons take away from the design </p>
<p> Too easy to knock over in tripod mode due to lightweight build </p>
<p> Has difficulty connecting to the app via Bluetooth on the first connection </p>
<p> Can't easily connect to and switch between multiple devices </p>
<p> Two-axis stabilization instead of three-axis </p>
<p> 3-hours to charge </p>
<p> App needs some work, especially in landscape orientation </p>
<p> With a typical cost of over $150, gimbals can be expensive but Zhiyun Smooth XS, recently sent out for review, is trying to change that. As a two-axis gimbal, it isn't the most stabilizing device around. And it isn't made of the most premium materials either. There are missing features as well. But this is, at $74.99, the Zhiyun Smooth XS doubles as a tripod and delivers app-related features by the armful too. </p>
<p> Zhiyun packed Smooth XS with just about every feature needed to get started with a professional-grade photo and video hardware for mobile cameras. All of that in a lightweight package that costs less than half of what the competition charges. And it's got buttery smooth motions to match. So let's take a closer look at what makes Zhiyun Smooth XS great. And where it's not so great </p>
<p> Zhiyun Smooth XS hardware is obviously not made to feel premium </p>
<p> Upon opening my review unit, it became immediately clear that Zhiyun wants its Smooth XS gimbal to be a high-value product. The company packs the device with quite a bit of extra hardware aside from the handheld unit. For instance, there's an extension handle that at once acts as a selfie stick and tripod. That screws onto the bottom of the gimbal, in the same slot a standard tripod can be mounted. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A charging cable is included as a pack-in too, but no wall adapter. As is a lanyard and a cloth carry bag. All of that goes a long way toward making this feel like a better deal. Especially since the gimbal itself is made out of plastics. </p>
<p> Now, that's not an expensive plastic either. It feels solid in-hand and doesn't creak or bend much. But it's also exceptionally lightweight and doesn't necessarily feel premium as a result. In fact, it almost feels like the device is going to fall over when a phone is mounted in tripod mode. Although the tripod is tipped with rubber feet to prevent slipping, the legs themselves are a honeycomb-patterned hollow design. </p>
<p> Similarly, the control stick and slider for zooming in or out feel somewhat more squishy than I'd liked to have seen. And the recording button and the "M" multi-purpose button, as well as the power button, feel squishy too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The sliding vertical arm feels so stable and locks into place tightly with a "click." The power plug also clicks snugly into place. So the buttons and control stick feel out of place. They just don't feel as premium as those two elements do. </p>
<p> The phone holder, on the other hand, is well-designed. It's coated in a rubbery material to prevent damage to the phone and it holds the phone firmly in place. </p>
<p> The mechanisms for moving the phone along its two-axis — that's left and right rotating horizontally and in a circular motion — are smooth and clean without jitter under most circumstances. And it doesn't feel as though it would be easy to break those. Although the manual does warn about over twisting them. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Connectivity with Zhiyun Smooth XS is okay if you don't use multiple phones </p>
<p> Connectivity is another place the Smooth XS from Zhiyun immediately felt like a less expensive gimbal under review. Not only did the device have a difficult time finding the phone to connect to in-app. It had a hard time reconnecting and switching across multiple devices when I wanted to switch between phones. </p>
<p> In the first instance, the problem only arises on initial syncing. The app is used to look for the device and to connect to it. And once the connection is established it never wavers. And it also has no problem reconnecting later on to the same smartphone. But the initial connection, across every device I tested with this gimbal, took a long time. More than 5 minutes, all told. </p>
<p> Connecting to multiple smartphones for quick switching isn't a possibility either. In fact, it took the same amount of time for switching as an initial connection when it did connect. And Bluetooth on one device needs to be turned off entirely for it to connect to another. Otherwise, the Zhiyun Smooth XS will just keep reconnecting to the previous gadget. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As noted above, once connected, that connection does remain solid throughout use. The gimbal responds in well under a second to commands from the controls. And it will even auto-connect without opening the app, whenever the gimbal is turned on and the phone has its Bluetooth turned on. It's just not the easiest task when it comes to getting set up or switching between smartphones. </p>
<p> The app here is both a big plus and a serious caveat </p>
<p> We've already covered at least one shortcoming the Zhiyun Smooth XS exhibits under review, with regard to its required ZY Cami app. That's the fact that this gimbal will only work with that one app. But the app does, at the very least, not try to override the basic code underlying the camera. So, in most cases, the quality of shots should remain the same. </p>
<p> The biggest shortcoming of the app then is that it has a design that can be easy to misread and is filled with bloat. For instance, in light mode, the main text is grey and the icons are white with a glowing outline. In dark mode, they're the reverse. In either mode, it isn't an easy-to-read UI. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But there's also a lot of UI, to begin with, matching up with a ton of features. And the UI, more often than not, seems to default to being upside down on Android. At least in landscape mode. It didn't matter how I placed the phone in the gimbal either. It always reverted to being upside down. </p>
<p> Aside from that, and the fact that walking with this gimbal doesn't result in the best shots due to the two-axis-only approach, the features in the app are genuinely great. </p>
<p> For instance, Zhiyun includes a "Smart" mode that provides a guided way to create a montage of short clips for specific purposes. That mode even allows users to save multiple drafts. Once completed, the system compiles everything together into one clip. "Live" mode, conversely, is for streamers who need to put media out on the fly. Hyperlapse, Timelapse, and Pano modes, on the other hand, are self-explanatory. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Each feature works as would be expected. And every mode, including photo and video mode, has its own special features ranging from user-selected focus points to beautification and pro image adjustments. </p>
<p> So how does this gimbal really work, in the real world </p>
<p> The real question, when it comes to a review of Zhiyun Smooth XS though, is how it performs in real-world use. And on that front, this gimbal effectively performed as expected. Setting aside that I often needed to rotate images after-the-fact because it shot them upside down, this gimbal does actually work. And it works well, aside from only rotating in two directions. </p>
<p> Now, competing gimbals can and do offer three-axis rotation but at a much higher cost. So as long as users aren't expecting to get the same performance there, this gimbal should do just fine. As hinted already above, Zhiyun Smooth XS rotates in a circular motion around the phone holder. It also rotates in a panning motion. Both of those motions are controllable via the built-in control stick. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> And, in both cases, the rotation is smooth and clean. So users can expect their videos and images to turn out just how they want them to. As long as they keep a steady hand in terms of tilt or motion in the up-and-down direction. </p>
<p> That goes for both in-hand and tripod captures too. While there are some features missing on the software side compared to competitors, this device is much more than a glorified selfie-stick. </p>
<p> Battery Life Zhiyun Smooth XS </p>
<p> One other drawback to this gimbal is that it requires its 1,000mAh battery to be charged up for use. But, on a positive note, the Zhiyun Smooth XS didn't seem to show any signs of slowing down or malfunctioning as the battery drained under review. </p>
<p> I was moderately concerned that would be a problem since the power is used to rotate and swivel the smartphone. And the smartphone is going to be almost as heavy as the overall gimbal too with a max phone weight of 235g to the gimbal's 250g. </p>
<p> The company claims, conversely that this gimbal has around a 4-hour operating time. And I found that to be mostly true, although it can last a bit longer than that with lighter use, such as locking it in place and then recording. Or a bit less if it's being rotated and swiveled the entire time. </p>
<p> Regardless, it takes around 3 hours to charge complete, filling up an array of four LED lights along the main body. The almost one-to-one ratio is almost certainly going to prove obnoxious for larger projects. But it should be plenty of time for recording or capturing short scenes and clips. Or for smaller projects. </p>
<p> Is Zhiyun Smooth XS really worth the cost? </p>
<p> As might be expected with a price under $75, Zhiyun Smooth XS is a less capable gimbal than some competitors. Especially compared to those at double the cost. For example, aD JI OM 4 gimbal. That's not just because it's a two-axis system compared to a three-axis one either. </p>
<p> The application is a pain when it comes to first-time use and exploring features just for starters. Although that does get much easier after a couple of sessions, Zhiyun Smooth XS also — at least for this reviewer — couldn't get the UI facing the right way up most of the time. </p>
<p> But that, and the other issues noted above, is something that could easily be fixed in a future update. Or are easy enough to work through. For example, it's easy enough to rotate media after-the-fact, so that it's right-side-up and that only happened in landscape orientation. </p>
<p> At the end of the day, gimbals aren't typically this inexpensive. At $74.99, Zhiyun is a good value that goes well beyond what a similarly-priced tripod would offer. And it offers additional features atop that, for those that already have a tripod can attach the gimbal to it. Coupled with stabilization in modern smartphone cameras, this device will result in much more stabilized shots as well. </p>
<p> Summarily, the Zhiyun Smooth XS is not going to be a great gimbal for professionals. No two-axis gimbal really can be. But it will be a great gimbal for aspiring beginners to start out with. Or for those who need something more portable and lightweight. At under $75, it's hard to argue this device isn't going to be worth every penny for those who are looking for just that. </p>

<p> Zoom To Roll Out End-to-End Encryption Next Week </p>
<p> Following through a promise it made a few months back, videoconferencing platform Zoom is all set to roll out end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to users. The feature will be available as a technical preview starting next week, the company announced on Wednesday. During this period, Zoom will be "proactively soliciting feedback from users for the first 30 days." </p>
<p> When the feature is available, Zoom users will be able to host up to 200 participants in an E2EE meeting. A green shield logo with a padlock in the upper left corner of the screen will indicate that the meeting is end-to-end encrypted. Users can also see and verify the host's security code to ensure that the connection is secure. </p>
<p> Hosts will be able to enable E2EE at the account, group, and user level, and can also lock the setting at the account or group level. Additionally, to join an E2EE-enabled meeting, customers must enable the setting at the account level and will require to opt-in on a per-meeting basis. </p>

<p> However, it'll be a phased rollout, and Phase 1 comes with some limitations. Firstly, all participants must join the meeting from the Zoom desktop client, mobile app, or Zoom Rooms. Users will also lose some features, including the ability to join before host, cloud recording, streaming, live transcription, Breakout Rooms, polling, and meeting reactions. E2EE will not be available for one-on-one private Zoom chats. </p>
<p> Zoom expects to begin Phase 2 of its E2EE rollout in 2021, but it doesn't detail an exact timeline. Better identity management and E2EE SSO integration are some of the features that'll arrive with Phase 2. There will be four phases in total. </p>

<p> Zoom users finally get end-to-end encryption </p>
<p> Zoom's unprecedented growth spurt following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has somewhat been plagued by security concerns. Over the past few months, the company has taken several measures to mitigate security risks. Now, with the addition of end-to-end encryption, it may earn some trust back. </p>
<p> The company had announced the E2EE plans in May, shortly after its acquisition of encryption startup Keybase. It initially wanted to offer E2EE to only paying customers. However, it quickly changed that decision after a backlash. The company now promises the same level of security to both paying and free users. </p>
<p> Zoom's E2EE uses the same GCM encryption you get currently in a Zoom meeting. However, the participants' machines now generate encryption keys. Earlier, Zoom's cloud would generate those security keys and distribute them to meeting participants. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While the keys are still distributed through Zoom's servers, they lack the decryption keys required to see the meeting contents. Only the participants of that particular meeting will be able to decrypt the contents. </p>
<p> "End-to-end encryption is another stride toward making Zoom the most secure communications platform in the world," said Zoom CEO Eric S. Yuan. "This phase of our E2EE offering provides the same security as existing end-to-end-encrypted messaging platforms, but with the video quality and scale that has made Zoom the communications solution of choice for hundreds of millions of people and the world’s largest enterprises." </p>
