<p> 23+ Best Ad Blocker for Android to Hide Annoying Ads </p>
<p> Here is what this ad blocker for Android blog post is all about: Get rid of all those intrusive videos, </p>
<p> Here is what this ad blocker for Android blog post is all about: </p>
<p> Get rid of all those intrusive videos, graphic, and text ads that appear on your Android device while using apps or browsing websites with the powerful ad blocker apps. </p>
<p> We have reviewed and listed some of the best ad blocker apps for Android that blocks advertisements throughout your Android device. </p>
<p> If you are looking to block advertisements while web browsing, then check out the section of handpicked ad blocker browsers for Android. </p>
<p> We have included some advertisement detectors too, which comes handy in those cases when you don’t know which app is showing ads, why it appears out of nowhere, it could be malware? Check the Android ad detector section to find out more. </p>
<p> With every passing day, like the online medium of content consumption is gaining popularity, online advertisements are also increasing in numbers and intrusiveness. We see ads while playing games, watching videos, and browsing the web, which is why the usage of ad blockers has become essential for the majority of people. </p>
<p> EDITOR’S NOTE: Many websites, apps, and services let you pay a certain amount for an ad-free experience. We will highly recommend you to opt for that instead of ad blocking because online content creators and developers earn their living through advertisements. Just a thought 🙂 </p>
<p> We do accept the fact that there are a large number of websites and apps filled with intrusive and forced ads, which kills the usability while making it hard for us users to consume the content, and then eventually, we are forced to look for ad blockers. </p>
<p> Most of the ad blockers we have featured in this blog post are free and open source. However, it is important to note here that ad blockers are not usually available in the Google Play Store because any app that is designed to block advertisement simply violates section 4.4 of the Google Developer Distribution Agreement and removed from the Play Store. </p>
<p> You don’t need to worry though as we have included an official link for each one of them, so you don’t have to look anywhere else 😉 </p>
<p> Best Ad Blocker Apps For Android </p>
<p> There are a large number of ad blockers available for Android devices, but not all of them are reliable, and many will ask you to purchase a premium account. To make your search for Android ad blockers easy, we have tried and tested all the ad blockers and listed some of the best ad blockers for Android available for free. </p>

Simply said, the request goes nowhere and no ads are served. </p>
<p> AdAway ad blocker lets you download a preconfigured hosts file right from their website, but it has native support for custom as well as modified hosts files. Talking about hosts files, on Android OS, these files are stored in a read-only system partition, which is why the app requires root access to modify that file. </p>

<p> Download Disconnect VPN and Ad Blocker for Android </p>
<p> 9. Cygery AdSkip for YouTube </p>
<p> The name of this app explains itself that how it can help you in dealing with advertisements. What Cygery AdSkip for YouTube does is, when you are watching YouTube videos, and the advertisement pops up, it will automatically tap on the ‘skip ad’ button whenever it appears over your screen. </p>
<p> Cygery AdSkip is one of the simplest adblockers you are going to see. To help this app get the job done, you need to enable accessibility service on your Android device, as the app is dependent on that service to detect ads and automatically click on the skip ad button. </p>
<p> Simple app designed to instantly skip YouTube ads, without any required action from the user. </p>
<p> Does not require root access to work. </p>
<p> Requires you to enable accessibility service, which is used to detect ads and click on the skip ad button. </p>
<p> The developer didn’t release any further updates after its initial launch on May 6th, 2016. So it might not work on the latest Android OS, but it doesn’t hurt trying. </p>

<p> If you happen to use a computer or if you have ever configured the network, then you must have heard about the firewall. It is designed to prevent unauthorized Internet access to a specific app or network requests. So with the No Root Firewall app, you can block ads on specific apps by preventing foreground data access to the app. </p>
<p> However, one should keep in mind that configuring the firewall to block ads on any app would also prevent it from accessing an Internet connection. For those who don’t know, No Root Firewall was previously known as Droidwall. The best thing about this app is that it doesn’t require any special permission that could make you uncomfortable. </p>
<p> Does not need root access to enable or disable the firewall. </p>
<p> Shows a log to track which app is showing a popup and intrusive ads on your phone. </p>
<p> If you are new to the firewall, then the list of apps and configuration might feel a bit hard. </p>
<p> The app didn’t receive any update since November 2014, so there might be a possibility that some features might not work on your version of Android. </p>
<p> 12. AdLock </p>
<p> AdLock is a relatively new ad blocker that has already shown itself as a reliable tool in the fight against annoying and malware advertising, phishing websites, and all kinds of tracking.

<p> Frequently Asked Questions Related To Ad Blocker For Android </p>
<p> Here are some of the most frequently asked questions by the Android users about ad blockers that we usually come across. We decided to create a dedicated section where we answer all those FAQs so that you won’t have to ask us repeatedly, which saves yours and our time, and we can direct you to the working solution within a matter of minutes. </p>
<p> How do I stop ads from popping up on my Android? </p>
<p> There are moments when we see unexpected ads on the lockscreen or homescreen while we are working on something else. The ad suddenly pops up out of nowhere. </p>
<p> The best way to deal with these types of popup ads and air push ads in the notification area is to install an ad detector. We have a list of best ad detectors in the previous section within this blog post, where we have reviewed four ad detectors that can help you find the origination of popup ads. </p>
<p> Once you have found which app is showing those annoying ads, then you will have two options, you can uninstall that unwanted ad serving app or block Internet access to that app using a firewall. This will help you stop ads from popping up on Android. </p>
<p> Is there any ad blocker for Android? </p>
<p> Yes, there are many. Some are browser-based ad blockers, and some are system-wide ad blockers. Out of the two, which option to choose completely depends on your usage and the way you are looking to block ads on your Android device. </p>
<p> Browser-based ad blockers only work on web browsers by integrating themselves with the browser that is already installed on your Android and blocks ads that are shown on the websites you are browsing. </p>
<p> Whereas, system-wide ad blockers are more powerful and can block advertisements shown on apps and games you are running on your Android. It can block air push ads, malicious banner ads, notification bar ads, harmful lock screen ads, intrusive pop-up ads, adware, and whatnot. </p>
<p> Which is the best ad blocker? </p>
<p> According to our tests and manual reviews of best ad blocker apps that we tried and tested while writing this blog post, we will recommend AdAway ad blocker as it has a blacklist and whitelist feature and can help you control which ads you want to see and which ad to block. It gives you much greater control over the adblocking. Since it edits the hosts file for ad blocking so it requires root access. </p>
<p> If you have a non-rooted Android device, then we will suggest you go ahead and install Adguard for Android as it comes in both variants, i.e. Adguard Content Blocker for web browsers and Adguard for Android which is a system-wide ad blocker. </p>
<p> Is Adblock Plus safe to use for Android? </p>
<p> Yes, Adblock Plus is safe to use for Android, but because it uses proxy servers to bypass all the traffic and block ads, so many suggest staying away from it, and some find it unsafe. It doesn’t require root, and it is one of the best solutions to block advertisements on your whole device. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> That is it. Whether you are looking for a system-wide ad blocker or a simple browser-based ads blocker or maybe just looking for apps that can help track down those intrusive full-screen popup ads, you can easily rely on these 24 best ad blocker for Android, subject to your requirements and compatibility with your phone/tablet devices. </p>
<p> Which one of the ad blockers did you like? Do you have any favorite Android ad blocker that you use very frequently? Please let us know in the comments down below. We would love to hear about it! 🙂 </p>
<p> If you ask for my suggestions, I will recommend you to go for AdAway, but if you are running a non-rooted Android device, then Adguard should work really well. </p>
<p> If this article helped you in finding the best ad blocker for your Android phone, then please don’t forget to share it with your friends and help them get rid of intrusive and annoying advertisements 🙂 </p>
<p> very awesome and comprehensive list… but i am very confused as to what to use! adguard, adclear, dns66, block-this, all work on the exact same principle (local VPN to redirect DNS traffic to custom DNS) – it boils down to which one has the fastest and more restrictive DNS and also creates a ‘better’ local VPN (whatever that means)… wish there were a comparison! </p>
<p> Thank you, Shikhanshu. We can’t really compare all of them because of the fact that the advertisement implementation continues to evolve and there is no single ad blockers you can pick from the list that can help you block ALL the advertisements. But I can assure you that each one of the mentioned app works and are reliable. </p>
<p> I recommend AdClear to simply everyone, an amazing app. It DOES work on rooted phones (I have such myself and use AdClear after having experience with many other blocking apps). Blockers like AdAway or Block This make good job blocking standard ads, but won’t do much against more invasive ads like the ones from Listonic and many more. AdClear blocks everything, at least I have yet to see an ad which was not blocked. It gives you a prompt every time you lose your VPN connection, which was annoying for me. Just choose automatic VPN reconnect and no prompts in the options and it works smoothly. </p>
<p> Thanks a lot for stopping by and sharing your valuable experience about AdClear with our readers. Without any doubt it is a reliable ad blocker. 🙂 </p>
<p> The only problem is the booting up the phone and white screen. Have to go to recent apps and delete it every time. It is a bug they won’t fix. </p>
<p> Was using AdClear on Pixel XL 8.0, worked great. Blocked all ads from Google’s amp news feed and installed apps, with the exception of YouTube but YouTube is a whole other beast to tackle. </p>
<p> Upgraded to Oreo 8.1 today and AdClear died, it’s sad. Cleared all certificates, credentials, uninstalled and tried to reinstall and nothing. Hopefully SEVEN AdClear manages this. </p>
<p> You are correct. There were some issues in the previous version of AdClear, which was causing problem on devices running Android 8.1 Oreo. Some users have sent the error log that made the developers aware about the issue, and most probably the fixed may have already been released. You can try downloading the AdClear latest version from the link given above in app #5. </p>
<p> In case the latest version still didn’t work then I will suggest you to opt for their beta test version because future updates will fix AdClear issues with Android Oreo 8.x devices. You can download the AdClear beta version from here. </p>
<p> Update: I emailed SEVEN and an hour later they invited me to beta test. It’s one week later and they already have a stable version that has overcome the initial compatibility issues with Oreo 8.1. </p>
<p> It’s successfully blocking ads, etc… On browsers, Google amp news feed and within apps. </p>
<p> As for YouTube, they still recommend Parallel. It drained my battery so I uninstalled. Then I blocked it with AdClear, because I could, and it didn’t really work plus I noticed YouTube was not able to log my watch history and my feed was static. With my Google family account I paid $14.99 to kill all ads. Each person in my five person family got their own YouTube red (ad free), plus YT Music (YouTube music, a separate app, ad-free) and an ad free version of the Google Music app. I think $14.99 for five people to get all three apps ad free, plus extras, is worth it. For me, that’s only three dollars a person per month. </p>
<p> Good list. I wouldn’t mind a dignified ad screen on app launch but mostly the ads are persistently in your face and really stupid to boot. I’ve found the FOSS “system wide” blockers that work both both apps and web sites (Block This, DNS66 Blokada) are best for me – you should review / add Blokada which is on F-Droid. Unfortunately, some apps “detect” and either force ads or reject use, and the blockers work differently. I haven’t found a 100% effective one, but they block ads for most apps/sites. </p>
<p> Good article! In addition to this app mentioned above i would like to add PlusPrivacy. This app enable you to control the privacy settings in your social networks accounts, hide your email identity, block adds, trackers and malware and prevent unwanted apps and browser extensions from tracking you and collecting your private data. </p>

<p> Because the Android operating system has become so much widespread that the people who are using Windows or Mac on their computers seem to be interested in having Android installed on their systems so they can experience the easy to use UI being offered by Android. </p>
<p> Apart from that, the vast majority of the users are interested in playing all those popular gaming titles and apps on their computer, that are actually available for Android only. </p>
<p> To be able to run those Android apps, you don’t need to have a physical Android smartphone or tablet. All you really need is a computer with hardware specifications that is capable enough to handle the following Android emulation software: </p>
<p> Best Software To Run Android Apps On PC </p>
<p> In this section, you will find the review of the 4 best Android emulation software that enables your PC to run Android-based games and apps. I have also discussed the details for each one of them. </p>
<p> 1 – GenyMotion </p>
<p> GenyMotion is an Android emulation software designed and developed by GenyMobile, a French-based company that develops applications and software solutions for Android users as well as developers. It is one of the fastest Android emulators widely used by professionals and businesses for the development and demonstration purposes of their Android apps and makes it easier for users to run Android apps on PC. </p>
<p> This software promises to speed up your overall app development projects thanks to its easy to use user interface as well as the accessible and most effective apps testing and collaboration tool. </p>
<p> Apart from all those features and benefits being offered by GenyMotion, the most basic version of this software will allow you to flawlessly run any Android app on your PC. The individual version is available as a free download for personal use, and the only requirement before downloading the free version is that you must need to get yourself registered on their website first. </p>
<p> Believe me, the whole registration process was simple and straightforward. I was able to access setup files and begin downloading the basic version in under two minutes! Since I do not have any virtual machine software installed in my computer, so I opted to download the one that comes bundled with the Oracle VM VirtualBox. </p>
<p> Once the GenyMotion software was successfully downloaded and installed, I configured it according to my personal preferences and then I was able to get the Android 5.1.0 running on my computer. And for those of you who are curious, I was running Android 5.1.0 on Google Nexus 5 at a resolution of 1080×1920 pixels. However, you can select whatever device you want from the list of available devices. </p>
<p> As GenyMotion doesn’t have support for Google Apps as well as the Google Play Services within the emulator, so in order to install and run any app, first I must have to download its APK file on my computer. Then I used a simple drag and drop functionality to install that app on the GenyMotion Android emulator. And I was able to play the game on my PC in no time. </p>
<p> Overall, as per the tests I conducted, the performance of GenyMotion emulator was fast and I experienced no lag whatsoever while playing the game or using the Android interface for web browsing and other activities. </p>
<p> Key Features of GenyMotion </p>
<p> Some of the key features found in the GenyMotion software are as follows. </p>

After reviewing all the features being offered by this Android App Player, I decided to download and install this on my computer to see how it performs. The installation process was straightforward and did not require any input from my side. Once the installation was completed successfully, the setup automatically launched Nox App Player. </p>
<p> The Nox App Player was booted up in less than a minute. I was then greeted by a user-friendly Android interface along with easy to reach onscreen shortcut buttons on the right side to perform all the basic tasks including shake functionality, screen capture, virtual location, full screen, volume control, and some other controls as you can see in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Nox App Player supports Play Services and Google Apps so downloading and installing any app is easy. Just head over to the Play Store and download any app you want. Furthermore, you can also install any app if you have APK file by simply dragging and dropping the file onto the App Player, but it requires you to enable the root mode first. </p>
<p> I tried to install and run an Android game on this emulator and amazingly, it outperformed all the other Android emulators in the list. I experienced no lag at all, graphics quality was good and the performance was butter-smooth. </p>
<p> At the time of writing this article, the Nox App Player I downloaded and installed on my computer was running Android KitKat version 4.4.2. However, the developers are looking forward to bring the more upgraded version of the App Player to further improve the capabilities of the software. </p>
<p> Nox App Player allows you to customize some advanced system settings to further improve the overall Android emulation and gaming experience on PC. The performance settings allow you to modify the usable CPU cores, RAM allotment as well as the resolution and screen size of the emulator. </p>
<p> As far as customer support is concerned, I believe that since this is a new software (if you compare with others in this list) which is probably the reason why they are trying their best to provide the best individual support to every user. In case you run into any problem, simply contact their support team and they will get back to you with a possible workaround or solution. </p>
<p> Overall, after performing all the tests and evaluating this software, my experience with this Android emulator is far better as compared to the other emulators I have tried. The software was speedy and it performed far better than I actually expected, and I was surprised that it did not consume a lot of my computer resources, which means that it could possibly run without any hiccups on computers with old hardware and lower specifications. </p>

<p> Download Andy (Andyroid) </p>
<p> 4 – BlueStacks App Player </p>
<p> BlueStacks App Player is developed and produced by BlueStacks, a virtualization and mobile software technology company that was founded in 2009 and headquartered in America, who uses their patented Layercake technology to serve the users of App Player with a capability to run Android apps and games on their computer at full-screen size. </p>
<p> The software was originally designed to make it easier for the Windows and Mac OS users to virtualize the full Android experience on their computers large screen as well as to install, run, and operate apps that are originally designed for Android-based mobile devices. </p>
<p> The BlueStacks website openly claims that their BlueStacks App Player is compatible with most of the apps available on the Google Play Store (Android apps store) and the software has been polished enough that it is now fully capable of running over ninety-six percent of those Android apps. The website also claims that the software alone has been downloaded by more than 109 million Windows and Mac computer users. </p>
<p> At the time of writing this article, BlueStacks is believed to be one of the best software and Android emulators according to the reviews and testimonials of users from all around the world. The reason behind all these claims, positive reviews, feedbacks, and support from the users is the hard work that has been done by all of the creators and developers in an attempt to make their software more effective and to add more features. </p>
<p> Recently, during the end of 2015, BlueStacks released the latest and the most up to date version of App Player i.e. BlueStacks 2.0, which brought an amazing multitasking capability allowing you to run multiple apps at the same time, screen resizing capability, support for zoom-in and zoom out, and many bug fixes. Furthermore, they have an awesome support team who is keen to help and guide the users. </p>
<p> So after evaluating all the reviews and testimonials by the existing users, I decided to try BlueStacks App Player just to see how it performs. The software is indeed free of cost and I was able to download the setup file from the official website without providing any of my personal details. The installation process was pretty straightforward, but the last phase of the installation did take quite a bit to successfully setup all of the required components on my computer. </p>
<p> Once installed, I was able to easily log in to my Google account and synchronize all of the services. Then I opted to install an app on the BlueStacks App Player to see how it performs while emulating an app. </p>
<p> After playing this game for a while, I can conclude that performance wise the BlueStacks 2.0 App Player seems to lag a lot, consume more computer resources, and require much greater processing speeds. The reason behind all these could be the newly released version with a completely overhauled user interface, which still requires some patches and bug fixes so that it can handle all the tasks flawlessly. </p>
<p> Key Features of BlueStacks App Player </p>
<p> Some of the key features found in the BlueStacks software are as follows. </p>
<p> Capability to run all Android apps whether they are based on x86 or ARM </p>
<p> Compatible with over 86 percent of the Android games available on the Google Play Store </p>
<p> Ability to localize the App Player to your actual mobile device using IMEI localization technique </p>
<p> Automatically associates BlueStacks App Player with all the APK files on your computer </p>
<p> Active integration and support for mouse, keyboard, microphone, camera, sensors, as well as multi-touch </p>
<p> Ability to transfer and move files and apps between your computer and Android device </p>
<p> Support for your computer’s native graphics card </p>
<p> Download BlueStacks App Player </p>
<p> BlueStacks App Player is freeware and is fully compatible with any computer that is either running Microsoft Windows (supported versions include Windows XP SP3, Vista SP2, 7, 8, 8.1, 10) or Mac OS X Mavericks 10.8 or above operating systems. </p>
<p> You can download the full-featured version of this software for free from the official BlueStacks website. </p>
<p> Download BlueStacks App Player </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> In the conclusion, I can safely say that after installing all those emulators and trying each one of them individually, GenyMotion and Nox App Player are the best of all. However, GenyMotion does not have support for Google Play services, which might be the reason many will not like this software. But on the other hand, Nox App Player was the best performer, with great speeds, and did not lag for even a second. </p>
<p> Numerous other Android emulation software like AMI DuOS, ARC Welder, ARChon Runtime are available for running Android apps on PC. But unfortunately, I was unable to install ARC Welder and ARChon Runtime on my Chrome web browser, and AMI DuOS is available for 30 days trial period only, which is the reason I have not included them in the list. </p>

<p> How To Send Text Messages From PC Using Android Phone – The Ultimate Guide </p>
<p> Do you want to send and receive text messages from your Android phone without having to pick up your phone? </p>
<p> Do you want to send and receive text messages from your Android phone without having to pick up your phone? Here we have a couple of ways, which synchronizes your Android phone with your computer and let you send and receive text messages using a web interface without you even having to touch your mobile phone. </p>
<p> We have several ways outlined in this blog post; the first method is native, where we will use Google’s official Android Messages app newly released web interface. Then starting from the second method, we will be using all the third party apps namely MightyText, Textra SMS, MySMS, Handcent Next SMS, and Pulse SMS to help you send a text from the web. </p>
<p> Google has recently released an updated version of their Messages app for Android, and in this update, developers have included one of the most requested features, i.e., the ability to send and receive SMS from your computer and a web browser using the Messages for the web interface. </p>
<p> This feature alone is beneficial for those users who are frequently texting while working on their computer. Once your mobile is connected to the Messages web interface, you can just leave your phone in your pocket and continue replying to your clients or your friends using your laptop or desktop computer, just like how WhatsApp works from the web. </p>
<p> To help you out, I have created a detailed step-by-step guide on what is Messages for the web and how you can use Android Messages for web on your laptop or computer. </p>
<p> How Android Messages Works from the Web </p>
<p> Android Messages for web works in a very similar way as to how WhatsApp for web works. The web interface is designed to replicate and show what’s already on your Messages mobile app on your Android device. </p>
<p> Messages for Web connect to your Android Messages app using either a WiFi or a data connection of your mobile device. And the same link is then used to send SMS messages from your mobile so carrier fees will apply just like how you use SMS service on your Android device. </p>
<p> Android Messages app allows you to pair your account on numerous devices including your work computer, home computer, and your laptop. But due to end-to-end encrypted connection, only one paired connection will be active at any given time. For example, if you are using Messages for web on your work computer, then your conversations on other computers will become inactive. </p>
<p> Things You Need To Access Android Messages from the Web </p>
<p> Even though the process of accessing Android Messages from the Web is pretty simple and straightforward, but since this is the ultimate guide so I decided to include a list of things you will need: </p>
<p> Android phone with functioning camera to scan the QR code, </p>
<p> Active Internet connection on your computer and phone, </p>
<p> A computer with any latest version of web browser, </p>
<p> The latest version of Android Messages app installed on your Android phone. </p>
<p> Configuring Android Messages to Access your Messages from the Web </p>
<p> Once you have things mentioned on the above list already with you then setting Android Messages to access all of your messages from the web on your computer is straightforward. Here is what you need to do: </p>
<p> On your Android phone, open Messages app, </p>
<p> Tap on the Menu button located at the top-right corner, </p>
<p> Tap Messages for web option, </p>
<p> A Messages for web window will open with a link to Android Messages web interface (messages.google.com/web) along with a box to launch QR code scanner, </p>
<p> On your computer, open web browser (like Google Chrome) and in the address bar type this address: messages.android.com or messages.google.com/web, </p>
<p> Once the Messages for web page has been loaded, you will see a QR code on your screen, </p>
<p> On your phone, tap on that box that says QR code scanner, </p>
<p> Point your phone’s rear camera to the QR code visible on your computer screen, </p>
<p> The moment your phone recognizes and scans the QR code successfully, you will see a “You’re all set!” message. </p>
<p> Now as soon as Messages app reads the QR code, it will automatically connect your phone to the PC, and all your conversations in Messages app will be synced on the web browser. </p>
<p> Things You Can Do With the Android Messages for Web </p>
<p> Here are the things you can do using the Android Messages for Web on your computer: </p>
<p> Start a new conversation with any of your contact. </p>
<p> Continue the conversation with any of your existing contact. </p>
<p> View contact information and details. </p>
<p> You have an option to mute or unmute any conversation. </p>
<p> Ability to archive and delete conversations. </p>
<p> Start a group text conversation with multiple contacts. </p>
<p> You will get to respond to all the conversations and type messages using your laptop/PC keyboard. </p>
<p> Option to enable and disable dark theme for Messages for Web platform. </p>
<p> The settings menu gives you numerous toggle switches including the option to enable and disable notifications for new text messages, message previews, choose whether you want audio notifications for all the incoming messages, as well as the option to keep the computer paired with Android Messages Web interface. </p>
<p> While messaging your contact, you can add emoji, sticker, GIF, and any attachment from your computer device. </p>
<p> Copy any text from the messages you have sent or received. </p>
<p> Ability to enable or disable dark theme Messages Web UI. </p>
<p> Limitations of Android Messages for Web </p>
<p> As you are accessing Android Messages Web through your PC and it’s not the exact mirror of Messages app that you are using on your Android device, so certain features are missing in the web interface of this app. So here are some limitations of Android Messages for web: </p>
<p> You can’t share your current location information. </p>
<p> No option to share any contact details. </p>
<p> You can’t record and share voice or audio messages. </p>
<p> You are not allowed to make or receive voice calls. </p>
<p> You cannot access the blocked contacts list. </p>
<p> There is no way to customize or access advanced Android Messages settings. </p>
<p> You can’t access or view messages stored in your SIM card. </p>
<p> How to Sign Out from the Android Messages Web Interface </p>
<p> Once you have logged in and synced your Android Messages with the Messages Web interface on your computer, you can then keep it logged in even when you are not using it because it’s secure and useful if you want to reaccess Messages. It will also give you notification of all the incoming messages, and you don’t have to pick up your phone and unlock it to view and respond to the texts. </p>
<p> However, if you have logged into Android Messages on a shared computer, then it is recommended to log out before leaving the computer due to privacy reasons. If in case, you are unable to figure out how to sign out from the Messages Web interface then don’t worry, the process is straightforward. </p>
<p> Apparently, there are two methods to sign out from the Android Messages Web interface, and we have outlined the steps for both methods below: </p>
<p> Method 1 – Sign Out Using Android Phone </p>
<p> Open Messages app on your Android phone, </p>
<p> Tap on the Menu button located at the top-right corner, </p>
<p> Tap Messages for web option, </p>
<p> Messages for web window will open. Now look under the Signed in computers section, and you will see all the computers where you have signed in to access Messages for Web interface. </p>
<p> If you want to sign out from all the computers then just tap on the option that says, “Sign out of all computers.” Alternatively, if you know which computer is shared then tap on the cross right next to the computer name and the popup will appear asking, “Sign out from this computer?” then tap on Sign out. </p>
<p> Method 2 – Sign Out Using Computer </p>
<p> On your computer, open web browser (like Google Chrome) and in the address bar type this address: messages.android.com, </p>
<p> Once the Messages for the web page is loaded, then wait for the interface to load all the messages, </p>
<p> Click on the Menu button as highlighted in the screenshot below, </p>
<p> Now click Sign out, </p>
<p> A popup dialogue box will appear asking, “Sign out from this computer?” then simply click on Sign out. </p>

<p> Though it is important to note here that Textra SMS offers all of these features and functionalities for free without any time limitations, though there might be some moments while using the app for messaging that you might see an ad or two, usually there won’t be many advertisements. Furthermore, if those advertisements annoy you, you can always make a one-time payment through the in-app purchase system and get the ads removed forever. </p>

<p> Pulse SMS </p>
<p> We have put Pulse SMS on the last in our list because of a reason. You will find that reason in a while. But for the time being, let’s talk about the features offered by this app and how well all of those powerful features work. Though, it is important to mention here that the app is crammed with some of the most remarkable features along with tons of customizability you could think of. </p>
<p> The best aspect of Pulse SMS is the capability to enhance your messaging experience by making all of your messages and conversations seamlessly available across all the supported platforms where your Android device is connected. </p>

<p> So the reason why Pulse SMS app is mentioned in the last is that it does not offer the capability of text messages sending and syncing from the web for free. It is a charged feature and enabling send a text from web feature will cost you about $0.99 per month or else you can pay a one-time purchase fee of $10.99 and get a lifetime license. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>

<p> One thing is confirmed, you love Android smartphones and eager to learn more about its powerful functionalities to get the most out of it. But apart from the essentials, do you really know about all the secret features available in the Android OS? </p>
<p> You won’t believe me, during the past 8 years of my Android usage, I have discovered loads of hidden features as well as tips and tricks that most of the Android users may have never heard about. All of those amazing and super-cool features still exist on the Android operating system. </p>
<p> Since most of our blog readers are Android beginners and are willing to learn all the ins and outs of their powerful Android devices, I have decided to share a handful of the best Android tips and tricks to ensure that the content is simple, short, and easy to follow for everyone. 🙂 </p>
<p> But first, a little background information about Android </p>
<p> Without any doubt, Android is one of the dominating mobile platforms in the world and the recent Gartner report claims that the Google’s mobile operating system has a global market share of 86 percent and will soon hit almost 90 percent, which is staggering. </p>
<p> Here is how the graph looks like: </p>
<p> All of this is possible because of the fact that the Android OS is being embraced by multiple mobile device manufacturers including: </p>
<p> Samsung, LG, Huawei, Motorola, HTC, Sony, Nokia, Vivo, Oppo, and Xiaomi. </p>
<p> With so many devices in the market, including the ones you are currently using, it’s hard to keep up with a number of new features being added after every Android new update. Which means you are probably only scratching the surface of what your powerful Android OS equipped devices are actually capable of doing. </p>
<p> So in an attempt to help you get the most out of your smartphone and/or tablet devices and improve the user experience, here we are sharing with you the ten best and most useful Android tips and tricks. </p>
<p> Amazing Tips and Tricks You Should Know About Android </p>
<p> NOTE: All of these should work with all the makes and models as well as the newest and previous Android versions including Nougat, Marshmallow, Lollipop, KitKat, and Jelly Bean (unless otherwise mentioned). However, some of the instructions may vary a bit depending on which device you own. </p>
<p> 1. Automatically Unlock Screen Security When You Are At Home </p>
<p> You can configure your Android phone or tablet device to automatically unlock whenever it detects that it is currently located at home so you won’t need to frequently enter a passcode or draw pattern. You can achieve this with the help of a feature known as “Smart Lock”. </p>
<p> It was introduced in Android 5.0 Lollipop, which means it is not available on older Android versions. </p>
<p> How this actually works is that you first enable the Smart Lock functionality and there you will find an option called “Trusted Places”. Tapping on this option will ask you to add locations you trust like office and home. Once added, whenever you are in the marked place your device will be automatically unlocked. </p>
<p> In a nutshell: </p>
<p> Smart Lock provides you with a bunch of cool features that automatically enables or disables lock screen security depending on your configured environmental factors like where you are and what you are doing. </p>
<p> 2. How to Connect USB Mouse and Keyboard to Android Phone/Tablet </p>
<p> This trick comes handy in those cases when your phone’s digitizer/touch screen sensor is not working. </p>
<p> But there’s a catch: </p>
<p> It is a hardware dependent feature and requires USB OTG (On-The-Go) compatible Android smartphone or tablet device to work. And to be able to connect a mouse/keyboard to your device you need to have a USB OTG cable too… </p>
<p> …and it looks like this: </p>
<p> Once you have connected a USB mouse to your Android device, you will immediately see a mouse cursor on the screen. You can then control your device using just a mouse and amazingly all the buttons will work too. </p>
<p> As an alternative, in case you don’t have an OTG enabled Android device, you can connect your Bluetooth-enabled mouse and keyboard to your Android phone or tablet. Then you will be able to use both peripherals and control your device wirelessly without any issue. </p>
<p> 3. Zoom-In To Anything Using Triple Tap Gesture </p>
<p> Apart from the pinch-to-zoom feature, you may have already used double tap gesture to zoom into the pictures on your Android device. </p>
<p> But did you ever hear about triple tap gesture? </p>
<p> Triple tap gesture actually exists on Android and used to enable a magnification tool so you can zoom in or magnify any image/piece of text on your Android. </p>
<p> You can enable it by following these simple steps: </p>
<p> Go to “Settings”. </p>
<p> Tap on the “Accessibility” option. </p>
<p> Look for an option named “Vision” and tap on it. </p>
<p> Then tap on the “Magnification Gestures”. </p>
<p> Now you can use the toggle button to enable magnification. </p>
<p> While you are zoomed-in, you can pan around the area by dragging two fingers across the screen and magnification level can be adjusted with a two-fingers pinch gesture. </p>
<p> 4. How to Find Your Phone after It Has Been Lost or Stolen </p>
<p> The Android makes it easy for you to find, locate, and lock your phone or tablet after it has been lost or stolen. </p>
<p> Want to know the best part? </p>
<p> You can use the Android Device Manager (ADM), which gives you an approximate location of your Android device and when it was last used. </p>
<p> Here are the steps you can follow: </p>
<p> Sign into the Android Device Manager website at google.com/android/devicemanager, and make sure current device is selected. </p>
<p> From here, you can choose following options: </p>
<p> See the approximate location of your device, </p>
<p> Lock the phone and display message/phone number, </p>
<p> Erase all the data stored on your phone, </p>
<p> Ring your device: Your phone will ring for up to five minutes even if it is on silent mode. </p>
<p> As simple as that. </p>
<p> However, keep in mind that if you opt to erase data from your device then you will not be able to further track and locate it. </p>
<p> 5. How To Access Missed Notifications on Android With Notification Log Widget </p>
<p> Did you ever miss a notification? </p>
<p> Maybe you accidentally swiped it without reading or it might have disappeared. Which then leaves you wondering where that notification came from and what did it say. </p>
<p> This is where the notification log comes to the rescue. 😀 </p>
<p> What you need to do is create a new widget on your home screen by following these steps: </p>
<p> Long press on the Android home screen. Some options will appear at the bottom, tap on the “Widgets”. </p>
<p> Scroll down and look for a widget named, “Settings shortcut”. Then drag and drop it onto the home screen. </p>
<p> The moment you drop it on the home screen, it will show you a list of different settings you can choose for that shortcut. In that list, look for an option called “Notification Log” and tap on it. </p>
<p> Perfect! Now you can simply tap on that Settings shortcut widget which will open notifications log where you can scroll through all of your recent notifications. </p>
<p> 6. Restrict Notifications of Calls and Texts on Android </p>
<p> Do you habitually put your phone into silent mode during your sleep or work hours? </p>
<p> If you answered yes, then you must have been worried about missing important/emergency calls and messages. Now you never need to worry about that because… </p>
<p> Android has a Priority Mode feature in Android 5.0 Lollipop and later versions, which allows rings and notifications from your chosen contacts only. Other than that any other calls, messages, and notifications will remain silent. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to turn on Priority Mode: </p>
<p> Press the ‘Volume Up’ or ‘Volume Down’ button on your Android device. </p>
<p> Under the volume slider, you will see the ‘Priority’ option so tap on it. </p>
<p> Then tap on the settings gear icon. </p>
<p> Interruptions settings menu will open, from where you can use toggle switches to customize which calls, messages, and notifications you want to allow and which ones don’t. </p>
<p> Furthermore, you can apply a filter for the calls and text messages to allow calls and messages from: </p>
<p> Anyone, </p>
<p> People in your contacts book, or </p>
<p> Only from starred contacts in your phone book. </p>
<p> Isn’t that a cool feature? </p>
<p> 7. Use Google Maps Even When You Don’t Have Active Internet Connection </p>
<p> Yes, that is possible. And will help you save a huge amount of data when you are traveling. </p>
<p> You might not know but Google has added a functionality in the Maps app that let you select a large area, which will then be downloaded and stored on your phone. </p>
<p> It requires very less amount of storage space too. </p>
<p> When the offline map is downloaded, you can then access the Google Maps and get directions while traveling within the selected area, even when you have no cellular connection. </p>
<p> Now to get the most out of it, what you can really do is first use your WiFi connection to download the whole city or any area where you are planning to travel. Once the selected map is downloaded, you can then navigate around without downloading the map. </p>
<p> This will save you a significant amount of cellular data and also help you navigate in areas where you have no cellular signals. </p>
<p> Even better: </p>
<p> Google Maps automatically keeps your saved offline map data up to date every 30 days (when you are connected to WiFi) so no don’t need to worry about having outdated map. </p>
<p> 8. Take Control Of Your Cellular Data Usage </p>
<p> Yes, Android is smart and capable enough to help you take control of your cellular data usage by using a native feature known as data limitations and restrictions. You can use this to save a significant amount of data by imposing restrictions on the apps so they won’t consume any cellular data when you are not using them. </p>
<p> To enable this, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Go to “Settings”. </p>
<p> Tap on the “Data Usage”. </p>
<p> Then tap on the “Data Saver”. </p>
<p> You will see a toggle switch, tap on it to enable data saver. </p>
<p> Now, if you want to grant data access to apps like Gmail, WhatsApp or any other app that you need to receive notification update from then you can select those from the list by tapping on the “Unrestricted data access” option. </p>
<p> Furthermore, Android keeps a detailed data usage log of all the apps and shows you how much cellular data is being consumed by each one of them. To check the total usage and impose system-wide data usage limitation, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Go to “Settings” and then to the “Data Usage”. </p>
<p> Tap on the “Mobile Data Usage” option. Here you will see a graph of data usage. </p>
<p> Here you need to tap on the gear icon, which will take you to the “Billing cycle” menu. </p>
<p> This is exactly where you can set up data warning, data limit, and billing cycle date. Once set, these will help you make sure that you won’t exceed your cellular data limit. </p>
<p> 9. How To Add Webpage Link Shortcut To Android Home Screen </p>
<p> For this trick to work, you need to use Google Chrome web browser. </p>
<p> It is quick, simple, and easy. </p>
<p> Follow the following steps: </p>
<p> On your Android device, open Google Chrome. </p>
<p> Go to the URL of the website you want to create a home screen </p>
<p> Once the page is loaded, tap on the options or overflow menu button and there you will find an option “Add to Home screen”. </p>
<p> Enter any appropriate name of a web page in the box and hit the “Add” button. </p>
<p> An icon should appear on home screen. Now a simple tap on this shortcut will give you a quick access the website. </p>
<p> 10. A Quick 2-Minutes Fix to Make Your Android Faster </p>
<p> I don’t know if you have noticed or not. Your Android device has some fancy effects and animations that are executed whenever you open/close apps or switch between menus on Android. This is just to make your phone’s interface look elegant. </p>
<p> As it turns out: </p>
<p> Those animations come at the price of speed and performance. And by disabling them, you can make your phone a little bit snappy. </p>
<p> However, the majority of the Android users don’t even know they can completely turn off those animations and that’s because the option is hidden under a setting called “Developer Options”. </p>
<p> Now to gain access to this hidden Developer Options, you need to do the following: </p>
<p> Go to “Settings”. </p>
<p> Scroll down and tap on “About Phone”. </p>
<p> Here, you need to look for a “Build Number”. Once found, tap on it several times until you see a toast message that says, “You are now a developer”. </p>
<p> Go back to the “Settings”. You will notice a new menu “Developer Options” is now visible. </p>
<p> Now: </p>
<p> Adjust animations by following these steps: </p>
<p> Go to “Settings” and tap on “Developer Options”. </p>
<p> Under the Developer Options, there should be a subsection named “Drawing”, </p>
<p> There you will find three options i.e. Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale. </p>
<p> Simply tap on each one of these options and then you can select either ‘Animation off’ or the lowest animation speed i.e. ‘Animation scale .5x’. </p>
<p> If you are running a slow or old Android device then this should help you speed up a tiny bit. In some cases, this change goes unnoticed, but turning it completely off does give your Android phone a slight performance boost. </p>
<p> These are some of best tricks I found the most useful. Do you know some more tips? Dont forget to share with me. </p>

<p> 25 Best Android TV Apps You Should be Using </p>
<p> Do you have Android TV or maybe an Android set-top box but don’t know which apps you should install to </p>
<p> Do you have Android TV or maybe an Android set-top box but don’t know which apps you should install to maximize its functionality and to make the most out of it? Here we have a list of 25 amazing apps that you should have on your Android TV to enhance the experience. </p>
<p> Android TV is becoming a norm these days with a large adaptation of Smart TV’s as well as the wide usage of gadgets like Chromecast. Not only that, the easy availability of TV boxes help make ordinary televisions almost as capable as the smart TV and, in some cases, they make it even more powerful. </p>
<p> One of the main reason for the success of Android TV is Google’s optimization of Android TVs in recent times, which has significantly improved its performance. The lag that plagued the user experience in the initial stage is now non-existent. The buttery-smooth UI and optimized integration with the Android ecosystem have made the overall experience completely seamless. </p>
<p> To help you entirely immerse yourself in this wonderful experience, we have compiled a list of 25 best apps for Android TV that will save you the hassle of burning your brain oil to decide which app will serve you better. To make a list easier to understand, we have broken the app list into little sections to give you a greater choice for the apps in each category to match your comfort and preferences. </p>
<p> Best Streaming Apps For Android TV </p>
<p> Web browsing is not a forte on a TV. The strength of TV is in media consumption, not social feed. For this purpose, the experience with the local cable provider is a mixed bag, so having a media streaming subscription is a must so that you can watch movies and TV shows. If you are missing out on this experience, then you are not making the most of your Android TV. The versatility of streaming services is so much that there’s something for everyone. </p>
<p> 1. Netflix </p>
<p> Netflix is not the cheapest streaming subscription you can buy for yourself, but it’s worth what you pay, as the availability of content is massive. This streaming service is not famous for getting most of the content readily available for its consumers; however, it has a strong selling point, which is producing Netflix exclusive content. </p>
<p> The content on the Netflix ranges from trending TV series to anime. We admit that the collection of anime is not as vast when compared to the other content categories, but the fact that Netflix is such a well-rounded media streaming subscription easily puts it on top of everyone else. </p>
<p> It’s a no brainer to not to have a Netflix account as it starts from $7.99 for the basic. The app is quick and seamless, and the poster style banner-like UI works nicely to glue you to the couch and binge-watch few movies or TV series. </p>
<p> 2. Hulu </p>
<p> Hulu is a relatively new platform as compared to Netflix. From a strict ‘best value for money’ standpoint, it is no match for Netflix. In fact, it has less availability and is pricier than Netflix, but if you’re a die-hard anime fan, then this streaming platform is for you. </p>
<p> The one benefit that Hulu enjoys over its other competitors is that it has a richer library of anime. Another advantage of Hulu is that the basic version is free, though it comes with ads. Hulu has an interface similar to Netflix with minor differences, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. </p>
<p> 3. Amazon Prime Video </p>
<p> Another relatively new video streaming app that provides a decent number of TV shows at a reasonable monthly price. The Android app of Amazon Prime Video does not support chrome cast; therefore, the Android TV app is the only way to get it without any hassle. </p>
<p> If you pay the admission price, then you can unlock other Prime benefits as well. Furthermore, the online streaming service also includes a variety of specialized channels with more exciting content to watch. </p>
<p> 4. Crunchyroll </p>
<p> If you’re an otaku and don’t care about the world of TV series, then you are better off with skipping the apps mentioned earlier and get this one. Nothing beats Crunchyroll when it comes to anime; it has the biggest library of anime content except for the Netflix originals. It has anime in subs and dubs, and it publishes the episodes right after airing. </p>
<p> Subscription for Crunchyroll streaming service starts from $5.99, which is a lot cheaper than the other two. The app also gives you access to manga which although is not the best thing to read on TV but sure is nice to have it handy. The app has a different layout than Netflix and Hulu but provides a cleaner UI that is easier to navigate. </p>
<p> 5. Cartoon Network App </p>
<p> A name synonymous with quality content, Cartoon Network has had an iconic legacy for decades. The Emmy award-winning app is the perfect source of recreation for children as it provides a lot of cartoon entertainment coupled with the right amount of education. </p>
<p> Fortunately, the app has now added support for Android TV. Similar to other applications for cable networks, the Cartoon Network app allows you to watch a selected on-demand content on your Android TV. If you want to enjoy the app fully then, you’ll need to provide your cable info. The app for the better part is free but does contain ads. </p>
<p> 6. ESPN </p>
<p> Sports are exciting to watch, but ads aren’t. If you love watching sports, then ESPN is highly recommended, as it will help you get rid of ads and provide the ultimate sports experience and the broadcasting is fairly extensive so you can catch most of the sports events. The subscription for ESPN starts from $4.99. </p>
<p> Best Music Apps For Android TV </p>
<p> TV’s are not just to watch as there are times when we want to make use of those surround sound speakers of our TV, so having a good music streaming service is also a must-have. </p>
<p> 1. Spotify </p>
<p> Spotify is another strong contender in the music streaming game; it rivals Google Music in most aspects. Though it does fall behind for additional features mainly due to Google having the support for YouTube Music. </p>
<p> Spotify or Play Music is just a matter of personal preference, but Spotify does differentiate it from Google Music by giving free access to playlists and albums. You can also listen to the podcast in Spotify, which is missing in the Google Play Music. </p>
<p> 2. Google Play Music </p>
<p> Google Play Music has a rich library of songs, and it is not limited to just songs. It also has radio stations which you can listen to for free, but there are ads in the free version. For the on-demand content, you have to pay $9.99. Play Music service also allows its users to upload their music, which they can listen to at any time at their convenience and that too, without any charges. </p>
<p> 3. Pandora for Android TV </p>
<p> Pandora is not exactly a music streaming service though it does give that option to paid users. It is mainly a music discovery service. It also has a huge library and boasts access to your favorite radio station and podcasts. </p>
<p> Best Media Streaming Apps For Android TV </p>
<p> The power of having an Android TV is that you have the freedom to stream any media that you have stored on your local home network, flash drive, or any storage device. To help you with movie and music streaming and in an attempt to simplify the process, here are the best media streaming apps for Android TV that you can try right away: </p>
<p> 1. Kodi </p>
<p> Kodi is the award-winning free and open source cross-platform software media player app and an entertainment hub for digital media for HTPCs (Home theater PCs). When it comes to streaming from various home devices on your home network, then look no further. If you are watching something in the living room and you suddenly feel like moving to another room where you have another TV, you don’t have to transfer your media to the other device. </p>
<p> Being open-source and community-driven, Kodi offers tons of options for modifying as well as extensions that can give you access to around thousands of channels. The app has a 10-foot interface design and is a tailor-made media player for the living room. The app uses a remote controller as the primary means of input device. It’s GUI allows users to navigate through various forms of content including, videos, photos, podcasts, and music from hard drive, local network, and the Internet. </p>
<p> 2. Plex </p>
<p> One of the very first Android TV apps available on Google Play Store, Plex to date remains to be one of the most popular apps for Android TV when it comes to playing videos from your computer/phone to your TV. Simply put, Plex operates the same way as Kodi, but it requires a full-fledged PC acting as a server. It can let you decentralize your media wherever you are and whenever you want it and even let you pause on one device and play it on another. </p>
<p> Furthermore, Plex doesn’t require you to be on the same LAN. Unlike Kodi, Plex lacks in the extensions and modifiability but offers more professional design and support. </p>
<p> 3. Haystack (news) </p>
<p> In an era of ever-increasing information, a decent news app can filter the right amount of information for its users. HayStack is a news app that provides updated news on everything from science and technology, politics and current events, to games and movie trailers. The app has reached unprecedented popularity in the last three-four years. </p>
<p> The app takes a slightly unorthodox and unique approach when it comes to delivering the news to its audience. The way it works is that it allows you to select the topics of their interests, along with your most trusted news sources. The app then learns about your interests, and then this information is used to provide you with the daily newscast. HayStack collects news information from over 100 local and international stations. </p>
<p> Best Online Content Watching Apps For Android TV </p>
<p> Some services will allow you to consume content as well as share any content on the Internet, these services are widely used on Android phones but has been designed specifically for Android TV too. Those apps are: </p>
<p> 4. YouTube for Android TV </p>
<p> YouTube is perhaps the most popular online video platform and one of the most popular apps on Google Play Store, and the giant video platform has one of the largest collection of videos on the Internet. It features videos from all genres, including tech, music, comedy, politics, sports, and whatnot. </p>
<p> The YouTube Android TV app gives you the option to write anything on the search bar via the remote control instead of opting to use a microphone for voice command. The best part is that it’s free, however, if you want to enjoy an add-free experience you can subscribe to YouTube Red on a monthly package. </p>
<p> 5. Twitch </p>
<p> If you love watching live streams of Pro gamers showcasing their skills, then Twitch is the app for you. Regarded as the best platform for the gaming community, Twitch provides live streaming videos where gamers post live streams of their gameplay. It may sound mundane to any normal user, but the platform provides a lot of learning curve to budding gamers. </p>
<p> If you’re a gamer, then you should thank Amazon for making Twitch compatible with the Android TV platform and helping us include it in the list of best Android TV apps. </p>
<p> Best Web Browsers For Android TV </p>
<p> Browser is important because it will help you experience the power of the web on your television. Web experience cannot be good if the browser is unable to comply with the modern standards of the web, but in this case, it might not be that convenient to browse the web using Android TV. </p>
<p> Android OS has tons of web browsers, if you didn’t like the ones we have mentioned below then you can always head over to our list of best web browsers for Android which is available here. </p>
<p> 1. Puffin Android TV-Browser </p>
<p> Puffin Browser by CloudMosa, Inc is likely one of the best options if you are looking for a way to browse the web on Android TV. Unlike Google Chrome, whose UI is more optimized for touch-enabled devices, this browser advertises it as tailor-made for the TV to provide the best web browsing experience on TV including the task as simple as watching a video, listening to music, and surfing the web. </p>
<p> 2. Google Chrome </p>
<p> Google Chrome is the browser designed and developed by Google that is well compliant with the modern web standards and is convenient enough to be used on TV as it offers a coherent design over all the platforms. However, you won’t be able to find the app on the Google Play Store for Android TV despite being supported, so you need to sideload it. (We have explained sideloading process at the end of this blog post). </p>
<p> 3. HopWatch for Reddit </p>
<p> If you are a meme guy, then we are pretty confident you are a Reddit user as well or for the very least familiar with it. HopWatch is a Reddit client that is purposely made with TV in mind, so you easily browse through the Reddit website right from your Android-enabled TV. </p>
<p> It’s a great app to have even if you use Reddit rarely because you will get to watch and explore hot trending topics including pictures, videos, movies, and subreddit threads. </p>
<p> Best VPN Apps For Android TV </p>
<p> Since we have been talking a lot about subscription services, there are situations where these services do not work depending on your geographical whereabouts. In such scenarios, VPN acts as the perfect solution to this problem, as it can change your IP to a given list of countries while allowing you to use that service even if it is not allowed in that region. </p>
<p> Here are the best free VPN apps for Android that you might want to install: </p>
<p> 1. Tunnel Bear </p>
<p> Tunnel Bear is the go-to VPN app for Android users, geo-locations may limit it but the ones it provides are sufficient. The VPN comes with a free option; however, these options have bandwidth limitations that are very less and won’t help you much with streaming. </p>
<p> 2. Express VPN </p>
<p> Express VPN is also a famous name in the VPN market. If you are somehow not convinced with Tunnel Bear, then this definitely deserves your attention. It has more geo-locations, so it has better chances of offering lower latency connection. The downside for Express VPN is that it doesn’t offer any free version and starts with $12.95 a month. </p>
<p> Best File Managers </p>
<p> Android TV nowadays has become more than just a media-streaming device. With an ever-developing Android ecosystem, you will need a reliable file manager to navigate the local and external storage on your Android TV. File managers become increasingly useful when transferring files from externals storage such as SD cards, flash drives, or hard drives. To better manage your files, here are some of the best file managers for Android TV. </p>
<p> 1. FX File Explorer </p>
<p> FX File Explorer is a great ad-free app for managing files, documents, images, and apps stored on your Android TV. The app comes with a variety of features such as: </p>
<p> Neatly designed home page UI with the support for split-screen mode, </p>
<p> Tool backed by AI for cleaning phone storage as well as to show what is taking space on your device, </p>
<p> Manage all of your cloud storage including Dropbox, Google Drive, or Sky Drive, </p>
<p> The app enables you to manage your media files such as downloads and storage space and move things around from one folder to another to easily organize your files. The file manager provides classic desktop options such as cut, copy, paste, create, delete, and rename. Furthermore, you can also decompress files to ZIP or RAR. </p>
<p> 2. Airscreen </p>
<p> Due to various incompatibilities between the two ecosystems, i.e. iOS and Android, it is nearly impossible to cast videos from an iPhone to Android TV. The main reason for this is that Android TV supports Google Cast, which is only compatible with Android devices. However, with the help of the AirScreen app, iPhone users can cast their device’s screen to Android TV. </p>
<p> AirScreen is compatible with multiple operating systems including iOS 8, 9, 10, 11, 12; macOS; Windows 10; and Android. It also provides support for multiple applications such as iTunes, YouTube, Safari, and Chrome. Some of its useful features include: </p>
<p> Encrypted transmission (protects your privacy), </p>
<p> High-resolution images (4K), </p>
<p> Video hardware acceleration, </p>
<p> 3. Google Drive </p>
<p> If you regularly access files on your Android TV, then what better to do it than Google Drive. Google’s very own cloud storage service is one of the most popular online storage services on the Internet. Installing this app grants you unlimited access to your cloud storage while allowing you to view all the stored content on the big screen. It is fully compatible with Android TV. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, you won’t be able to find it in the Android TV’s version of the Play Store. You need to sideload it first and then launch it via a third-party launcher. Once you install Google Drive, you will be able to sync all your devices together as well as transfer and manage all the files between them. </p>
<p> Best Android TV Launchers </p>
<p> Although the manufacturers do not recommend sideloading launcher because using apps that are not on the store can be dangerous from a software standpoint. However, if you are cautious enough about where you download your apps from, then you are going to be fine. </p>
<p> The issue is that on Android TV, the launcher does not show the sideloaded apps, which is why we need special launchers that can make the sideloaded apps visible. The downside is that they are usually buggy and sometimes may not be able to work at all. However, they can greatly increase the potential of Android TV (more on how to sideload apps on Android TV at the end of this blog post). </p>
<p> We already have a list of speedy launchers for Android but you can try the ones we have mentioned below too: </p>
<p> 1. Sideload Launcher for Android TV </p>
<p> Sideload Launcher comes from the famous developer, Chainfire. The sideload launcher is fairly simple, and it does what it is supposed to do without any extra features. While certainly not as streamlined or seamless as the average user would wish for their TV, many apps can still function on some level on these devices if you sideload them. This launcher lacks the customizability too. </p>
<p> 2. HALauncher </p>
<p> HALauncher is an alternative to Sideload Launcher that offers similar features; however, the interface is a lot better and provides more customization. One downside of the HA Launcher is that when Google apps update it starts to mess up, so it is better to turn off the auto-update with this one or use it only when you have to use a sideloaded app. Another downside is that it contains ads, which might affect the overall usability. </p>
<p> Bonus: Best Gaming App For Your Android TV </p>
<p> 1. Stream Link for Android TV </p>
<p> The Stream Link came to the Play Store in May, last year. The app brought the much-needed feature of enabling streaming from PC to other Android devices. Simply put, the app brings desktop gaming to your Android devices. It means if you have a good Internet connection, you can stream your games at up to 4K 60fps. </p>
<p> Pair a Bluetooth/Stream controller to your Android TV and connect it to a computer running Steam on the same local network. You can then start playing your games. An important thing to take into consideration is that for better streaming performance on Android TV you have to make sure you have connected your Stream PC and Android TV to your home network via Ethernet or wired connection. </p>
<p> How to Sideload APKs on Android TV </p>
<p> The process of sideloading Android apps is fairly easy and simple. Just follow these steps, and you will be good to sideload any app on your Android TV: </p>
<p> On your Android TV, go to the Settings menu and navigate to Security. </p>
<p> Now you need to enable “install from unknown sources.” </p>
<p> Once unknown sources are enabled, you can download any APK you want to sideload and install them using a file explorer we have recommended i.e. “FX File Explorer.” </p>

<p> 11 Best Free Antivirus & Anti-malware Apps for Android </p>
<p> Malware and viruses have been around since the early days. The first computer virus was made back in the ’80s </p>
<p> Malware and viruses have been around since the early days. The first computer virus was made back in the ’80s by the name of “Brain.” As time passed, computers went through various revolutionary phases and transformed into much sleeker forms. </p>
<p> With the advent of smartphones, viruses have also plagued this platform in the form of malicious apps, phishing attacks, adware, and much more. A lot of these malicious apps cause advert apps to pop up on your smartphone screen. </p>
<p> Those popup ads may make you worried but it should be the least of your worries because the most troublesome aspect of these viruses is that some dubious organizations or people use these malicious apps to spy on the data stored on your Android device and steal it. </p>
<p> To better fight the major and minor threats of viruses, antivirus apps for Android are an easy and quick way to root out any existing malware on your smartphone. Since the core focus of antivirus apps is to prevent programs such as ransomware, Trojan, botnets, and other modern-day viruses from getting a hold of your phone, they are the most reliable defense against such threats. </p>
<p> Before we jump onto the list of best Antivirus for Android, let’s first have a look at how to keep yourself safe from malicious Android apps: </p>
<p> Well, the first and foremost priority of any Android user from a security perspective should be not to mess with any default system settings or allow the installation of apps from an unknown source. Unless you’re an experienced user and are aware of the nitty-gritty details of the process and its consequences, you should otherwise stay away from conducting any experiments on your Android phone. </p>
<p> The Play Protect on Google Play store keeps you and your device safe from malicious apps that are violating any of Google’s policies and prompts an uninstallation message to the user if any app violates its rules. However, as we progress further, we will learn that there are a lot of nuances that lead to the security breaches for the end-user. </p>
<p> Best Antivirus and Anti-malware for Android </p>
<p> Moving on to the primary focus of our discussion, we have reviewed the top ten antiviruses, which we think are currently the best antivirus from a security perspective. The selection is based on malware detection and usability, including performance and false positives. </p>
<p> Furthermore, to better guide you about the reliability and effectiveness of antivirus, we have looked into the performance statistics of the app, which have been thoroughly tested by AV-TEST, an independent research institute for IT security. The percentages provided throughout this article are in-line with the tests conducted by AV-TEST. </p>
<p> Avast </p>

<p> Thanks to the wide-scale reachability of Android and the fact that its open-source capability has made Android the most popular OS in the world. Ever since the early days of Android, viruses on the Android OS have hit the headlines more often than not, and unfortunately. </p>
<p> It’s true that historically, Android has been more prone to be attacked from viruses or malicious apps because of is reachability, a more significant community of developers, and a larger number of apps, which has caused some security breaches as well. A better and more efficient way to counter such threats is by using an antivirus that can notify you about such risks and nullify them in due course. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> That was a complete list of what we think are the best modern-day antivirus apps for your Android device. The antiviruses we have reviewed above all have one thing in common; they all provide superb malware detection and protection. So, no matter what your preference is, these suggested antivirus apps will make sure to keep your phone protected from any possible risk. </p>
<p> Furthermore, these antivirus apps are well optimized for Android OS, so they will not cause any lag or performance issues.

<p> 6 Best App Killer Task Manager for Android </p>
<p> Best app killer and task manager apps for Android to help fix your resource-hungry and slow phone. Did your Android device become slow and started to drain a lot of battery power lately? But you don’t know what to do? We have a possible solution for you… </p>
<p> What happens is that in case you install a poorly developed app on your device and run it, the app will start to consume a considerable chunk of RAM and resources and continues to run in the background. That negatively affects your device’s performance. </p>
<p> To help you find and stop any of the resource-hungry apps, we have listed the best app killers for Android. </p>
<p> But before we move onto our list of best app killer for Android, we would first like to provide you some quick facts about how Android OS handles memory and why it could be a bad idea to frequently use an app killer to stop/kill essential apps on Android. </p>
<p> How Android OS Handles Memory/RAM? </p>
<p> For the beginners or for those who are unaware about the working of the Android OS, it is important to understand that Android handles the RAM in a completely different way as compared to the Windows OS (we compared it with Windows because that is what most of the users have used). </p>
<p> If you know how to see a list of currently running apps on Android, then you must have noticed that several apps are running all the time, even though you are not using them, right? </p>
<p> That is how Android is designed to handle apps. And that is precisely what allows the Android device to let you quickly open the apps as well as switch between multiple apps without waiting for them to load because those apps are already loaded in the RAM. </p>
<p> And in those cases, when you are running an app that requires a lot of RAM, for example, a gaming app, the Android OS will automatically kill the least necessary apps to free up memory and allocates it to the game. </p>
<p> And once you close that game, Android will automatically reopen any essential app that was killed/stopped during the process. </p>
<p> Even though the Android OS is smart enough to automatically kill and restart the background apps depending on your usage. But at times, some apps are poorly developed and have some flaws/memory leaks that use all of your device’s resources, ultimately making your device slow or unresponsive. </p>
<p> That is exactly when a need to use an app killer arises, which is designed to kill any buggy app or unresponsive task and will help you to quickly stop that app from eating up the resources hence making your phone responsive again. </p>
<p> How To Make The Most Out Of App Killer On Android </p>
<p> In most of the cases, app killers and task managers do more harm to your Android device than doing much good because the app killer itself would be continuously running in the background to help you monitor and stop an unresponsive app. </p>
<p> Or, in worst cases, using the app killer to kill essential apps will have a direct impact on your device’s performance that would ultimately drain the battery a lot faster. </p>
<p> You must be wondering that how killing an app is going to have any impact on the battery. Right? </p>
<p> What actually happens is, whenever you try to kill an app that is necessary and should not be stopped, Android will automatically restart it. </p>
<p> Moreover, this whole stopping and the restarting process of apps will unnecessarily consume your device’s resources, slows it down, and will negatively affect the battery. </p>
<p> Best App Killer & Task Manager Apps for Android </p>
<p> With that being said, app killers and task managers are specifically designed to help you kill and stop the poorly written app that continues to run in the background all the time without any reason. </p>
<p> Now, as you have learned about how to make the most out of the app killer, so without any further ado here are the six best app killer for Android: </p>
<p> 1 – Native/Stock Android App Manager </p>
<p> In case you don’t know, Android comes with a native app manager that has a capability of app killer and lets you view a list of all the apps running on your device along with the amount of memory each of them is consuming and for how long they have been running. </p>
<p> The Android stock app killer is not only limited to that. It even allows you to force stop/kill those apps that are conflicting with your device or are resource hungry. And because this feature is built-in in your device and is much reliable, so we believe installing a third-party app is not necessary. </p>
<p> Allow you to force stop app. </p>
<p> It is preinstalled with Android system. </p>

<p> 15 Best App Lockers For Android That You will Ever Need </p>
<p> Did you ever want to add another layer of security on your Android device to further enhance the overall privacy </p>
<p> Did you ever want to add another layer of security on your Android device to further enhance the overall privacy of your data? You should install app locker, which provides you with an option to put pattern lock or password lock on any individual app you want to secure. Here we have reviewed 15 best app locker for Android. </p>
<p> With the constant development in hardware and software, Android can provide us with lots of security options to lock the screen of our Android devices. From a simple pattern lock to a complicated alphanumeric password, different variants of facial unlock (including Iris scanner) to something as simple as a biometric lock, smartphones have never been this much secure. </p>
<p> While the luxury of fingerprint and face unlock has become a mainstream necessity thanks to the advancement in software and hardware technology, which has made it cheap and allowed mobile phone manufacturers to include the feature in most of their latest smartphones. There is still, however, a lot of smartphone users out there who might be using an older Android phone, which doesn’t have these advanced unlocking capabilities. For these people, app lockers are perhaps the best-suited alternative. </p>
<p> Best App Locker for Your Android Phone/Tablet </p>
<p> The best thing about the Android ecosystem is that you can get the majority of the apps for free. Here is our recommendation for the best app lockers for Android, which can help you add another layer of security and further secure the data stored in your Android device. All of the app lockers we have reviewed below will offer you a range of security options including pattern, PIN, and password to protect any app. </p>
<p> 1. AppLock by DoMobile Lab </p>
<p> AppLock by DoMobile Lab is one of the oldest players in the app lock game and is hands down one of the best app locks the Android ecosystem has seen. It has many features to offer and further includes a theme store as well. AppLock can also offer additional security through the helper app, which makes it pretty secure. With additional security ‘activated,’ it prevents any attempt to uninstall or force stop the app. </p>
<p> The feature list doesn’t just stop here. It comes with a vault built into it to hide your private media files. The vault did pass our security test, and we weren’t able to get the media file however we were able to delete them, but that wouldn’t have been possible without knowing if the app exists on the device, which you can hide using the app itself. </p>
<p> Other features include setting up custom profiles for locking apps and notification. It also has a built-in power-saving mode. It is limited to three ways of authentication. To be more precise, it has all the essential features you will ever want in an app locker. The best part is that it is available for free and if the app fulfills your requirements then you can also buy the paid version which enables a few advanced features and removes ads too. </p>
<p> Pre-equipped with Gallery Vault, </p>
<p> Power saver and app uninstall protection, </p>
<p> Theme support, </p>
<p> Hide app icon, </p>
<p> Automatic locking based on time, location, and SMS, </p>
<p> Allows multiple custom profiles with the ability to lock system apps, </p>
<p> Recovery through security question and email. </p>
<p> 2. Avast Antivirus Mobile Security & Virus Cleaner by Avast Software </p>
<p> In case you are looking for an application that does everything then Avast Antivirus is the one you should install on your Android smartphone. It not only gives us the functionality to lock apps and media files but it also gives us added security as it is one of the most famous antiviruses and security program. </p>
<p> Avast also gives you a VPN service to protect your privacy as well as the anti-theft lock that locks your phone if it gets stolen. The downside is that being an antivirus program, it does not come with as many features as other app lock applications do, but it gets the job done. </p>
<p> Provides antivirus (security from malicious files), </p>
<p> Features an App Lock functionality, </p>
<p> Adds the facility of Call Blocker (supported on Android 8.1 and later), </p>
<p> Provides Anti-Theft, VPN and RAM Booster, </p>
<p> Also gives the option of Photo Vault to store your private photos, </p>
<p> 3. AppLock Fingerprint by SpSoft </p>
<p> AppLock Fingerprint takes a lean approach to the footprint of the app size. If the other two apps are too big for you then you can give this one a try as it comes with most of the features of the app lock except for some features like hiding the app and getting it back using the dial pad or browser URL. </p>
<p> This AppLock app not only shares similarities with other apps in the list but also offers its features like scalable pattern lock, fingerprint lock, multiple passwords for different apps. It also offers functionality to lock the screen with its lock in case you find it more secure or aesthetically pleasing as compared to the stock screen locker. </p>
<p> Lightweight and small app size around 3MB, </p>
<p> You can replace stock Android home screen lock with this lock app, </p>
<p> Scalable pattern lock, which means the pattern matrix size could be as big as 18×18, </p>
<p> Supports fingerprint locking, </p>
<p> Intruder notifier that takes a picture and sends it your email in case someone tries to access the locked app. </p>
<p> 4. Perfect AppLock (App Protector) by Morrison Software </p>
<p> Beyond a conventional app locker, Perfect AppLock checks all the boxes for being one of the great apps for locking and privacy. It comes with the features like intruder detection, automated locking based on location or connected device, vault, preventing force uninstall and force close of the app. The thing that separates this app lock from other apps is the ability to control settings like screen rotation, screen filter, and screen brightness for individual apps. </p>
<p> The downside of the Perfect AppLock is that the free version comes with ads, and it doesn’t have other cool features like controlling brightness and rotation for apps. Aesthetically the app is kept simple and mostly adapts to the user wallpaper for the lock screen. </p>
<p> Lock any app by using PIN, pattern, or gesture, </p>
<p> Screen Filter support that helps you effectively manage screen brightness of individual apps, </p>
<p> Rotation Lock support prevents unwanted screen rotation on selected apps, </p>

<p> 5. Lock App Smart App Locker by Anuj Tenani </p>
<p> Lock App Smart App Locker is a locker app that has taken a much leaner approach. It’s completely free, which means unlike other apps we have reviewed above, this app is ad-free, has a small app size, and consumes very low battery. </p>
<p> We will highly recommend this app for people who are looking for a simple app lock experience but are keeping themselves away because they fear performance degradation. However due to such downsize approach; number of key features offered in the app is quite limited. It doesn’t come with media vault, and anyone can easily terminate or uninstall the app using the settings. </p>
<p> Supports locking of any app using PIN, pattern, gesture or fingerprint, </p>
<p> Completely free and contains zero advertisements, </p>
<p> Small footprint so it won’t consume a lot of system resources, </p>
<p> Low battery impact, which means greater battery life. </p>
<p> 6. MaxLock Xposed App Locker by Maxr1998 </p>
<p> If you are a power user and got root and Xposed module setup on your Android device then MaxLock is the app locker designed for you. Due to the app being dependent over the Xposed module, it puts less strain on the system and is stronger app locker compared to other options. It is also completely ad-free and bloat-free with multiple powerful app locking mechanisms. </p>
<p> The downside of the app is that it doesn’t come with media vault; however, it makes up for that missing feature by providing other one-of-a-kind features like support for tasker as well as the ability to disable the app from appearing in the recent apps list. The app also has a non-Xposed version for no-root devices, but it is less powerful and overshadows the true potential of the app. </p>
<p> Lock any app by using different locking methods PIN, pattern, gesture, knock code, or fingerprint (Fingerprint requires Android Marshmallow), </p>
<p> Completely free of cost and clean from the advertisement or any bloatware, </p>
<p> Requires very fewer resources to perform app locking magic, </p>
<p> Native support for Tasker, in case you are looking for automation, </p>
<p> Lots of customization options in UI, </p>
<p> Option to hide incoming notifications from locked apps. </p>
<p> 7. Oops! AppLock by Keybotivated </p>
<p> Oops AppLock is perhaps the unique app lock in this list as it doesn’t use conventional password or pattern authentication methods. The app uses hardware key combinations for the authentication, i.e. volume keys. </p>
<p> You can set up a custom lock screen to hide the app locking status. The app hides pretty well and prevents itself from being force killed or uninstalled. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t come with any extra features and also lacks a secure media vault. </p>
<p> Lock any apps by using volume hardware buttons, </p>
<p> Completely invisible and unnoticeable app locker, </p>
<p> Offers different UI customizability options to choose from, </p>
<p> Allows you to lock any app you want without any limitation. </p>
<p> 8. AppLocker Lock Apps Fingerprint, PIN, Pattern by BGNmobi </p>
<p> The AppLocker by BGNmobi has a more colorful approach. It focuses on customization but falls short on the feature list and can also be terminated easily from the settings. The cool thing about this app lock is that it gets the job done and offers customization with no complicated stuff. </p>
<p> If you want colorful and highly customizable app locker that does not consume a lot of resources and doesn’t put much stress on the system resources then this is the app locker you should have on your Android device. </p>

<p> 11. Password to Power Off, App Lock, Vault: lockIO by Locking Partners </p>
<p> As the name suggests, Password to Power Off is an app that allows you to put a password on the option to turn off your phone. The philosophy of this app lock is to prevent the phone from theft. The app is fairly strict in terms of enforcing security; therefore, it prevents killing or uninstallation of the app. </p>
<p> Other than locking the power off option, it can send the location and take a picture in case of an attempt to break into any of the locked apps is recorded. The app also offers media vault to hide photos and videos from the gallery and puts them behind a stronger password. </p>

<p> AppLock Fingerprint Pro is the first paid entry on our list of best app lockers for Android that doesn’t have a free option.

<p> Media Vault that lets you keep your private photos and videos hidden behind a secure lock, </p>

<p> 13. Lockdown Pro AppLock & Vault by The Lockdown Team </p>
<p> XDA’s favorite app lock Lockdown Pro has all the necessary features one needs in an app locker app. Though, Lockdown Pro falls short, as it doesn’t have the most important functionality, i.e. the ability to prevent force stop and uninstallation of the app. </p>
<p> Despite that limitation, Lockdown Pro has some features of its own that differentiate itself from its competition. There are different lock modes, including calculator lock and time lock, a smart unlocking feature that unlocks your device through smartwatch, car, or even WiFi.

<p> We all grew up knowing the Pokemon from either trading card games, anime series, or the first video game from Nintendo that was released in 1996 for Game Boy. Pokemon are fictional characters that humans (their trainers) catch and keep them as pets to train and compete against each other. </p>
<p> Later on, the Pokemon media franchise grew into most sold trading card games and became the second best-selling video game. Keeping the popularity of the Pokemon franchise in mind, Niantic Incorporation chose it for their first AR (Augmented Reality) based game and released Pokémon Go that encourages its players to physically move from their geolocation and actively explore the area around them. </p>
<p> Pokémon GO was one of the first games that require you to get up from the couch and move in real-time, and this concept was widely appreciated throughout the globe. During its peak popularity, we have seen people roaming around the neighborhood in search of Pokemon as well as crowds at different Pokestops (to get free items or lure Pokemon). All of which moved socializing and mobile gaming one-step forward. </p>
<p> Later on, Niantic Studios and other developers started to adopt AR to develop more games based on the same technology. Mobile phone devices got further advancement with new generation processors, enhanced RAM, and extended battery life to make sure the resource-hungry AR-based games continue to run smoothly. </p>
<p> In this blog post, we have reviewed about ten popular Android games similar to Pokémon GO that you may like and should try. </p>

<p> How To Use Battery Saver Mode On Pokémon Go? </p>
<p> Tired of keeping your cell phone always plugged into a battery bank or an external power source to make sure </p>
<p> Tired of keeping your cell phone always plugged into a battery bank or an external power source to make sure you can play Pokémon Go throughout the day? </p>
<p> We all are well aware of the fact that Pokémon Go is a battery hungry app and requires a lot of battery juice. And battery hogging is the same reason why most of the players opted for power banks to keep their phone’s battery at the optimum level so that they can continue playing the game without letting the phone die. </p>
<p> But now you might not need to do all that because there is a battery saver mode built right into the app and available for your convenience. </p>
<p> Yes, you heard that right! 😀 </p>
<p> Developers did include a battery saver mode in the app, and many users are not even aware of it. </p>
<p> Here I am going to teach you how to use battery saver mode on Pokémon Go so that you can save battery and play the game for extended hours on a single charge. </p>
<p> How To Use Battery Saver Mode On Pokémon Go? </p>
<p> Below I have included a step-by-step guide along with the pictures to make it easier for you to enable the battery saver mode on Pokémon Go. </p>
<p> Step #01 – On the Pokémon Go, while you are on the Map view, tap the Poké Ball icon located at the bottom of the screen, this will pop up the options menu. </p>
<p> Step #02 – Under the options menu, tap on the “Settings” button located at the upper-right corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Step #03 – In the Settings section, you will see a Battery Saver check box. Tap on it to enable the battery saver mode. </p>
<p> What the battery saver mode does is that it forces your phone to enter a low-power state mode whenever you hold your cell phone in an upside down position, so that the app consumes fewer system resources while you are walking around which in turn saves a significant amount of battery power. </p>
<p> Why Battery Saver Mode On Pokémon Go Is Not Working? </p>
<p> I have seen a lot of users complaining that the battery saver on Pokémon Go is not working. Here is my answer for those users: </p>
<p> Pokémon save battery option does the following things to your phone whenever you hold it in an upside down position: </p>
<p> Shows a black Pokémon Go picture on the screen, </p>
<p> Turns off the touch capabilities on the app. </p>
<p> Now to properly understand the working of this battery saver mode, you need to be aware of the two most popular display screen types i.e. LCDs and OLEDs. </p>
<p> In case you don’t know, different phones have different display screens. Some phones have LCD screen, while others have OLED display screens. </p>
<p> OLED screens are much more power efficient because they are capable of showing true blacks, as compared to the LCD screens that uses a backlight and displaying black picture doesn’t turn off the backlight. </p>
<p> So, if you enable the Pokémon Go battery saver mode on a phone that have a LCD screen then this will make you think that your phone’s screen has been turned off, however, in reality, it will be on and consume your battery power. </p>
<p> Basically, in a nutshell, this battery saver mode is specially suitable for phones that have OLED display screen and will save a significant amount of your phone’s battery. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Did the Pokémon Go built-in battery saver functionality helped you in improving your phone’s battery life? Do share you experience in the comments section down below. </p>

<p> Most of the Android devices come pre-loaded with the Google Keyboard (Gboard) app. If you don’t have it installed already on your phone then you can download the latest version from the Google Play store. </p>
<p> Once installed, you need to download the Bitmoji app and set it up. You can head over to the Google Play store and download the Bitmoji app. You need to set up the profile and other settings of the Bitmoji before you can integrate it with the Google Keyboard. </p>

<p> In the next screen, enter the basic profile details, including the first name, last name, email address, and password. Then tap on the Sign-up. You can choose your gender in the next screen by tapping on either the male or female avatars. </p>

Choose your preference for each of these options to proceed. </p>
<p> After setting up the avatar, the app will welcome you with a collection of pre-designed stickers based on your custom avatar. You can use these stickers to share on social media or other supported chat interfaces. You can always make changes to your avatar in the options available on the top bar of the app. </p>

<p> Ultimate Guide to Block YouTube Ads on Android </p>
<p> YouTube is an American website with headquarter in San Bruno, California. It was developed in February 2005 and has been </p>
<p> YouTube is an American website with headquarter in San Bruno, California. It was developed in February 2005 and has been exceptionally grown ever since. Mobile website and app were developed over time, which attracted almost 1,300,000,000 active users today and 300 hours of videos being uploaded to YouTube every single minute. Yes, it is amazing and signifies the popularity of YouTube in the current era. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, in late 2007, after Google acquired YouTube, they started to monetize the website and added partner programs. Then they begin showing in-video ads, but users were always given the option to skip those ads, so it didn’t cause any hassle. </p>
<p> Today, several types of ads are being shown on YouTube, few are very much intrusive and affect our overall experience so let’s talk about those first, and then we will move onto the apps and tricks to block YouTube ads on Android. </p>
<p> Types of Advertisements we see on YouTube </p>
<p> At the Beginning of the Videos – You often have to watch the ads at the start of a video, and you get the option to skip those ads only after 5-10 seconds. These do cause hassle, but the idea is to give users the convenience of an uninterrupted video by showing an ad in the beginning. </p>
<p> In-video Ads – Some YouTubers allow YouTube to show ads in-between their videos, and such ads do help YouTubers to earn some extra bucks even though they can get a bit annoying when you are watching a video, and you are forced to wait for about 15-30 seconds for an ad to finish. </p>
<p> Unskippable Ads – YouTube introduced these ads in late 2018, and they are quite a hassle for us viewers as we are not able to skip these ads and forced to watch it until the end. </p>
<p> We all want to be able to skip these ads or somehow block them on our mobile devices so we can enjoy our favorite videos without going through those unnecessary ads. </p>
<p> Well, nothing to be worried about, and you are in the right place as we have thoroughly researched for this and compiled a list of ways through which you can block ads on YouTube and have the seamless YouTube experience that you are looking for. </p>
<p> How to Block YouTube Ads on Android </p>
<p> There are several options that we have tried ourselves and will be sharing with you in detail about blocking YouTube ads on Android phones. </p>
<p> Whether you prefer using the official YouTube app, want an alternative YouTube app with built-in ad blocking on Android, or maybe you want to stream YouTube directly on the Android web browser. </p>
<p> We have divided this section into two subcategories and reviewed all the possible options below: </p>
<p> Using Browsers with Built-in YouTube Ad Blocker – If you are comfortable using a new browser for streaming YouTube videos, then we will suggest you consider installing a browser with a built-in ad-blocking feature. We have compiled a list of browsers for Android discussing their features to help make your choice easier. </p>
<p> Third-party YouTube Apps with Ad Blocking – Many third-party YouTube apps come with ad-blocking while giving you the exact same feature and functionality of the original YouTube app. In this section, we have reviewed some of the most popular YouTube alternative apps. </p>
<p> 1. Android Browsers with YouTube Ad Block Feature </p>
<p> To help you block YouTube ads on Android devices, we have reviewed a handful of Android web browsers that comes with native ad-block functionality: </p>
<p> Brave Browser </p>
<p> Built on the same engine as Chrome and with a similar interface, Brave has a built-in ad blocker that ensures no ads may interrupt your internet browsing, and you can stream YouTube videos without being forced to watch an advertisement. </p>
<p> The features are similar to that of Chrome-like history, bookmarks, and allow you to keep track of third party cookies. The only con is that you cannot sync your bookmarks and history across devices. </p>
<p> So if you would like to use the default Chrome browser for your day-to-day web browsing and you are tired of those ads, Brave is the best choice for you. </p>
<p> ArmorFly </p>
<p> ArmorFly focuses on user’s data protection and safety over the internet. Its core purpose is to ensure the safekeeping of your personal data while the built-in ad blocker ensures that no ad can interrupt your web browsing experience. </p>
<p> ArmorFly comes with a vault that you can use to encrypt your sensitive data and also has native malware protection that scans every downloaded file for malware and viruses, which keeps your Android device safe and secure. </p>
<p> Other features include night mode, effective incognito mode, and customized ad blocking settings that allow you to choose the websites you want to add to either whitelist or blacklist to unblock or block advertisements. </p>
<p> Opera </p>
<p> We all must have heard the name of Opera and have used it at least once in our lifetime. It’s one of the oldest web browsers designed developed back in April 1995. It is well known for its safety, stability, and agility. Its built-in compression allows you a faster web surfing experience while consuming fewer Internet data. </p>
<p> Opera comes with a built-in adblocker feature that can be enabled with a single click, and you can stream YouTube videos or surf through the internet without watching the ads. The only con is that the ad-blocking feature is non-customizable, and you cannot whitelist or blacklist websites. </p>
<p> Turbo Browser </p>
<p> As the name suggests, the Turbo browser focuses on speed and is extremely fast. It comes with an ad block feature that allows you to block all the unwanted ads with a simple tap so you can just sit back and enjoy your favorite videos on YouTube. </p>
<p> For an enhanced and superfast browsing experience, Turbo Browser allows you to choose not to load images while browsing websites. It has a minimal interface, and similar to other browsers, it fills the spaces from where ads were removed for an immersive experience. </p>
<p> Mozilla Firefox </p>
<p> Released in 2011, Mozilla Firefox for Android carved its niche by extended security and stability. It utilizes lesser hardware resources compared to other web browsers ensuring a fast browsing experience and offers optimum security for regular users. Firefox is one of those rare browsers that allow the installation of add-ons. </p>
<p> Below we have listed three popular Mozilla Firefox add-ons that allow you to block unwanted ads while streaming YouTube videos on Android without affecting your browsing speed. </p>
<p> Adblock Plus (ABP) – Adblock Plus is one of the most popular and open-source add-ons for adblocking and content filtration. It not only allows you to block ads on static webpages but also enables you to block annoying YouTube ads. It also supports websites that run unobtrusive ads by not blocking them.Download Adblock Plus add-on for Firefox </p>
<p> uBlock Origin – uBlock Origin is another popular and efficient adblocker that not only blocks static and pop-up ads but also helps you block video ads on YouTube.

You just need to install and activate the add-on to start enjoying YouTube videos without ads.Download uBlock Origin add-on for Firefox </p>

It has a very efficient ad-blocker that gives you a truly customizable ad-blocking experience and can help you block video ads on YouTube as well as other video streaming sites.Download Ghostery for Firefox </p>
<p> 2. Third-Party YouTube Apps with Ad Blocking </p>
<p> Some of us want to stick to the original YouTube app while others are okay with third-party YouTube apps that come with additional useful features. We have tested and compiled a list of popular third-party apps that you can use as an alternative to the official YouTube app and avoid those video ads while enjoying your favorite music videos, vlogs, or watching tutorials on YouTube. </p>
<p> NOTE: You may need to allow installations from unknown sources on your Android device to be able to install these YouTube ad-blocking apps. To do so, on your device, go to Settings -> Security and enable the option “Allow installation from Unknown Sources.” </p>
<p> NewPipe </p>
<p> NewPipe is one of the latest additions to the league. An open-source app that does not require you to root your device to block ads on YouTube and let you download videos in audio and video formats. </p>
<p> NewPipe gives you a search bar using which you can search for your favorite YouTube videos and watch them because it does not support logging into the YouTube account. The resolution choices are also limited. But if you are looking for an app that is light on hardware and does the job with zero ads, NewPipe is your go-to. </p>
<p> Features – Audio playback in the background, no ads, allows audio and video downloads. </p>
<p> Pros – Zero ads, minimal interface, no need to root your device. </p>
<p> Cons – Does not allow login to YouTube account, does not support 1080p or higher resolutions. </p>
<p> iTube Android </p>

<p> If you are looking for an ad-free YouTube experience, then we will highly recommend OGYouTube. You can even log in to your account to enjoy the personalized YouTube experience. </p>

<p> Although TubeMate itself is free to download and use but it is ad-supported so that the developers can keep the app updated, but it can block YouTube ads on Android. Talking about its download functionality, it allows you to download videos directly to your phone’s internal storage or SD card. </p>

<p> FlyTube is one of the most lightweight alternatives to YouTube that uses minimal resources, blocks all the unwanted ads, and does the job just fine without putting much strain on the hardware of your Android device. </p>
<p> Similar to OGYouTube, FlyTube has a hover mode (Picture-In-Picture mode) too, that allows you to watch videos in a small window while you are using another app. It also lets you sign in to your YouTube account and use your customized playlist. </p>

<p> YouTube Go is not limited to streaming, but you can even download videos for offline viewing while keeping a continuous check on your data usage and storage. The app is so data-friendly that it lets you preview videos before you watch or download them. </p>

<p> BONUS: Watch Ad-Free Videos with YouTube Premium </p>
<p> Similar to other video streaming services out there, YouTube is free to use. However, they offer a paid subscription as well named as YouTube Premium. The subscription not only lets you enjoy a truly ad-free experience without any boundaries of platforms ranging from website to mobile app. </p>
<p> YouTube Premium also grants you access to the exclusive content available on the platform, including YouTube Originals, which includes exclusive series and movies, and YouTube Music Premium, where you will get to use features like background playback as well as the ability to download them for offline playback. </p>
<p> Google does offer a one-month free trial, and after that, you need to pay $11.99 a month for YouTube Premium. </p>
<p> There are chances that a lot of us are not able to afford a monthly subscription for YouTube Premium or it might be possible that the Premium service is not even available in our country so this is where we have to find alternatives to enjoy the video content without being disturbed by unwanted ads. </p>

<p> Which Call Blocker Is Your Personal Favourite? </p>
<p> Out of the 12 best spam call blocker apps for Android, my personal favorite is Calls Blacklist by Vlad Lee and Truecaller as both of these app are easy to use, allows me to save the blacklist, have caller ID functionality, provides scheduling, lightweight and does not consume much resources. </p>
<p> Which app did you install on your Android phone to block incoming calls? I would love to hear your experience in the comments section below. 🙂 </p>
<p> I have no anything useful yet. I want to make sure they can’t leave a voicemail. I want to simply hang up. </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_wF5r7EU6r8:disqus, if you simply want to hang up then any app should work for you. If you want my suggestion then download Call Blacklist by Vlad Lee. That’s what I use on my phone too. </p>
<p> Hey @disqus_wF5r7EU6r8:disqus, a little heads-up. I have looked into your problem further and found an app called “Extreme Call Blocker” available here. It supports automatic pick-up and hangup feature that prevents the blocked caller from leaving a voicemail. </p>
<p> Hi @mohammadfarzanhussain:disqus I was Extreme Call Blocker’s biggest fan but it is no longer supported by the developer. It was the one app which had the ability to answer a call and disconnect it so that unwanted callers couldn’t leave voicemail. It was very easy to tweak ECB to work in conjunction with Truecaller and the stock phone app that came with my Samsung Galaxy S7. I am now receiving about 30 unwanted calls per day and I am no longer able to keep blocked callers from leaving me voicemail. I don’t want robocallers, bill collectors or former acquaintances to have the capability of getting inside my voice mailbox but apparently the ability to disconnect blocked calls stopped with subsequent Android system upgrades (I’m on Nougat now). Would you kindly let me know if you should hear any news of a redesigned app that keeps callers out of voicemail on Nougat or Oreo? Many thanks! </p>
<p> Hi @Natalie McDonald. Thanks for stopping by and sharing your query with us. You are right about Extreme Call Blocker being outdated. It was last updated during the end of May last year. It hurts when these one-of-a-kind Android apps with exclusive features are left outdated. </p>
<p> Anyways, I did some in-depth research on call blocking apps and tried some newly updated apps that offer what you are looking for i.e. blocking of calls by automatic pick-up and hang-up functionality. I found 2 apps but only first one will work on Nougat: </p>
<p> 1. Should I Answer? by Mister Group s.r.o — I have tried this one. The app’s description page does not mention about blocked calls pickup and hangup feature, however, the functionality has been implemented but currently in a testing phase. And please note that there is a possibility that it may not work on all Android phones. I have read somewhere that Samsung, on their new phones, has disabled the functionality required to make this feature work. But you can give it a try. The app is free. </p>
<p> 2. Mr. Number by Hiya — This app has a hang-up functionality but it won’t work on Android 5.0 or later, as already mentioned in the description area. So don’t waste your time on trying this app. I tried but the option isn’t even visible in the app. </p>
<p> Go ahead and try the app “Should I Answer?” and then let me know if it helped you in keeping blocked callers from leaving a voicemail. 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi Mohammad! I also spent several hours researching this after I left my original post and came to the same conclusion that Should I Answer was the best app to try. I had to do a lot of tweaking and rebooting on the first day and still an unwanted voicemail got through. The app’s settings menu also did not even offer me the “pick and hang” option it advertised. However, by the second day no voicemail messages were received from the one unwanted number that finally manages to get through after several attempts per day. But that was Sunday so maybe the call center agents weren’t trying as hard. Now it’s Monday and that will be the real test as I get about 30 unwanted calls on weekdays, more than weekends. I want to thank you for your prompt and courteous thorough response — let’s hope this works! </p>
<p> You are welcome, Natalie! Good to hear that you already found out about this great call blocking app on your own. I am glad you managed to set it up on your phone. The interface is a bit confusing as it has a lot of different options but you just need to set it once and then it will take care of your call blocking needs. </p>
<p> As far as telemarketers, spam calls, and robocalls are concerned, the blocking app has a crowd-sourced database of numbers where it stores all the reported numbers and automatically blocks them so you won’t need to add them manually. In case any number slips through and reach your voicemail then you can leave a rating for it to make sure it can’t reach you again. </p>
<p> Moreover, the app receives frequent updates. This means someone is there to listen and you can either leave a review or directly reach the developer if something does not work. </p>
<p> I hope this app continues to help you in blocking unwanted calls and makes your life easier 🙂 </p>
<p> Another worthy consideration is Should I Answer? Not sure if they have it for Apple, but that’s what I’ve used for a while on Android. </p>
<p> Thanks a lot for your suggestion! We will give that app a try and add it to our list if we find it useful in any way. 🙂 </p>
<p> I need a blocker that would not only reject the unwanted calls, but also not notify me of them – because frankly, I don’t need the notification, I don’t want to know the call happened at all. I get mostly spoofed numbers, so replying on a database of known numbers isn’t going to help. I’m desperate enough to want to block all calls except contacts, but this will put a big cramp in my job search. </p>
<p> @KittyDelAmour:disqus seems like you are looking for an app with aggressive call blocking abilities. I will suggest you to try Call Blocker by NetQin available here (already mentioned above in #03). </p>
<p> It has a ‘custom blocking mode’ option that allows you to accept calls from your contacts and whitelist only. Rest of the calls will be automatically blocked. And you can even disable the block notifications. </p>
<p> I used Safest Call Blocker which worked GREAT but it messed up my ringtone – that went to silent and I had to do a factory reset. So I am on the lookout for a simple app that will block any call that is not in my contact list – automatically to VM. What would you suggest? </p>
<p> That shouldn’t have happened. Call Blockers are designed to block calls only and should never interfere with ringtone. Anyways, the #1 app on the list i.e. Call Blacklist by Vlad Lee should be your best bet. It has an option called “Block Unknown Numbers” that allows you to block all numbers except contacts. Moreover, all the blocked numbers should be automatically forwarded to VoiceMail. </p>
<p> Give it a try and let me know how it worked for you 🙂 </p>
<p> Why would anyone want spam calls going to voicemail? I don’t want the calls and don’t want them leaving messages that I have to delete. </p>
<p> if you are doing a project that involves contractors their subs will not be in your contact list, so better to go to voicemail. </p>
<p> I don’t want to block calls from unknown callers because it’s my business phone. But I want to be able to add calls to a blacklist or reject if I want to. Which is best for this? Or, do all allow a blacklist but let calls show up if you wish to connect? </p>
<p> Hi @TuckerdogNC:disqus, the majority of apps mentioned in this list have the exact same feature that you are looking for. Most will let you manually add numbers to the blacklist/calls reject list. Go for whichever app that suits your calls blocking style. If you want my suggestion then try “Calls Blacklist by Vlad Lee”. It is #1 on this list. 🙂 </p>
<p> Thanks for the review. I have tried the #3 pick and now am trying an app called nights keeper but both give me the same problems. When I am talking on my phone and a second call comes in that is not in my contacts, I am disconnected from the call I am in and the offending call is also blocked. The other issue I have is, when my phone is connected to my car stereo via Bluetooth and a blocked call comes in my music will temporarily stop until the blocking software hangs up on the call. I really want an app that will give me the Apple iOS do not disturb style, if the number is not in the contacts it never makes to the phone, it goes directly to voicemail. Any suggestions. Thanks </p>
<p> Hi @markgoodine:disqus, thanks for stopping by! The call blocker app mentioned in #3 is a great choice for blocking all the calls that are not in your contacts. And the issue you mentioned should not happen. I have used call blocker on my phone and in case I receive any unwanted call that needs to be blocked, the app automatically puts the current call on hold, blocks the offending call, and then resumes the call. </p>
<p> To avoid unwanted music interruptions when your phone is connected via Bluetooth, you need to disable the call block notifications in the app settings. </p>
<p> I’d like a call-blocker that allows to me block all calls not on my contact list, EXCEPT from a specific area code. I’ve already tried #1 and #3 on your list and I don’t see that feature. Any recommendations? </p>
<p> Hi @erinmcdade:disqus, I will recommend you to try “Blacklist Plus by Vlad Lee”. It’s #7 on the list above. It is a powerful calls blocker app for Android. The app allows you to create a custom Whitelist where you can add specific area code from where you want to receive calls. And then you can set the calls block mode to “All except whitelist”. </p>
<p> I hope this helps you out in accepting calls from certain areas only. Give it a try and let me know how it goes. 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi Mohammed. I need a call blocker with whitelist and also i want silent ring feauture when rejecting calls. Caller must hear endless calls. I want to see who called me in a seperate log. In my family time i used whitelist and at work time i check who called me. I want rejected calls just hear endless ring. Thank you:) </p>
<p> Hi, give a try to app #3 in the list above. The app name is “Call Blocker Free by NQ Mobile Security”. Once installed, go to Settings and there you will find “How to block calls” option. Tap on it and you will find 3 options to block calls: 1. Hang up, 2. Hang up and send a text, 3. Mute without hanging up. </p>
<p> You need to select the third option, which will silent the ring for all the blacklisted calls and the caller will continue to hear the ring. Moreover, you will also have a separate log for all the blocked calls. </p>
<p> If you have any other question then please feel free to ask. 🙂 </p>
<p> I used Call Control Call Blocker for years and absolutely loved it until 2017 when I discovered that half the features I enjoyed were now only available to this who ‘purchased’ the upgrade. So, I went looking and found ‘Shoyld I Answer which at least gets the basic. I do miss not even having to hear the ring of bad calls. That’s now under ‘premium’ in CCCB. I am like others-I don’t want to be bothered by the ring and I don’t want them in my answering center. How do you compare SIAP to your #1 pick, Calls Blacklist by Vlad Lee? Thanks for your great help! </p>
<p> Hello @ginhunt:disqus, I have already suggested a call blocker app to Kerem Aydin in the comments below. The app name is “Call Blocker Free by NQ Mobile Security”. It’s #3 in the list above. This is one of the best call blocker apps and provides a feature that will silent all the blocked calls while that blacklisted caller will continue to hear the ring. The best thing is it’s completely free. 😉 </p>
<p> I tried Should I Answer, but I lost the ability to add contacts to my contact list. </p>
<p> @speedlever:disqus I hope you are aware that Should I Answer is hard to configure for an Android user who is looking for a simple app to block unwanted calls. I will recommend you to try the app mentioned in #1 i.e. Calls Blacklist. If you need any further help then feel free to let us know. </p>
<p> Thanks. I already snagged Mr. Number and am trying that now. I found SIA rather intrusive as it always wanted feedback about a call and was confusing to use on my Android phone. </p>
<p> If Mr. Number doesn’t work out for me, I’ll try Calls Blacklist. I was hoping to find an app that worked on iOS as well as Android since I live in a mixed family. 3 iPhones and my lone Android. 😉 I knew that SIA has both Android and iOS apps, so was hoping that would work for me. </p>
<p> Good to hear that, buddy! I hope Mr. Number work for you. A few of our readers found Mr. Number easy to configure 🙂 </p>
<p> Remember, what works on iOS may not work well on Android as both operating systems are very much different from each other. </p>
<p> Understood. OTOH, we’ve had very good luck with Our Groceries which runs on both iOS and Android. So sometimes it works. </p>
<p> Give it a try after some time. It should work. </p>
<p> Our Groceries is a list type app and is from a completely different category that’s why it works on both. All it needs is a proper synchronization. Whereas, Call Blocking apps require some extra permissions as it is directly interfering with your phone’s calling functionality. </p>
<p> OK thanks! </p>
<p> I used Calls Blacklist for a while because I needed to blacklist the first 6 digits of my own phone number due to spoofing by scammers, while allowing my wife to still get through. It worked well for a while, then stopped blocking anything a few months ago. Trying one of the others now. </p>
<p> #05 – CALL BLOCKER Is full of ridiculous. People have wrote in the comments on the play store, no annoying ads, but that’s a lie </p>
<p> Thanks for sharing your review about the call blocker by AndroidRock. And if you are not happy with the app then you are free to try other Android call blocker apps we have mentioned in the list. </p>

<p> About Candy Crush Saga Mod APK </p>
<p> In case you don’t know, Candy Crush Saga is one of the most popular and widely played puzzle adventure game for Android phones and tablet devices with hundreds of levels. The puzzling nature of the game is what makes it addictive where you need to match three or more candies of the same color to earn points and gain additional bonus points when they burst. </p>
<p> When you match four or more candies of the same color then you will get a unique powerful candy. This special candy has the ability to pop a large number of candies. And you can even match two powerful candies, which will clear many candies and give you points boost. </p>
<p> But there a catch: </p>
<p> To clear the level, you must need to earn the required amount of points within given number of moves/switches. For example, in level 1 you need to make at least 300 points within 6 moves. You can make as many points as you can but 300 is the minimum you need to make to successfully clear the level. </p>
<p> That is not all. </p>

Booster includes Jelly Fish, Coconut Wheel, Color Bomb, Striped and Wrapped, Lucky Candy, 5 Extra Moves, Lollipop Hammer, Free Switch, Bomb Cooler, Sweet Teeth, and Extra Time. </p>
<p> As if that’s not enough: </p>
<p> To further make the game tougher, you get five lives during the beginning of the game. Losing a level will result in losing a life. And to earn back one free life you will need to wait 30 minutes. You can also purchase a pack of five lives or request your friend to send you one. </p>

<p> Time Limited: This game mode will give you limited time to clear the level, and you must need to earn at least one star before the timer runs out otherwise you will fail. </p>
<p> Candy Order: This mode is similar to that of ingredients but here you are required to collect a specific type of candies to win the level. </p>

<p> How to Change Spotify Username [Guide] </p>
<p> A step-by-step guide on how to change Spotify username on Android, iPhone, iPad, Windows, or Mac devices. We have shared </p>
<p> A step-by-step guide on how to change Spotify username on Android, iPhone, iPad, Windows, or Mac devices. We have shared four working methods that are very simple and easy to follow to help you add/change your randomly generated Spotify username. </p>
<p> Solution number three on our list is the best workaround to change your username… </p>
<p> For those of you who don’t know, Spotify is one of the best apps to listen to your favorite music as well as download the complete playlists for the offline listening experience. </p>
<p> What is Spotify Username? </p>
<p> The Spotify username is intended to be your unique identity on the music-streaming platform and is automatically assigned the moment you create your account due to security reasons. However, it is not required for you to remember that detail, and it does not even show up anywhere unless you have created a display name (more on this later). </p>
<p> Since the username is hardwired to your account and acts as an identity, so, unfortunately, there is no possible way to change your Spotify username in any case. </p>
<p> Moreover, you don’t even need to use your randomly generated username to login to your Spotify account. Simply use your email address and password, and you are good to go. </p>
<p> Psst… Do you know you can download Spotify Premium mod on your Android with all the premium features enabled including unlimited skips, audio and visual ads blocked, unlimited shuffle, and option to play any song? All of that for free available here. 😀 </p>
<p> Guide on How to Change Spotify Username on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac </p>
<p> Here we have a complete step-by-step guide on how you can change your Spotify username on all platforms including Android, iPhone, iPad, Windows, and Mac devices: </p>
<p> 1. Connect an Existing Spotify Account to Facebook </p>
<p> Spotify allows you to connect your existing account with your Facebook, which lets you log in using your Facebook credentials. And will hide your ugly Spotify username as well. </p>
<p> Not only that, once connected, but your Spotify account will also display your Facebook profile picture and name across Spotify. That will make it easier for your friends to find you on Spotify and vice versa. </p>
<p> Steps for Spotify App </p>
<p> Here’s how to connect your existing Spotify account to Facebook through the Spotify app: </p>
<p> Open the Spotify app on your phone/tablet device. </p>
<p> Tap on the “Home” button. </p>
<p> Tap on the gear icon located at the upper-right corner to go to “Settings.” </p>
<p> Scroll down and look for the “Social” option. Once found, tap it. </p>
<p> Here you should be able to find the “Connect to Facebook” button, tap it to begin the process. </p>
<p> The process may ask for your Facebook login details if opened on the browser. Else, you will be redirected to the Facebook app if that’s already installed on your device. </p>
<p> Steps for Desktop </p>
<p> Follow these steps to connect your Spotify to Facebook on the Spotify desktop app: </p>
<p> Launch the Spotify app on your computer. </p>
<p> Click the drop-down menu button located at the top-right corner (right next to your profile). </p>
<p> Click on “Settings.” </p>
<p> Scroll down and look for the “Social” section. There will be a sub-section for “Facebook.” </p>
<p> You will see a “Connect to Facebook” button. Click on it to start the process. </p>
<p> A popup window will open automatically where you will be asked to enter your Facebook login details. Once done, click on “Log In” and you are good to go. </p>
<p> 2. Add or Change Your Spotify Display Name </p>
<p> Spotify allows you to add or change your display name whenever you want, which also hides your randomly generated username and gives you a more personalized feeling. This change will be visible on your profile, playlists, and friend activity section. </p>
<p> Here’s how you can achieve this on devices running Android or iOS: </p>
<p> Open the Spotify app on your device. </p>
<p> Tap on the “Home” button. </p>
<p> Tap on the gear icon located at the upper-right corner to go to “Settings.” </p>
<p> Tap on your name or “View Profile” option. </p>
<p> You will see the “Edit Profile” button. Tapping on it will let you add or change your display name as well as your profile picture. </p>
<p> Once you are satisfied with the changes to your display name and profile photo, then tap on the “Save” button. That’s how simple it really is. </p>
<p> 3. Create a Brand New Spotify Account </p>
<p> Although it is a bit lengthy process creating a new Spotify account is one of the only working methods actually to change your Spotify username. </p>
<p> The process is lengthy because it requires you to contact the Spotify support team. After all, you have to set up a new account but using the exact same email address. Your account status, playlists, podcasts, saved music, and artists/people you are following, as well as every other detail will be copied to your new account from your existing account. </p>
<p> Yes, that does sound overwhelming; that’s why we have discussed more about the process below and how you can achieve it. </p>
<p> Close/delete your current account </p>
<p> Yes, this is the first step. And it would be best if you did this. </p>
<p> Here’s how: </p>
<p> If you are a Spotify Premium user, then you have first cancel your Premium plan subscription and switch to a Spotify Free. </p>
<p> Once done successfully, you have to contact Spotify customer support using this link to request them to close your account permanently. The link will take you to the contact form. </p>
<p> From the list of categories, you have to select “Account.” </p>
<p> Then from a list of topics, you have to select “I want to close my account.” </p>
<p> On the next page, select the “Close Account” option. </p>
<p> That will take you to another page where you can proceed to close your Spotify account. </p>
<p> Sign up for a new account </p>
<p> Now you have to sign up for a new Spotify account. But since we are using the same email address for this new account so you may need to contact the support staff. </p>
<p> Here’s what you have to do: </p>
<p> Using any web browser, open the Spotify homepage (similar to how you use the web player). </p>
<p> Click on the “Sign Up” button located at the top-right corner. </p>
<p> On the sign up page, fill in all the details. And make sure to enter the correct new username in the “What we should call you?” box. </p>
<p> Once done, click on the green “Sign Up” box. </p>
<p> You will receive an email notification about your new account. </p>
<p> You can now use the Spotify customer support page and ask the support staff to transfer all of your previous account details to your new account. And you must have to complete this task within the seven days of closing your old account. </p>
<p> 4. Sign Up for a New Spotify Account with Facebook </p>
<p> Alternatively, apart from following the solution number three above, you can sign up for a new Spotify account using Facebook, which will also help you to get a custom username for your account. </p>
<p> This is pretty simple, and here is what you have to do: </p>
<p> Using any web browser, open the Spotify homepage. </p>
<p> Click on the “Sign Up” button located at the top-right corner. </p>
<p> On the sign up page, click on “Sign Up with Facebook.” </p>
<p> Enter your Facebook account details to log in to your account and authorize Spotify to create a new account. </p>
<p> That is all you have to do. You should shortly receive an email in your inbox from Spotify regarding your new account. </p>

<p> You will not see any updates about contact’s profile picture. </p>
<p> Any message that you will send to the contacts by whom you are blocked will always show one check mark meaning message sent but will not show second check mark meaning message delivered. So your message will not be delivered. </p>
<p> Any calls that you will make to a person by which you are blocked will not go through. </p>
<p> Try adding the person to a group conversation, if you see a message saying “You are not authorized to add this contact” then it means that you are blocked by the contact. </p>

<p> Best Clash Royale Decks Ever for Arena 1 to 13 </p>
<p> Are you trying to jump into the Clash Royale higher ladders or maybe do you want to win the Clash </p>
<p> Are you trying to jump into the Clash Royale higher ladders or maybe do you want to win the Clash Royale tournaments, but you are unable to win all the crowns? Don’t worry, as you have come to the right place. Here I have compiled a list of some of the strongest and the best Clash Royale decks along with the working strategies for all the arenas starting from Arena 1 to 13 and above to help you win all those trophies and move to the higher arena. </p>
<p> Clash Royale has become one of the most popular real-time strategy based games by Supercell after the widely popular game known as Clash of Clans, where you are required to build your village, create a powerful clan using several dozen characters and troops, and compete in Clan Wars. Similarly, Clash Royale offers you real-time multiplayer strategy game featuring all of your favorite Clash of Clans characters, Royales, spells, defenses, and a lot more. </p>
<p> The theme of Clash Royale is a bit different from that of Clash of Clans as in this game you have cards for each character, royales, and spells. You have to prepare your own personalized deck of eight cards and then during the battle, out of eight, only four cards will be randomly served at any given time. You have to strategically use those to knock the enemy King and Princess from their towers in order to defeat the opponent and win crowns, trophies, and move forward in the Arena. </p>
<p> Just like how the Clan used to work in the Clash of Clans, it works similarly in the Clash Royale. But here you have to build your own community, form a clan, and donate or share cards with the other clan members to earn XP (experience points) and progress through the game. </p>
<p> That is not all. There is a lot more to do and achieve within the game, but here in this blog post, we are more focused on the Clash Royale Decks as well as which decks are best for the different Clash Royale arenas to help you win all those battles and move further into the higher arenas. </p>
<p> The best Clash Royale decks we have shared below are suitable and valid for all arena levels starting from arena 1 to arena 13 and further. I have even mentioned the average elixir cost so that you can better strategize your moves and figure out how long you will have to wait until you can play your next card. </p>
<p> Best Decks for Clash Royale </p>
<p> Some of the Best Decks for Arena 1, 2, and 3 </p>
<p> Since arena 1, arena 2 and arena 3 are some of the most initial arenas in the Clash Royale game and one can easily reach the 3rd arena within a few days of playing the game. So I decided to combine all three of them into one place. Furthermore, all the cards shown in this section can be easily unlocked and collected during the initial playtime. </p>

<p> 7 Best Custom Gaming ROMs For Finest Gaming Experience </p>
<p> Are you a mobile gamer and looking for custom gaming ROMs for Android that let you overclock your Android mobile </p>
<p> Are you a mobile gamer and looking for custom gaming ROMs for Android that let you overclock your Android mobile phone and tablet device for the finest gaming performance? Well, your search is finally over as here we have reviewed some of the best custom Android gaming ROMs along with the compatible kernel. </p>
<p> When we focus on aspects such as performance or hardware enhancements like sound and speed then things become less related to actual ROM and more so towards the kernel. While keeping that in our mind, we are giving our recommendation based on the kernel, because in ROMs we very rarely come across features that are baked into the ROM and actually benefit gaming. With that being said there is a good proportion of aspects in the ROM that we are going to consider while recommending. </p>
<p> Before we start with a list of ROMs let’s talk about kernels a bit, as already explained, it is a crucial part of decision-making and planning for the ROM you want to flash on your device. </p>
<p> ROM and Kernel: What are those? </p>
<p> Now kicking off with the technical aspects, how kernel improves sound and performance in a ROM is easy to understand. As pointed out previously, the kernel has all the necessary information on how the OS will behave or control the ROM in certain conditions. </p>
<p> The fine-tunings in the variables help achieve better performance in a way one thing is prioritized over others to have a more focused feature set which results in a better experience for the user. The tradeoffs can be the battery, safety, or overall stability of your Android device. </p>
<p> Kernel: KangarooX OC – ROM: OnePlus OxygenOS </p>
<p> When it comes to gaming you don’t need the latest version of ROM, what you need is whatever works. There are some stable versions of OnePlus ROM that comes with KangarooX OC (overclocked) option, which can be extremely helpful in tweaking and customizing your phone. </p>
<p> There is also a gaming mode, which is enabled automatically whenever you launch any game. Not only that, the game booster tries to clear out the entire occupied RAM to prevent graphical choppiness due to background running apps. </p>
<p> Furthermore, heads-up notifications are disabled to make sure that you are not disturbed with a message or call notification while you are in the middle of the game. The gaming mode also enables you to customize it’s settings on a per-app basis so you can completely silent your phone when playing specific games. </p>
<p> Thanks to the KangarooX kernel, the overall sound output is also enhanced and focused towards bass so if you like to connect your phone to a sound system while playing games then this makes the ROM ideal for gaming. </p>
<p> The ROM may have bugs and updates may be very slow to roll out or no update may come </p>
<p> The ROM has a gaming mode and support for joystick and mic mods out of the box. </p>
<p> Kernel: IceCold – ROM: EVOLUTION-X </p>
<p> Similar to the OnePlus Oxygen OS, Evolution is another ROM that comes equipped with the gaming mode. However, the gaming mode is pretty basic as compared to the OnePlus ROM, in fact, the gaming mode in one plus ROM is difficult to compare with other ROMs since it’s more mature than the community-based offering. </p>
<p> The main highlight of Evolution X ROM is not gaming mode but the IceCold kernel, which is so good that it competes for the neck to neck competition with KangarooX OC. There are some differences in IceCold such as the sound is tuned to have more depth, which is more preferable for folks who use a headset. It also has overclocking support that let you set your desired custom profiles. </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> Lots of customizability </p>
<p> Custom profile can be difficult for a new user. </p>
<p> The updates to ROM may have a slower release cycle </p>
<p> Tuned Audio </p>
<p> Overclocking and Undervoltage option </p>
<p> Kernel: PureCAF – ROM: Pixel Experience </p>
<p> The Pixel Experience Android custom ROM is great for gaming on smartphone and has been praised for stability and solid performance. One of the reasons for its appraisal is its strong PureCAF kernel, which is not only for Redmi Note 5 Pro but also for any device. It promises the best performance but sacrifices on most recent patches. </p>
<p> If you just want a custom Android gaming ROM that works perfectly fine and you don’t want to be bothered with extra features then this is truly an out of box performer that will work great without any tweaking or customization. </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> Very Lean </p>
<p> Lacks features as compared to other ROMs </p>
<p> CAF may take longer than the AOSP to get to the latest update. </p>
<p> Not much tweaking options </p>
<p> Kernel: Illusion – ROM: Havoc OS </p>
<p> Havoc OS is a feature ROM with decent features for Android gamers who are looking for a performance OS that maximizes the power of their smartphone. This ROM has a gaming mode that is more aggressive alongside an aggressive battery saving mode, which is specifically designed to help the user conserve battery when it has been depleted after a great gaming session. </p>
<p> Havoc OS is more than decent that comes bundled with a custom Illusion kernel, it will give you granularity to modify a lot of things, however, it doesn’t compete with IceCold or KangarooX as it lacks the most important feature i.e. overclocking. </p>
<p> For those of you who don’t know, Illusion kernel was previously known as Derp kernel but the developer behind it i.e. Akhil Narang rebased and rebranded it to Illusion kernel on July 21, giving it a completely new name and life. </p>
<p> Believe it or not, Derp kernel is the Android development community’s favorite choice for baking it into their custom ROMs, primarily because of its unmatched stability and supreme scalability. It offers a lot of powerful features, but at the same time, it can still remain pretty stable. </p>
<p> Although Derp kernel, which is now known as Illusion kernel, is found in so many custom gaming ROMs, it always is adequately modified and adjusted by the developers according to the target Android device because it is very easy to discern, despite it being the same kernel in all the cases. </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> Very Stable and consistent performance </p>
<p> Lacks Overclocking </p>
<p> Kernel: InsigniuX – ROM: Masik X </p>
<p> Masik X is a custom Android ROM for gaming that is essentially MIUI based ROM but it provides its user with the possibilities to remove many bloated services and apps while keeping all the essential features you need. Despite being heavily modified, it doesn’t put the user under the restrictions of being a rooted user. </p>
<p> MIUI is one of the few ROMs that similar to the OnePlus ROM has decent gaming mode and configuration possibilities. That is not all as the kernel it uses is InsigniuX that has joystick support, vibration control, and microphone gain control. In spite of all these eye-catchy features, it lacks overclocking. If you are not looking to overclock your device then this ROM and kernel combination is really good. </p>
<p> Pros </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> Joystick Support and mods to improve mic </p>
<p> ARB is not disabled on this ROM which can lead to hard bricks </p>
<p> The ROM has gaming mode </p>
<p> No Overclocking </p>
<p> The updates maybe limited as compared to other AOSP ROMs as it’s a MIUI based ROM. </p>
<p> Kernel: LOS (LineageOS) – ROM: CandyROMS </p>
<p> Candy ROMS has its own modified version of LOS (LineageOS) kernel which has few features that are must-have in custom gaming ROMs. Like other gaming ROMs, it also opens the possibility of higher settings in different games so you can improve the visuals and overall performance of the game if you care less about the smoothness of the ROM. </p>
<p> Candy ROM is perhaps the only ROM that is based on LOS, so if you are a fan of Lineage OS then it’s the go-to option for you because it is fully customizable. </p>
<p> Pros </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> Always up to date since its based-on Lineage Kernel </p>
<p> No Overclocking </p>
<p> Compatible with most mods </p>
<p> The kernel follows a lean approach, therefore, lacks the customizability </p>
<p> Removes the constraints of a mid-range device and unlocks all settings in games for the user </p>
<p> ROM: ViperOS </p>
<p> ViperOS is one of the most stable custom Android ROMs for gaming that you can rely upon without sacrificing constant OS updates and security patches. That’s because most custom gaming ROMs are left behind in the updates department. </p>
<p> However, ViperOS despite being a stability-focused ROM, it is fairly up-to-date, not only in the ROM sources but also its kernel sources are kept up to date so that latest features are not being missed out and the performance is also snappy while taking caring of the security patches. </p>
<p> The ROM though doesn’t have advanced gaming features like a gaming mode or overclocking but due to its stability, it is a trustworthy ROM. It can easily cope up with most of your gaming requirements and day-to-day tasks. </p>
<p> Pros </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> Most up to date Kernel and ROM that is based on AOSP </p>
<p> No Overclocking </p>
<p> Stable performance </p>
<p> No gaming mode in the ROM </p>
<p> The lack of customization is not on just kernel but the ROM is also pretty basic </p>
<p> ROM: Liquid Remix </p>
<p> If ViperOS is too much minimalistic in features for you then you can go ahead and give a try to the Liquid Remix OS that also focuses on lag-free smooth user experience. So the performance is spot-on here. However, once again, the gaming-specific features are missing in this ROM but it is rock solid and mostly up to date so you can consider it for Android gaming purposes. </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> Greater support for mods and tweaks </p>
<p> No Overclocking </p>
<p> No much mods out of the box and no out of the world customization for the Kernel </p>
<p> The ROM is great to be used as an all-rounder due to its many customization options on the ROM level </p>
<p> How To Tweak The Kernel For Gaming? </p>
<p> The benefit of using an off the shelf custom kernel is that you can tweak them as you like and you can experiment with different profiles and the clock speed of GPU and CPU, depending on what your kernel and device hardware allow. Having a custom kernel alongside a custom ROM is very advantageous since our intention is to run resource-hungry games on our Android phone. </p>
<p> Kernel profiles are a description of how the processor will clock itself based on the workload, a basic example is that you can set your idling clock to too low, this will save you a lot of juice but the responsiveness of your phone will suffer. If you set it to maximum, your phone is likely to thermal throttle or run out of battery really soon. </p>
<p> There are also settings related to configuring your RAM management and caching of internal storage, which can improve your multitasking or foreground responsiveness depending on what you are looking for. You can also overclock and under-volt your processor depending on what you want to achieve, a lower volt will save you battery but will tax the CPU thermally, when it is clocked higher, so much that it can thermal throttle really bad. </p>
<p> The amount of audio processing employed also affects performance, more processing means more tuned sound and more CPU power needed. So keep that in mind when you are tuning either for the footsteps in the FPS or bangs and effects of MOBA or MMORPG. </p>
<p> You don’t necessarily need to edit files to get changes in your kernel settings because there are many apps that can help you tune the kernel for specific gaming. You can use apps like Kernel Editor or Smart Pack Kernel Manager. </p>
<p> Precautions For Custom Kernel </p>
<p> While a lot has been already explained about the ROMs, which will surely help you decide what best meets your needs. Before we move onto installing the gaming ROM and kernel on your Android device, let’s first begin with a word of caution. </p>
<p> Installing a custom kernel can often cause such issues, which are, in some cases, irreversible and cause performance instability. For instance, a mere kernel restoration, which in theory should work fine, often fails, which is a huge reason why developers don’t support custom kernels when working with custom ROM. </p>
<p> Moreover, a bad kernel configuration by a user who doesn’t understand much about the kernel and its complications also becomes a pain for the developer to debug. </p>
<p> In practice, if something breaks due to a custom kernel, the way to restore the kernel is by trying to restore the backup of the previously installed kernel. If that fails, then it is recommended to give the ROM a fresh install. If the problems persist, then the ultimate way to restore your device is to flash the stock ROM, which restores the stock kernel with stock settings. </p>
<p> How To Install Custom ROM with Custom Kernel on Android </p>
<p> Installing a custom gaming kernel is minutely different than installing a custom gaming ROM. In fact, the major part is similar to installing a custom ROM, which requires unlocking the bootloader, rooting the phone, and installing the custom recovery. </p>
<p> Installing Custom Gaming ROM on Android </p>
<p> Let’s begin with the installation/flashing of custom gaming ROM on Android. The steps are as follows: </p>
<p> NOTE: This is a summarized version of flashing ROM on Android. Every custom ROM comes with the installation and flashing guide, and we will recommend you to follow that. </p>
<p> Boot into recovery (via ADB or key combination). </p>
<p> Wipe System, Cache, and Dalvik Cache partition. </p>
<p> Go to Install, locate the ROM file, and then add the GApps (if ROM requires it). </p>
<p> Once the ROM has been flashed, then you have to Wipe Cache and Dalvik Cache partition. </p>
<p> Reboot and wait a fair amount of time to let the phone boot up. </p>
<p> Once you are done installing the custom ROM. You may then proceed to install the custom Kernel on your Android device. However, it is important to note that after installing the custom ROM on your phone, you need to let it boot and get past the initial setup phase, and then you can flash the custom kernel. </p>
<p> Installing Custom Gaming Kernel on Android </p>
<p> Flashing or installation custom gaming kernel on Android is simple too. You must need to have all the required files ready with you and then follow these steps: </p>
<p> NOTE: This is a summarized version of the flashing kernel on Android. Every custom kernel comes with its installation guide, and we will recommend you follow that for proper and error-free installation. </p>
<p> On your Android device, boot into Recovery using either key combinations or via the restart menu. </p>
<p> Create a full backup of your current kernel. </p>
<p> Select the Kernel file and flash it. </p>
<p> Wipe the Cache and Dalvik Cache (after the flashing process has been completed). </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> If you have performed the above steps correctly, then now you should have a custom kernel installed on your Android device. You can now go ahead and configure it as per your liking. But make sure not to fiddle with advanced settings as it may cause performance issues and bugs. </p>

<p> We have reviewed the 12 best custom ROMs that are specifically designed for Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro and fully compatible with the said device. </p>
<p> What are custom ROMs and what are the different techniques that are used to develop and modify ROMs for Android. </p>
<p> We have shared a summarized guide on how to flash custom ROM on your Redmi Note 5 Pro and what are the resources you must need to have first. </p>
<p> We have shared our views about the custom kernel and how it is beneficial to have a custom kernel on your device as opposed to the stock kernel. </p>
<p> Having Redmi Note 5 Pro is great since it has been well adopted by the flashaholic (People who flash custom ROM on their Android device very often) community, which means you can get rid of the stock firmware, whether you like it or hate it. </p>
<p> Believe it or not, there can be plenty of reasons why a person can be fed up with the stock firmware and start looking for a custom Android OS. A few of them being aesthetic choices that the OEM has opted or optimization techniques they have employed or plain bugs that went unnoticed by them (OEMs) and they didn’t care to provide any fixes. </p>
<p> Whatever your motives behind switching to custom ROM are, be it performance, debloated OS, stability, or better battery life, it is difficult to have everything in one piece of software. Hence there are tons of options to choose from. </p>
<p> Here are our recommendations based on the different needs of the users of Note 5 Pro. It is important to note here that most of these custom ROMs for Redmi Note 5 Pro are available on XDA for free. </p>
<p> Before we go into the details of each ROM and their features, we believe that it is important to share with you some basic requirements that must need to be met to proceed with installing custom ROMs: </p>
<p> You need an unlocked bootloader. </p>
<p> Latest update of the MIUI firmware. </p>
<p> The latest version of TWRP recovery. </p>
<p> NOTE: We will explain how to implement the above three steps at the end of this article. </p>
<p> Best Custom ROMs for Redmi Note 5 Pro </p>
<p> Here we are going to share with you some of the best custom ROMs for Redmi Note 5 Pro. Most of these ROMs are highly popular among Android phone users, and each of them provides great support and updates so that your device keeps running without any issue. </p>
<p> Lineage OS 16 </p>
<p> Lineage OS is the biggest name in the world of custom ROMs, mainly because this is where everything started. Due to carrying the name of Cyanogen mod, the ROM is very lightweight in terms of available features. The Lineage OS has some standards that must need to be followed to keep the custom ROM to a bare minimum while allowing it to act as a base ROM source for many other custom ROMs. </p>
<p> Lineage OS has an array of features that makes it unique from its competition. The custom ROM provides: </p>
<p> ‘LiveDisplay’ that let you change the color temperature to your liking (warmer looks eye-pleasing though bit straining in comparison to colder temperature). </p>
<p> Preinstalled Apps like AudioEQ, Gallery App, Audio Recorder, Screen Recorder, are one of those apps that you don’t get with your regular Gapps package. </p>
<p> PrivacyGuard: Manage all apps permissions from a single interface. </p>
<p> Trust: Gives information regarding the security of the device. </p>
<p> Caffeine Quick Tile: Toggle button to turn off screen timeout feature. </p>
<p> NavBar Customization: Allows complete hiding or changing the placement of the buttons. </p>
<p> At the time of writing this, Lineage OS ROM is ready to be used as a daily driver on the majority of supported devices; however, it does have few known bugs. Some of them can be removed by using fixes mentioned in the XDA thread of Redmi Note 5 Pro. </p>
<p> Since the ROM has few bugs, which is the reason why it hasn’t gotten official status yet. However, the ROM is not far from achieving the official status, so you should give it a go. </p>
<p> Oxygen OS Port </p>
<p> Oxygen OS is one of the most appreciated Android skins that has also been ported to Redmi Note 5 Pro. Unfortunately, at the time of reviewing, it has a lot of bugs that it is barely a daily driver, but if you want to have the taste of Oxygen OS, then this is a must-have custom ROM. </p>
<p> The OxygenOS is a definite highlight of the OnePlus experience, it includes: </p>
<p> One Plus Ecosystem: One Plus Ringtones, System Animations, Icons, Sounds, Wallpapers, and the Launcher. </p>
<p> Gestures: You can disable the Navigation button and use gestures to navigate the UI. </p>
<p> Gaming/Fanatic Mode: This disables heads up notification and any kind of interruptions that can ruin the gaming experience and lets your foreground application to be prioritized in terms of a resource for best performance. </p>
<p> Accent Changer and Dark Mode: If you are bored from the default colors of the system UI, you have the option to change to less eye-straining dark mode and also the accent colors. </p>
<p> Parallel App: Allows you to login with two different accounts on any app. </p>
<p> App Locker: Out of the box app locking to add an extra layer of authentication to your apps. </p>
<p> Before you try Oxygen OS on your Note 5 Pro, we will recommend you to read the official thread carefully as it may require a downgrade for the MIUI firmware. It also doesn’t support encryption. </p>
<p> Highlights of Oxygen OS </p>
<p> /e/ OS </p>
<p> A not new but rather unconventional and rare offering by the /e/ OS non-Google Android smartphone. /e/ OS is based on the project microG which enables a lot of Google dependent features on the Android phone but it is completely Open Source. </p>
<p> The upcoming batch of custom ROMs for Redmi Note 5 Pro is mostly highly customizable ROMs they mostly include the features such as: </p>
<p> Privacy Score: It provides a score for each application in the installer and also reveals all the trackers in each app. </p>
<p> Ungoogling: Google’s default search engine removed, google services replaced by microG and Geolocation is using Mozilla Location Services. </p>
<p> Uninstall Pre-installed apps: This feature when implemented will let the user uninstall the pre-installed apps from their devices. </p>
<p> UnParalleled privacy: /e/ OS doesn’t scan its user’s data on the phone or in the cloud, doesn’t track GPS location and doesn’t collect any sort of app information about the user. </p>
<p> If you are concerned with its privacy, then you should give /e/ OS a try. It works with most Android apps without requiring GApps. </p>
<p> Highlights of /e/ OS </p>
<p> Privacy Centered. </p>
<p> Runs on Open Source components. </p>
<p> ROM lacks rich features available in normal Android OS. </p>
<p> Pixel Experience </p>
<p> Pixel Experience ROM lets you have the taste of having an Android One or Google Pixel device without the need to owning one. The ROM has strict rules to have only apps and features that are found in Google Pixel devices, so you are sure that even the first boot resembles the Pixel startup, without even flashing GApps. </p>
<p> As mentioned the ‘Pixel Experience’ as from its name offers what a Pixel or Google phone might have to offer in terms of the software The ROM may be unable to feature like squeeze for ‘Google Assistant’ trigger being hardware dependent. Pixel Exclusive Camera Features are also hardware dependent so their usability and availability depend on what phone you are using what you do get out of the box. </p>
<p> One of the highlights of the Pixel Experience ROM is the Pixel Ecosystem which includes Google fonts, ringtones, system animations, sounds, wallpapers. Here is a complete list of features: </p>
<p> Button Customization: Navbar keys can be inverted, Torch on power menu can be enabled and power menu can be disabled or enabled on the lock screen. </p>
<p> Full-screen display: Provides a feature that forces full screen of applications while also ignoring the notch area, which is useful for movies and games. </p>
<p> Lockscreen toggle: A toggle on the screen to display cover art or magazines when the phone is locked. </p>

<p> The Pixel Experience custom ROM can be used as a daily driver. However, at the time of writing this review, the development thread has reported a weird bug, which causes the device to restart when reaching the battery level below ten percent. Since we are talking about battery here, so it is important to tell that this ROM mostly provides a very stable battery life. </p>
<p> Highlights of Pixel Experience </p>
<p> ROM is as clean as Android One. </p>
<p> No need to flash GApps. </p>
<p> The UI is as close to the Pixel device as a non-Pixel device can get. </p>
<p> Samsung Experience 9.5 Port </p>
<p> Are you missing the Samsung Experience UI after switching to Xiaomi? Well, you can get it on your Redmi Note 5 Pro with the Samsung Experience 9.5 port. There is a tradeoff for it, though. You will miss out on the Android Pie. </p>
<p> There aren’t any particular issues with the ROM; there are just some usual incompatibility concerns of a different platform. Also, some Samsung specific features might crash because of course, you are running it on a non-Samsung device. </p>
<p> That being said, it doesn’t mean the Samsung Experience custom ROM can’t be used as a daily driver; however, you need to follow the update path. And another issue is that the ROM has been abandoned, meaning that there won’t be any more bug fixes or updates to it. Yet the ROM is a good option if you are bored from similar-looking ROMs. </p>
<p> Keyboard Layout: Tap and hold icons to drag them to a new position to customize the keyboard layouts for emojis, stickers, settings. </p>
<p> Finder: Integrated search for contacts, messages, and files, initiated by a swipe down gesture on the home screen. </p>

<p> Color Lens: To prevent eye strain Samsung’s color lens gives the option to change the color of the screen like to Green, Rose, Magenta and also choosing the amount of opacity for the color. </p>
<p> Highlights of Samsung Experience 9.5 Port </p>
<p> It allows you to experience Samsung Experience 9.5 on Redmi. </p>
<p> ROM is dead, as it no longer receives updates and bug fixes. </p>
<p> Havoc OS </p>
<p> If you cherish the Pixel Experience (PE) custom ROM but also want some more features in it, then Havoc OS is the answer. This custom ROM for Redmi Note 5 Pro has been built on AOSP, and it tries to have the majority of the features available on GitHub from other source trees. </p>
<p> The Havoc OS ROM is free of bugs, but the update cycle is slower than other ROMs like Lineage OS. It is highly recommended due to the aesthetic mods it has besides the stability and features. It also has a theme manager which dynamically changes the accent color based on your wallpaper or you can set it according to your will it also has a font manager and substratum theme engine which makes the possibility of customization endless. Here is a complete list of feature that Havoc OS supports: </p>
<p> Sensor block per-package: Unlike traditional battery-saving applications, this feature certain sensors for certain apps, ultimately saving battery life. </p>
<p> Smart pixel: You can select the percentage of pixels to turn off on the screen to save battery life. </p>
<p> Configuration Center: Ultimate customizability for every feature from gestures, miscellaneous, animations, ambient display to even system settings. </p>
<p> Burn-in protection: Background which saves the screen from any discoloration across any part of the screen. </p>
<p> Highlights of Havoc OS </p>
<p> AOSP Extended </p>
<p> AOSP Extended custom ROM for Redmi Note 5 Pro is very much similar to the Resurrection Remix OS. It tries to have as many features as possible under one roof. There is one major difference, which is that both have different OS bases. The Resurrection Remix runs on Lineage OS as a base while AOSP Extended, as the name suggests, is based on the AOSP. </p>
<p> Although Resurrection Remix is a very old player in the custom ROM category, it is not available for Redmi Note 5 Pro on Android Pie (The version currently available is very old, and ROM is dead because it no longer receives further updates), but you can have every possible feature on your device using AOSP Extended. </p>
<p> Some of the notable features of custom ROMs for Redmi Note 5 Pro are extensive UI customization through rootless substratum support and Dirty Unicorn’s Font engine plus it also has adaptive AOSP icons and AEX wallpapers out of the box. It also offers One-Handed UI which helps in reducing the size of the usable display to make areas of it easily reachable with a single hand. </p>
<p> Here is a complete list of feature for a better comparison and understanding: </p>
<p> Fling: An alternate to navigation buttons, enables swipe gestures that perform the same function of navigating to the home screen or recent menu. </p>
<p> SmartBar: Not only allows adding custom button images and icons to existing buttons in the navigation bar but also allows choosing custom actions like single tap, long-presses for those buttons. </p>
<p> Advanced Reboot Quick Tile: Quick setting to reboot on tap or enter recovery mood on long-press instead of holding the power button. </p>
<p> Recent panel 3 types: For quick access to recent apps, there is also a grid for showing details of recent apps. Finally, the multitasking feature allows splitting the screen into half for recents so you do not lose the current foreground application. </p>
<p> Highlights of AOSP Extended </p>
<p> Very feature-rich custom ROM. </p>
<p> ROM is in active development, and new features are added very frequently. </p>
<p> Viper OS </p>
<p> Viper OS has been around for quite a while now, and this custom ROM for Android aims to bring stability and a nice set of features to Android devices like Redmi Note 5 Pro without bloating it with too many features. </p>
<p> The developers behind Viper OS custom ROM make sure that the features are tested thoroughly. They have even removed a lot of unnecessary stuff from Lineage OS, which they consider bloatware and might affect the overall stability of the ROM. </p>
<p> Despite being based on Lineage OS, it is a lot cleaner than the Lineage itself, yet it brings useful features to the table. The custom ROM doesn’t have any out of the box support for the substratum theme engine but has a color engine and Quick settings themes finally it also has a font manager. Here is a complete list of features for better understanding: </p>
<p> Quick toggles: Quick turning on and off of VPN or Data saver or heads-up notifications. </p>
<p> SELinux: This feature dictates the device that processes have access to which file/paths on your device. </p>
<p> Color engine: Allows you to change colors of device theme, of an accent color, of QS tile and of the lock screen. </p>
<p> Feed: Swipe right on the home screen to go to google’s newsfeed. </p>
<p> Since Viper ROM focuses heavily on the device and OS stability, therefore, it sacrifices features. But this makes it daily driver ready because bugs are almost nonexistent. Though there is one known feature that isn’t working, which is a wireless display. </p>
<p> Highlights of Viper OS </p>
<p> Liquid Remix </p>
<p> Liquid Remix custom ROM came to the ground from the developers of the liquid-smooth. Now it not only focuses on the responsiveness but also tries to have a good blend of features from other custom ROMs as well. </p>
<p> Liquid Remix is the most stable ROM on the Redmi Note 5 Pro platform. It includes most of the custom ROM features, yet it is almost bug-free. The ROM is based on Lineage OS but is reported to be very good in terms of responsiveness and stability. Here is a complete list of features for a better understanding of the Liquid Remix’s abilities: </p>
<p> Liquid Lounge: A new panel just to customize the ambient, navbar and settings by adding new icons and gestures to the phone. </p>
<p> Now Playing: Built-in feature to identify the songs playing near you and automatically displaying its information on the lock screen. </p>
<p> PiP quick tile: Allows quick access to picture-in-picture (PIP) mode when you want to open something while a video is being played in the background. </p>
<p> Screen pinning: Allows the phone to show only a specific app screen meaning all other functions of the screen are locked. </p>
<p> Developers have fixed most of the bugs, and they are releasing frequent updates for the ROM that includes monthly security patches and fixes. If you are looking for a completely stable custom ROM experience and want to use it as a daily driver, then Liquid Remix is highly recommended given the fact it has most of the bugs sorted out. </p>
<p> Highlights of Liquid Remix </p>
<p> Based on the Lineage OS. </p>
<p> Almost bug-free. </p>
<p> Lots of customization options. </p>
<p> It receives monthly security patches and bug fixes. </p>
<p> Syberia OS </p>
<p> Syberia OS is one of the most Xiaomi centered custom ROM. It started as a project Siberia for the Mi5. The ROM has been built from the ground using the AOSP sources and kernel patches from CAF forums. Although CAF patches are dead now, it is still pretty capable ROM given that the battery life on this ROM is on par with other custom ROMs for Redmi Note 5 Pro. </p>
<p> The ROM constantly adds performance patches from other SOCs to maintain the performance and battery life on the ROM. Syberia OS custom ROM doesn’t have tons of features, but it can easily be recommended as a daily driver for Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro. Here is a complete list of Syberia OS features: </p>

<p> Highlights of Syberia OS </p>
<p> Very good performance. </p>
<p> Nonexistent bugs. </p>
<p> Evolution OS </p>
<p> Have you ever wished that there were more custom ROM similar to Pixel Experience with more features? Well, Evolution OS brings just that. This custom Android ROM has a great battery life due to its being based on the Google Pixel ROM. </p>
<p> The ROM does not even require you to have GApps on your device, and it comes with all the Pixel related features right from the very first boot. Talking about the boot, the first boot on this ROM is a pleasant surprise of minimalism yet capable features. </p>

<p> What Are Custom ROMs For Android </p>
<p> Custom ROMs for Redmi Note 5 Pro are non-OEM based ROM usually made by the users and developers. Since Android is an open-source program, manufacture modify Android’s source code in an attempt to improve the user experience. </p>
<p> There is a possibility when OEMs add features in the Android, some of them are unnecessary and frustrating to use. This is where custom ROMs come in; people take the source code and modify them according to their needs. Custom ROMs are made by groups of people since a lot of maintenance needs to be done to provide a complete bug-free ROM with continuous updates. </p>
<p> For those of you who don’t know, there are three levels of changes that modified and custom ROMs can have: </p>
<p> Custom ROM Modification Level One </p>
<p> All those changes are made on the base level of the ROM, which means the majority of the code of the Android operating system has been modified. </p>
<p> Level 1 changes are extremely difficult, and only a single code base has been there for a fairly long time. Mostly get dropped due to the limited use they have. The changes and modifications made by OEMs are somewhere between level 1 and level 2. </p>
<p> Custom ROM Modification Level Two </p>
<p> These changes only add or subtract features from the existing Android code base, meaning there is rarely any modification to the Android codebase. </p>
<p> The surplus of custom ROMs is a result of level 2 and 3 changes. They are mostly very similar; the changes are subtle and yet noticeable enough to make people jump from one ROM to another. </p>
<p> Custom ROM Modification Level Three </p>
<p> Level 3 changes are the changes that are tweaks or results of the different compilation. Basically, small tweaking of values and bundling is level 3 changes. </p>
<p> This type of custom ROM includes changes in different Kernel and the apps that come bundled with the ROM. While it may seem insignificant, the fact that it involves tweaking in values of the kernel can have impressive improvements. </p>
<p> That being said, stock ROMs like MIUI, Samsung One UI, Huawei EMUI, OnePlus Oxygen OS are all results of multi-level modifications. </p>
<p> Another thing that needs to be highlighted here are CAF ROMs. These types of custom ROMs have level 1 and 3 changes that are specifically hardware-centric. Apart from the addition of new features, these modifications are specifically targeted towards hardware and made to improve performance drastically. </p>
<p> How To Install Custom ROM on Redmi Note 5 Pro </p>
<p> Installation of any custom ROM follows pretty much similar steps, although there is a generalization that can be made about the process of installing custom ROMs on your Redmi Note 5 Pro. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, it is highly encouraged that one should follow the instruction provided within the thread of the firmware to avoid any unwanted bugs or boot loops after flashing the ROM. </p>
<p> So first, before we begin with anything, it is important to have an unlocked bootloader. </p>
<p> Unlocking Bootloader on Redmi Note 5 Pro </p>
<p> Usually, unlocking bootloader is fairly simple on the majority of Android devices, but on Xiaomi devices, it has been made rather complicated as compared to others. </p>
<p> For unlocking bootloader, you will need Google platform tools and an active internet connection. And you need to remember that all of your data will be wiped in the process, so it is important that you create a backup of your data before proceeding. </p>
<p> Here are the steps to unlock Redmi Note 5 Pro bootloader: </p>
<p> Go to https://en.miui.com/unlock/ sign in with your Mi account and apply for unlocking.NOTE: You will also need to enter the reason for unlocking the bootloader on the application. Once the application review period has been completed, and you have received the SMS about bootloader unlock, you can proceed to the next step. </p>
<p> Download the Mi Flash Unlock tool on your computer from the download section. You can access the download section using the unlock link given above. </p>
<p> Enable USB debugging on your Redmi Note 5 and enable OEM unlocking. You can enable these settings from Developer Options. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Additional Settings > then Navigate to Mi Unlock Status. </p>
<p> Add your Mi account and device (the account where you requested unlock permissions). </p>
<p> Launch the Mi Flash Unlock Tool on your computer. </p>
<p> Sign in with your Mi account. </p>
<p> Now open the Command Prompt in the directory of the extracted platform tools. </p>
<p> Under Command Prompt window, type the command: ADB reboot bootloader. </p>
<p> Once your phone is booted into fastboot (bootloader mode), click the unlock button. </p>
<p> Once done, now you have to wait for the time that is being displayed on the Mi Flash Unlock Tool. When this time is over, your bootloader should be unlocked. </p>
<p> Now, the next phase is to flash TWRP or CWM recovery on your phone (depends on the custom ROM you are planning to flash). </p>
<p> Flashing/Installing Custom Recovery Redmi Note 5 Pro </p>
<p> Installing a custom recovery on Redmi Note 5 Pro is fairly easy. You need to make use of ADB fastboot and need an unlocked bootloader (which we have already done above). </p>
<p> We are assuming that you have already setup ADB. Launch Command Prompt and type ADB reboot bootloader. </p>
<p> Type the following command: fastboot flash recovery filename.img </p>
<p> Press Enter when it is finished. </p>
<p> Now turn off your device and directly boot into recovery using the key combination without booting the device to Android OS. </p>
<p> WARNING: At this step, if the phone boots to Android OS then the custom recovery TWRP/CWM will be replaced by the stock recovery. So in case if that happens, repeat the above steps. </p>
<p> Once you are in the recovery, you can now flash No Verity zip file using the TWRP. </p>
<p> That is it. Now you are done with the flashing of custom recovery. </p>
<p> Installing Custom ROM on Note 5 Pro </p>
<p> Once custom recovery is installed successfully, then you have to download the required files over to your SD card, OTG, or on the internal storage. Doing this will limit the possibility of wiping the internal storage and accidentally removing the downloaded files. </p>
<p> When you have all the necessary files ready, you can then perform these steps on your Redmi Note 5 Pro: </p>
<p> Boot into recovery (via ADB or key combination). </p>
<p> Wipe System, Cache, and Dalvik Cache partitions. </p>
<p> Go to install, locate the ROM file, then add the GApps (if required by ROM). </p>
<p> Wipe Cache and Dalvik Cache after the installation is finished. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and wait a fair amount of time to let the phone boot up. The first boot usually takes time. </p>
<p> Once done, your Redmi Note 5 Pro should be rocking a new custom ROM. </p>
<p> What Is Custom Kernel? </p>
<p> Although we have mostly talked about the custom ROMs in the article, Custom Kernel does deserve a fair bit of attention when we are considering custom ROMs and general flashing for our Android device. </p>
<p> The kernel is the heart of the ROM. It has all the necessary code that tells the hardware how to perform in different conditions. Kernel not only supports features but can also allow modification of some of its aspects. </p>
<p> Sure, ROM brings features such as customizations and features, but most of these features can’t even be supported on the default kernel, so it is essential to flash custom kernel too. Sometimes, the custom kernel also fixes many of the bugs found in ROMs. </p>
<p> Kernel lets you fine-tune variables that can bring huge improvements in the overall performance of your device. In the case of Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro, there is a wide variety of custom kernels available to be chosen from including Kali Netunter, Kangaroox, Stormguard, PureCAF kernel, Illusion Kernel (mostly used in custom ROMs), IceCold kernel (another popularly used kernel). </p>
<p> Updating The Firmware And Downgrade Warnings </p>
<p> Updating of custom ROM or Android firmware is a straightforward process. All you have to do is grab the zip file for the latest version of custom ROM you are using on your Redmi Note 5 Pro and flash it using either the Mi Flash Tool or your custom recovery. </p>
<p> However, it’s the downgrading where things get complicated. </p>
<p> MIUI has enabled anti-rollback on its devices, which has been introduced by Google. Actually, if we unlock the bootloader on Google devices, then the ARB (anti rollback) program gets disabled too, but that is not the case with the Xiaomi devices. ARB on MIUI cannot be disabled by a simple bootloader unlock. </p>
<p> Anti Rollback is Google’s implementation that prevents the system from installing older or non-verified ROMs. However, this does not mean that you cannot install older firmware at all. You can always install firmware with an ARB index that is either equal to or higher than the firmware already installed on your Redmi device. Moving to lower ARB index firmware can brick your device. </p>
<p> It is not entirely impossible to downgrade to lower ARB. If you want to downgrade, then you need to have an unlocked bootloader along with a special recovery that supports ARB downgrades. Once you have those, you can then easily flash the firmware with a lower ARB index. </p>
<p> It is important to note here that one should not use TWRP custom recovery for this because it did not have ARB check support on MIUI devices. So, in this case, having a stock recovery or the MIUIi Flash Tool automatically rejects a firmware or Android ROM with a lower ARB index, which makes it safer. </p>
<p> Checking the ARB index version of your device firmware is easy. All you have to do is simply connect your Redmi Note 5 Pro to your computer via USB and boot it to fastboot mode. On your computer, launch Command Prompt and then type the following command and press enter: </p>
<p> To check the Anti Rollback index version of different firmware, then you can use the ARB checker tool. The ARB is related to stock Android firmware only but, at the same time, it is important for the custom ROM enthusiasts as well. Especially in those scenarios where a custom ROM might require upgrading to a newer firmware or downgrading to an older firmware. </p>

<p> 1 – Happn Online Dating </p>

<p> Ultimate Guide to Disable Chrome Site Notifications on Android </p>
<p> In this blog post, we are going to discuss all the possible techniques to disable Chrome site notifications on Android </p>
<p> In this blog post, we are going to discuss all the possible techniques to disable Chrome site notifications on Android phone and tablet devices: </p>
<p> Are you tired of constant pop-ups and notifications from Google Chrome? Here we have the ultimate guide to disable Chrome site notifications on Android. </p>
<p> We have shared four methods along with a complete step-by-step tutorial to help you get rid of unwanted site notifications and pop-ups from Google Chrome. </p>
<p> There is even a method using which you can customize notifications sent by websites through the Chrome web browser. </p>
<p> Majority of the Android users use Google Chrome as their primary browser because it comes preinstalled on their devices. However, one major downside of this web browser is that it constantly request popup for site notifications. </p>
<p> Apart from the usability and benefits of the Google Chrome site notifications, the key aspect of this feature is to keep you updated with important website activities and to provide a better experience for sites like a web version of Gmail in the form of banners. </p>
<p> Seeing frequent popups for notification requests from sites that you are going to visit once is of little to no value. It’s more like spamming, and constant popups affect the overall site usage experience too. It is also observed that not all web notifications are safe, and they tend to contain malware or adware that can affect your device performance. </p>
<p> So if by any chance you have mistakenly allowed site notifications or you are getting unwanted random popup notifications or maybe you find those popups annoying, and they are constantly bugging you. You don’t have to worry. Here we have a complete guide on how to disable Chrome site notifications on Android. </p>
<p> How to Disable Google Chrome Site Notifications </p>
<p> Google Chrome, by default, asks you whenever a site wants to get permission to send you notifications and you will get a popup similar to the one shown below asking, XYZ website wants to send you notifications. </p>
<p> As you can already see, you have the option to either “allow” or “block” these notifications. Tapping on either option will store your preference for that site in your Chrome browser. We will discuss about making modifications to these settings below. </p>
<p> Anyways, that is one way to disable Chrome site notifications on Android from a single website. </p>
<p> However, you may ask if there is any way to get rid of these annoying popup site notifications completely. Actually, there are two methods and we are going to share both of them below. </p>
<p> Disable Site Notifications using Chrome Incognito Mode </p>
<p> Google Chrome Incognito mode, which is also known as private browsing, is a privacy feature that stops the web browser from remembering your activity and let you browse the web privately. </p>
<p> While you are in Incognito mode, Chrome won’t save your browsing activities, including site data, history, and cookies. What’s interesting is that while you are in this mode, you won’t receive popups asking for site notifications. </p>
<p> Here is how you can open Incognito mode on Google Chrome: </p>
<p> Open Chrome web browser. </p>
<p> On the top right corner, there is a menu button, tap it, and then tap on the New Incognito tab. </p>
<p> A new tab will open with a dark theme and a visible Incognito icon. </p>
<p> You can now freely browse the web without getting distracted by those annoying Chrome site notifications. </p>
<p> Filtering Site Notifications for Specific Websites </p>
<p> Remember, at the beginning of this tutorial, we told you about the notifications popups and how you can allow or block site notifications while browsing. Now, in this method, we are going to share how you can customize notifications settings for specific websites. You will also be able to change notification sound settings. </p>
<p> Here are the steps to manage Chrome site notifications for specific websites: </p>
<p> Open Chrome web browser. </p>
<p> On the top right corner, there is a menu button, tap it, and then tap on Settings. </p>
<p> Under the Advanced section, tap on Site Settings. </p>
<p> In the list of settings, look for Notifications and tap it. </p>
<p> Here you will see two drop-down lists, i.e., Blocked and Allowed. Tapping on it will show you a list of all the websites for which you have allowed or blocked site notifications. </p>
<p> You can tap on the site name and make changes to the permissions, including notifications and sound. </p>
<p> Using these same steps, you can also revoke site notifications access for any website to which you might have accidentally allowed before but don’t know how to stop those notifications from appearing on your phone. </p>
<p> Completely Disable Site Notifications on Chrome </p>
<p> There are chances that some users may find these popup notifications too annoying because it continues to bug them frequently, and they don’t want to use the Incognito mode method. </p>
<p> There is actually a way to disable Chrome site notifications popups from settings completely. Here is how you can do this: </p>
<p> Open Chrome web browser. </p>
<p> On the top right corner, there is a menu button, tap it, and then tap on Settings. </p>
<p> Under the Advanced section, tap on Site Settings. </p>
<p> In the list of settings, look for Notifications and tap it. </p>
<p> Tap on the Notifications toggle button to switch it off and disable site notifications. </p>
<p> Toggling Notifications to off will change the site notifications setting to blocked, which will prevent any further popups from appearing. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> There you have it, guys. These are some of the easiest ways to disable Chrome site notifications on Android. Now you will no longer be annoyed by the unwanted notifications and popups while browsing websites on Google Chrome web browser, giving you complete control over Chrome site notifications. </p>

<p> Ultimate Guide to Disable Google Weather Notifications on Android </p>
<p> A step-by-step guide to help you find and disable Google weather alerts or notifications cards on Android that are usually </p>
<p> A step-by-step guide to help you find and disable Google weather alerts or notifications cards on Android that are usually sent automatically by Google mobile app (the app that comes preinstalled on most Android devices). </p>
<p> Google mobile app is actually a search app by Google, which not only shows you all the relevant news (according to your interest) through Google Discover but also gives you other alerts including weather alert notifications, sports, reminders, unpaid bills, and whatnot. </p>
<p> Weather alerts card are enabled by default on Google app and we can understand not everyone needs these notifications on a daily basis (especially those living in tropical areas) because the weather remains constant throughout the year. </p>
<p> Or, possibly, you are using a third-party weather app and no longer want Google (formerly, Google Now cards) to send you unwanted notifications telling you that the weather is going to be clear and sunny. Again. </p>
<p> Google has several innovative small features to make its users more comfortable while using smart devices. And thanks to their mobile app, we all get weather updates regularly on our Android smartphones based on our current region. </p>
<p> When we actually look at the Google weather alerts feature, it only seems helpful for those who need it. But not everyone is the same and not living in the same weather conditions, and not everyone wants to receive these frequent weather alerts in the form of notification. </p>
<p> In case you haven’t noticed yet, this feature comes preinstalled with your Android smartphone alongside Google Play services. And live weather updates are a part of Google app, which is enabled by default for everyone, whether you like it or not. </p>
<p> Regardless, it is an excellent feature for those who are very curious about the weather conditions and are in a region where frequent weather changes are common. But the story is different for others who are living in the areas where the weather remains stable for at least a month or so. </p>
<p> If you are one of those who want to stop receiving weather alerts by Google mobile app (Google Now cards), we have a solution for you. We have an easy to follow guide using which you can manually disable this feature and get rid of the weather update notifications. </p>
<p> Guide to Disable Weather Notifications in Android </p>
<p> As mentioned above, you can quickly turn off weather alert notifications from Google on Android. But before jumping onto the steps, let’s understand why you are receiving them in the first place… </p>
<p> Why am I getting weather notifications on Android? </p>
<p> As we have already mentioned at the beginning of this blog post, every Android device comes installed with a Google mobile app, which apparently is a part of the system app and cannot be uninstalled or removed. </p>
<p> The same app generates the Google weather notification card that randomly appears in your Android notifications area. That is not all. There are chances that you are already receiving alerts and cards for sports updates, important news updates, calendar events, movie updates, and a bunch of other alerts. </p>
<p> You can check out the above screenshot to find out which Google app notification modules are enabled by default. </p>
<p> In a nutshell, Google app uses your interests and recent search as well as your geolocation to show weather information, news alerts, and promotional notifications. And this is the reason why you are receiving all those annoying alerts in your notification panel. </p>
<p> Now, it’s time to turn that off. </p>
<p> Guide to Turn Off Weather Notifications Card in Google App </p>
<p> The steps are really simple for killing the weather alerts from the Google app in Android. The step-by-step guide is below: </p>
<p> NOTE: If you are using the latest version of the Google app and Google Play Services, then it is going to be straightforward. </p>
<p> Find and open the Google app, and it must be located either at your home screen or in the app drawer. </p>
<p> There you will see a Google search bar along with Google Discover filled with interest-based news and information about weather, news, sports, movie, and entertainment. Tap on the More button at the bottom bar containing various options. </p>
<p> Now you will see a window with some other options to customize your experience. Find the Settings option and tap it to open the Google app settings. </p>
<p> As you can see in the screenshot below, there should be another set of menu items. Find and tap on the Notifications menu. </p>
<p> Here you will see all the enabled Google notifications. </p>
<p> To turn off weather notifications only, scroll down and uncheck the following options from the list: </p>
<p> Current weather conditions, </p>
<p> Weather alerts for big changes, and </p>
<p> Daily weather forecasts. </p>
<p> If you want, you can completely turn off all notifications from Google mobile app at once by toggling off the Show notifications option. </p>
<p> Similarly, you can also turn off other unwanted notifications. </p>
<p> That’s all about disabling the weather updates from Google in your Android device. </p>
<p> Moreover, you can do a few more things while you are in this same settings page. You can go to the advanced settings option and adjust your notification preferences for each set of a module like custom notification sound or enable/disable vibration alerts. </p>
<p> How to turn off all notifications from Google mobile app </p>
<p> If you have already tried the above steps, but you are still receiving weather updates from Google mobile app, then you may want to know more about disabling all alerts from Google. </p>
<p> It has been noticed that on some devices, the modifications we have done above might be overwritten automatically, and you continue to receive those unwanted alerts in your notification area. </p>
<p> If you are experiencing similar issues, then the following step-by-step guide is going to be helpful for you. In addition to that, this will also let you disable all alerts from Google mobile app forever, regardless of your preferences in other apps and settings. </p>
<p> When you receive a notification from Google, tap and hold on that notification in your notification panel. </p>
<p> That notification will expand with some options, and you can directly block notification by toggling off at that menu. </p>
<p> However, if you want to disable all notifications and adjust your preferences, then tap and hold on the same notification and tap on the Manage Notifications option. </p>
<p> Here you can disable the notifications completely or set your custom preference for the different Google app notifications. </p>
<p> Bonus tip: You can use the same method to customize notifications for all installed applications on your phone. </p>
<p> Final Words </p>
<p> Apart from disabling all the notifications from Google mobile app and completely stopping Google cards from appearing, we strongly recommend you to turn on the Weather alerts for big changes option to continue receiving high priority disaster alerts and natural calamity alerts promptly. </p>
<p> Unbelievably, this feature has saved many people from running away from places that had experienced severe flooding and hurricanes. Considering that point, you should keep that single option turned on for your own safety. </p>
<p> That is all about how to disable Google weather notifications from the Google mobile app on Android. You can change your settings anytime according to your preference. Try all the steps now, and check if it works. </p>

<p> Download Dolphin Emulator APK to play GameCube and Wii games on Android </p>
<p> Do you love playing Nintendo GameCube and Wii games but your console is no longer working and you are looking </p>
<p> Download APK File </p>
<p> App Details & Guide </p>

Here we have Dolphin Emulator apk you can install on Android phone or tablet device and start playing GameCube and Wii games. </p>
<p> Dolphin Emulator is a great little app designed to help you portably play and enjoy Nintendo GameCube and Nintendo Wii games on your Android smartphone. You can easily run retail games as well as homebrew and various hacks. </p>
<p> And what’s more interesting is that playing games on Dolphin for Android is somewhat different too as compared to the normal gaming on the original console as the emulator allows you to dump RAM, pause execution, and poke memory without requiring you to have a USB Gecko. </p>
<p> You can download the Dolphin Emulator apk from the download link given within this article and sideload it onto your Android device and begin playing your favorite old Nintendo console games right on your Android phone. </p>
<p> About Dolphin Emulator APK </p>
<p> Dolphin Emulator was initially released during the third quarter of 2003 as freeware for Windows and was the first emulator to be able to emulate commercial Nintendo GameCube games. Then later it became open source and completely free as well as gained support to emulate Nintendo Wii games. </p>
<p> Then later, during 2014, as Android mobile phones started featuring powerful hardware so the developers started targeting Android operating systems too and released Dolphin Emulator Alpha for Android on the official Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Since it was an alpha release, so the developers made sure to include a clear warning that not all the games will be playable as they were still working on polishing things out and trying to optimize the app so that it gets stable on some selected Android devices, rather than preparing the app to emulating high FPS games. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, people who saw the Dolphin Emulator on the Play Store completely ignored change log and the fact that the app is still under an alpha stage. They started assuming that this emulator would help them play their favorite GameCube and Wii games regardless of the Android device they are using. </p>
<p> And when they found out that they were unable to run the games, they started leaving negative reviews and ratings on the Play Store. As the number of negative reviews started to pileup, the moderators decided to take action and removed the app from the store during the second quarter of 2016. </p>
<p> However, the developers were determined and they continued to make certain improvements and worked on enhancing compatibility with more game titles as well as the Android devices. Those alpha builds were being uploaded to their own servers and available for download for those who are advanced users and knows how to side load it on their device. </p>
<p> Then exactly after two years of the removal from the Google Play Store, the Dolphin beta app made an unexpected comeback to the store along with many improvements and the addition of better features to cope up with the never-ending demand of users who are willing to play high-end Nintendo games on their Android phones. </p>
<p> After a 2 years break, Dolphin for Android is back on the Play Store! From now on, our beta versions will be updated there every month (synced with our monthly Progress Reports). </p>
<p> Though, one should not forget that the Dolphin Emulator for Android is still in beta phase so you can expect to experience unforeseen issues and problems that may unexpectedly stop you from enjoying the game. But you will be able to play a lot of old Nintendo gaming titles like Super Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Bros Melee, Mario Kart: Double Dash, Metal Gear Solid, and Animal Crossing. </p>
<p> Though you should not forget that the game compatibility list for the Android variant of Dolphin is still very limited but you will be able to play some of your favorite games without any issue. The app even supports external controller for better gaming experience. Moreover, there are some advanced configuration options available within the settings so that you can modify preferences and controller settings. </p>
<p> Features of Dolphin Emulator APK </p>
<p> As little as it may seem, Dolphin Emulator for Android comes packed with handful of great features. Here are some of the most notable ones: </p>
<p> Support for OpenGL ES 3.0 – The most recent release of Dolphin Emulator adds a support for OpenGL ES 3.0. This means you can run games at faster speeds but you need to have an Android device that supports GLES3. </p>
<p> 64-Bit Architecture – Developers introduced 64-bit AArch64 architecture to maximize compatibility and enhance development for latest and powerful Android devices like NVIDIA Shield. </p>
<p> Broader support – With the release of the latest version that is available on the Google Play Store, the Dolphin is now capable of running on wide range of Android devices. So if you buy any high-end phone then you should be able to enjoy Nintendo GameCube and Wii games. </p>
<p> Advanced GUI – Developers have designed a unique GUI for Android variant as compared to the PC and Mac versions. Furthermore, Android mobile and Android TV has their own unique GUI as both devices have different screen real estate. </p>
<p> Support for external controller – Even though the game can be easily played using the fully customizable touch screen but the Dolphin developers have included a native support for any third-party controller as well as the native GameCube controllers and Real Wii Remotes are also fully supported and configurable through settings. </p>

<p> How to use Do Not Disturb Mode On Android? [Q/A Guide] </p>
<p> Believe me, when I say that Do Not Disturb mode is one of the less used features on Android. That’s </p>
<p> Believe me, when I say that Do Not Disturb mode is one of the less used features on Android. That’s because either people haven’t discovered it correctly, or they haven’t learned how they can make the most out of this powerful feature. The majority are just used to the manual ways to get those things done, which Do Not Disturb could do automatically. </p>
<p> In a nutshell, the Do Not Disturb (DND) feature lets you instruct your phone about how and when you want to receive updates about incoming notifications, calls, and alerts. You have complete control over it, and you can customize which notifications and calls you want to get alerts for when Do Not Disturb mode is enabled. You can even schedule it to make things automated. </p>
<p> I will talk and discuss more about it below: </p>
<p> What Does Do Not Disturb Mode Do On Android? </p>
<p> Most of the Android phone and tablet manufacturers have now started including the Do Not Disturb function right into the OS. In case they forget, Android makes sure the DND mode is there, considering how useful it really is. </p>
<p> The feature is compelling and, once enabled, will allow you to take a break from your phone and concentrate on the life outside by putting unwanted notifications and calls entirely out of your sight for any of your specified schedules. </p>
<p> Basically, DND mode puts your mobile phone on silent during certain times of the day except for some of your favorite contacts and apps, which are essential for you and you don’t want to miss. </p>
<p> By setting up schedules, the DND function will automatically enable and disable itself based on the preferences you have set and configured. Because obviously, there is no reason to let your smartphone control your life, and you should be the one controlling it. </p>
<p> There are various moments when I believe you should be scheduling DND on your phone, which includes bedtime, mealtime, meetings, and while you are working. You can even enable it manually during those moments when you need some time away from notifications. </p>
<p> What The Differences Are Between Do Not Disturb Vs. Silent? </p>
<p> The differences are significant between the two. </p>
<p> Do Not Disturb can be customized and scheduled. You can select and personalize whose calls and notifications you want to receive and what notifications you want to block when DND mode is enabled. You can set up timings and schedules when you want it to be enabled and disabled, and everything will happen automatically. Even your phone’s display will not wake up. </p>
<p> Whereas on the other hand, Silent mode cannot be customized or scheduled. Once enabled, it will put all the calls and every single notification on silent. Your phone will not ring or buzz for anything. Silent mode needs to be enabled and disabled manually. Upon the arrival of any message, notification, or phone call, your phone’s display will wake up. </p>
<p> How Do I Turn Off Or Turn On Do Not Disturb? </p>
<p> Turning DND on or off is really simple. Just a 1-2-3 step. And won’t take more than a couple of seconds. Here’s how: </p>
<p> Unlock your Android mobile phone. </p>
<p> Swipe down from the top of your screen to open the notifications menu. </p>
<p> Tap Do Not Disturb. </p>
<p> On your notifications bar, if you see a circle sign with a dash inside, that means the Do Not Disturb function is enabled. If there is no sign, then it means it’s disabled. </p>
<p> If there is no shortcut icon or option to enable Do Not Disturb in the notifications menu, then here is an alternative method to go to Do Not Disturb settings on Android: </p>
<p> When you are on the home screen, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification drawer. </p>
<p> Tap on the Settings gear icon. </p>
<p> Tap on the Sound & Vibration section. </p>
<p> Here you should be able to find the Do Not Disturb option. </p>
<p> That’s how easy the whole process is. </p>
<p> How Can I Properly Set Up Do Not Disturb? </p>
<p> By properly setting up Do Not Disturb on your Android, you can put a limit on the interruptions caused by certain app notifications, calls, and messages. </p>
<p> Here is a guide on how to set up DND on your phone: </p>
<p> NOTE: Settings and menu may differ depending on your phone manufacturer and Android OS running on your device. </p>
<p> Open Settings app on your device. </p>
<p> Find and tap on Sound & Vibration. </p>
<p> Here you should be able to find the Do Not Disturb option. Tap it. </p>
<p> In the section, What Can Interrupt Do Not Disturb, you can easily choose what you want to allow and what you want to block. It’s like an exceptions list. </p>
<p> Apps – Select which app can send you notifications and which cannot. </p>
<p> People – Allow or block calls, messages, and notifications from specific contacts or favorites only. </p>
<p> Alarms – You can block/allow sounds like alarm, reminders, other sounds like touch, and calendar notifications. </p>
<p> Repeated Callers – Automatically allow any callers to bypass DND, who calls you twice within 15 minutes. </p>
<p> That is all you have to do to set up this function. </p>
<p> How Do I Schedule Do Not Disturb? </p>
<p> You can enable DND from the notifications drawer or through the Settings menu, both of which we have already mentioned in the previous section. However, scheduling is another way to automatically enable Do Not Disturb on Android during a specific time of the week, as per your requirements. </p>
<p> Here is how you can do it: </p>
<p> Go to the Settings app on your Android device. </p>
<p> Tap on the Sounds & Vibration option, then tap on Do Not Disturb. </p>
<p> Tap on Turn on as scheduled. </p>
<p> Tap on the Off button to enable scheduling. It should show On and allow you to configure scheduling settings. </p>
<p> The schedule settings include the option to select days of the week and the option to choose the Start time and End time. </p>
<p> Once you have entered all the schedule data, tap on Done. </p>
<p> It is important to note here that scheduling does not allow you to set up multiple schedules for a single day. Which means you can only select only one start and end time for any day of the week. </p>
<p> Just set it and forget it. Android will now take care of DND for you. </p>
<p> How Does Do Not Disturb Turns On By Itself? </p>
<p> In this section, I am going to help you find out and fix why Android devices go to Do Not Disturb mode automatically, why it keeps turning on, and how exactly you can stop it from happening randomly. </p>
<p> The first thing you need to check is whether the automatic DND scheduler is enabled or disabled. To check that, check out the previous section where I have already discussed about Do Not Disturb schedule. </p>
<p> Secondly, most of the Android devices have a DND shortcut placed right at the notifications drawer, which is prone to be activated accidentally while you are checking notifications or toggling other settings from the notifications area. So you can try removing the Do Not Disturb shortcut access from the notifications. </p>
<p> Thirdly, you can try the method I have given in the next section related to Android Special Access settings. </p>
<p> Do Not Disturb Automatic Rules Not Working </p>
<p> I remember when my Android mobile phone got upgraded to Android 8 Oreo, my already set up and perfectly working Do Not Disturb scheduling and automatic rules started acting up. Sometimes my phone used to stay in DND mode, although it has been scheduled to turn off. I had to turn it off manually. </p>
<p> Then after playing and fiddling with settings here and there, I figured out about a new option, i.e., Special Access settings. It is located right inside the Apps settings. When you tap on the menu button located at the top-right corner, there is an option called Do not disturb permission. </p>
<p> Tap on it, and you will see a list of apps that have access to the Do not disturb functionality, and apps with access can enable/disable DND mode based on your preferences set up within that specific app. </p>
<p> What I actually did here is to give special access to the Google app. And voila, it fixed my issue. If you have any other questions, a query related to Android Do Not Disturb mode, or in case the above solutions did not help to fix the issue, then please feel free to drop your question in the comments below, and I will help you out. </p>

<p> Are you tired of the Facebook app constantly force closing itself due to low system resources? Or, are you running out of storage space because the Facebook and Messenger app are consuming it all? Here I have found a definitive solution for you. </p>
<p> We all know that Facebook has become one of the most widely used social networking website on the Internet with over a billion users. </p>
<p> Despite all this popularity, the developers are still unable to optimize their Facebook for Android app correctly and to develop a battery-optimized and less resource hogging app for their users. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, many third party developers have done a pretty excellent job of developing a highly optimized, lightweight, data-saving Facebook app for Android. And I have listed the ten best apps below! </p>
<p> #01 – Facebook Lite </p>
<p> Facebook Lite app is designed and developed by the Facebook itself to provide its users with an app that works on the slow Internet connections, uses fewer data, and consumes a reduced amount of system resources as compared to the standard Facebook for Android app. </p>
<p> Though the interface looks old and outdated but provides all the essential features that will get all your tasks done including a built-in messaging functionality so you won’t need to install a standalone app to have chats with your friends. </p>
<p> #02 – Fast – FB Alternative Client </p>
<p> Fast is a real Facebook alternative app that has been downloaded by more than ten million users with an average user rating of 4.0 out of 5.0 on the Google Play Store. The app is the best way to manage and use your Facebook account if you are tired of using the regular and resource-hungry Facebook app. </p>
<p> Fast provides all the features available on the original app while making it light enough so that every Android device can run it without experiencing lag or force closure due to lack of RAM and system resources. </p>
<p> #03 – Metal for Facebook & Twitter </p>
<p> Metal is a tiny app that supports both Facebook as well as Twitter in a single interface, and the size of the app is so small with a little footprint that you will be able to access your Facebook account at the whirlwind speed. </p>
<p> In a nutshell, Metal is a Web wrapper and works as a web browser but has additional features that are not offered by the regular browsers i.e. floating windows, built-in themes, and notifications. The key feature is the floating window as it lets you access your Facebook newsfeed and notifications over any other existing app. </p>
<p> #04 – Swipe for Facebook </p>
<p> Similar to what Metal offers, the developers of the Swipe app has managed to do something similar in their perfect way. The developers have used the Facebook mobile website as their base to provide you with a light and familiar Facebook user interface without overstraining your Android device’s system resources. </p>
<p> That is what makes Swipe one of the lightest and the most battery-friendly Facebook app for your Android smartphone device while keeping the user experience as typical as possible so you won’t have to spend any time learning the ins and outs of the app. </p>
<p> If you liked the app, you could even opt for the Swipe for Facebook Pro version that comes with premium features and priority support for bugs and issues. </p>
<p> #05 – Fast Lite – FB </p>
<p> Fast Lite is a much lighter app of the Fast FB alternative client that I have mentioned in the list earlier. </p>
<p> This version provides some additional features to make it even faster and lighter for those who have slow Internet connection speeds or looking for a way to save bandwidth while browsing through Facebook by using the block image functionality. </p>
<p> #06 – Tinfoil for Facebook </p>
<p> Tinfoil for Facebook is one of the slimmest apps and has a file size of less than half a megabyte, which makes the Facebook accessible even on those Android devices that have not as much of resources available to run any app. </p>
<p> Moreover, the app only requires Internet and location permissions so that it can allow you to access Facebook and let you check-in to the places. </p>
<p> #07 – Puffin for Facebook </p>
<p> Puffin for Facebook is designed and developed by CloudMosa Inc, the creators behind the popular Puffin web browser for Android. The key target of this app is to let you access and browse Facebook without consuming much bandwidth so that you can check your account while you are running low of data. </p>
<p> Furthermore, the app uses the Puffin’s servers along with its unique compression technology to reduce the overall data usage while making it lightweight so that the low-end Android device users can easily access their Facebook account. </p>
<p> #08 – Folio for Facebook </p>
<p> Folio for Facebook is an app that transforms a simple mobile website version of the Facebook and wraps it into a beautifully designed material user interface. The app even provides you with real-time notifications for new messages and notifications. </p>
<p> To further customize your Facebook experience on the Folio app, the developer has included four predesigned themes that you can change anytime and according to your personal liking. </p>
<p> There is also Folio Pro version that comes with over forty-four themes to choose from, a customized Facebook UI, and some battery optimizations. </p>
<p> #09 – Bubble for Facebook </p>
<p> Bubble for Facebook is a floating bubble that looks and works similar to the Messenger chat heads and stays on top of your screen, keeping your Facebook newsfeed at an easy access and making it always reachable. </p>
<p> You can touch the bubble to access your Facebook anytime. You can drag and drop the bubble anywhere on the screen. The app even allows you to chat with your friends while you are using other app or playing games. </p>
<p> #10 – SlimSocial for Facebook </p>
<p> SlimSocial for Facebook is an ultimately slimmed and simplified Facebook app available for your Android. And above all, it is an open source application making it even more transparent that any other app. </p>
<p> Intelligently developed by Leonardo Rignanese, the app has a file size of just 200 kilobytes that makes it not only light but fast too along with full support for the features like full-screen video playback, a capability to upload videos and photos, and does not require any unnecessary permission. </p>
<p> Which Facebook App Is Your Personal Favorite? </p>
<p> Do you know about any other Facebook app that is your favorite and I haven’t included in the list above? I’d love to hear about them in the comments section below! 🙂 </p>
<p> metal is the best application for Facebook I’ve tried this application it works very smooth. other are also good . nice list for alternative apps for Facebook </p>
<p> No doubt, as compared to the bloated and heavy Facebook app, Metal for Facebook is a great alternative. It receives regular updates along with frequent performance and functionality improvements. Even though some latest key features are missing but the app is very smooth and light weight. </p>

<p> App Details & Guide </p>
<p> Facebook Lite apk download for Android to use Facebook without giving away much storage space on your phone. With this lite version of Facebook, you can connect with your friends and family on the go without overloading your Android device. </p>
<p> About Facebook Lite APK </p>
<p> Facebook Lite apk is a smaller and more efficient version of the original Facebook application. It was launched a couple of years ago for all the users who have a lower-end Android smartphone that doesn’t run the original Facebook app smoothly. </p>
<p> This application was launched in places like Bangladesh, Vietnam, Nepal, and other places where the phones compatible with running the Facebook app easily are not sold much as it is much more expensive there. So Facebook launched another application similar to the old one that can run easily on the lower end android phones. </p>
<p> This app especially helped all the people who wanted to use Facebook but their smartphones couldn’t run it smoothly. </p>
<p> Facebook lite also has some advantages over the original Facebook app. It is a much smaller application, 250 kb to be exact, which is almost nothing while comparing it to other applications. </p>
<p> It was also designed to work on a 2G internet connection. So it will work like a charm if you are in a situation where you are getting very slow internet speeds or your phone only supports 2G. Due to this reason, it also uses less data bandwidth and doesn’t eat up all your data. </p>
<p> Another big advantage with the lite version of Facebook is that you don’t have to download the Facebook Messenger app which takes up more space on your phone. Facebook lite comes with the messenger app built into it. So that is also an advantage that you don’t need to have two applications. </p>
<p> As far as using system resources is concerned, it is a lot more efficient than the original Facebook app as it is designed to target the people who use lower-end smartphones or use an internet connection that is unreliable or really slow. </p>
<p> Now, you must be wondering that there must be a lot of things missing in this application which makes it so efficient. Well jarringly, it has almost all the features that the original Facebook version has with some small changes. </p>
<p> It doesn’t run in the background and use the RAM which slows down your phone. And as you also don’t need to download the separate Messenger app, and that doesn’t run in the background, it helps in making the apps run more smoothly on your phone. </p>
<p> Other than that, as far as the user interface is concerned. It is less appealing to use. Why you may ask? Well because the buttons on the lite version are slightly boxier and are not rounded from the edges like the original version. </p>
<p> The pictures and videos are not loaded by default in order to save internet resources. To view the photos and videos uploaded by your friends, you’ll have to tap on the view button, and then it is going to load that photo or video for you. This helps in saving internet resources as unwanted photos are not loaded by default. </p>
<p> Just like this, the videos are not going to play by themselves. You’ll have to press the play button to start the video playback. But the Facebook lite all the features that the original Facebook has and doesn’t lack behind in any feature. It definitely feels old to use but it gets the job done at the end of the day. </p>
<p> If you ask what makes it look old. The buttons on the main screen like the profile button, home button, and other navigation buttons look a lot chunkier and harsh while the original Facebook makes it look round and smooth, giving it a much sleeker look and making it look more futuristic. </p>
<p> Features of Facebook Lite for Android </p>
<p> There are multiple features that Facebook lite apk has to offer, some of which are listed below: </p>
<p> Low resource usage, Facebook lite is designed to run on low power devices as it is mostly targeting all the consumers with lower-end smartphones. </p>
<p> Runs on slow Internet connection, it runs smoothly and efficiently even on very slow internet connections like 2G without any issues. </p>
<p> Fully featured, regardless of its low power usage and low internet usage, it still has all the features that the original Facebook has to offer. </p>
<p> Smaller form factor, the Facebook lite application is one of the smallest applications, coming in at only 250 KB. </p>
<p> Facebook Lite FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) </p>
<p> What is Facebook lite? </p>
<p> Facebook Lite is a smaller and less demanding version of Facebook. It is generally targeted to all the users who have a slower android smartphone or a sluggish internet connection as it can run smoothly on 2G internet connections as well. </p>
<p> What is the difference between Facebook and Facebook lite? </p>
<p> In most conditions, both of these applications are pretty similar but with some minor differences such as the Facebook, app loads images and videos by itself and play it automatically while in Facebook lite, you have to tap on images and videos to view it. </p>

<p> Want to talk to your Facebook friends conveniently? Download Messenger APK and talk to your friends via video call for free. </p>
<p> About Messenger APK </p>
<p> Messenger is texting, video, and audio calling app developed by Facebook. There was a texting feature built in the Facebook app, but after a while, Facebook introduced this app and removed texting feature from Facebook, making it necessary for the user to download this app to talk to people from Facebook. </p>
<p> This application is very fun to use and talk to your friends. It has a simple interface with useful features laid out in front of you. In the default tab, there is a search bar on top of the screen where you can search for the chat of the person you want to talk. Under that search bar, there are four tabs on top, namely Messages, Active, Groups and Calls. Right under these four tabs, there are all the stories from all your friends on Facebook. </p>
<p> Those four tabs have very simple uses. Messages are the place where all of your chats are available, and you can interact with them and talk to them here if you want. After that, there is an Active tab, which is pretty self-explanatory. It shows you the people who are available on Facebook or messenger so that you can talk to them. </p>
<p> On the right side of that, there are Groups. Here you can see and interact with all the groups. It also shows you if any of the group participants are active right now and when the last time that group was used. And in the end, there is Calls tab where you can see all the calls you’ve had in the past and call that person or that group also if you want. </p>
<p> If we go into the chats, we can see some interesting things there. There is the name of the person you’re talking at the top and right below that there is the time when that person was last online. </p>
<p> On the right side of the name, there is voice call and video call buttons. If we come to the bottom, we can see the box where you can type and talk to your friend. Tap on the face on the end of that box, and you can interact and use all the emojis you can also download or add more emojis in your list from the messenger app itself. </p>
<p> You can also buy more stickers, emojis, and gifs from this application itself for getting premium options regarding stickers and stuff. They are not that expensive as well if you are considering to buy some of them. </p>
<p> On the left side of that type box, there is an option which you can use to send pictures or videos, take a picture or even send a voice message. And on the other corner, we can see a thumbs up icon which you can tap and hold to make the size bigger and bigger, and if you hold it for too long, it is going to explode with a pretty sleek sound effect. </p>
<p> If you tap on the info icon on top of the screen, it is going to show you more options like you can set notifications, color, emoji(that gets bigger) and also add a nickname of your friend if you want. Below that, it is going to show you all the groups that you and your friend are in. If you scroll more, you can see some more options like starting a call of any kind, block that friend, ignore their messages, etc. </p>
<p> Scroll more, and you’ll see the shared content. Here all of the photos that you’ve sent or received will be shown. You can also play games in this application. Yes, you read that right. These are pretty simple games that you can play and try to score more than your friends and compete with each other. </p>
<p> For more ease of use, there is also a feature known as chat heads. Whenever you’re talking to a friend on messenger, and you want to use another application like Facebook, you can turn on this feature and talk to your friends while using your favorite apps. </p>
<p> These are small circular overlays on a corner of the screen that you can move on any desired corner of the screen. You can tap on them to open the chat even while using another application. You can open multiple of these and talk to multiple people at once by just tapping on the chat head of the person you want to talk and open their chats. </p>
<p> It makes it easy and convenient to talk to people while doing your work or while using another application simultaneously. You don’t need to open the messenger application every time you want to talk to your loved ones. You can open their chat heads and talk to them without any problem. </p>
<p> Another awesome feature that got added in messenger quite recently is the filter options for your pictures. There are many options for filters with a different idea in every one of them. </p>
<p> It is quite similar to Snapchat and Instagram’s version of the filter. It is mostly used for selfies or taking pictures of yourself with some interesting stuff. And as messenger introduces story options which allows you to post pictures and videos for telling the story of your day or what you did the whole day. So it is very useful for these trends. </p>
<p> And if you go in the camera menu and look at the top right corner of the screen, it has a very similar feature like Snapchat. There is a moon there, and if you press on that, it tries to brighten up the image wherever possible by decreasing the blacks and lifting the shadows up. </p>
<p> It can come in handy in some situations, but it can also introduce more noise in your images as it is revealing all those shadow areas of the picture. So it works in certain situations pretty well, but in some situations, it might make your pictures look worse. </p>
<p> While talking about pictures, you can also edit your pictures like put some emojis, draw on it or even put a sticker to make your pictures look more interesting. There are multiple options available for you to choose from, you can change the color of the brush, change the size of the brush as well as use emoji brush to paint on an image with emojis. </p>
<p> If you want, you can also sync your cellular number with Messenger application. What this is going to do is that it is going to sync all of your messages with the Messenger app. So whenever there is a message on your cellular number, it is going to be displayed on the messenger app rather than on your original messaging app. </p>
<p> It can be good for those people whose original messaging app on their phone is not good, but it can be frustrating sometimes when you can’t make out if the message is coming from the Messenger app or the cellular message. </p>
<p> So it can be useful for some people, but I think most of the people are just going to use the original app as it is going to make it convenient for them to determine where the message is coming from and replying to them quickly and on time. </p>
<p> They have also added voice message options that can come in handy if you don’t want to type the whole thing or are busy in driving or doing something else. They are decent quality audio files that are sent really quickly over medium speed internet too. </p>
<p> Overall it is a very useful and nicely laid out application which you can use to talk to your friends on Facebook. </p>
<p> Features of Messenger APK </p>
<p> Facebook messenger has a lot of useful features built into it. Some of them are listed below. </p>
<p> Talk to anyone, talk to anyone with their phone numbers or username. </p>
<p> All in one chat feature, you can chat, voice call or even video call your friends. </p>
<p> Send favorite emojis, send new emojis to your friends and entertain them. </p>
<p> Play games, play games with your friends, score more and compete. </p>
<p> Sync cellular messages, now you can sync your cellular messages with the messenger app to get the messages in one place. </p>
<p> Face Filters, and they have also introduced filters that you can use to make your stories and pictures look interesting. </p>
<p> Discussions </p>

It has a very solid architecture, as you can expect from any official iOS app. </p>
<p> FaceTime makes it pretty simple and convenient for anyone on the iOS platform to connect with others using the same app with virtually zero lagging issues or bugs in the connectivity. </p>
<p> We all know that switching to an Android device from iOS is not an easy task. You miss all the pre-loaded apps that come handy like iMessage and FaceTime. Even though there are plenty of video calling apps for Android, but it is almost impossible to call them FaceTime alternatives as they do not offer the same stability and connectivity. However, some pretty fine applications can be used as an alternative to the FaceTime app on Android. </p>
<p> In this blog post, we will be sharing a detailed review of FaceTime alternatives along with the pros and cons of each of them so you can read and decide the best app for your video calling needs. </p>
<p> Best FaceTime Alternatives for Android Phones </p>

<p> WhatsApp Messenger </p>
<p> WhatsApp has become a basic necessity for us and is used worldwide for sending and receiving texts, audio, video calls, and sharing the media files. This app gained its popularity through fast text messaging services and media sharing options. And the same is now widely used among smartphone users. </p>
<p> WhatsApp is well known for its speed and stability, with regular updates and improvements that eventually mean lesser bugs that are equal to none. It also gives you the liberty to back-up your chats to the cloud or your phone’s local storage, so you do not miss out on your chats/media while switching the device. </p>
<p> WhatsApp is secured with end-to-end encryption and all the conversations are stored on your device locally instead of servers. The app also allows you to send group messages, and you can create a group for up to 256 persons. </p>
<p> WhatsApp allows you to make video calls along with the group calling capability where you can have a video call with up to 4 persons and talk to them simultaneously. To call someone using this service, you must need to have the phone number of that person, which is registered with WhatsApp service. </p>
<p> The service is highly efficient despite its popularity and a huge number of users. And the good thing is that you don’t need to install any additional app or add-on to be able to use it for video calling. </p>
<p> Pros: Fast and highly stable, receive frequent updates, widely used. </p>
<p> Cons: To be able to call someone through WhatsApp, you just need to have their phone number registered with the service. </p>
<p> Facebook Messenger </p>
<p> Facebook Messenger is also one of the most popular apps being used these days. It allows you to send and receive text-based messages, exotic stickers, media sharing as well as audio and video calls. </p>
<p> In comparison to the other similar video calling apps, the Facebook Messenger does not require you to have a person’s phone number to call them. You can simply add the person using their username and start calling. The Facebook Messenger Android app gets frequent updates from Facebook Developers, and you can expect optimal performance and quick updates for any bugs that may occur. </p>
<p> Facebook Messenger also offers a group video calling feature that allows you to video call multiple persons simultaneously. You can have a video call with up to 6 persons at a time, along with group voice call with up to 50 persons. Which makes it one of a good alternatives to FaceTime on Android devices. </p>
<p> Moving forward, the app has Augmented Reality stickers that help you interact in a more personalized way over a video call. You can also log in to multiple Facebook accounts and manage each of them using a single Android device. Also, all the conversations and media files are stored on Facebook servers, so it does not consume any space on your cellphone. </p>
<p> Pros: Consumes less space on the device, allow you to add up to six persons for video call </p>
<p> Cons: Requires a faster internet connection. </p>
<p> Skype </p>
<p> Skype is one of the oldest and most stable solution for chats and video calling. Due to its stability, the service is being used by most businesses and other organizations that require various mediums of communication between its employees including video, verbal, text, and it even helps in file sharing. </p>
<p> Skype is a cross-platform app that allows you to communicate with the other Skype users without any bounds of the platform you both are using, including Android, iOS, Windows, or Mac. </p>
<p> Skype has a group video call feature, and it allows you to add up to 25 users in one video session, which makes it one of the most suitable solutions for someone who is looking to have a group calling with more people. </p>
<p> Some other noticeable features include media and documents sharing, through which you can share files with other users; and screen sharing options that allow you to share your computer screen with the other person over a video call. </p>
<p> Pros: Skype is highly stable and allows faster communication; over 25 users can be added in a single video call session. </p>
<p> Cons: Skype consumes comparatively more processing power than its competitors consume; the app tends to get slow at times. </p>
<p> Viber </p>
<p> Viber started to gain popularity as a voice messaging service provider and became quite famous for its vibrant and eye-catching stickers. Over the span of time, they introduced the video call option as well for its users. </p>
<p> Viber has a minimalistic interface that enables fast communication and ensures lesser lags in calls. The development team is active and rolls out the updates quite frequently as well. In addition to that, it is fairly lightweight on the processor and consumes relatively less battery power to work. </p>
<p> The only drawback is that Viber does not support group calls, and you are allowed to initiate a video call with one person at a time. So if you are not looking for an app to make group calls, and all you require is a communication app with smooth and simplistic UI, Viber is your go-to app. </p>
<p> Pros: Minimalistic user interface; light on hardware. </p>
<p> Cons: Does not support group calls. </p>
<p> WeChat </p>
<p> WeChat is another multipurpose app that is popular among smartphone users as a FaceTime alternative for video calling purposes. It allows multiple ways to communicate like text messaging, media sharing (photos and videos) as well as audio and video calls. </p>
<p> Although, as the name of the app suggests, the core focus is on the text messaging but the video calling feature is pretty strong too and does not feel lagging at any point. It allows you to make high-quality video calls with lesser interruptions and disturbances. </p>
<p> WeChat video calling functionality also offers you to make group video calls, and you can add up to 9 people and chat with them simultaneously on a video call. Additional features include attractive stickers and support for GIFs. The only drawback is that not everyone is on WeChat, and you need a person’s phone number registered with WeChat to contact him or her on this platform. </p>
<p> Pros: Light and multipurpose; store messages locally on the device. </p>
<p> Cons: Comparatively fewer users. </p>
<p> Google Hangouts </p>
<p> Probably the most simplistic and efficient FaceTime alternatives for Android is offered by the Google itself, and they named it as Google Hangouts. The key feature that sets it apart from other apps is that you just need to send an invitation link to the person with whom you want to have a video or voice call, and once they click on the link you can then connect and start a video chat with them. </p>
<p> Google Hangouts allows you to initiate group video calls with up to 10 persons at a time and group chats with up to 100 persons. </p>
<p> Additional features include screen sharing and remote access, which means you can get access to the other person’s device with their permission through Hangouts and can use their device. This feature is proven to be greatly beneficial for people working in the IT industry for troubleshooting and remotely fixing the errors. </p>
<p> Pros: Simple to connect with other people for video calls; provides screen sharing and remote access capabilities. </p>
<p> Cons: Not multipurpose like the competitors. </p>
<p> ezTalks Meetings </p>
<p> EzTalks Meetings is one of the great alternatives for FaceTime on Android as it offers good quality video calls with great connection stability and lesser bugs. The app focuses on groups and conference calls, so if you are looking to have conference meetings or talk to a number of friends at the same time, then ezTalks Meetings is the best app for this purpose. </p>
<p> Moreover, it also allows one-on-one calls. The connectivity process is pretty simple and you can connect with the persons you are looking to call by sending them an invite link through email. </p>
<p> ezTalks Meetings offer three different plans, i.e., Free, Premium, and Enterprise. The free plan allows you up to 100 persons in a group call, whereas the Premium plan allows up to 500 people, and Enterprise plan allows a whopping 1000 persons connected to one video call. </p>
<p> Additional features include screen-sharing, whiteboard sharing, and scheduling meetings, so the participants are aware of the schedules in advance. You can also record the meetings and play them later. You can even use the instant messaging service offered by ezTalks Meetings. </p>
<p> Pros: Simple connectivity process; allows larger groups to chat simultaneously. </p>
<p> Cons: Some features are paid. </p>
<p> Line </p>
<p> The core focus of the Line app is on the chat and text-based conversations, but they also offer voice and video calling services. It has attractive and immersive stickers as well as other fun features for chats. Also, customized tunes are pretty interesting and make chatting much more fun. </p>
<p> Although the voice and video calling services are offered as well, both of them are of good quality and never make you feel like you are using some cheap service. </p>
<p> However, the scope of the Line app is limited, and they only offer one-on-one communication services, unlike other alternatives like WhatsApp, Skype, or Hangouts, all of which offer group calling functionality. </p>
<p> Pros: Solid and minimalistic interface; it does not lag. </p>
<p> Cons: Does not allow group calls. </p>
<p> IMO </p>
<p> IMO is among one of the top FaceTime alternatives on Android that comes handy and proves to be extremely useful if you are tired of all the complex apps with multiple features as IMO is basically developed with a core aim to bring the video chatting capabilities over to the mobile devices. </p>
<p> But with the passing time and gaining popularity as well as user’s demand, the developers started adding other features like text messages, audio calls, and media sharing. </p>
<p> However, IMO is still one of the most reliable when it comes to video chatting because it has a strong architecture topped with regular updates to ensure the stability and efficiency of the app. </p>
<p> IMO supports large group calls for up to 25 persons at a time. Through this app, you can also live stream broadcast and let people see you. The live streaming feature is a great plus for users who are trying to convey messages to a group of people. </p>
<p> You can also watch broadcasts from other persons live streaming from within the IMO Android app. You can even join a live stream if the sender allows you, and if you did, then all viewers who are watching the live stream can see you as well along with the person who originally started streaming. </p>
<p> Pros: Light and minimalistic interface; live streaming option. </p>
<p> Cons: Can be a bit sluggish on slow Internet connections. </p>
<p> Snapchat </p>
<p> Snapchat is one of the first most popular apps among the younger generation, the majority loves it because of its disappearing messages and AR filters. If you are already a Snapchatter and do not want to install another app just for video calling, then Snapchat has had you covered. </p>
<p> While the basic idea behind Snapchat is to update your friends with your unique stories, you can also chat with other persons in real-time. The app gained its popularity and gained a lot of users because of its auto-destructing messages, which is a great plus for teenagers. </p>
<p> Moving forward, you can send voice notes to your friends. The camera and its immersive AR (Augmented Reality) filters are fun to use, and that is one of the major reasons for the growth of the app in relatively lesser time. </p>
<p> Snapchat also allows you to make voice and video calls to your Snapchat friends with great audio and video quality. While video chatting, you can also use your favorite AR stickers and filters that will make the whole video chatting experience much more fun and exciting. </p>
<p> Snapchat does require you to have a stable internet connection, and it consumes more data and phone resources as compared to the other apps, but that is certainly worth each bit as the quality is unbeatable as well. Due to the inclusion of extensive features and AR, the app can be a bit slow on older devices. </p>
<p> Pros: Exotic and AR-based filters; highly stable; frequent updates; great voice and video quality. </p>
<p> Cons: Requires more hardware resources; consumes more data as compared to other apps. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> We have tried our best to ensure we provide you with an honest review about FaceTime alternatives for Android so that you can read in-depth about all the apps and compare them to see what would be better for your needs instead of going through the hassle to have to try all the apps yourself. </p>

<p> 10+ Signs To Differentiate Between Fake & Genuine Chargers & USB Cables </p>
<p> Are you planning to purchase a Samsung chargers or USB cable accessory for your Samsung phone but don’t know if </p>
<p> Are you planning to purchase a Samsung chargers or USB cable accessory for your Samsung phone but don’t know if it is original or fake? Don’t worry, here we have closely compared both by putting them side-by-side and found the 11 notable differences. Continue reading to find out what are those… 😉 </p>
<p> Many smartphone users believe that using third-party chargers and USB cable does not possess any risk, however, it has been proven from time to time that using fake/counterfeit chargers, batteries, USB cables, and other accessories could be unsafe and might damage your smartphone. </p>
<p> Recently, we tried to find the dissimilarities between the genuine Samsung chargers/USB cables and fake to help our readers in making a wise selection between the two while shopping for Samsung USB cables and chargers. </p>
<p> The differences were so minor that one would never be able to find out which one is the original Samsung accessory and which one is the replica unless both chargers and USB cables are physically positioned side by side and closely inspected, just as we did in this article. </p>
<p> So in an attempt to help you in making your charger and USB cable purchases stress-free, we have compiled a list of visible differences, which one can only find out if they already have an original charger and data cable with them while buying. </p>
<p> The differences we have mentioned in this article would assist you in confirming whether the charger and USB cable being sold by the seller and/or supplier is genuine or counterfeit. </p>
<p> Also, if you have planned to order a Genuine Samsung chargers or USB cable from any online e-commerce store then we will suggest you make sure that the supplier you are placing an order with is authentic and provides a refund policy. </p>
<p> This way, you would be able to get the product refunded later in case you find out that the charger or cable is fake. </p>
<p> Apart from the visible differences between the original Samsung chargers and the fake ones, there might be some variations in their circuits as well as the output power and current ratings. Keep in mind that the poorly made charger circuits with different output power ratings than the original ones could permanently damage your smartphone. </p>
<p> Samsung recommend you should use only Samsung genuine or approved batteries that have been specifically designed for use in Samsung products. The use of incompatible batteries, cables and chargers may not be safe to use and could cause damage to the device or couple provide external damage. </p>
<p> With that being said, are you now ready to find the differences between the fake and genuine Samsung accessories? </p>
<p> Please head over to the next section to make yourself aware of all the hard-to-notice differences and learn how you can easily differentiate between the two all by yourself. </p>
<p> 11 Differences Between Fake & Genuine Chargers/USB Cables </p>
<p> Below we have outlined the 11 noticeable differences between fake and original Samsung chargers and USB cables that would help you in identifying whether the charger and cable you are purchasing for your Samsung smartphone is original or fake. </p>
<p> 1. Build Quality of the Charger: The very first thing you are going to notice when you pick up your charger is its overall build quality. The genuine charger should feel well built, solid, and strong; whereas the fake charger would feel like it is made of some cheap plastic. </p>
<p> 2. The Weight of the Charger: If you take your original Samsung charger along with you when making your purchase for another charger, you will be able to distinguish between the genuine and fake chargers just by assessing their weight. Due to the superior build quality, the genuine charger should feel heavier as compared to the fake one. </p>
<p> 3. Corners and Edges of the Charger: If you compare the top side and the edges of the original charger with the fake one, you will notice that the fake charger’s corners and curves are uneven and have some excess plastic, whereas the original charger has smooth and leveled edges. (As you can see in the picture below). </p>
<p> 4. Joints on the Charger: Both, original as well as fake chargers have a joint in the middle. The original charger has a smooth and flat joint whereas the fake one has a sharp and prominent joint. (Highlighted in the above image) </p>
<p> 5. USB Connector Port Slot on the Charger: As we have discussed in the last point, the cutting of the USB connector port slot of the fake charger also have uneven corners and edges. Whereas, the original charger have well-built, smoothed, and flattened edges. (As you can see in the picture above). </p>
<p> Do you know how to improve your phone’s battery life and make it last a whole day on a single charge? The apps mentioned here will help you out. 😉 </p>
<p> 6. Charger Plugs: The European standard plugs on the original Samsung charger features an extra layer of plastic on the lower end of the structure of the plugs to provide extra strength and support, which also enhances its overall durability. Whereas, on the fake Samsung charger you will notice that there are simple plugs without any durability structures. (As you can see in the picture below). </p>
<p> 7. Micro-USB Connector Size: On the micro-USB to USB cable, you are going to notice that there is a significant difference between the micro-USB connector size of the original Samsung USB cable and the fake USB cable. The original micro-USB connector is smaller in length and is closer to the body, whereas the fake USB cable has a larger micro-USB connector and there’s more space between the connector and the body, which is more likely to get broken after frequent usage. (highlighted in the image below) </p>
<p> 8. Micro-USB Interlocking: If you pay close attention to the interlocking, you will notice that the original micro-USB interlocks are consistently placed, are trapezoid in shape, and have an equal distance. Whereas, on the fake USB cable, the micro-USB interlocks are inconsistently located and are square in shape. (As you can see in the picture below). </p>
<p> 9. USB Symbol Imprint on the Micro-USB Connector: The USB symbol imprinted on the micro-USB connector body have variation. As you can see in the picture above. The original USB cable’s connector has a light colored laser-imprinted symbol whereas the fake one has darker colored USB symbol. </p>
<p> 10. USB Connector: As you can see in the picture below, the surface of the original USB connector shell has a small dent. Whereas, the USB connector shell on the fake USB cable has a flat surface. </p>
<p> 11. USB Symbol Imprint on the USB Connector: As mentioned in the difference no. 9 above, the USB connector end also has a slight variation in the USB symbol imprint color. You can see the difference between the two in the above picture. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> In the conclusion, we would say that the differences that have been mentioned in this article are hard to identify if you don’t have an original product or accessory with you to compare and differentiate between the two. And as already mentioned in the beginning, using a counterfeit or fake charger with your smartphone could damage it over time, if not immediately. So we will recommend you to use genuine products and accessories only. </p>
<p> What’s your experience with buying a new charger or USB cable for your Samsung smartphone? Have you found any more differences between the original and fake ones? Share with us in the comments section below. 🙂 </p>

<p> How To Use Fly GPS To Fake/Spoof GPS Location In Pokémon GO </p>
<p> Since after the release of Pokémon Go, there have been more than hundreds of tools and apps that let you </p>
<p> Since after the release of Pokémon Go, there have been more than hundreds of tools and apps that let you hack, modify, or cheat in the game. But the people over at Niantic have been very strict to keep the game free from the hackers and cheaters, which is the reason why more than ninety percent of the Pokémon Go hacking tools, techniques, and apps are not working anymore. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, we have managed to find a working method for the Pokémon GO enthusiasts who are in search for a method to fake/spoof GPS location in Pokemon GO Gen 2 so they won’t have to roam around the city in search for the rare Pokémon, and finding PokéStop and gyms. </p>
<p> The app we are going to use here is known as Fly GPS with joystick feature that does not require you to have a rooted Android device. However, it requires Android 6.0 Marshmallow. </p>
<p> The step-by-step guide along with some additional usage tips are as follows: </p>
<p> What Can Fly GPS Do? </p>
<p> Fly GPS app will allow you to set a fake/spoofed GPS location in Pokémon GO so that you can take your character to virtually any location using joystick controller while you are sitting in the comfort of your home. </p>
<p> The location spoofing app will give you an on-screen joystick functionality over the Pokémon GO app so that you can easily navigate/fly your Pokemon character around the area without going back-and-forth between the two apps to change/modify your location. </p>
<p> It is important to note here that the Fly GPS app is working perfectly fine with all the latest versions of the Pokémon GO on Android. If you experience any issue then feel free to ask in the comments section. I will help you out. 🙂 </p>
<p> How To Use Fly GPS To Spoof Location In Pokémon Go? </p>
<p> The Fly GPS app is very easy to use and allows you to quickly spoof location in Pokemon GO. The complete step-by-step guide is as follows: </p>
<p> Step #1 – First you need to have Fly GPS app on your Android device. You can quickly download the latest version from the link given below: </p>
<p> Step #2 – Now, to be able to successfully install Fly GPS on your device, you must need to enable allow Unknown Sources option on your Android device. The steps are simple: </p>
<p> On your Android phone/tablet, go to the “Settings”. </p>
<p> Tap on the “Security” option. </p>
<p> Scroll down a little bit until you find the “Unknown Sources” option, and then put a checkmark to enable it. </p>
<p> Once enabled, you can then proceed to the next step i.e. Step #3. </p>
<p> Step #3 – You can now install Fly GPS by locating the APK file on your device you downloaded earlier in the Step #1. </p>
<p> Step #4 – Once the app has been installed successfully. You will now need to configure your Android device by enabling the Developer Mode, which you can do so by following these steps: </p>
<p> Go to the “Settings”. </p>
<p> Scroll down until you find “About Phone” option, and then tap on it. </p>
<p> Here you will see your device’s “Build Number”, tap on the number about seven times until you see the message that says, “Developer mode has been enabled”. </p>
<p> Once done, please proceed to the Step #5 for further configuration. </p>
<p> Step #5 – Once the developer mode has been enabled on your device, you will need to follow these steps to enable mock locations: </p>
<p> Go to the “Settings”. </p>
<p> Scroll down until you see the “Developer Options” menu, and then tap on it. </p>
<p> Now, scroll down a little bit and look for “Mock location app” option under then “Debugging” section. </p>
<p> Tap on the “Mock location app” option, a popup window will appear, and then you will need to select “Fly GPS”. </p>
<p> That is all you need to do for the Fly GPS configuration. </p>
<p> Step #6 – Now you need to enable the “Location” or “GPS” settings on your device. So head over to the “Settings” and then tap on the “Location”. </p>
<p> Turn on the Location, and then set the GPS/Locating method to “Low Accuracy” or “Only GPS” mode. </p>
<p> Step #7 – Make sure that the “Location History” is turned on. If, in case, that option is turned off then please turn it on. </p>
<p> Step #8 – Launch FLY GPS app on your device. The app will show you your current location on the map, based on your device’s GPS coordinates. </p>
<p> Now, the app will allow you to select a fake/spoofed location for your device. You can do so by simply tapping on any area nearby you. </p>
<p> NOTE: It is important to tap nearby your current location radius because selecting any location that is far away from you will trigger cheating in the servers and you may incur a soft ban from Niantic. You have been warned. </p>
<p> Step #9 – Once the location has been marked on the map, you have to tap on the popup that says, “Please select the menu.” </p>
<p> Step #10 – You will now see a popup menu with three options, you have to select the first one that says, “GPS Service Run”. </p>
<p> Step #11 – Then a second popup menu will appear with three options, you have to tap on the last one that says, “JoyStick Location Mode – (Pokemon)”. </p>
<p> Now, your spoofed GPS location has been successfully configured and the joystick for Pokémon Go has been enabled too. </p>
<p> Step #12 – Launch Pokémon Go app on your device. You will notice that your Pokemon character is at the location you fixed earlier on the Fly GPS app. </p>
<p> Do you know about the hidden Pokemon GO battery saver option? Here’s how you can enable it to prevent unnecessary battery drainage while playing Pokemon. </p>
<p> Moreover, you will notice that there is an over-the-screen joystick on the Pokémon Go game that you can use to move your character in any direction you want. </p>
<p> That is it. You can now easily go to any part of your neighborhood using the joystick, visit nearby gyms, Pokéstops, or search and catch Pokemon. 😀 </p>
<p> Tips To Get The Most Out Of The Fly GPS App </p>
<p> The tips mentioned below will help you get the most out of Fly GPS app without experiencing unexpected soft bans or any other issue while using the fake/spoof location in Pokémon Go. </p>
<p> Tip #1 – In case you are being relocated to your original location, then it has been suggested to turn off Wi-Fi on your device and use your Mobile/Cellular Data instead. </p>
<p> Tip #2 – Never try to teleport or fly far away from your original location in short time-period. Niantic servers keep track of your last location. And in case, you are suddenly relocated to somewhere far away from that original location then the move will be detected and Niantic will impose a soft ban on your account. </p>
<p> You must need to move/spoof your location realistically. Do NOT jump from one city to another within a matter of minutes. Play it safe. Use common sense. Or else, Niantic servers will detect your move and soft ban your account. </p>
<p> Tip #3 – In case, the Pokémon you are trying to catch is running away or fleeing, or the PokéStops are not giving you any item then it means your account has been soft banned. </p>
<p> Don’t panic, here’s what you could do: </p>
<p> Go to any nearby PokéStop and spin the wheel around 30 to 40 times until it again starts to give you items. Or, </p>
<p> You can wait for about 3 to 8 hours for the Niantic to automatically lift the ban from your account. </p>
<p> Tip #4 – If you are still being relocated to your original location (also known as the “rubber band” effect), then here is another solution for you. </p>
<p> We have heard from various sources that wrapping the backside (specifically the GPS/WiFi module area) with 2 to 3 layers of aluminum foil will completely block the GPS signals and stop the app from teleporting you to your original location. </p>
<p> That’s all. We hope that the tutorial helped you with the configuration of Fly GPS app on your Android phone. If you have any questions then let us know in the comments below. Our support team will help you. 🙂 </p>
<p> I am getting the rubberband effect. When I try to block the signal, I get a “Can’t find gps” pop up in the game and it won’t work. If I put on “GPS only” in the location settings, I grt the same error message in game. Ideas? </p>
<p> Hi, there was an issue with fly GPS after some recent updates. Please ask here to get fast replies from expert pokemon geeks. </p>
<p> At Step 11, I only have 2 options; 1) fixed location mode or 2) move location mode. Both options tell me to Enable GPS, which has already been done. Please help </p>
<p> Hi @selenastead:disqus, you will have a hard time using Fly GPS app to fake your location in Pokemon GO due to recent security updates in Android. </p>
<p> The best method is to download GPS JoyStick app and then follow method #3 mentioned here to properly install and configure the app on your Android phone. </p>
<p> This will help you spoof in Pokemon GO without any issue. Also, my personal suggestion is to opt for systemless root method. </p>
<p> Hi @Mohammad Farzon I am like Selena having 2 options only at set 11 but when I hit move location mode I am there in Pokemon Go. </p>
<p> My problem is that in Pokemon Go it said location not found error. </p>
<p> I also can’t and don’t need GPS joystick because I do see me joystick even though the option isn’t there for it. When I did try to download it I was banned from Pokemon. </p>
<p> Hi Daisy B., unfortunately Fly GPS app is no longer receiving any further updates from their developers. In case you are using an old Android device then it might work well but if you are on a newer Android device with latest Android version then I will recommend you to opt for GPS JoyStick because it provides some advanced fake location features (Privacy Mode, Indirect Location Mocking, Disable Location Service) that completely disables your device’s GPS signals to fix the location not found error in Pokemon Go. </p>
<p> And larger number of our readers including me uses GPS JoyStick location spoofing app and never heard from anyone about their account being banned from Pokemon just for installing the app. It is pretty safe. </p>
<p> If you are interested, you can learn more about the app here. </p>
<p> Sallam Muhammad ! I used method#3 but after 1 days my GPS is not working at All. Could you please guide me how I can fix it. I did lots thing to fix it but all in vain. Am really very depressed to take it kindly helpe out </p>
<p> @disqus_DPhL2k8VqH:disqus do you remember Step 17 in Method #3? Where you enabled four options. One of them was “Disable Location Service”. Once this option is enabled, it will disable location service on your device. This is what prevents your Pokemon account from getting banned and stops rubberbanding effect. </p>
<p> To use GPS to play Pokemon GO in a legit way or if you want to use GPS for navigation then you must need to disable the “Disable Location Service” option in the GPS JoyStick app. And then restart your device. GPS should work afterwards. </p>
<p> Hi, I’m using Samsung note 8 and I followed the YouTube video above to download the fly gps app. I managed to get the joystick on pokemon go app but the message ” failed to detect location. (12)” keeps on appearing. I am at my actual location when I use this app…there are no pokestops, Pokemon, seen on the screen except my own avatar. Please advise. Thanks. </p>

<p> FastPokeMap Alternatives For Pokemon GO Gen1+Gen2 [Scanners & Trackers] </p>
<p> Do you know what the FastPokeMap.se tracker is and how you can use it to find and catch 100IV rare </p>
<p> Do you know what the FastPokeMap.se tracker is and how you can use it to find and catch 100IV rare Pokémon? Here we have listed some of the best working FastPokeMap alternatives scanners as well as a complete step-by-step FPM guide to help you find and track rare Pokemon around your neighborhood without walking. 🙂 </p>

The scanner was powerful enough to let anyone find gen1 and gen2 Pokemon in any part of the world for free. Basically, these trackers can help you located exactly where the Pokemon are spawning on the map. </p>
<p> During the beginning of February 2017, Niantic and Nintendo rolled out some new safety and security updates to secure their game servers from these third party scanners as well as issued a C&D (cease-and-desist) order letters against all the third party Pokemon GO scanners and trackers services which apparently forced all of them, including FastPokeMap, to completely shutdown their Pokemon scanner and tracker services. </p>
<p> Here’s what the FastPokeMap’s official Twitter handle tweeted: </p>
<p> That is not the end. There were hundreds, if not thousands, of trackers and scanners that were helping Pokemon GO players in finding Pokemon within their neighborhood. And it seems like Niantic forcefully shutdown the popular ones only. </p>
<p> Now, to help our fellow Pokemon trainers in finding rare and legendary Pokemon, we have found some of the best FastPokeMap alternatives for Pokemon GO and decided to compile an updated list of Pokemon GO trackers and scanners. All of them works flawlessly and will help you find and track Pokemon around your area. It is available below: 😀 </p>
<p> Best FastPokeMap Alternatives for Pokemon GO </p>

<p> 2 – PokeAlert </p>
<p> PokeAlert, as the name itself suggests, gives you notification automatically whenever the app discovers Pokemon around you because the app continues to scan in the background. This will let you catch Pokemon as quickly as possible without rescanning or searching your surrounding area again and again. </p>
<p> PokeAlert APK is an app designed for Android phones and tablet devices to help you personally scan your vicinity for any Pokemon. </p>

<p> The reverse engineers are working hard to find all the loopholes in the Pokemon Go API so that they can keep the Pokémon scanner and tracker websites at a functional state for every Pokemon enthusiast around the world. </p>
<p> What Is FastPokeMap? </p>
<p> FastPokeMap.se is a third party Pokémon Tracker service created by the Pokémon Go enthusiasts in an attempt to help the Pokémon Go users like you to find all the Pokémon hiding nearby your area, without you needing to wander all over the place. </p>
<p> Yes, you read that right. </p>

<p> Did you know? Using this simple and awesome trick available here, you can catch all those Pokemon around your neighborhood from the comfort of your home. Click here to learn how! 😉 </p>
<p> What’s interesting about the FastPokeMap tracker is that it will not only show you the Pokémon position, but it will also give you information about Pokémon’s name, how it looks, and the estimated expiration time. </p>
<p> In a nutshell, FastPokeMap will tell exactly where you will find a Pokémon, which Pokémon you will be catching, and for how long it will be going to stay there. Helping you save your precious time, efforts, and energy that would have otherwise been wasted on randomly wandering around the locality. </p>
<p> Isn’t that amazing? 😀 </p>
<p> How To Use FastPokeMap Alternatives To Scan and Track Pokemon? </p>
<p> In this section, we will teach you how to use FastPokeMap to find, track, and catch Pokemon monsters without wasting your countless number of valuable hours and energy. </p>
<p> It is very easy and simple to use FPM tracker to track and find Pokemon in real-time in any part of the world. </p>
<p> Please follow the steps mentioned below: </p>
<p> NOTE: You can use any device to use the FastPokeMap tracker, including laptop, Android, iOS device, BlackBerry or any other phone with a web browser and an active Internet connection. </p>
<p> Step 1 – On your device, open the web browser and go to the FPM tracker website: https://fastpokemap.se/ </p>
<p> Step 2 – Once the site has been loaded, you will have two possible navigation options i.e.: </p>
<p> Use the search option to manually find and navigate to any location (city or country), or </p>
<p> Use the GPS location tracking option (if your device has the GPS capability). </p>
<p> If you use the ‘location tracking’ option then it will automatically navigate you to your exact location. But in this guide, we would be using the first option i.e. the search box. </p>
<p> Step 3 – We are using the ‘find location’ option in this guide for manual navigation. So we have to tap on the ‘find location’ button, and then enter the city and country name into the search box (as highlighted in the screenshot below). </p>
<p> And then tap on the search button. </p>
<p> Step 4 – Within seconds, FastPokeMap will navigate you to the searched location (see the screenshot). </p>
<p> You are now free to navigate around, Zoom-in or zoom-out on the map. </p>
<p> Step 5 – Once you have found the right location, tap on the map to drop a location marker. This will show you a predefined scan radius where it will begin a thorough Pokemon scanning. </p>
<p> It will take around 10-30 seconds (depending upon the server load) to complete the scanning process. </p>
<p> Step 6 – When the scanning has been completed successfully, the scan button will notify you by changing its color into green for a couple of seconds. And our search found around 11 Pokemon monsters (as highlighted in the screenshot below). </p>
<p> You can now see all the Pokemon found by the FastPokeMap tracker within the scan radius. </p>
<p> Step 7 – Tapping on the bar located at the top-right corner will reveal a list of Pokemon found within our scan area along with their pictures. </p>
<p> Step 8 – Now, open the Pokemon Go app on your phone, go to the location shown in the FastPokeMap, and then catch the Pokemon. </p>
<p> As simple as that. 😉 </p>
<p> Don’t Know How To Read The Map On The FastPokeMap? </p>
<p> For those of you who don’t know how to read the map or find it hard to understand the map being used by the FastPokeMap website then here is what you can do: </p>
<p> You can simply zoom into the Pokemon you are interested in catching and then tap on it. </p>
<p> This will redirect you to the Google Maps where you can switch to the ‘Earth view’ to make it easier for you to find exactly where the Pokemon is located. </p>
<p> Easy-peasy. 😀 </p>

<p> Download Firestarter/AppStarter APK launcher for Amazon Fire TV </p>
<p> Are you annoyed by how the Amazon Fire TV stick has Amazon UI homescreen that shows you all the content </p>
<p> Download APK File </p>
<p> App Details & Guide </p>
<p> Are you annoyed by how the Amazon Fire TV stick has Amazon UI homescreen that shows you all the content related to their own brand and not even allows you to see all the apps installed on your device? Download Firestarter apk (also known as AppStarter for FireTV), which works as an AppDrawer and provides you with much greater control over your device as well as let you easily update Kodi without root. </p>
<p> Amazon has designed the default UI of their Amazon Fire TV stick with a lot of limitations where you cannot modify the homescreen, cannot install a new custom launcher and don’t even let you download apps from unknown sources. </p>
<p> However, by installing the Firestarter apk or AppStarter apk, you can give your Amazon Fire TV a completely new homescreen user interface without rooting your device or voiding the warranty. And you will be able to download and install custom apps and get to see all the apps installed on your FireTV stick using the AppStarter homescreen UI and you will be ready to launch those apps easily as well. </p>
<p> About Firestarter/AppStarter APK </p>
<p> Designed and developed by Sphinx02, Firestarter is an app drawer and Kodi/SMPC updater especially designed for Amazon Fire TV devices so that the users can easily bypass the default FireTV user interface, which is extremely restricted and usually promotes Amazon’s products in an attempt to gain more customer base. </p>
<p> Recently, with the release of version 4.0, the developer decided to rename the app from Firestarter apk to AppStarter apk and changed the package name to de.belu.appstarter. </p>
<p> One of the key benefits of AppStarter is that it does not require you to root your FireTV to change the launcher or home screen. And not rooting means your device’s warranty will remain undamaged while you will get the ability to browse all the apps installed on your Fire TV right from the home screen, ability to download and install apps from unknown sources. </p>
<p> With the AppStarter app, you can install the Kodi and SMPC apps on your Fire TV device as well as keep both of those apps updated all the time in the easiest way possible. </p>
<p> Not only that. The AppStarter apk also has its own way to show device and system information of your Fire TV device, which looks identical to that of Android and includes data like Android version, Hostname, IP Address, Build Version, Uptime, and WiFi Name/SSID. </p>
<p> Features of Firestarter/AppStarter APK </p>
<p> AppStarter is a handy app for Amazon Fire TV users as it comes bundled with a lot of features to enhance the overall working of the device. Those features are: </p>
<p> Apps Organizing – You can freely organize and sort all the apps using a drag and drop functionality or through the Settings button. </p>
<p> Built-in Kodi & SPMC – Gives you the ability to download, install, and update Kodi & SPMC from within the AppStarter interface. </p>
<p> Import & Export Settings – The app allows you to import as well as export the AppStarter settings in case you have multiple Fire TV devices or want to have a backup of your preferences. </p>
<p> View Installed Apps – Shows a list of all the apps installed on your device including the ones installed via adb or sideloaded. </p>
<p> See System Information – You can find all the system and device information about your Fire TV including build version, Android version, WiFi SSID name, total uptime, IP address. </p>
<p> Automatic Update – AppStarter comes with a native automatic updater that keeps the app up-to-date. </p>
<p> No root – You don’t need to gain root access on your Fire TV to install this app. </p>

<p> Fix Common VPN Issues [Troubleshooting Guide] </p>
<p> Fix common VPN issues and connection problems with this quick troubleshooting guide to get it up and running again. Believe it or not, but VPN, also known as Virtual Private Network, has become one of the essential tools to gain unprecedented access to the restricted side of the Internet. </p>
<p> As technology becomes more and more advanced & the further we go into the future, we find ourselves using it in almost every aspect of our lives. </p>
<p> One of the greatest things that made our lives simpler to this day is the Internet. Used for almost every possible purpose you need it for, the Internet provides us with a great deal of information we require in every moment of our day. </p>
<p> Talking about VPN, although the software and accessibility have become a lot more advanced than ever before, there are moments when we fail to access the Internet. Even with the VPN enabled, which can make us go crazy. </p>
<p> We encounter several VPN problems and issues, most of which are easily fixable, but we all need a starting point, don’t we? That is precisely why we have created this troubleshooting guide. </p>
<p> Troubleshoot Guide to Known VPN Issues and Their Solutions </p>
<p> As said above, although VPNs give you great possibilities and options, while making sure you remain anonymous online, they too can have a moment of weakness. Here we have listed some common problems and their solutions to help you troubleshoot the issues. </p>
<p> Known VPN Issues and Problems </p>
<p> Here we have listed some of the commonly known VPN issues that create connection problems and cause intermittent connectivity issues. </p>
<p> Some known issue within the VPN application, </p>
<p> VPN incompatibility with the browser, </p>
<p> Overburdened VPN server, </p>
<p> Failure to reach the location outside the VPN server. </p>
<p> Connection Issues with VPN </p>
<p> We are going to start with the basics. There are moments when VPN fails to connect you to the Internet due to several known reasons and in those cases, you can follow these steps: </p>
<p> Check Account Status – See if your VPN service is still valid and active. And double-check your login credentials. </p>
<p> Check Your Internet Connection – Disconnect/stop your VPN and see if your Internet connection is working directly without a VPN. </p>
<p> See If VPN Servers Are Online – There are instances where specific VPN servers are offline. To check that, try logging into the VPN service provider’s website and look into the status of servers. </p>
<p> Look Into Firewall Settings – Firewall, if not correctly configured, does interfere with VPN all the time because all your outgoing and incoming Internet traffic goes through it. Try to disable it for a while and check if that resolves the issue. </p>
<p> Issues with Establishing Tunnels Connection </p>
<p> There could be an issue with establishing tunnels connection between the VPN client and the VPN server. That happens because of either the IP packet filtering process or the proxy server. </p>
<p> IP Packet Filtering – IP packet filtering prevents the connectivity between the server and tunnel connection from establishing. Your router or the VPN software usually does this filtration process. That can be disabled/configured through TCP/IP settings. </p>
<p> Proxy Servers – Proxy servers, if enabled, makes the network appear as if the tunnel connection is being established and coming through proxy servers rather than the client. That prevents the tunnel connection from forming, which is also known as NAT issue. </p>
<p> The best-recommended method to establish proper tunnel connection is through PPTP, which is a Point To Point Tunnel Protocol. That usually resolves the problem. </p>
<p> Frequent Disconnection Issue with VPN </p>
<p> If your VPN app or software has successfully established a connection but then automatically disconnects after a while, this can become annoying. Not only that but also, this can be a threat to your security as disconnection from the VPN could cause you to reveal your identity accidentally. </p>
<p> Connect To A Different Server – At times, the server you have preferred to connect to could be experiencing downtime or poor connection. That will cause frequent disconnection. The best way to check and resolve this is by connecting to another server to see if the problem persists. </p>
<p> Change DNS Server – Disconnection of VPN is sometimes linked with the DNS server too. For enhanced security and in an attempt to add another layer of privacy, the majority of the VPN service providers give you their DNS services, but oftentimes those cause stability issues. So it is better to use your DNS servers for better connectivity. </p>
<p> Unable to Access Online Streaming Services like Netflix </p>
<p> Many users turn to VPN simply because they want to gain access to online streaming services that are geo-locked by the publishers and content providers. With that being said, not every VPN provider is strong enough to fix these issues. </p>
<p> To resolve this and if you are having issues with VPN inaccessibility and being tracked by advanced tracking methods, then one of the best things to do is to find a VPN app with a more exceptional ability to bypass censorship. </p>
<p> Other Issues That You Might Encounter With VPN </p>
<p> Here are some other issues that you might be encountering with your VPN software and what exactly you can do to fix it: </p>
<p> Switch Servers – If your VPN is constantly sluggish and losing connection, there is a massive chance that the server you are connected to has some issues. To fix this, try connecting to a different server in the same country. Once connected, run a speed test, and you will get an insight into how good the connection is. </p>
<p> Switch Port Numbers – For a connection to be made from your device and a VPN server, you use a particular port connection on your end. It is highly possible that the port is overloaded and thus resulting in a slow connection or causes you not to gain access to blocked websites and streaming services. Changing your port will solve the issue, but if this does not work, then our advice is to contact the VPN customer support for further details since this particular task is not as easy as it seems. </p>
<p> Check Security Programs Installed On Your Device – Since VPN software and apps work closely with the internet connection and the same software is designed to redirect your traffic, so this could be detected as a security threat by antivirus programs. Temporarily shutting off security software and disabling your firewall may improve the connectivity issues. Note that disabling your firewall permanently is not a proper solution, but it may cause some problems with the internet connection. </p>
<p> Test The Workability Of VPN With Local Servers – This is specifically for those who travel and use VPN to gain access to the blocked content. Unfortunately, some countries are “forgetting privacy laws” and thus make it harder for individuals to connect to local servers or blocks access to specific websites. The best solution is to check the connection to the particular server before traveling. </p>
<p> There you have it, guys! We believe by using this quick troubleshooting guide, you should be able to fix some of the known VPN issues that you may encounter on your day-to-day basis. </p>
<p> VPN software exists to make your experience on the Internet safer and securer, so it is always recommended to make sure you choose the right one before venturing out on the web. </p>
<p> So before ending this blog post, here we have a little bit of information about the VPN: </p>
<p> What are VPN and Why Do We Use It? </p>
<p> Virtual Private Network or VPN is an essential tool to be used when it comes to protecting your privacy and guaranteeing your safety online. With its primary function allowing you to have a secure connection to another network over the Internet. </p>
<p> That acts as protection while at the same time, allowing you to gain access to geo-restricted services and websites, and to bypass Internet censorship. VPN also works as a shield to hide your browsing activity from the government or agencies and to maintain anonymity. </p>
<p> You can use a reputable VPN app to: </p>
<p> Encrypt your Internet traffic and protect your privacy from ISP (Internet Service Provider), the government, the website you are visiting, or even by any possible third-party viewers such as hackers while you are on public Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Bypass possible censorship as well as an option to access geo-restricted websites and content with the ability to spoof identity anywhere in the world. </p>
<p> Watch or listen to geographically restricted exclusive content on services like Hulu, Netflix, or other video or music streaming apps. </p>
<p> Protect your privacy and stop yourself from being logged while you are using torrent services. </p>

<p> How to fix Android Phone that keeps Freezing [Tutorial] </p>
<p> Are you experiencing Android phone freezing problems and unexpected apps stopping issues that won’t let you use your phone or </p>
<p> Are you experiencing Android phone freezing problems and unexpected apps stopping issues that won’t let you use your phone or tablet device? And you can’t really figure out how to fix the problem. Don’t worry as you have come to the right place because here we have a complete in-depth step-by-step tutorial to help you troubleshoot, analyze and fix the issue, once and for all. 😉 </p>
<p> I can understand how it feels like when you are trying to use your Android device to make a simple phone call or maybe you have opened a camera to take a picture but your device is stuck and frozen, and it won’t let you do anything. And this situation makes you feel like throwing your device away. </p>
<p> Believe it or not, unexpected freezing of your Android phone, crashing of apps and unresponsiveness are the significant signs that your Android device has some sort of app or software issue and can be fixed all by yourself without taking it to the warranty or service center. </p>
<p> To help fix the freezing, unresponsiveness, and the crashing issue of your Android device, I have compiled a list of seven methods that you have to go through one by one and follow it to troubleshoot your problem and ultimately solve it. </p>
<p> Have you tried restarting your phone? </p>
<p> Please don’t start rolling your eyes after reading this question. If you have ever called an IT support guy, whether you had a problem related to the computer, Internet, or printer; you can expect them to ask you the very first question, “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” </p>
<p> This question is so frequently asked that it has become an IT support catchphrase. And whenever this question is asked then the people start questioning what the IT expert guy is being paid for? Are they lazy? </p>
<p> Sometimes people are so fed up with the issue they are experiencing that they simply say, “Yes, I have already done that,” even when they know they haven’t. But believe it or not, in reality, a simple act of restarting your Android mobile phone mostly fixes a lot of issues. </p>
<p> This leads us to the question: </p>
<p> How restarting a mobile phone is going to fix the freezing issue? </p>
<p> We all use our mobile phones without restarting it for several days or weeks, and during this time period we continuously open and close various apps, sometimes install a new app or two and maybe uninstall some apps. Over a phase of several days, all of these tasks leave a footprint in the memory and storage, which are no longer needed by the system. </p>
<p> This overloads the processor as well as the memory usage, which in turn causes Android phone freezing problems. And the easiest way to clear this unwanted footprint from your mobile phone and fix the freezing issue is to restart the device. </p>
<p> Now, jump over to the next section where I have prepared to a simple guide to help you restart your frozen Android phone… </p>
<p> How to restart Android phone when it is frozen and not responding? </p>
<p> Due to the number of Android phone manufacturers and variation in the models, the steps of rebooting the device vary a lot. However, I have covered almost all the options of hard rebooting your Android device when it is frozen and not responding at all. You can try one method at a time and see if it works for you or not. </p>
<p> The first method – It is performed using just the physical power button located on your device. You have to press and hold the Power button for maybe around 3 seconds, and the menu will appear with the option to Power off and Restart your device. The restart option may only be visible if your device is running latest Android OS version. In case there is no restart option on the screen then just tap the Power off option, and once the device completely shuts down, then you have to press and hold the Power button for around two to six seconds to turn the device back on. </p>
<p> The second method – It is where we perform Hard Restart or Hard Reboot. This method is especially useful in those cases when your Android device is frozen, and the first method of restarting is not working. The procedure is to press and hold the Power button for fifteen to thirty seconds. During this moment, your frozen device should automatically power down and start again. If this method doesn’t work, move onto the next method. </p>
<p> The third method – This is another way to Hard Reboot or Hard Restart your frozen Android device and is recommended in case the previous process didn’t work. Most of the Android devices are pre-programmed to perform a reboot or completely shut down if the user press and hold specific button combination. So the combination you need to try on your device is the Power button and the Volume Down button. And you need to hold both of these buttons for around fifteen to thirty seconds. If this worked, then your device will power down and restart. If not then you can try the next method. </p>
<p> The fourth method – In this method, we will be using another pre-programmed button sequence to perform a Hard Reboot or Hard Restart. Here you will be required to hold two buttons simultaneously, i.e., the Power button and the Volume Up button. You have to press and hold these two buttons for fifteen to thirty seconds. And within this timeframe, your phone should reboot. </p>
<p> In case none of those methods mentioned above worked for you then the last sequence is to press and hold all three buttons, i.e., Power button, Volume Down button, and Volume Up button for about ten to twenty-five seconds. This should force your frozen Android phone to reboot. </p>
<p> However, if the last option didn’t work too then, I will recommend you to head over to the next section where we will guide you on how to remove your phone’s battery to force shutdown your device, then reinsert the battery and turn it back on. </p>
<p> Remove your phone’s battery and reinsert it (only if it is removable) </p>
<p> As you have already read in the heading, removal of your Android phone’s battery is only possible if your phone has a removable battery, otherwise, if your phone has a fixed battery then I will recommend you to skip this section. </p>
<p> Also before proceeding further, please note that the procedure of removing the battery from your Android device should only be performed if you are comfortable with the battery removal. </p>
<p> Even though it is a simple and straightforward procedure to perform and the majority of Android phones that come with a removable battery requires you to remove the battery first if you want to insert a SIM card or a microSD card into your phone. But still, some people are not comfortable doing this all by themselves and requires IT assistance. </p>
<p> How to remove phone’s battery and reinsert it? </p>
<p> Here we are going to guide you on how to remove a battery from your phone in case your phone is frozen, stuck or not responding at all due to some sort of a software glitch. The steps are as follows: </p>
<p> Slide or pop open the back cover of your Android phone. The opening method depends on the type of device you are using so in case you don’t know then I will recommend you to check the manual. </p>
<p> Once you have managed to open the cover, now you need to pop the battery out from the device. </p>
<p> Wait for over ten seconds. </p>
<p> Put the battery back into your phone and then put the back cover on your phone. </p>
<p> Now turn on your phone by pressing and holding the power button for three seconds or until the screen turns on. </p>
<p> That is it. Once your phone boots up, the freezing issue should go away. However, in case it still freezes then I will recommend you to try other solutions mentioned in this tutorial. </p>
<p> Check for any new device software update </p>
<p> If restarting didn’t fix the Android phone unexpectedly freezing issues then there are chances that your phone is lacking new essential updates and bug fixes from the device manufacturer that might fix the annoying freezing problem. </p>
<p> Your phone might start acting up or begin to freeze where there is some sort of a software glitch in the base Android operating system files. And obtaining the latest Android updates and installing it on your mobile phone will bring performance improvements along with security updates and bug fixes. </p>
<p> In most of the cases, automatic software updates are enabled by default on the Android mobile phones and tablet devices, which is preprogrammed to get the most recent updates from the servers and download it onto your device on its own. </p>
<p> How to manually check for the updates on your Android phone? </p>
<p> Though, in case, if the automatic update option is disabled, then there is a manual option to force check for the recent updates on your device manually. The steps to do that are as follows: </p>
<p> Before proceeding, please note that the steps may slightly vary for the Android device you are using. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll down to the end of the settings page, and there you will see the Software update option or the About device option. Tap it. </p>
<p> Tap on Download updates manually. </p>
<p> Using this option will force your device to check whether the most recent software updates are installed on your device or not. If any new update is found, then your device should automatically start downloading it. </p>
<p> Once the update file has been downloaded, the Android system will ask you when to install the update and apply changes. Simply tap the Install now button to begin the installation of latest Android operating system update. But before you instruct your phone to start the installation, it is essential to have your device’s battery about 80 percent charged to avoid an unexpected shutdown during the update process. </p>
<p> Check if your phone has enough free internal storage space </p>
<p> Android operating system not only requires RAM to operate soundly (as you might have heard from a lot of people) but it also needs sufficient free storage space in the internal memory to perform all the tasks promptly without any hiccups. </p>
<p> Let’s suppose if your device has an internal storage space of 32GB and your data has consumed about 90 to 95 percent of this storage then you are going to experience a significant amount of lags as well as phone freezing problems. And this freezing issue will occur even if your Android phone has bigger RAM like somewhere around 8GB of RAM. </p>
<p> Let me explain why this happens: </p>
<p> Android phones installed with the minimal number of apps, let’s say somewhere around 3 to 5 frequently used social media apps like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and Twitter, will require less free storage space. But, as the number of apps installed on your phone starts to increase, then the need for Android for free storage space will grow too. </p>
<p> You may ask, why Android operating system needs free storage space? </p>
<p> If you are an Android user, then you may have heard about the cache cleaning apps, and how a large number of “Android experts” recommends you to frequently clear cache on your Android mobile phones to make it run faster. </p>
<p> Regardless of the harm this process of clearing cache causes to the performance of your Android device, we at BestForAndroid will never recommend you to opt for cache cleaning apps. The reason behind this is the Android operating system uses cached data to speed up the processing speed and decreases the launch time of your frequently used apps. </p>
<p> All of this cache data is stored in your device’s internal storage, and this is why Android needs enough free storage space to function properly. </p>
<p> How do I check how much free space my Android device has? </p>
<p> Here is the tutorial to check the amount of free storage space left on your Android device. Please note that the steps may vary depending on the version of the Android operating system running on your mobile phone. </p>
<p> On your Android device, go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Device maintenance. </p>
<p> Tap on Storage. </p>
<p> Here you can find all the information related to your device storage. </p>
<p> How can I free up storage space on my Android phone? </p>
<p> Please follow the guide below to free up storage space on your Android phone. The following steps may vary depending on the version of the Android operating system running on your mobile phone. </p>
<p> On your Android device, go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Device maintenance. </p>
<p> Tap on Storage. </p>
<p> From here, you can tap any option from the list of documents, images, audio, videos, and apps. </p>
<p> For example, if you want to uninstall unused apps from your device then tap on the apps option, and the list of all the installed apps will appear along with the storage space any particular app is consuming. </p>
<p> To uninstall any unused or unwanted app, tap on the check box next to the app name. </p>
<p> Tap on Uninstall button located at the top-right corner. </p>
<p> Similarly, you can free up storage on your Android phone by removing unused photos, videos, documents, and any other data. </p>
<p> Check for slow or faulty external storage SD card </p>
<p> Android phone manufactures included a great feature in the smartphones and tablet devices, i.e. SD card, which allows users to expand the storage space and store additional media content like photos, videos, movies, and even some apps that won’t usually fit into the phone’s internal storage. </p>
<p> But as I have already discussed in the previous section about how Android operating system is designed to use cache data to speed up the performance of the Android phones, so using an SD card to store your data will force the Android OS to create cache data for all the content stored in the external storage. </p>
<p> Even though this functionality is designed in such a way to makes it easier for the operating system to remember where the files are stored. But this same functionality negatively influences the performance of your phone and causes it to freeze. </p>
<p> This same cache building functionality makes the situation worse in those cases when you have a corrupted file stored in the SD card, and Android media indexer tries to continually generate a cache or thumbnail preview of that media file. This might sometimes cause Android phone freezing problems. </p>
<p> According to a research that was conducted by the NEC Laboratories America on the impact of performance on Android devices due to the SD card: </p>
<p> So as already mentioned in the research conclusion, the usage of SD card directly affects the overall performance of your Android phone. </p>
<p> Moreover, in the market, you are to find some cheap micro SD cards that claim to offer you over 16GB or 32GB of storage and are Class 10. But these flash storage cards will stop working once you store data over 7GB or 8GB. This will cause your Android mobile phone to freeze, give you sluggish read/write speeds, unexpected slowdowns, as well as lags in performance, will occur too. </p>
<p> To overcome this issue, I will recommend you to invest in a better microSD card — specifically those cards that provide a better reading and writing speeds. Also, you need to make sure that you are not moving any frequently used apps, especially those apps that keep running in the background, to your external SD storage. </p>
<p> How to find out if your Android phone’s SD card is slow or faulty? </p>
<p> The best way to find out if your SD card is causing your Android phone to freeze then follow these steps where we eject the SD card external storage through the storage settings option and then analyze the change in the performance of your phone: </p>
<p> On your Android device, go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Device maintenance. </p>
<p> Tap on Storage. </p>
<p> Tap the menu button located at the top-right corner. </p>
<p> Tap on Storage settings. </p>
<p> Now, under the Portable Storage section, you will see your SD card along with the available and utilized storage space. Tap the Eject button. </p>
<p> You will receive a message, SD card unmounted. </p>
<p> You can now try using your Android phone and see if you are still experiencing freezing or slow performance issues. Most probably, the Android phone freezing problem should go away after you have unmounted the SD card from your device. </p>
<p> Try uninstalling apps that you have recently installed </p>
<p> One of the major plus points of having a smartphone that’s running an Android operating system is that you get easy access to millions and millions of free as well as paid apps through the Google Play Store. And in the Play Store, apps are neatly categorized in over 40 diverse categories, and within each category, there are thousands and thousands of apps. </p>
<p> And there are chances that you have installed an app that has issues and is causing your device to become unresponsive and freeze. Don’t know how that is going to happen? Read the next section where I have explained the possibility… </p>
<p> How installing apps could cause Android phone to freeze? </p>
<p> There are times when we are looking for a specific app in the store, for example let’s say an app for embedding GIFs within the WhatsApp or Messenger chats, the search for the term GIF is going to give you thousands of apps, and you decide to handpick about six of them and install it on your phone. </p>
<p> Even though it’s a simple app designed to give easy access to the database of already published GIFs as well as the ability to add a quick search shortcut onto your keyboard. But little do you know about how much is being performed in the backend of the app, how well the developers have designed it, and if all the glitches have been appropriately ironed out before releasing it to the public. </p>
<p> So what going to happen is that after maybe a week out of the six apps you recently installed on your device and trying them out, the problematic app could cause your phone or tablet to freeze unexpectedly. And you won’t be able to figure out what’s causing the issue. </p>
<p> How can I find out if any specific app is causing the issue? </p>
<p> Just like computers, Android devices also have an option that let you boot your device into a safe mode to find and resolve issues related to the apps you have downloaded from the Google Play Store. So please follow the steps below to restart your device into a safe mode: </p>
<p> On your device, press and hold the Power button until the power off menu appears. </p>
<p> Touch and hold the Power off button. </p>
<p> A Safe mode menu will appear that will ask you to tap again to restart your phone in Safe mode. So tap the icon to reboot your phone. </p>
<p> Once your phone boots up in Safe mode, you will see Safe mode mentioned on the bottom of the screen. Now you can analyze and see if you are experiencing any freezing issue. </p>
<p> In case the freezing issue has been resolved in the safe mode then just restart your phone to exit the safe mode. Now that you have figured out the downloaded apps were causing the issue, so what you have to do now is begin uninstalling your recently installed apps, but one at a time. </p>
<p> Once one app has been removed, and then you have to try to check your device for any clue for the non-responsiveness or freezing. </p>
<p> If the issue persists, then uninstall the second recently installed app, and check your device for problems. You have to continue doing this until you find the app that’s causing the problem. </p>
<p> Once you have found out which app was causing your Android phone to freeze, you can then start reinstalling all the other apps that you have removed in the process. </p>
<p> Perform a factory data reset on your phone (Last resort) </p>
<p> As I have already mentioned in the heading, if all the other methods that I have mentioned above failed to fix your Android phone freezing or unresponsiveness issue then the last resort is to factory data reset your phone. </p>
<p> Doing this will bring your device to its original state when you first bought it from the store. All of the personalization will be removed, all the saved data will be erased including photos and videos, and all the apps will be uninstalled too. So it is recommended to create a backup of all your important data before you begin to perform a factory data reset on your phone. </p>
<p> Also, you must have to make sure you remember your Google account details like username and password because all of your contacts, calendar entries, and other relevant data are synced there. And these Google account data will be automatically restored after performing a reset, only after you login to the account on your device. </p>
<p> How can I perform factory data reset on Android? </p>
<p> In case you don’t know, the Android operating system comes with a built-in restore feature that makes it easier for the phone owners to get over the situations like freezing or unresponsiveness by performing a factory data reset. </p>
<p> Before we proceed to the steps to perform factory data resetting on your device, it is important to make you aware that there are two possible methods to reset your phone or tablet, you may need to select the method depending on the situation you are in at the moment. </p>
<p> The first method – This is an ideal method to perform a factory reset on your device as it is the easiest, requires you to have a running Android device and can be performed through the Settings menu. </p>
<p> Here are the steps you need to follow: </p>
<p> Go to Settings and scroll down until you find Backup & Reset and tap it (or maybe you need to look for the General Management option). </p>
<p> Tap on the Reset option. </p>
<p> Tap on the Factory data reset option. </p>
<p> You will get a warning screen where Android will warn you that all of your data will be erased from your phone. Please read the warning properly before proceeding. </p>
<p> Once you are ready, tap the Reset button to begin the factory data reset process. </p>
<p> Since this feature takes your device to its factory state so, this process is going to take some time to complete, depending on the processor speed and RAM of your device. During the process, your phone will reboot automatically. </p>
<p> This should resolve any problem that could have been causing your phone to freeze unexpectedly. </p>
<p> The second method – This is the alternative method to perform a factory reset on your device and can only be performed on the Android device that is completely powered off. This method of factory data reset also known as a hard reset. </p>
<p> Here are the steps to perform a hard reset on your Android phone: </p>
<p> You need to access the Android system recovery by pressing and holding a combination of two physical buttons on your phone, e. Volume Down button and the Power button. </p>
<p> Release the buttons once the Android system recovery starts. </p>
<p> Touch usually doesn’t work in the recovery, and the only way to scroll up and down in the recovery menu is by using the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons. So using the Volume Down button scroll down to the Factory Reset option and then to select this option press the Power </p>
<p> Your device will now start performing the hard reset and should automatically reboot to the Android operating system once the reset process is completed. </p>
<p> Once your device boots, the initial setup screen will appear where you will be asked to enter your details like WiFi password, Google account details, and other relevant information. </p>
<p> When the setup has been completed, all the issues should be resolved, and your Android device will now be free from unexpected freezes and instability issues. </p>

<p> Fix Spotify Web Player Not Working – Easy Ways </p>
<p> We can understand how frustrating it becomes when you are unable to play your favorite music and no matter what </p>
<p> We can understand how frustrating it becomes when you are unable to play your favorite music and no matter what method you had tried, the Spotify Web Player not working issue is not getting fixed. Don’t worry; here we have an ultimate guide on how to fix Spotify Web Player not working problem once and for all so you can start listening to your favorite soundtracks again… </p>
<p> Spotify, perhaps the most popular Web player has become a personal favorite for music lovers from across the world. A major reason for its soaring popularity is because of a plethora of music collection which satisfies every music junkie out there. Add the seamless working of the web player to the experience and you have a fan favorite for the ages. </p>
<p> However, at times, Spotify’s Web player does not work on web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Some of the most common errors include not being able to login or not seeing any response after clicking the “play button”. To better understand and solve this, in this blog post we’ve highlighted some of the main issues that are responsible for Spotify Web player not working and how to fix them. </p>
<p> 1. Spotify Web Player not working due to web browser issues </p>
<p> The Spotify Web Player sometimes fails to work due to issues related to the web browser. It could be because of poor caching and/or browser failing to support the required technologies by the Spotify web player itself, which is usually the case of lack of support by Spotify or the browser being outdated. </p>
<p> Below are the solutions to the common issues with the web browser that can help you resolve most of the problems that you are experiencing with the Spotify web player not working: </p>
<p> a. Issues with Web Browser Cookies and Cache </p>
<p> Web browsers are designed in such a way that they store some data (like cookies and cache) for the better performance of the website if you plan to visit that specific website again. This is a very common practice widely accepted by almost all browsers. </p>
<p> The problem with this is that with regular caching the browser can accumulate a huge amount of data that is not useful in the long run and can negatively affect the overall performance of the browser. There is a possibility that you might be facing this issue. </p>
<p> Luckily, the solution is fairly simple. We will be explaining it for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome: </p>
<p> Clearing Cookies, Site Data, and Cache on Mozilla Firefox </p>
<p> Here is how you can clear cookies, site data, and cache on Mozilla Firefox web browser: </p>
<p> Open Firefox web browser on your computer. </p>
<p> Click on the hamburger menu located below the close button. </p>
<p> Open options. </p>
<p> Click on Privacy and Security. </p>
<p> Here you will find a section for Cookies and Site Data, simply click on Clear Data. </p>
<p> This will clear all the cookies, site data, and cache from your Firefox web browser, which should fix the Spotify Web Player not working issues. </p>
<p> Clearing Cookies, Cache, and Site Date on Google Chrome </p>
<p> Here we will guide you on how to clear cookies, cache, and site data on Google Chrome web browser: </p>
<p> Open Chrome browser. </p>
<p> At the top right corner, click More Settings. </p>
<p> At the bottom, click Advanced. </p>
<p> Under the Privacy and Security section, click Site Settings. </p>
<p> Select all cookies and site data and click on Remove all. </p>
<p> Confirm cleaning of site data, cache, and cookies by clicking on Clear All. </p>
<p> You can now go ahead and retry using the Spotify Web Player and see if it works. </p>
<p> b. Use another web browser or try switching user-agent on existing browser </p>
<p> Try using any other web browser because there is a possibility that the browser you are using is not supported by the Spotify Web Player. Although Spotify supports a large number of browsers if you are using some unknown browser then you should consider using one of the popular web browsers. </p>
<p> If this fixes the Spotify Web Player not working issue, there is a chance that you can fix it in your own existing browser by changing the user agent. To change user-agent, you will need to go into developer settings of the browser, which is not usually the most convenient thing to perform on your own. Moreover, to make the while switching user-agent thing easier, you can make use of the web browser extensions (like user-agent switcher for Google Chrome or user agent switcher for Mozilla Firefox). </p>
<p> c. Outdated web browser </p>
<p> Another reason for the Spotify Web Player not working might have been due to the outdated version of web browser you are using. In which case the resolution of the problem is fairly simple, you just need to follow these three steps: </p>
<p> Open the official website of the browser you are using. </p>
<p> Download the latest version available for your variant of browser. </p>
<p> Install the latest version. </p>
<p> That should fix the issue. You can now retry using the Spotify player. </p>
<p> 2. AdBlocker could interfere with Spotify Web player </p>
<p> Adblockers these days are getting more and more strict and harder to maintain since it’s getting increasingly difficult to block trackers and data collecting scripts placed on the websites. Even though those trackers are good and are designed to help webmasters with analyzing and improving their website but these increased constraints have led to a number of false alarms. </p>
<p> So perhaps you may want to try disabling the ad blocker and try using the Spotify Web Player. If this fixes the issue and the player starts working normally, you should consider adding all the links related to Spotify in the whitelist of your ad blocker. You can do this from the settings option of your ad blocker. This will stop ad blocker from running on those pages specifically. </p>
<p> 3. Enable Protected Content </p>
<p> If you are a Google Chrome web browser user then this solution applies to you. Otherwise, please skip this. </p>
<p> For additional security, Chrome has a setting that can block protected content to be played on the browser, this setting is by default set to ‘true’. If for some reason you think it might have been disabled you can check it real quick and enable it. </p>
<p> Simply follow these steps: </p>
<p> Type “chrome://settings/content” in your address bar and hit enter. </p>
<p> This will open a Settings </p>
<p> Look for the Protected Content section, once found click on it. From here you can change the option to true. </p>
<p> Now you can try playing your favorite music on the Spotify Web Player and see if it works or not. </p>
<p> 4. Internet connectivity issue </p>
<p> Spotify falls in the category of media streaming, consequently, it requires a stable internet connection in order to work seamlessly. To diagnose if your internet is working properly or not, you should consider trying other websites and see if they are working or not. If they aren’t then the culprit is your internet connection. </p>
<p> 5. Flushing DNS cache on your computer </p>
<p> Flush DNS Cache is sort of equivalent to clearing the cache of the web browser but it is more related to the internet connectivity aspect. Flushing the DNS cache might cause some issues with the Internet connection, in rare cases, but it is worth a try. And the method is fairly simple too. </p>
<p> For Windows </p>
<p> On your computer, click the Start button. </p>
<p> Type “cmd” and open the Command Prompt window with administrative privileges. </p>
<p> Within the command prompt window, type the following command: “ipconfig /flushdns” and hit the enter key on the keyboard. </p>
<p> That’s how simple it is. </p>
<p> 6. Spotify account issue </p>
<p> Spotify is strict when it comes to using a single account on multiple devices so scenarios like this can lead to arise of problems. One of them being the permission of having only one device allowed per account or one location allowed per user. </p>
<p> It is possible that you have already logged into the Spotify Android app and using the music streaming service there which could have been causing the issue. </p>
<p> If you are using Spotify for the first time and it is still not working then the issue might be that it is not available in your country. You can overcome this issue by using a good VPN service however we recommend to use a VPN with which you can connect from the same geo-location every time to avoid banning or unexpected issues. Otherwise, you might face difficulty whenever you log in to your account next time. </p>
<p> 7. Spotify already active on another device </p>
<p> If you are using Spotify on two different devices and trying to use both devices at the same time but your subscription only supports one device at a time then we believe that this might have been an issue that Spotify is still considering the last used device as an active device. And they are not allowing you to listen to music on your web browser. </p>
<p> To fix this issue, you don’t have to logout from other devices. There is an easier way out of this, just follow these steps: </p>
<p> Grab the mobile device where you were using Spotify. </p>
<p> Open Spotify and go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Devices and there select Web Player. </p>
<p> Doing this will force the Spotify web player to start working again. Moreover, if you are interested in Spotify Premium then you can follow our 100% working guide here to get Spotify Premium on Android for free without paying a single cent. 😉 </p>
<p> 8. Spotify logging out or failing to login </p>
<p> If you are using Spotify through the VPN then this solution is for you, otherwise, jump to the next one. This also applies to people who are traveling abroad. </p>
<p> There is an important catch when you are using VPN on Spotify, you not only need to be on supported geolocation when streaming media but it is sometimes very important that you log in from the same geo-location from where you first created the account. </p>
<p> So, it is highly recommended to use a good paid or free VPN service that gives you a freedom to select the same location whenever you want to use Spotify Web Player on your computer’s web browser so that you don’t lose access to your account. </p>
<p> 9. Other Resolutions For Spotify Web Player Issues </p>
<p> If the issue was resolved but it keeps coming back then you might just want to refresh the page. In case if it occurs frequently, simply copy the link of the song/soundtrack you are trying to play. Open a new window or tab on the web browser and paste the URL then press Enter key. This has been reported to solve the issue for some users. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Spotify is available as a standalone desktop app for Windows, Mac, Linux as well as the mobile app for iOS and Android. With a wide variety of options to enjoy and stream music, majority of users still opt for web player reason being it is the most convenient option out of all as you don’t need to install any additional app or package. All you really need is a web browser. </p>
<p> But with the web browser, there are some issues that arise that makes it a bit tricky to stream music, however, with the solutions we have provided above you should be able to enjoy streaming music on Spotify Web Player without any problem. Let us know which option worked for you in the comments below. </p>

<p> Q4: Fly GPS not working on Android 7.0 and 7.1 Nougat. </p>
<p> Recently, Fly GPS seems to have some compatibility issues with the latest versions of Android Nougat including: </p>
<p> Android 7.0, </p>
<p> Android 7.1, </p>
<p> Android 7.1.1, </p>
<p> Android 7.1.2, and above. </p>
<p> Many of our blog readers have had a great success with alternative spoofing app i.e. Fake GPS GO Joystick. You can download it here and see if it works for you. </p>
<p> Q5: Pokemon GO shows no GPS detected red bar. </p>
<p> Q6: How can I avoid soft ban and hard ban? </p>
<p> The best possible way to avoid any possible soft ban in Pokemon GO while using location hack is to use the joystick controls wisely and slowly move your character around because Niantic servers keep a constant track of your last location. </p>
<p> Here is an example: </p>
<p> In case you suddenly travel your character using joystick from point A to point B in a couple of seconds, the same amount of distance that usually requires five to ten minutes to cover then your account will be soft banned. </p>
<p> So I will suggest you to use location hacking apps wisely to protect your account from any type of bans. </p>
<p> Q7: Fly GPS teleports me back to my original location. </p>
<p> In Pokemon GO hacking terms, this issue is known as ‘rubber banding’ where your Pokemon trainer will randomly jump between your real location and fake location on its own. Few working fixes have already been discussed on our forum here. </p>

<p> Best Joystick GPS Apps to Spoof in Pokemon Go </p>
<p> The apps we have tested at BestForAndroid HQs are featured below. We found out that all of these methods are working flawlessly on Pokemon GO for Android. </p>
<p> 1 – Fake GPS Location – GPS JoyStick by The App Ninjas </p>
<p> GPS JoyStick Fake GPS location app is specially designed for those Pokémon Go users who are looking for a method to mock their location using an overlay joystick controller. </p>
<p> What’s unique in the GPS JoyStick app is that it provides you with ultimate location option flexibility, which means you can use three different location hack options. Each one of them can be configured according to your requirements. </p>
<p> Those settings are: </p>
<p> Manual Location – Set mock location manually using either latitude & longitude coordinates, or using the search function, </p>
<p> Current Location – Use your current location that can be detected automatically via your device’s GPS, </p>
<p> Last Location – Use the previously saved location where you closed the app. </p>
<p> And there are more exciting features, i.e., you can select up to three different speed settings as well as an automated option that automatically walks your Pokémon GO character to the assigned location at your customized pace. </p>
<p> Do you know about the hidden Pokemon GO battery saver option? You can follow our guide on how to enable it to prevent unnecessary battery drainage while playing Pokemon on Android. </p>
<p> 2 – Fake GPS Joystick & Routes Go by IncorporateApps </p>
<p> First things first, Fake GPS Joystick & Routes is not a free location spoofing app for Pokemon Go. It will cost you an onetime fee of $3.99. </p>
<p> The app works flawlessly without any problem and provides several advanced features as well as operational modes, including a joystick for smooth manual flying movement, automated movement around any specified radius, and the ability to customize speeds and update intervals. </p>
<p> There are a couple of features targeted explicitly towards Pokémon Go users, including expert mode and better spoofing abilities. </p>
<p> Apart from that, the app is capable of keeping track of your location history and allows you to add custom locations to your favorites list for quick access whenever you want. </p>
<p> 3 – Fly GPS for Pokémon GO </p>
<p> Fly GPS is one of the oldest and free Pokémon Go spoof location app that has been around for quite a while now and is being used by a large number of spoofers without any issue. That is precisely what makes it one of the most trusted PoGo location spoofing app for Android. </p>
<p> The significant advantage of Fly GPS is that it gives you an on-screen joystick that is accessible even while you are playing Pokémon Go, using which you can: </p>
<p> Easily navigate your character around the area, </p>
<p> Catch all the nearby Pokémon, </p>
<p> Visit PokéStop to collect items, and </p>
<p> Go to the gyms around the city. </p>
<p> You can do all of that from the comfort of your home without ever leaving your comfortable couch/bed. </p>
<p> Apart from the ease of controlling your character with a joystick, there are numerous other features, including location search, option to add favorite location, recent search history. All of which makes it easy for you to take your character to any part of the world and catch rare/legendary Pokemon. </p>
<p> In case you don’t know, we have a complete step-by-step guide on how to install and configure Fly GPS on Android to spoof location in Pokemon GO with a joystick. </p>
<p> 4 – TutuApp for Pokémon Go </p>
<p> TutuApp for Pokémon Go is known as the easiest method to spoof location on Android as the developer of the app provides a slightly modified version of Pokémon GO by incorporating a native joystick and location spoofing abilities. </p>
<p> But the problem is that the newer releases of the Pokémon Go are a lot harder to modify as compared to the older version due to which the TutuApp version is no longer working with Android. </p>
<p> We have found out that the developers over at the TutuApp have been unable to release a modified version of the latest Pokémon Go for Android. Moreover, the app being provided by TutuApp is just a mirrored APK of the original Pokémon GO app that is already available on the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> If you still want to try your luck with TutuApp for Pokemon, then you can download the hacking app for free from here. </p>
<p> Known Issues Of Pokémon GO Location Spoofing </p>
<p> Rubber Banding Problem Fix </p>
<p> The rubber-banding problem occurs when you are navigating around the spoofed location using Pokemon Go joystick app, and suddenly your character is teleported back to your real location. And the cause of this sudden teleportation is the real GPS data are overriding the fake GPS data. </p>
<p> The rubber banding effect, if happened several times, is known to cause soft bans. And when you are soft banned, the Pokémon you try to catch will flee. Moreover, spinning PokéStop will not give you any item. </p>
<p> Do you know, you can now catch ultra-rare and legendary Pokemon effortlessly without moving away from your couch? Here’s how you can do that with Pokesnipers! 😉 </p>
<p> How To Fix Rubberbanding Problem? </p>
<p> There are three ways to fix Pokemon GO rubber band problem while spoofing location: </p>
<p> Set your Android phone location accuracy option to the only GPS (never use high accuracy), </p>
<p> Try to be in an area where there is no GPS signal (basement or room without windows should do the trick), </p>
<p> Wrap the backside of your phone in 2 to 4 layers of tin foil to block GPS signals from reaching your phone. </p>
<p> How To Fix Soft Ban? </p>
<p> In case your account is soft banned because of the rubberband effect, there are two possible ways to remove the soft ban: </p>
<p> One is to wait for 2 to 6 hours, and the other one is to follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Open the Poké Stop, </p>
<p> Spin the circle, </p>
<p> Close the Poké Stop. </p>
<p> Rinse and repeat those three steps for about 40 times or until the PokeStop starts giving you items. That should help you remove the ban from your Pokémon Go account fast within 5 minutes. </p>
<p> What are your thoughts about the mentioned location spoofing apps? Did any GPS joystick hack help you to spoof your location? Or maybe you already know about an app that works for you. Let us know in the comments below. 🙂 </p>
<p> thanks for this helpful post for me and all tutuapp user’s. this is a best platform for all who want tutuapp helper apk file. regard. </p>
<p> Yeah. Niantic always try to stop these things, but don’t worry next update of Fly GPS will solve this. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, the current version of Fly GPS and GPS JoyStick no longer works after the latest Android update. But we have found an app that works even after the Android update. The latest working method is available here: https://bestforandroid.com/location-gps-signal-error-pokemon-go/ </p>
<p> If somethings works don’t post it online the developer gonna see and stop all the hack just help them by not posting so developer will not know and and you can hack forever dumb people alway posting and making the hack go away sad </p>
<p> You will need to root your phone because “mock locations” option no longer works. </p>
<p> Yes, location spoofing and GPS hacks are still working. You can use Fly GPS, Fake GPS GO, GPS JoyStick. Apart from the TutuApp, all of them works. But you must need to move the GPS spoofing app to the Android system directory to be able to fake your location in Pokemon GO, and that requires you to first root your device. </p>
<p> Can’t detect the location with Fly GPS . the built-in security of the game is working against location hacks. </p>
<p> flygps is not working with my android device, is the latest version 5.0.9? shows me “failed to detect location. (12)” after opening the game on move location mode </p>
<p> I am rooted with Fake GPS Route already in my system files. But can’t play because I am rooted. So I have to unroot my device and keep the Fake GPS route in the systems folder to play? </p>

<p> About Fortnite APK </p>
<p> Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games. It was introduced in 2017, and since then it has gained a lot of popularity in the gaming community among all the gamers from platforms including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, IOS, and Android. </p>
<p> The people who wanted to enjoy playing this game on their phones were waiting for epic games to launch this game for Android and they finally did. The people who couldn’t afford an expensive PC can now enjoy Fortnite on their Android smartphones. They have to check if their Android phones are compatible for downloading Fortnite and download the game. </p>
<p> It is a PVP Player-Vs-Player based game consisting of two different game modes namely, save the world and Battle Royale. </p>
<p> Fortnite: Save the world, is a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to 4 players as a squad to fight zombies like husks and protect their objects from them. You and your three other friends will be the only one in the whole world, as all other 98% of the population of the world disappeared after a storm appeared across the earth. </p>
<p> You’ll have to complete all the missions and tasks. In reward, you’ll get some in-game items which include, hero characters, survivors, weapons, and traps. All of these things can also be leveled up to get their attributes enhanced after you gain more experience in the game. </p>
<p> Fortnite: Battle Royale, is a free-to-play battle royale where up to 100 players land into the map as solo, duo or squads, with only their pickaxes, from a battle bus that starts from one end of the map and stops at another end of the map giving you time to land at your desired location. </p>
<p> You can tap on the map and add a pointer to be sure that you land at your exact location. When you want to jump from the battle bus, you’ll have to tap the jump button, and then you can glide from the sky to your desired location and land on the ground. You’ll have to look through chests and floor loot for guns, ammo, and shields while looking out for enemies near you. </p>
<p> You can even build your base or small huts to protect yourself from enemies. But to do that, you’ll have to farm materials with your pickaxe. There are three kinds of materials that you can carry: wood, brick, and metal which you can get by breaking trees, brick structures, and cars or buses respectively. </p>
<p> All of these materials have their advantages and disadvantages. A wooden structure is the quickest to complete, but it is the weakest from all of them. The brick structure takes a bit more time to complete, but it is stronger than the wooden structure and takes more hits to break while the metal structure takes the longest to complete but is the strongest from all of them and requires much more hits to break. </p>
<p> By going into build mode, you can build walls, ramps, floors, pyramids and place traps. You can also edit these builds by tapping the edit button, and you can edit your walls with a window or a door or both. Edit your ramp to be a single full-size ramp, one-sided stairs or even swirly stairs. You can change the directions of the ramps as well. </p>
<p> After you’ve gathered all of your materials and weapons or even when you are halfway through, you might encounter an enemy. So if he is on a building or a high place, you can build some stairs to that person, and if he is close to you, you can use your shotgun to shoot him. </p>
<p> There are also different game modes in which you can play. These modes include solo, duo, squad, playground and some more different modes that change after every short period. </p>
<p> As the match progresses, there are air-drops that land at different places of the map which give you some shields and an epic or a legendary weapon. There are also some llamas that have been added to the game a while ago. There are only three llamas in a single match, placed at different locations of the map in different matches of the game, and they give you 600 materials (200 materials of every category), some damage traps, shields, and some grenades. </p>
<p> Note: llamas do not give you weapons. </p>
<p> As time goes by, there is a storm that starts coming toward the middle of the map, shown by a pink or red colored circle and it is going to stop at the white outline. Any player left inside the storm is going to take health storm damage and is going to die if he stays there for much longer. The storm damage also increases as the game passes by. Starting from 1 ticker (1 health damage per second) to a 10 ticker. </p>
<p> The storm forces the players to go towards the center and as a result, encouraging more player encounter. </p>
<p> Coming back to the main menu, you can also buy V-Bucks from the in-game store. V-Bucks are a kind of in-game currency for buying skins, emotes, pickaxes and even gliders. The in-game shop is also updated every 24 hours with new things added in every day. </p>
<p> You can also buy a Battle Pass using V-Bucks, which allows you to get some skins and stuff at the start of the season and also get more stuff as you play and complete more and more challenges and go up tears. </p>
<p> The game is also updated every week, and new stuff gets added into the game to make it more interesting. There are also seasons that get updated after every two or three months, and they bring some more new things into the game as well. </p>
<p> Epic games have also told us that they are going to allow some devices to be connected with your Android smartphone to make playing Fortnite easier, like keyboard, mouse or even Xbox or PS4 controller. </p>
<p> It is the most trending game in the world right now which is available for Android smartphones. Download the game with the link given below, get in and try to get that Victory Royale. </p>

<p> Fortnite Tips, Tricks, Strategies, and Hacks for Android </p>
<p> Fortnite for Android is a highly popular strategy based game among online video game players even though the game is </p>
<p> Fortnite for Android is a highly popular strategy based game among online video game players even though the game is still under a beta phase. Here we are going to share with you all the Fortnite tips, tricks, and hacks for Android devices to help you win most, if not all, of the Battle Royale games because we all know how complicated it really is to perform all the tasks on a touchscreen. </p>
<p> Fortnite for Android is designed and developed by Epic Games and is an online multiplayer game for a variety of platforms including Windows, Mac OS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game has two core modes, i.e., Fortnite: Battle Royale and Fortnite: Save The World, but since we are talking about mobile devices here, only the Fortnite Battle Royale gaming mode has been released for mobile platforms like Android and iOS. </p>
<p> Even though it’s still under a beta phase for mobile platforms but the game has received an overwhelming response from the players all around the world, and it has become the most widely played online game. The Fortnite Battle Royale is a free-to-play game and offers its players an in-app purchases option through which players can buy cosmetic items to modify their characters further. </p>
<p> We can understand that winning matches on mobile devices requires you to develop certain skills on the touchscreen and get a proper hold onto a smaller screen because there is no official support for external mouse, keyboard, or controller. So to help you out, here in this article, we are going to share with you all the Fortnite Battle Royale tips, tricks, and strategies for Android that you can master and use during the battle to ultimately win a Victory Royale while playing on the mobile devices. </p>
<p> But first, we will talk a bit about the basics of Fortnite and discuss how the game works. </p>
<p> Basics of Fortnite Battle Royale Android </p>
<p> For those of you who don’t know, battle royale (also known as battle royal) is a game category where all the players are dropped in a large map. Each player then has to explore the area, search for the essentials and weapons, and survive the battle by eliminating all other opponents while at the same time have to make sure they don’t get trapped outside the shrinking safe zone. In short, the last player/team member standing will win a Victory Royale. </p>
<p> Similarly, in the Fortnite Battle Royale, over 100 players enter a large map from the floating Battle Bus and skydive onto different landmarks or point of interests (like Tilted Tower, Salty Spring, Pleasant Park, Retail Row, Paradise Palms) without any weapon. Players can find random weapons, shields, ammo boxes, and supply drops as well as harvest materials by destroying things using a pickaxe. Harvested materials can then be used to build structures like walls, floors, stairs, and roofs. </p>
<p> Once you have gathered items, then your goal is to be the last team or player alive by eliminating other team or players from the game. The players can loot conquered opponent for items, weapons, and equipment. To make the battle more intense, the storm eye (safe zone) shrinks in size and any player left outside the storm eye will see a constant decrease in their health. This forces the surviving players to move into tighter spaces, and in-turn forces encounter between players. </p>
<p> Tips, Tricks, and Strategies for Winning in Fortnite Battle Royale on Android </p>
<p> Here in this section, we are going to discuss all the strategies, tricks, and tips for winning in the Fortnite Battle Royale on Android and you can use some of these, if not all, to survive in the battle for as long as possible. These tricks and strategies will help you get better at Fortnite no matter if you are an expert or a beginner. </p>
<p> 1. Technique To Fire Your Weapon </p>
<p> As soon as you launch Fortnite and signup/sign-in for the first time on your Android device, the very first thing the game is going to ask you will be the way you want to fire your weapon. Those options are: </p>
<p> Auto Fire – Weapon starts firing automatically when you aim at the enemy. </p>
<p> Tap Anywhere – Fire weapon by tapping anywhere on the screen. </p>
<p> Dedicated Button – Fire weapon when you tap the dedicated on-screen fire button. </p>
<p> Custom – This method will let you enable all three firing options. </p>
<p> You just need to select one from the provided options. You will find out that the game recommends the auto weapon firing option because as a beginner you may find the auto fire option a lot more suitable as you need to control many other aspects too using the on-screen virtual buttons. But you can try each one of the provided weapon shooting option and select the best method that suits your playing style. </p>
<p> If, in any case, you changed your mind and wanted to select any other fire method then just follow these steps: </p>
<p> Go to the options menu, </p>
<p> Tap the HUD Layout Tool button, and then </p>
<p> Tap the Change Fire Mode option. </p>
<p> You will enter the same fire mode selection screen and then you can choose the firing method you like. </p>
<p> 2. The Objective Is To Survive The Battle </p>
<p> Unlike other shooting game titles, the core objective in the Fortnite Battle Royale game is to survive the battle by playing strategically, eliminating opponents, and ultimately winning a Victory Royale. </p>
<p> So it does not matter if you are unable to fight or kill each of your opponent you encounter. It is completely passable to run away if you are almost running out of ammo or health because to be able to survive the battle you have to make sure that you have all the required materials and weapons to kill the opponent. </p>
<p> Remember, you need to make a strategy and be prepared with all the required materials, weapons, and ammunition so that you can take down the opposing team without losing a lot of your health because the one who survives the longest will ultimately win the battle. </p>
<p> 3. Make Use Of On-Screen Sound Indicators And Headphones For An Edge </p>
<p> Unlike other action games, your chance of surviving in Fortnite battle royale for longer heavily depends on your ability to hear sounds and noises while you are navigating around the virtual map. </p>
<p> Since we are on Android, so we have an additional advantage, i.e. on-screen sound indicators, which indicates you from where exactly the sound is coming from. This way you will be able to find out if any enemy is running nearby, there is a chest somewhere near you, or there is gunfire. You will be able to figure out their proximity even if you are not wearing your headphones. </p>
<p> Furthermore, there are several different on-screen sound indicators because of the different sounds generated during the gameplay. Like firing, someone’s walking nearby you, the appearance of the chest, storm eye shrinking, supply drops, vehicle, quad crasher, or ATK (All Terrain Kart). </p>
<p> 4. Learn, Practice, And Master The Virtual Controls </p>
<p> The fundamental difference between the mobile version and PC/console version of Fortnite Battle Royale is the controls. On mobile, you will have virtual buttons right on the touchscreen through which you need to perform all the tasks including building and battling. And unfortunately, there are no shortcuts nor are you allowed to use any external gaming controller. </p>
<p> On mobile, you need to remember the exact location of the controls and virtual buttons so you can easily hit them precisely without even looking at them. </p>
<p> 5. Adjust Touch Sensitivity According To Your Personal Preference </p>
<p> We will recommend you to spend some time playing around with the touch sensitivity. There are not one but three different settings for touch sensitivity, which includes: </p>
<p> Touch Sensitivity – This one will adjust the touch sensitivity for camera controls. </p>
<p> Touch Targeting Sensitivity – Allows you to adjust touch sensitivity when you are targeting. </p>
<p> Touch Scope Sensitivity – Sensitivity of touch when you are using a weapon’s scope. </p>
<p> Vertical Sensitivity Multiplier – Sensitivity multiplier for touch input. </p>
<p> The whole game depends on how fast you can swivel the camera to search for your enemies and your ability to keep the camera as well as your weapon focused on your enemy. So touch sensitivity plays an important role here. And it will take several attempts to find the right setting for you. </p>
<p> 6. Keeping Yourself Healed And Protected </p>
<p> The nature of the game is survival, which means you need to actively look around the virtual world in the game for health packs, medical kits, shield, and fruits to maintain your health and keep yourself protected through shield. </p>
<p> You can find health packs and shields inside buildings, chests, supply drops, and different areas around the map. There is a handful of items for healing which includes: </p>
<p> Apart from those, there are some limited time healing and shielding items added to the game occasionally. </p>
<p> 7. Gathering Resources And Materials </p>
<p> Have you ever played the popular game Minecraft where players interact with the virtual world by breaking blocks and then build creative structures with those blocks? A similar feature is added in Fortnite too where you can use the Pickaxe to break and harvest objects and items like trees, furniture, walls, stone, buildings, vehicles, machinery, and other objects. </p>
<p> Depending on what object you are harvesting, the game will give you metal, wood, and brick. The amount of relevant resources you are going to receive depends on the object you are destroying. </p>
<p> But whenever you are destroying stuff, you just need to take precautionary measures, as using Pickaxe to harvest anything in the game will cause noise, which can easily be heard by the nearby enemies and will aware them of your presence. </p>
<p> 8. Practice Proper Use Of The Build Mode </p>
<p> The mobile version of the Fortnite Battle Royale is slightly harder to control because of the lack of space on the screen. The reason is there are two modes, i.e. shoot mode and build mode. And both of these modes are quite self-explanatory. However, there is a dedicated on-screen button to switch between modes. </p>
<p> Once you are in the build mode, you will see several building options, which includes building floors, walls, roofs, and staircase. And you need to select whichever thing you want to build and then start building. There are no shortcut buttons for these, so you have to be quick with the building process when you are trying to protect yourself from the enemies or when you are trying to escape from the enemies. </p>
<p> Learning how to build structures quickly while being able to tackle your enemies is the essential aspect of the game. And mastering it will help you survive in the game for longer. </p>
<p> 9. Smart Usage Of The Auto-Run Feature </p>
<p> Fortnite is the game where you have to explore a lot to discover items, weapons, traps, chests, and even ammunition. So exploration is one of the most crucial parts, and you need to be quick and attentive at all times because your enemies can come from almost anywhere. However, since you are using a touchscreen, which means certain parts of the screen will be covered by your thumbs (if that’s what you use for playing the game). </p>
<p> So the developers of the game added a unique feature, i.e. auto-run that helps your character to run in any direction by simply double tapping the directional control. Now your character will continue to move straight, and you can change the direction by simply swiping your screen to left or right. </p>
<p> Download Fortnite for Android </p>
<p> Fortnite for Android is compatible with a wide range of Android devices and support for new devices is added by the game developers on a weekly basis. To download Fortnite APK for Android or if you want to check the compatibility that whether your device is compatible and supported by Fortnite, then you can head over to our dedicated APK section where the app is available for download for free. </p>

<p> Fortnite has already gained its position in the list of top games in the world. It is currently trending among people from all generations on multiple gaming platforms such as PC, Mac, Tablets, and smartphone devices. The company behind this popular game has already received loads of appreciation and awards exclusively for developing this ultimate gaming experience. Here is a very useful and complete guide on everything about Fortnite. </p>
<p> What is Fortnite? </p>
<p> Fortnite has some similarities with the other Battle Royale shooting games. It’s a multi-player shooting game where over 100 players can play at a time. Just like the other games such as Player-Unknown’s Battleground, Fortnite air-drops 100 players to the playing area from a bus attached to an air-balloon. In the case of PUBG, it air-drops players from a moving airplane. </p>
<p> If you are in a survival mode, after reaching the ground, the players can start to fight with other players to survive. The playground shrinks as time progresses, and the players should move into the playground to avoid death. </p>
<p> When landed, you won’t have any weapons with you except a pickaxe on hand. You need to find your required weapons scattered randomly in different locations. Players can grab desired weapons and tools to fight in the game. </p>
<p> Now comes the best part of Fortnite; players can create building materials with the trees, cars, and other materials around the playground. You can build your custom walls, ramps, and other things. This feature is not yet available in most of the Battle Royale games including the most popular PUBG. </p>
<p> What is the Free Pass and Battle Pass? </p>
<p> Fortnite has a very interesting progression system that lets you target for two-game passes, i.e. Free Pass and Battle Pass. </p>
<p> The Free Pass is available in multiple stages. It does not cost you any money, but you can earn it while performing great in the game. It lets you access some funny items, including the custom account icons and emotes. You can grab it by completing the challenges given in the game every season. </p>
<p> Talking about the Battle Pass, it lets you unlock serval premium rewards easily. It gives you some premium cosmetic rewards and experience boosters. However, the Battle Pass is not free as compared to the Free Pass. You will have to purchase it with 950 V-Bucks (premium coins inside the game), which equals $9.50. One pass lasts for a duration of one full season, and you will have to purchase another one once the season ends. </p>
<p> How to play Fortnite? </p>
<p> Just like any other Battle Royale games, Fortnite is also not very easy for a beginner to understand. It takes some time to understand how to play the game at first. However, we are here to help you learn to play Fortnite for a beginner. </p>
<p> The open-world map in the game lets the players fight with other players and the game-controlled characters. You can walk around the map locations to find enemies and kill them. </p>
<p> The game has a multiplayer mode, single-player mode, and co-operative mode. In the single-player mode and the co-operative mode, you can enter the game to fight with the game-controlled characters. The co-operative mode lets you fight with these characters as a group. However, these modes are especially for beginners so that they can understand the game easily. </p>
<p> The multiplayer mode is the most popular game mode in this game as it lets 100 players enter the game at once and fight each other. This is completely an online mode; you will have to be connected to a good internet connection throughout the gameplay. You can enter the game individually or as a squad of 4 players. The last person to survive the battle wins the match. </p>
<p> Players will have to submit the email address to create an account to play. For Xbox One users, an Xbox Live Gold account is required to start, whereas the PS4 users do not require a PlayStation Plus account. Once you have verified the email address, you can start playing with your account. </p>
<p> How many people play Fortnite? </p>
<p> As mentioned above, Fortnite is popular across the globe, with a lot of players on multiple platforms. The total number of active players is still not known, as the company hasn’t revealed any official figures after May 2019. However, the company has announced that they have over 250 million players as of March 2019. </p>
<p> These are the official information from the company after counting the number of registered and verified accounts. Anyways, it is worth pointing out that the total number of accounts includes some inactive accounts too. We don’t have official information on the inactive accounts. Also, it’s been many months after the May announcement, so the number of accounts may have changed now. </p>
<p> As announced by the company, Fortnite had 78.3 million in August 2018. Now the official figure is 250 million according to the May announcement. So, it is a great growth for the company as the best Battle Royale game in the market. We will update this post once the company announces a new figure for the total number of active accounts. </p>
<p> When did Fortnite come out? </p>
<p> If you are enthusiastic about the Fortnite, you will want to know some history of the game. </p>
<p> Epic Games first teased this game in 2011 at the SpikeTV Video Game Awards. The interesting fact is that the company teased the product just three weeks after they created the idea of this game. The company was celebrating its 20th anniversary that year and introduced Fortnite to the global gaming communities. </p>
<p> “Imagine a world where you explore, you scavenge, you build and ultimately you survive” – the company’s statement about the game while revealing. </p>
<p> Cliff Bleszinski, design director at Epic Games, revealed the Fortnite at SpikeTV Video Game awards in 2011. After that, the company started the active development of this game with new features and elements. They opened the registrations for the closed Alpha of the free-to-play Battle Royale game in April 2014. The company started the first round of Fortnite’s Alpha testing in December 2014. The second phase was started in March 2015 with even more testers. </p>
<p> Soon after this, Epic Games announced the compatibility of Fortnite with Mac OS and started the closed beta phase at the end of 2015. After this, many people came to know about the game and shown interest in it. As a result, the company set big ambitions for the game. </p>
<p> On July 21, 2017, the company launched the early access version of the Fortnite for Windows, Mac, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 platforms. The game was available on July 21st for those who pre-ordered the game and July 25th for the rest. The same year, in September, the company launched the Battle Royale as a free-to-play for everyone. </p>
<p> It took around one year for them to launch the game on a mobile platform. Fortnite was launched on the iOS platform in March 2018 for free. Soon after that, they launched this game on many other platforms and devices and had some troubles too. </p>
<p> On July 12, 2018, Fortnite was made available to the Android-based NVIDIA Shield TV users. However, they launched the beta version of the game officially for the Android devices on August 9, 2018. It was available for the Samsung Android devices only. Later, the company expanded support for the beta version to some other Android devices. </p>
<p> Minimum System Requirements & Supported Devices for Fortnite </p>
<p> Fortnite is indeed a heavy and resource hungry game that consumes lots of data and storage space, which is the same reason why the game is available on limited devices. Here is a list of the supported devices. </p>
<p> Supported Android Devices </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy: S7 / S7 Edge, S8 / S8+, S9 / S9+, Note 8, Note 9, Tab S3, Tab S4 </p>
<p> Google: Pixel / Pixel XL, Pixel 2 / Pixel 2 XL </p>
<p> Asus: ROG Phone, Zenfone 4 Pro, 5Z, V </p>
<p> Here is an official list from Epic Games. If your phone is not listed above, no need to worry. You can still play the game if you have the following hardware requirements on your phone: </p>
<p> OS: Recommended Android 8.0 or higher, 64 bits </p>
<p> RAM: 3GB or higher </p>
<p> GPU: Adreno 530 or higher, Mali-G71 MP20, Mali-G72 MP12 or higher </p>
<p> The Minimum System Requirements for PC/Mac Devices </p>
<p> As mentioned already, the game is heavy and requires good hardware to run it smoothly without any interruptions. Here are the officially released minimum hardware requirements to run Fortnite on your PC/Mac devices: </p>
<p> Windows 7/8/10 64-bit OR Mac OSX Sierra </p>
<p> Core i3 2.4 GHz processor </p>
<p> 4GB of RAM </p>
<p> Intel HD 4000 video card </p>
<p> The Recommended System Requirements for PC/Mac Devices </p>
<p> The requirements mentioned above are just enough to run the game on your device with the basic performance settings. However, if you want to enjoy the game in full with all the graphical effects and textures, you will need to have a device that follows these recommended system requirements. </p>
<p> Core i5 2.8 GHz processor </p>
<p> 8GB of RAM </p>
<p> Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU </p>
<p> 2GB VRAM </p>
<p> If you are sure that your device meets the above requirements, you are good to go. If it doesn’t even meet the minimum system requirements, you can’t run the game on your device. </p>
<p> How to Download Fortnite? </p>
<p> It can be somewhat confusing for a beginner to download and install the latest version of the Fortnite game on Mac, PC, Xbox, PS4, iOS, and Android devices. However, it is very easy to download the game. </p>
<p> All you need to have is a device that has enough specifications to run this heavy game. The game weighs around 9-15GB on each of the above platforms. If you are using a limited internet connection with a data cap, we will recommend you to switch to an unlimited data connection to download it. </p>
<p> You can’t download this game like other popular games. This one is not yet available on Steam for both Mac and PC devices. So, you will have to download it separately. </p>
<p> As a precautionary measure, it has been suggested that one should never download games from third party websites on the internet. The chances for containing malware inside the third-party game packages are high, and it is not worth taking the risk. So, you can simply head over to the official website of Epic Games and download the original copy for free. </p>
<p> You can open the above link on your PC, Mac, and Android devices. You need to select your device platform and it will start to download the official Fortnite installer from Epic Games. Open the installer and it will start downloading the game files instantly. After downloading the files, you can start installing the game within the installer. </p>
<p> However, for iOS devices, you can open the Apple App Store right on your device and directly install the game from there easily. </p>
<p> You can download the Fortnite for Xbox, PS4, and Nintendo Switch from their native stores accordingly. Use the following links to start downloading. </p>
<p> How to get better at Fortnite? </p>
<p> If you are an in-experienced newbie player, your death rate will be very high during the beginning phase. You need to learn some skills and techniques to avoid sudden deaths and improve the gaming experience. If you are suffering from instant death from enemies, we are here to help you with the best tactics to get better at Fortnite. </p>
<p> 1) Choose where to land, it makes the gameplay better </p>
<p> Landing position is very important in Fortnite. I am sure that many guides and experts advise newbies to land in less populated areas. They claim that landing on a less-crowded area makes it less vulnerable for the player. </p>
<p> However, that is a bad idea if you want to improve your gaming skills and in-game experience. You need to land in populated areas to learn combat and improve your overall skills. </p>
<p> The landing place is not very important, but proper planning plays a significant role. You need to have a proper plan on what to do right after landing on the ground. You can plan the tactics and the actions while you are on the bus. </p>
<p> Some people try to land as fast as possible and collect the necessary goods and weapons. At the same time, some others prefer a sneaky approach and try to crouch behind the enemies slowly. Either way, what you are going to do after landing is completely your choice. </p>
<p> 2) Use a good quality earphone for an enhanced gaming experience </p>
<p> That is the basic requirement in almost all shooter games. You need to have a good quality headphone for the best in-game experience. Thanks to the surround sound, using a high-quality earphone will help you listen to every sound around you. </p>
<p> You can easily detect the movements and presence of enemies nearby and continue the combat accordingly. In addition to these, you can easily find all those golden chests located in hidden places around the playground as it makes a special sound whenever you are nearby. </p>
<p> 3) Practice and learn the game at first </p>
<p> For an absolute newbie, the main issue is getting killed at the very moment after landing. If you are also facing this issue, no need to worry. You need to spend some time on the game to learn more about gaming and controls. In the process of playing, you may be killed multiple times, but it is your opportunity to understand the strategies and game tricks and work your way from there. </p>
<p> The best strategy is to jump into the ongoing battlegrounds and engage in the combat to understand other player’s tricks and movements. You can easily pick the available weapons and choose the best one for you. </p>
<p> Fire testing different weapons will let you learn the recoiling and accuracy of each weapon to choose them wisely in the next respawn. On the contrary, if you keep hiding by getting behind the bushes and buildings, you won’t be able to polish your skills and will continue to fail the working of the game. </p>
<p> 4) Grab resources and use them for building </p>
<p> Fortnite lets you build different materials like the roof, walls, and stairs using the raw materials collected from the playground. Unlike other shooter games, you need to keep some raw materials handy at all times to build structures whenever the need to defend yourself arises; this way, you will become professional in the combat. </p>
<p> You can collect the raw materials by destroying trees, machines, doors, buildings around you with a pickaxe. Use those materials to build walls and stairs to defend yourself from your enemies during battle. </p>
<p> Also, it is important to keep an eye on the enemy buildings and try to get away from them to avoid fatality. If your enemy is building a higher stair and climbing on it, try to place one of the materials on that to stop them, otherwise, build higher stairs than them. </p>
<p> 5) Master the movements and win the opponents </p>
<p> You need to master your movements to challenge your opponents and win them easily. You can use some of the movement tricks to confuse other players and improve your game performance. </p>
<p> At first, you can utilize the power of jumping while moving through an open space. You can fool the snipers sitting at a distance by jumping while running. It makes it difficult for the enemies to target you and fire with precision on you. In addition to that, jumping helps you increase the movement speed. </p>
<p> The next important thing is rapid and unexpected movements during combat. You can move aggressively throughout the game to confuse other players. You can also crouch while moving. Crouching helps you avoid footstep sounds while moving nearby an enemy. Otherwise, enemies can detect your presence with the footsteps. </p>
<p> In addition to that, crouching helps you improve your accuracy. If you are crouching and stopping for a second before firing, your firing accuracy will reach 100% dramatically. </p>
<p> How to play Fortnite on PC? </p>
<p> Fortnite was launched on PC before it was released on mobile devices. It has become very popular on Windows PCs, and there are millions of players using it on computers. If you are a beginner, here is how to play Fortnite game on a PC. </p>
<p> First, you need to set up your Epic Games account by visiting the official website. It is required to sign up for this game. </p>
<p> At first, you have to download the Epic Games launcher and open the Fortnite game easily. As mentioned above, you need to have a good quality internet connection to play it smoothly without server issues. </p>
<p> Now launch the game from the Epic Games launcher and sign in with your Epic Games credentials. In the game window, you will see two options – Save The World and Battle Royale. </p>
<p> You can choose the Battle Royale to get started with the gameplay. Before starting it, you can open the settings from the menu and familiarize yourself with the controls in the INPUT tab in settings. You can modify the input settings in this menu as your wish. </p>
<p> Now you can choose the game mode by clicking on the button located just above the PLAY button. You can choose from SOLO, DUOS, and SQUADS options as you wish. Make sure you check the FILL option to include other players in the game; otherwise, you will end up joining a game with all solo players. Once all is done, click on the PLAY button to start the game. </p>
<p> These are all the available game modes: </p>
<p> Solo: Battle it out on your own. </p>
<p> Duos: Pair up with a friend. </p>
<p> Squads: Choose two to three others. </p>
<p> 50v50: Join one of two teams of 50 each (you’ll find extra loot here but more lethal storms). </p>
<p> Playground: Practice with weapons in this low-pressure environment and build massive structures. </p>
<p> Steady storm: Be prepared for relentless storms. </p>
<p> After clicking on the PLAY button, the game window will show the loading screen. Then it will open up a warm-up mode that lets you walk around and try your controls before starting the real game. Once the countdown has ended, you will be taken to the playground in a bus attached to the flying balloon. You can jump to the desired location and use your control to land properly on the ground. </p>
<p> Once landed, you can run around to find weapons and items required to continue the battle to survive. However, you need to make sure that you are not attracting the nearby enemies and avoid getting killed by them. </p>
<p> In case you are killed by someone, you have the option to continue to watch other player’s gameplay or start a new game. You can use this spectating opportunity to learn the battle tricks and combat styles and ultimately become a pro player. </p>
<p> During your gameplay, you will notice an indicator that informs you that the storm is shrinking. You can open the map and run to a safe area. If you get yourself caught in the storm, it is going to cause damage and once you run out of health, you will get elimination from the game. </p>
<p> Here are the common input controls in Fortnite on PC: </p>
<p> So, these are some of the few basic things to know before playing Fortnite on a PC. </p>
<p> When will Fortnite ‘Save the World’ be free? </p>
<p> As mentioned above, the popular Battle Royale is free-to-play in the Fortnite game on all supported devices and platforms. However, there is a co-op PVE mode named Save the World, which is still under development. At this time, users have to pay for it to enjoy the Save The World mode in their Fortnite application. It will cost you $39.99 to grab this game mode. </p>
<p> The company has been working on it for the last few years and was set to release officially in 2018. But that didn’t work out properly, and you have to spend money to own it as of now. </p>
<p> To support this, they stated that they are working on the mechanics and backend of Save The World mode to prepare it for free-to-play availability. That is the reason behind the delay of the public release of the said mode. </p>
<p> However, we have good news for global Fortnite fans. The company has just revealed that they are planning to make the Save The World mode free-to-play in the coming seasons. </p>
<p> In a blog post, the company announced that the users could earn X-Ray tickets by taking part in quests, mission alerts, and daily login rewards. Users can use these tickets inside the Save the World mode only. That indicates the company’s plans to launch the free-to-play version of the same. </p>
<p> The company hasn’t yet revealed any official release date for this. However, the announcements, rumors, and news from the company indicate that they will be launching it by the end of this year for the free users. Until then, the company will be working on the backend and functioning of the mode for the overall smoother gaming experience. </p>
<p> How much money has Fortnite made? </p>
<p> Epic Games is not a very open company when it comes to revealing the total earnings. However, they are making a very good amount of money from gamers each year. If we dig in deeply, most of their money is coming from other business models in the gaming industry, rather than the in-app purchases on their games. Their earning model is very promising and long-term. </p>
<p> Anyways, according to Nielsen’s SuperData tracking arm report in 2018, Fortnite has made around $2.4 million as revenue. Fortnite charges $10 for the most popular Battle Pass from the users, and it adds to the Epic Games’ overall revenue. They are making additional money from Fortnite with in-game items such as virtual money (V-Bucks), add-on items, and special outfits. However, it is worth noting that they are not charging any money from the users to play the game for free. </p>
<p> Why is Fortnite so popular? </p>
<p> As you know, Fortnite is dominating the Battle Royale category and is making a buzz on the internet. We see many posts and clips of the best gameplays of Fortnite all over Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms. </p>
<p> Have you ever thought about how it became so popular when there is some strong competition in the same category? There are multiple reasons to justify this. </p>
<p> First of all, Fortnite is a free-to-play game with not even a single fee for playing the game in normal cases. It attracts millions of players across the globe, and they just fall in love with the features and the experience it offers, even on the free version. Many of the popular online games were using the same strategy to increase the user base. </p>
<p> Fortnite is not only a shooting game with boring traditional gameplay. Instead, it allows you to play the game without even firing a single shot. That means you can easily roam around and explore the playing area. The playground is filled with mysteries and new things to explore, which attracts everyone to the game. Moreover, it is a skill-based and creativity focused game that requires you to learn something new at each match. </p>
<p> Seasonal promotions are another point that attracts many new users to the game. When the company announces a seasonal event, everyone starts posting about it on social media and forums. When someone who doesn’t know anything about the game sees this, he/she is more likely to install the game to know what it is all about. That makes the game very popular in the digital world.

<p> Are you confused about which emailing apps offer the best email widgets for your Android homescreen? To narrow down your search, here I have reviewed the 6 best free email widgets for Android phones and tablet devices. </p>
<p> In case you guys don’t already know, I have previously covered best email apps where I discussed with you about all the possible options that Android users can rely on to manage their emails on mobile phone and tablet devices on a day-to-day basis. </p>
<p> Soon after the blog post was published, some of you were concerned about the widget compatibility and user interface of those emailing apps. Few of you people even asked for my suggestions about which email app provides the best widget for managing all the email related tasks like: </p>
<p> Checking new emails, </p>
<p> Scroll through your previous email messages, </p>
<p> Write a new email, and… </p>
<p> …even handling multiple email accounts. </p>
<p> All of these, right from the home screen, without really opening the app. </p>
<p> That actually sounds quite efficient! 😀 </p>
<p> To answer your question and clear your doubts, our editorial team decided that it would be a lot more helpful for our subscribers as well as our readers if we create a dedicated blog post about email widgets for Android. </p>
<p> So, without any further ado, let’s quickly jump onto our list of 6 best free email widgets for Android: </p>
<p> Best Email Widgets For Android </p>
<p> 1. Gmail Widget </p>
<p> Gmail is an official emailing app that comes preinstalled in the majority of the Android devices. Originally, it didn’t support any other third-party email service but after the release of other apps that provided multiple email account support, the developers over at Gmail decided to turn up their game and added support for popular email providers. </p>
<p> The widget enables you to check and compose new emails right from the home screen. You can easily scroll through the emails and even resize the widget according to the space available on your home screen. The advanced option will also ask you to select any specific folder/label you want to see on the widget. So, if you are captivated by the simplicity of Gmail app, then you can use their widget that works pretty well. </p>
<p> 2. Blue Mail Widget </p>
<p> Blue Mail is a unique app as it offers you email management in a single unified interface. In case you are wondering how that works, suppose you have three email accounts and add all of them to the Blue Mail app then it’s going to merge all of them in one place. Apart from that, it is highly configurable in every aspect. </p>
<p> Other than the app, the widget option is personalizable too so that you can make sure that it matches with your homescreen and blends perfectly with the other elements in the best way possible. The widget is scrollable so that you can quickly scroll up and scroll down to check unread emails without opening the app. </p>
<p> 3. TypeApp Widget </p>
<p> TypeApp has a material user interface and beautifully designed theme that comes bundled with a lot of options to customize the usability and notifications including the VIP notifications, which reminds you about any new incoming emails from your important contacts. </p>
<p> The widget comes in two different visuals i.e. light and dark so that you can pick the one that suits your home screen layout, wallpaper, and most importantly your taste. The widget is customizable too with resizable width and length, transparency, and an option to scroll the list of recent emails. The widget allows you to open the email (as well as attachments) right from the home screen. </p>
<p> 4. Aqua Mail Widget </p>
<p> Aqua Mail is one of the versatile emailing apps for Android. Its native support for multiple email services makes it the most preferred app among those users who are looking for flexibility to manage two or more email accounts from one app. </p>
<p> It supports home screen widgets along with the badge for unread email count. The widgets provided by Aqua Mail are highly customizable which includes the option to select the email account you want to manage from the home screen, selection of themes as well as custom labeling to identify email account. </p>

Adding multiple emails accounts is easy and you can check each one of your email accounts in one go through combined email view. Moreover, you can even filter out your messages by attachments, starred, or unread to save time and quickly find the message you looking for. </p>
<p> That’s not all. The widget is perfectly designed too. There are two types of widgets, one that supports scrolling and the other only supports the selection of simple mailing list. The light and dark colored themes make the widget appropriate for all types of home screen setup. Also, if the widget is hiding so much of your wallpaper then you can modify the transparency level. </p>

<p> We all are well aware of the fact that Android mobile OS is open source, very easy to modify, and best known for its customizability. This operating system allows anyone to download and install paid, patched, and hacked apps for free. </p>
<p> Even though you can manage to get paid apps for free but their in-app purchases feature is what asks you for your credit card and real money to get premium items and in-game coins, life, gems, keys or unlock characters, through which you are going to end up paying a lot more than the cost of game itself. </p>
<p> Not everyone can afford all of that. </p>
<p> So today, we are going to show how you can have free in-app purchases on Android to buy premium items without spending a penny. All you really need is an Android phone, one of the hacking apps listed below, and a little bit of time. </p>
<p> Continue reading to learn how… </p>
<p> Best Apps to Free In-App Purchases on Android </p>
<p> There are several hacking apps you can use on Android that allows you to hack free in-app purchases on Android and works with most of the apps and games. The apps are reviewed below: </p>
<p> Disclaimer: We at BestForAndroid do not support piracy and hacking in any way. This article is for informational and educational purposes only. </p>
<p> 1. Lucky Patcher </p>
<p> If you are really interested in getting free in-app purchases on Android, then Lucky Patcher will be your best bet. It is a very powerful and well-known app developed by a development team named ChelpuS. </p>
<p> Lucky Patcher app lets you unlock the true potential of compatible games and apps because using this you can get all the in-game resources for free including gems, coins, levels, cash, characters, and every other item through free in-app purchases Android hacking technique that works with and without root. </p>
<p> We are very well aware of the fact that most of these hacking apps require you to have an Android device with root access, but Lucky Patcher, on the other hand, works flawlessly on Android devices with no root. That is exactly what makes it the best app to get free in-app purchases. </p>
<p> Apart from hacking in-app purchases on Android, you can use Lucky Patcher for a wide range of hacking purposes, like if you are annoyed by advertisements while playing games, then you can patch that app using Lucky Patcher to get rid of ads. In short, Lucky Patcher helps you remove ads from apps and games. </p>
<p> There are so many freemium apps available on the Play Store that comes with some of the greatest in-app purchases items, but that requires you to spend some real money. However, if you want to access it without spending money, then Lucky Patcher is going to help you get in-app items for free by creating custom patched APK files of your favorite games with free in-app purchases enabled. </p>
<p> The only downside of Lucky Patcher is that you will not be able to use it with online games (specifically games which store your data on their servers) because these games require active communication with its servers, which is a very tricky task to achieve. </p>
<p> Download Lucky Patcher for Android </p>
<p> 2. Freedom </p>
<p> If you are looking for a way to have free in-app purchases on Android to buy in-game items like a new character, paid filters, coins, keys, gems, cash, and whatnot without paying real money for it, then Freedom is your answer. </p>
<p> The Freedom app is a perfect solution to bypass in app purchases in the majority of Android games and apps, especially those that are offline and store your game progress and data locally on your device storage. And the hacking app is backward compatible with Android 2.3 Gingerbread. </p>
<p> In case you are wondering, Freedom is designed and fully compatible with Android devices that have root access. So if your Android mobile phone or tablet device has no root, then we will recommend you to try other apps we have reviewed in this list for non-rooted Android smartphones. </p>
<p> Moreover, having root access on your Android device is actually a good thing because it can help you increase the performance of your device as well as perform tasks that are otherwise not possible because you don’t have access to the system. </p>
<p> The number one reason for rooting your Android, while talking about this free in-app purchases topic, will be the ability to run apps like Freedom and Lucky Patcher with much greater capabilities as compared to Android with no root access. </p>
<p> You can download Freedom APK for your Android from here </p>
<p> 3. CreeHack </p>
<p> CreeHack, similar to the other two apps reviewed above, is an amazing app that allows you to hack Android games and get free in-app purchases like money, coins, gems, new levels, characters, gold and whatnot without any limitations. You can tap and get paid items for free using this quick and simple hack. </p>
<p> The good thing about CreeHack is that it works on every Android device, regardless of root status. So even if your device has root or no root, you will be able to hack games, free in-app purchases, and bypass app payments. </p>
<p> There is one limitation of CreeHack, which is it works with Android games only. So if you are planning to bypass in-app purchases in regular apps, then you won’t be able to achieve that and we will suggest you try other apps from the list. </p>
<p> Just like any other in-app purchases bypass and hacking apps, CreeHack may not work with all the games, and you can hack a limited number of games that includes popular Android games. </p>
<p> You can download CreeHack APK for Android from here </p>
<p> 4. Xmodgames </p>
<p> Xmodgames is not actually designed to have free in-app purchases but it comes preloaded with an always updated mods list that can help you hack all the latest and popular Android games including Pokemon GO, Color Switch, Clash Royale, Clash of Clans, Piano Tiles, 8 Ball Pool, Candy Crush, Subway Surfers just to name a few. </p>

<p> The only con of Xmodgames is that it works on root Android devices, so if you have Android without root, then you will not be able to use the true potential of this modding app apart from performing hacks like speed mod or multiplier mod. </p>
<p> The user interface of Xmodgames is one of the best for hacking apps as it is developed specifically so that everyone can understand, use, and apply mods to their games without any need to learn something special. </p>
<p> Xmodgames app can be downloaded from here </p>
<p> 5. Leo PlayCard </p>

<p> The one con of AppSara is the usability, i.e. the app is a bit hard to use because of its outdated UI that might be a bit of a turn off for you as you have to figure out how each option is working and which option is actually going to give you free in-game items. </p>
<p> Download AppSara for Android from here </p>
<p> Is it possible to get free in-app purchases on Android </p>
<p> Before we dig further into the tutorial, we would like to give you a basic idea of what type of games and apps you should expect the above-mentioned hacking tools to help you free in-app purchases. </p>
<p> There are two main kinds of games/apps for Android: </p>
<p> Online, which simply does not work without the Internet and your data are stored on the developer’s game server (like Clash of Clans). </p>
<p> Offline, which does not require Internet connectivity and your data are stored on your own device (like Temple Run). </p>
<p> As you may have guessed already, you will only be able to hack in-app purchases of those apps and games that work offline because all the data is stored locally on your device, which makes it easy to hack and manipulate the in-app purchases. </p>
<p> However, other patches and hacks, like the ones available in Xmodgames, work great with online and offline games. </p>

<p> Part 1: Installing Lucky Patcher on Android </p>
<p> This part will teach you how to install Lucky Patcher on your Android phone/tablet: </p>
<p> Download Lucky Patcher APK from here directly to your Android device, because it is not available on the Play Store. </p>
<p> Once downloaded, tap on the Lucky Patcher file to start the installation process. </p>
<p> Tap on the “Install” button. </p>
<p> You will get an “Install blocked” warning message that says, “For security, your phone is set to block the installation of apps obtained from unknown sources.” </p>
<p> This happens whenever you install any app that is downloaded from third-party sources. To be able to install the app, you need to tap on the “Settings” button. </p>
<p> Now, a “Security” section will be opened automatically. </p>
<p> In the list, find the option “Unknown sources” and tap it to temporarily enable the installation, but first, make sure “Allow this installation only” option is enabled, and then tap on the OK button. </p>
<p> Lucky Patcher will now show you a list of permissions it needs access to. Simply tap on the “Install” button. </p>
<p> Once installed, tap on the “Done” button. </p>
<p> Part 2: Patching Games/Apps with Lucky Patcher to Free In-App Purchases </p>
<p> In this part, you will learn how to patch games to free in-app purchases using Lucky Patcher: </p>
<p> Launch the Lucky Patcher app and within a few moments, it will ask you to grant Superuser request. Tap on the “Grant” button. </p>
<p> Lucky Patcher will show you a list of all the apps that are installed on your phone. </p>
<p> Scroll the list until you find the app/game you want to hack in-app purchases and then tap on the app name to open the menu. </p>
<p> To show you how it actually works, here we are hacking Collage+ app. </p>
<p> From the list of options, tap on the “Open Menu of Patches” button. </p>
<p> Tap on the “Support patch for InApp and LVL emulation”. </p>
<p> Now, another window will open with several checkboxes. Please make sure these two options are marked: </p>
<p> Support patch for LVL emulation. </p>
<p> Support patch for InApp emulation. </p>
<p> Tap on the “Apply” button. The patching process will begin. Once patched, you will get free in-app purchases. </p>
<p> Part 3: Demo of Free In-App Purchases using Lucky Patcher </p>
<p> In this third and the last part, you will see how we get free in-app purchases of the app patched in the previous phase using Lucky Patcher: </p>
<p> As you can see in the screenshot below, one of the picture collages for Thanksgiving Day is locked. We can install it but cannot use it unless we pay for it via in-app purchases. </p>
<p> Since we have patched this app, so we can get that collage for free without paying anything. So, </p>
<p> We go to the menu to find an option to purchase it. </p>
<p> Tap on the “Buy Now” button. </p>
<p> Since this frame is locked and there are several other frames and collages in this category, so the app offered a bundle option too. </p>
<p> But here, for the sake of this tutorial, we are trying to get only one frame so simply tap on the “Buy Now” button. </p>
<p> This is exactly where Lucky Patcher will intervene in the purchase process and help you get in-app purchases for free. </p>
<p> You will see several options but don’t select anything on the popup window and simply tap on the “Yes” option. </p>
<p> Wait for the Lucky Patcher to perform its magic and make you lucky. </p>
<p> After a moment… This is what we see: </p>
<p> Voila! Got that collage frame without paying a single cent. 😀 </p>
<p> See the above screenshot. Did you notice how that “lock” icon is gone? </p>
<p> We can now use that collage frame for pictures. </p>
<p> How to use Freedom to free in-app purchases on Android </p>
<p> This guide is for the Freedom app. Here you will learn about how to download, install, and use Freedom app to hack in-app purchases and get in-game premium items for free on any Android device: </p>
<p> Note: As compared to Lucky Patcher, you will find the Freedom app to be much simpler and easier. </p>
<p> Download the Freedom app from here to your Android device. Because of the nature of this app, it is not available on the Play Store so you need to rely on third-party sources. </p>
<p> Install the app on your Android device (The installation process is similar to that of Lucky Patcher). </p>
<p> Launch Freedom app and it will ask you to grant Superuser access. Tap on the “Grant” button to allow access. </p>
<p> Once the list of apps is generated, scroll and find the app you want to hack in-app purchases and tap on it. </p>
<p> For the sake of the tutorial, we are using Freedom to free in-app purchases on Temple Run. So, once you tap on the app name, Freedom will start the patching process and will ask you to wait. </p>
<p> As soon as the game is patched, Freedom will automatically launch it so that you can do the purchases. </p>
<p> Navigate straight to the in-game store to purchase special items, coins, or gems. </p>
<p> As you can see in the screenshot, we already have 2,737 coins in account. Now, we are going to buy 200,000 coins. </p>
<p> Buy now button opens Google Play popup window where a FreeCard credit card is already added, which is how a patch by the Freedom app works. And it is important to note here that we don’t even have any payment method connected to Play Store account. </p>
<p> As you can see, the purchase of 200,000 coins for Temple Run is going to cost the US $19.99. However, I will be able to buy it for free. </p>
<p> To proceed with the purchase, tap the “BUY” button. </p>
<p> The Google Play in-app purchases window showed a “Payment successful” message. </p>
<p> Within a few seconds, a toast message will appear “Added 200000 coins!” and Temple Run account immediately receives those coins. </p>
<p> Did you see how it works without a flaw? </p>
<p> That’s how easy it actually is to free in-app purchases on Android using the Freedom app. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> We hope you have now learned about how simple it really is to free in-app purchases on Android for favorite games and apps. </p>
<p> Keep in mind, because some of these in-app purchases hacking apps are advanced, they might require you to have Android with root access to help you hack in-app purchases. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy Fold Specs & Launch </p>
<p> Ending the uncertainty over the comeback of its first foldable phone, Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy Fold is finally </p>
<p> Ending the uncertainty over the comeback of its first foldable phone, Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy Fold is finally going to be put on sale starting September after undergoing a redesigning process to fix the alleged frailties of its screen. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Fold was first showcased in February at the Galaxy S10 Unpacked event ahead of its slated launch on April 26. But ahead of that, the screen of Galaxy Fold began snapping in the hands of YouTubers and influencers in early reviews, forcing the South Korean tech behemoth to hold off the scheduled release of the ambitious phone for an indefinite period. </p>
<p> Samsung re-announcement of the Galaxy Fold launch comes after the company had said a couple of weeks ago that the device completed the two-month redesign process. Even the Fold was recently spotted being used by an unknown user in India, sparking the speculation that the Fold is about to stage an official comeback. </p>
<p> Samsung has put out a report on its website about the design flaws the company has fixed highlighted by early reviewers. It says the top protective layer of the display has now been extended beyond bezels so that no user will be tempted to peel it off. </p>
<p> To ward off dust and other particles from entering into the phone Samsung has now added additional reinforcements as well as protective caps for the top and bottom hinge. Also, it has used additional metal layers underneath the display to make it robust while further reducing the gap between the hinge and body of the phone. </p>
<p> Apart from that, Samsung also says that it has worked towards improving the overall user experience by optimizing the apps and services for its unique foldable UX. </p>
<p> According to the Samsung post, the Galaxy Fold is carrying out final product tests to make it available to customers in “select markets” starting September though an exact date is not revealed. Samsung says more details will be out towards the release of the phone. </p>
<p> The smartphone will offer a 7.3-inch QXGA panoramic display in unfolded state and a 4.3-inch HD+ external display in a folded state. It will come with One UI based on Android Pie, 4,380mAh battery, a power button-mounted fingerprint scanner, six cameras, 12GB RAM, and 512GB internal storage with no expandability support. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Fold is expected to cost a phenomenal USD1,980 which could be a deal-breaker but then again Samsung is wisely launching it in select markets probably including the US and UK where buyers can splash out to first experience one of the most cool and upcoming form factors of 2019 and beyond. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy Note10 Specs </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Note10 is getting tantalizingly closer to its launch. It is two weeks away, that is to say. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Note10 is getting tantalizingly closer to its launch. It is two weeks away, that is to say. And the device has picked up the pace in leaking in the hands of tipsters. Thanks to them we already know what the phablet is to offer in toto, leaving almost nothing to our imagination. </p>
<p> The latest leak comes in the form of a spec dump as well as images of the Note10 series courtesy of Evan Blass and Roland Quadt (associated with WinFuture) who have a stellar reputation as tipsters. It seems everything has been laid bare about the S Pen-totting phone. </p>
<p> Here is a run-down of details on Galaxy Note10 which will come in two models, the regular Note10 and a scaled-up Note10+. </p>
<p> The renders released by WinFuture are clear in conveying that the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+ are look-wise similar, coming in a rectangular form factor with sharp corners. The bezels are comparatively thinner than the previous generation of the devices. Both the phones will have Infinity-O display but the punch hole is centrally aligned at the top instead of at the corner. </p>
<p> In terms of display, both the Note10 and Note10+ will feature Dynamic AMOLED displays with HDR10+ support, and Gorilla Glass 6 protection, but with different resolution, 2280x1080p FHD+ for the Galaxy Note10 and 3040x1080p QHD+ for the Galaxy Note10+. There will be an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner for authentication in both the phones. </p>
<p> Pumping power form under the hood will be a 7nm octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus or an Exynos 9825 SoC in both the phones depending on the market. The Note 10 will pack 8GB RAM while the Note 10+ will be offered with up to 12GB RAM. Up to 256GB UFS 3.0 internal storage is predicted for both the devices, but only the Note10+ will have the expandable storage facility. </p>
<p> There is a possibility of phones duo having up to 512GB and 1TB storage options as well, but it is not confirmed as yet. Not to mention, both will boot Android Pie with One UI slapped on top. </p>
<p> On the rear, the Galaxy Note10 will mount a vertically aligned triple camera setup including a 12MP Dual Pixel primary sensor with f.1.5-f/2.4 variable aperture, a 16MP ultra wide-angle sensor with f/2.2 aperture, and a 12MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom. All these three sensors will also find a place on the back of the Galaxy Note10+, but with an additional depth-sensing ToF camera. The front will be equipped with a 10MP dual-pixel selfie camera. </p>
<p> A 3,500mAh battery with 25W wired fast charging and 12W wireless charging will be backing the Note10 while a bigger 4,300mAh battery with 45W wired fast charging and 20W wireless charging will keep the Note10+ running. However, the bigger battery in the latter raises the overall weight of the phone at 198 grams versus 168 grams of the Galaxy Note 10. </p>
<p> The iconic S Pen stylus is much improved now with a new Air Gestures feature that allows users to interact with UI without having to touch the screen with the stylus. Moreover, the physical Google Assistant button and the legacy 3.5mm audio jack are likely to be done away with. </p>

<p> Mobile gaming has become a significant industry ever since the introduction of smartphones. However, with the rise of mobile gaming, a lot of unwanted and annoying features have also started surfacing in various games. This is what plagues the overall gaming experience. </p>
<p> For instance, various free games on the Google Play Store are bombarded with a lot of ads and a set of limited features that are designed to force the user to buy the premium version of the game. </p>
<p> The good news is there is a way to bypass such constraints and enjoy some of the games for free, without paying for premium. Furthermore, these apps also provide cheat methods that allow you to customize the way games operate on Android phones and help you to level up quickly. </p>
<p> However, it should be noted that installing such apps is a slippery slope. That’s because some of these apps require rooting your Android device. Moreover, hacking apps, in general, are never available on the Play Store, which adds an extra layer of caution when downloading and using such apps from third-party websites. </p>
<p> A major reason for letting you know about this precautionary measure is that a lot of these apps have a possibility to steal data and other private information stored on your Android device. </p>

<p> Select the Scan Type to ‘Exact Value’ and type the value you found in the previous step. </p>
<p> Press the Scan button and then keep repeating steps 6 and 7 as long as you don’t get less than six variables in the scan result. </p>

<p> Keep the default settings checked and click on “Rebuild the app.” </p>

<p> NOTE: You must not try to complete step 3 and step 4 or step 5 and step 6 in one go, bad things can happen. Rebooting of your device between two phases is important. </p>
<p> Once you are done with the above steps, verify that all the patches have been applied. In case if any of them has failed then you should try removing the patches with options “Remove all patches from core.jar” and “Remove all patches from service.jar” again. </p>

<p> Tap “Support patch for InApp and LVL emulation.” </p>

<p> How to Root your Android device </p>
<p> Rooting an Android device is often considered an intricate and painfully complex process for non-technical smartphone users but if you follow the proper procedure then you can easily root your device without asking for anyone’s help. </p>
<p> Following are the simple and necessary steps that apply to every Android phone you want to root: </p>
<p> Download the Magisk zip from here into your phone. </p>
<p> Boot the phone into recovery. </p>
<p> Install the Magisk zip. </p>
<p> Wipe Cache and Dalvik Cache and hit Reboot. </p>
<p> These are basically the fundamental steps involved in rooting however as mentioned earlier the rooting process is not complicated but getting through the prerequisites is the real challenge. It is easier said than done. </p>
<p> Firstly, you should have a custom recovery for your phone, which must need to have an unlocked bootloader. In fact, the real challenge is actually being able to install custom recovery, and in some cases, unlocking the bootloader becomes an even bigger hassle. </p>
<p> Huawei is one such case among many others, where unlocking the bootloader is not supported therefore you straight up can’t install custom recovery into these devices. </p>
<p> For starters who are looking to get their phone rooted, you should start searching if your phone’s bootloader can be unlocked and then search for custom recovery for your model of device from this link. Chances are that your phone might have an unofficial version for it or some other compatible recovery. </p>
<p> If you’ve made up your mind and ready to progress further with the root, then the first step is to figure out how the phone can be restarted into the recovery mode. Later, you should move to other steps such as applying for bootloader unlock (if that’s needed) and installation of necessary files and drivers. </p>
<p> Now, at this phase, the rooting method for Android devices differs depending on the smartphone manufacturer. Keeping Huawei out of the loop because of the complex procedure, we have shortlisted three leading smartphone brands i.e. Samsung, Xiaomi, and Google and we have prepared an easy to follow guide for you, which you can follow here. </p>
<p> Types of Android Games and Which Ones Can Be Hacked </p>
<p> Here are some insights on the kinds of Android games that can and cannot be hacked using these hacking tools. </p>
<p> Basically, Android games are divided into two distinctive categories: </p>
<p> Server-side games, </p>
<p> Client-side games. </p>
<p> Server-side Android Games </p>
<p> The server-side games for Android usually have dedicated online servers that store all the game information such as the player’s data, game points, player’s rank, and all the purchases the player has made. All of this data is stored in an encrypted form over their servers. Every game differs in terms of how much data they store on the server. </p>
<p> Purely server-side games are impossible to hack due to multiple layers of encryption and data they fetch from the server. However, there are some exceptions. PUBG and Asphalt are famous server-side games, but they are hackable to some extent because of the amount of data they sent and receive to/from the server. </p>

You are at the right place, as here we will guide you about where to get Spotify Premium app that offers you all the premium features for free and then how to properly install it on your Android device. </p>
<p> 100% working step-by-step guide on how to get Spotify Premium for free on Android, iOS, Windows PC, and Mac OS without spending a cent. </p>
<p> Once you have followed this tutorial, you will be able to enjoy all the paid premium Spotify features, including unlimited skips, enable extreme sound quality, block ads, and the ability to play any song. </p>
<p> At the end of this ultimate guide, we have answered some frequently asked questions to help you out with the common problems related to Spotify. </p>
<p> What is Spotify? </p>
<p> Spotify is one of the most widely used music-streaming app, which not only allows you to listen to millions of soundtracks but it also gives you the ability to create your very own personalized playlists for music, podcasts, and songs. </p>
<p> You can even share your favorite music and playlists with your friends. And the best feature is the capability to sync your music across all of your devices, including Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac. </p>
<p> There are over twenty million soundtracks that you can search, play, and even download for offline listening using the Spotify Premium account. </p>
<p> Spotify offers two account types: </p>
<p> Spotify Free: To get Spotify free, simply signup using your email address. The process takes just a few minutes. But it comes with certain limitations like shuffle music play, no skips, and audio/video advertisements. </p>
<p> Spotify Premium: The Spotify Premium offers tons of features using which you can download music for offline listening, listen in extreme sound quality, skip unlimited songs, and you won’t get ads. </p>
<p> Talking about premium, Spotify offers three popular paid plans starting from as low as $4.99 per month for the Student plan and going as high as $14.99 per month for Family plan (which supports six accounts). </p>
<p> For many, these charges become too high, considering it’s a subscription-based model and requires a monthly payment. Don’t worry as you can follow our in-depth guide to get Spotify Premium free. </p>
<p> How to Get Spotify Premium for free on Android, iOS, Windows PC, and Mac OS </p>
<p> Spotify is a cross-platform service and has a dedicated app for every device like Android, iPhone, tablets, and PC (whether it is Windows or Mac). </p>
<p> Here in this guide, we are going to help you get Spotify Premium to that you can use most of the paid and premium features for free for as long as you want. </p>
<p> Using Multiple 90-days Premium Trial Accounts (Easiest Spotify Hack) </p>
<p> The easiest Spotify Premium hack is to officially subscribe for the 90-days or 3-months free trial offered by the Spotify for new users. (Previously, it was for 30-days). </p>
<p> You can use this method to enjoy all premium features, including offline listening for free. Still, the only downside is you will have to create a new email address as well as a new Spotify account once every ninety days. </p>
<p> We know the method is not much efficient, but it is very effective for sure, as this works on all supported platforms, whether it’s Android, iOS, Windows, or Mac OS. </p>
<p> Join Your Friend’s Spotify Family Account </p>
<p> Spotify offers multiple Premium plans, which includes: </p>
<p> Individual, </p>
<p> Family and </p>
<p> Student. </p>
<p> Here, the Spotify Family plan allows over 6 Premium accounts at a much-discounted price of USD 14.99, which (if my math is correct) will be about USD 2.49 per account, whereas the Individual plan costs USD 9.99 for a month. That is really cheap. </p>
<p> Now, you have two possible options: </p>
<p> Scenario 1: You have to find just five friends or relatives who are interested in Spotify Premium, opt for Spotify Family plan, and link up all the accounts together. All six of you will be able to enjoy premium services at a real cheap price. </p>
<p> Scenario 2: You can find a friend who is already using the Spotify Family plan and ask him/her to let you be one of the six members. </p>
<p> Android: Install Spotify Premium mod cracked APK </p>
<p> For Android users, we have a modded Spotify cracked app, which lets you enjoy all the premium features without paying a cent (some server-specific features may not work). </p>
<p> All you have to do is install Spotify Premium mod apk on your Android phone/tablet device and log in using your free Spotify account. You will have all the premium services unlocked like unlimited skips, extreme quality enabled, ad-free, and uninterrupted music listening experience. </p>
<p> Here is how you can do this on your Android: </p>
<p> Uninstall the original Spotify app from your device, if already installed. </p>
<p> The apk file will be in a compressed zip format, so you will have to use a file explorer to extract/unzip the file. </p>
<p> Install the app. If this is your first time installing apk, then you may need to allow installation from unknown sources. </p>
<p> Open the app, enter your account credentials, and tap on login. </p>
<p> DISCLAIMER: We at BestForAndroid won’t be held responsible if Spotify terminates/suspends your account due to the usage of the Spotify Premium mod app. All information provided here is strictly for educational purposes, and we are not responsible for how you decide to use the provided information. </p>

<p> The app should appear on your iPhone. Tap on it to open and enjoy Spotify Premium. </p>
<p> Mac OS/Windows PC: Use Hosts File to Block Ads </p>
<p> This method is for Mac OS and Windows PC, and here we will be using the hosts file to get Spotify Premium for free and enjoy features like ad-free music listening and unlimited skips. Originally, the free version limits you to skip only six songs per hour. </p>
<p> For Mac OS: Follow these steps to get Spotify Premium on MacBook, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, iMac running any version of Mac OS: </p>

<p> Troubleshooting and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) </p>
<p> We have created a dedicated FAQ and troubleshooting section to resolve your issue quickly. </p>
<p> In case your question is not answered here, or if you are experiencing an entirely different problem, please feel free to leave your comment in the comments section below, and we will help you out 🙂 </p>
<p> Why does the Spotify app keep logging me out on Android? </p>
<p> Please follow these steps to fix this issue: </p>
<p> Also, we have reviewed some of the best free VPN apps for Android, which might help you bypass the Spotify country restriction. </p>
<p> Go to Settings and tap on Apps. </p>
<p> In the list of apps, look for Spotify and tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on Storage. </p>
<p> Tap on the clear data and clear cache to reset Spotify (this is important; otherwise, the trick won’t work). </p>
<p> Download the Browsec VPN app from the Google Play Store here and enable VPN (you can use ‘United States’ as your VPN location). </p>
<p> Launch Spotify and log in using your credentials. </p>
<p> Why are Spotify songs downloading and offline listening not working? </p>
<p> Music downloading and offline listening is a server-side feature and is directly linked to your Spotify account, which can be either Freemium or Premium. </p>
<p> If you still want to download music, then you can use Deezer Premium. You can download and install this app from here, and it’s free. 😉 </p>
<p> Why use a VPN app with Spotify? </p>
<p> VPN is necessary. But only for the first time. Once you are logged into the Spotify and got the premium features, then you can go ahead and disable VPN. </p>
<p> The VPN trick is used to bypass the country restriction and allows anyone from any part of the world to get Spotify Premium for free. If you don’t use a VPN, then there are chances you may not be able to login to Spotify. </p>
<p> Can’t log in to the Spotify app, getting error code auth:3. </p>
<p> You may be getting the following error message on Windows or Mac: </p>
<p> “A firewall may be blocking Spotify. Please update your firewall to allow Spotify. Additionally, you could try changing the currently used proxy settings. (Error code: auth:3)” </p>
<p> To resolve this, you need to temporarily delete the Spotify ads blocking lines added into your PC’s Hosts file. Then log in to your account. Once logged in, you can then add those ad-blocking lines back into the Hosts file. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Now that you have learned how to get Spotify Premium for free so don’t forget to share your views about the features you have used and which platform you are using to enjoy this incredible music streaming service. </p>

<p> How come I cannot download songs and I don’t have unlimited skips and I cannot choose which song to play since it is in shuffle? I already downloaded the app but I cannot access the premium settings </p>
<p> Hi @jace_andrews:disqus, we have already mentioned in the article above that, “downloading and offline listening option is directly linked to your account so you won’t be able to download any music.” </p>
<p> Downloading feature is linked to your account and we cannot enable it with modded apk. As far as unlimited skips feature is concerned, it works flawlessly. I use it almost everyday. </p>
<p> Make sure you have uninstalled any previous version of Spotify from your phone before installing the modified apk provided here. </p>
<p> This doesn’t work for me, I don’t have unlimited skips nor download functionality. </p>
<p> Hi @Lodown77:disqus, unlimited skips works flawlessly in this modded Spotify premium apk. I have verified it. However, download functionality is linked to your Spotify account, which means if you are actually a premium user then downloading will be available else you cannot use this feature. Unfortunately, it is a server-side option. </p>
<p> We have already mentioned this in the article above. </p>
<p> how do I download the apk? theres nothing to press on to start the download? and also does this mod apk cause malware or viruses? or like cause random browser pages to launch? pls be honest, thank you 🙂 </p>
<p> Download APK from this link. No, this is safe apk file. We have already tested before posting. </p>
<p> Please try one more time now. We have just updated the Spotify Premium mod apk to latest version. You can download from this link. Once downloaded, follow the steps above to get Spotify Premium on Android for free. It should work. </p>
<p> Please try again now. We have just updated the Spotify Premium mod apk. You can download from here. Once downloaded, follow the steps above to get Spotify Premium on Android for free. It will work. 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi @hqtriviahackplugin:disqus, please try again as we have released an updated Spotify Premium mod apk. You can download from this link. Once downloaded, follow the steps mentioned above to get Spotify Premium free on Android. </p>
<p> And in case you are unable to login to Spotify Premium then you can follow our step by step guide mentioned here that will help you bypass Spotify country restriction and access Spotify Premium abroad. </p>
<p> Hi I was logged out of the app this morning and i havent been able to log back in since. I checked around and everyone seems to have the same issue. Apparently its because spotify update the app so any outdated on wont work. Can this be fixed </p>
<p> Spotify updated their system so we have to wait for next release of modded apk. We will update this page as soon as we got new mod. Don’t forget to bookmark this page. </p>

<p> hello, have the new mod been released yet? i was just logged out and could not log in back then :(( </p>
<p> Works fine but received this email roughly a week later: </p>
<p> Dear user: </p>
<p> We detected abnormal activity on the app you are using so we have disabled it. Don’t worry – your Spotify account is safe. </p>
<p> To access your Spotify account, simply uninstall any unauthorized or modified version of Spotify and download and install the Spotify app from the official Google Play Store. If you need more help, please see our support article on Reinstalling Spotify. </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_o2oDo9SbAD:disqus, we have found a workaround for Spotify Premium and released an update. The tutorial above has been updated with latest method. Please follow all the steps and let us know if this new method works for you or not. </p>
<p> Didn’t work for me:( </p>
<p> Did not work </p>
<p> Try creating a new Spotify account and then perform same steps on it. </p>
<p> Let me know how it works.. </p>
<p> Works </p>
<p> Every time I log in with a new account, it loads and then kicks me back out to the Spotify sign-in page. </p>
<p> Every time I log in with a new account, it loads and then kicks me back out to the Spotify sign-in page. </p>
<p> Same with me, i created a new email to make a new spotify account. I downloaded the latest apk and followed the tutorial step-by-step. When i tried to login to the spotify app it immediately kick me back to sign-in page </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_U6oUqNLrUn:disqus & @disqus_5a0l03VeGM:disqus, I will recommend both of you to follow the guide again. We have just updated it with a new working method. And don’t forget to uninstall previous Spotify apk and download the new modded Spotify Premium apk given in Step #2. </p>
<p> Don’t forget to update us with the status if it worked for you or not. </p>
<p> You guys are miracle workers! It works. Thank you so much (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ By the way, I got an email from Spotify trying to confirm my new account. Should I confirm it, or ignore it? </p>
<p> You can confirm it. No problem. </p>
<p> I created a new account and after i got on a second time it wouldn’t let me login </p>
<p> Did you download the Spotify Premium apk from the link given in Step#2? You need to uninstall previous version of Spotify. </p>
<p> Hi Justin! Two of our readers, in the comments, reported that they got it working by creating a new Spotify account rather than using an existing one. </p>
<p> Give that a try! It should work. </p>
<p> Yup! But for a little while. We have found a quick fix to bypass their new blocking system. 😉 </p>
<p> It doesn’t work, the one you posted today does not work. Still says Unable to login. </p>
<p> Never mind!! Do everything just make a new account! It works for me now!!!! Thanks !! </p>
<p> Thanks for your suggestion Andre. Creating a new Spotify account worked for me too!! </p>
<p> That’s great! This will also keep your original account safe in case Spotify decides to impose any ban. 😀 </p>
<p> Worked For Me With An Existing Account But Do I have to Open the VPN Always when i want to play on Spotify </p>
<p> Good to hear that, @bineetrupakheti:disqus! To be on a safe side, I will recommend you to use VPN when using Spotify. This will keep your account safe. However, there is always a risk of getting your account banned as Spotify Team has been actively monitoring our every move. Your best bet is to create a disposable Spotify account to save yourself from losing personalized playlists. </p>
<p> It says cannot contact sign up servers. i tried again than it said this email is taken. went to login section than it said user name or password is incorrect. </p>
<p> Hi @yobugabu:disqus, we have found out that there are some issues with the current modded Spotify Premium apk. Another working Spotify Premium apk will be up soon. Until then, please be patient. </p>
<p> I made a new account and it worked yesterday but today I got logged out and I cannot log back in today </p>
<p> Hey @disqus_7XDYztLFVv:disqus, thanks again for updating about the issue. It was indeed working earlier. Anyways, we are looking into it and will release an update as soon as we discover another working method. </p>
<p> At the moment, it seems like there’s some issue with the Spotify apk itself. And according to our initial tests, the Singapore VPN bypass still works. </p>
<p> Please be patient, we will be back with an update soon. </p>
<p> You’re welcome, @disqus_7XDYztLFVv:disqus! We have updated the guide as well as new APK, we will recommend you to try again from the beginning and don’t forget to download apk given in Step #2. </p>
<p> Same as here. I think vpn singapore is working but you have to create a new account over and over again. Created 2 dummy accounts and logged me back out. </p>
<p> @disqus_BpDHVZ50IH:disqus, we were aware about the issue and has released an update. Please try to follow the tutorial again. </p>
<p> I’ve tried it again, I’ve also downloaded the new apk too on step 2. I’ll check with you what will happen after a day 😀 it’s working again and hopefully will work for quite a bit. 🤞 </p>
<p> @disqus_ogwvLwzxcu:disqus a fixed Spotify apk is up now. Follow the guide again from the beginning and let me know if it works for you or not. </p>
<p> Hi i’m from philippines, why the premium spotify doesn’t work for me I follow all the instructions that you gave but why it doesn’t work ? </p>
<p> It’s not working anymore.. You can create new account and login but after 1 day It’ll kick you out again. </p>
<p> Hey @disqus_BpDHVZ50IH:disqus, we have updated the post with a new method. Give it a try and let us know if it works for you or not. </p>
<p> I’ve tried it again, I’ve also downloaded the new apk too on step 2. I’ll check with you what will happen after a day 😀 it’s working again and hopefully will work for quite a bit. </p>
<p> Glad you got it working! 🙂 </p>
<p> Yaaaay! ❤️ Still working hahahaha.😅 thank you, lovelots! 😄 </p>
<p> Haha, awesome!! Thanks for updating us! 😄 </p>
<p> It’s logged out again and not working.. 😭🤦 </p>
<p> It says when you follow the steps again that it cannot login you to the sign up servers.. </p>
<p> Hey @Aienma01:disqus, there were some issues with that version. We have updated the post with newer Spotify Premium app. You should give it a try. Also, it works with previous accounts too! 😉 </p>
<p> Realllly?? So i just need to download the new apk? Yaaaaaaaay. 😄 </p>
<p> Tried it aaand one of my old accounts let me in so YAY 🙌 ❤️ thank you for your endless supports and updates 😭❤️ </p>
<p> Still working ❤️ thank you so much 😊 </p>
<p> Not working anymore again.. 😢 just now, i’m playing it and it logged me back out.. 💔 </p>
<p> I’ve tried it again, I’ve also downloaded the new apk too on step 2. I’ll check with you what will happen after a day 😀 it’s working again and hopefully will work for quite a bit. 😀 </p>
<p> Ryan, the method you followed has stopped working, maybe it was fixed by Spotify. We have now updated the post again with a new method, give it a try and let us know if it worked for you or not. </p>
<p> Hi Andre, try following the tutorial again from the Step #1. We have just updated the article with a new method. </p>
<p> Hailee, try to follow the guide again. We have just updated it with a new working method that doesn’t require you to change the country. But you need to use VPN to sign up for a new account. </p>
<p> Thank you very much! I can be able to run Spotify again with these steps. Thank you! </p>
<p> It works. You have to make a new account. The downside is that it’s the older version of spotify. But that doesn’t matter because this is all free! I just hope it lasts long! </p>
<p> No, you can uninstall VPN app once you have got the Spotify Premium apk working. Currently, it works fine without VPN. </p>
<p> Works fine with the old apk in tutorial but its very old so it doesnt support the “singles” so i cant find most of the stuff i was listening to unless i know the name of it. could be better if we got a “one up” to the next version there was.(not the newest one) </p>
<p> Try following the steps again from the beginning, we have updated the method with a working solution along with a newly modded Spotify Premium apk. It will work now. </p>
<p> You’re welcome, @disqus_yUcfj2o5bK:disqus! Enjoy Spotify Premium features for free while it lasts… 😉 </p>
<p> Thanks for your effort, Mohammad. Do I have to remain connected to the VPN when I’m already using Spotify? </p>
<p> No, once your account is successfully created and you are able to play music then you can even remove the VPN app from your phone. </p>
<p> Hey. Thanks for the good work. When I try to sign up whit VPN, this happens: “We can’t conttact whith the servers” </p>
<p> Seems like you are using another version of Spotify app. You need to download the version of Spotify Premium apk we have provided in Step #2 above and then follow the remaining steps. It should work. </p>
<p> No, I was usinagem the Spotify Premium APK, but anyway, I reloaded again the app and tried onde more time, and It worked! Thanks for answer me 🙂 </p>
<p> You need to download the Spotify Premium app we have provided in Step #2 above. This method works on that specific apk only. Give it a try! </p>
<p> it worked for me,thanks alot! but can i still use spotify after i delete BROWSEC?? </p>
<p> Doesn’t work, created new account, used vpn in singapore didn’t get the update popup and is just s free account not premium </p>
<p> Hey @antcanova:disqus, seems like you didn’t follow the steps correctly. </p>
<p> You must need to uninstall any previous version of Spotify app installed on your device. And download Spotify Premium apk provided in Step #2 above. This Spotify Premium bypass trick worked for all of our readers. It should work for you too. </p>
<p> Give it another go and let me know if it works for you or not. </p>
<p> I’ve tried it twice now, I’ve downloaded the apk zip from the site, removed spotify from phone, installed spotify apk from file, using pia vpn set to singapore and clicked signup and used a fresh email and poassword all I get when click enter, is a popup with spotify mod modded by bestforandroid etc etc, go into spotify and in top left of screen at bottom it says go premium try 7 days free. Never had the new version available update popup. Going to give up now can’t keep creating new accounts and email addresses </p>
<p> My friend, I guess you are using Spotify for the very first time. </p>
<p> Believe it or not, you have already got the Spotify Premium working on your phone. That “Go Premium try 7 days free” message you are talking about is meant to appear because you actually have a free Spotify account. However, most of the Spotify Premium features will work as this is a modded app. </p>
<p> Do one thing, search for any playlist in Spotify, play any music from that list, and then try to skip the tracks. If Spotify allows you to do that then it means you have a Premium. Remember, free version do not allow you to skip music tracks. </p>
<p> I hope now you understand how Spotify Premium works. </p>
<p> Ok thanks, yes I am new to spotify, It’s not full premium though is it? As you can’t download the tracks to play offline, which was kind of the reason to get spotify in the first place, as will be linking phone via android auto to play in the car </p>
<p> You’re right. Download feature is premium and linked directly to your Spotify account. It is server side and cannot be hacked. We have already mentioned this in the article above. </p>
<p> If you have an active data connection on your Android phone then this will work for you. </p>
<p> It seems like you are NOT using the version of Spotify Premium we have provided in Step #2 above, which is the reason why you are experiencing issues with Sign Up. </p>
<p> Please uninstall any existing version of Spotify app from your phone and then download and install the modded Spotify Premium apk from the link given in Step #2. Then follow the rest of the steps. It will work! 🙂 </p>
<p> Installed the spotify apk, but when I tried to open it in my downloads it said “can’t find app to open this file.” Not too sure what to do now. :/ (My phone is a ZTE Zmaxpro, idk if that had to do with this or not) </p>
<p> The apk file is in compressed zip format. Usually Android has native support for compressed files. </p>
<p> Anyways, to open the file, download any file manager app and then browse to the downloads folder. You will now be able to install Spotify app. </p>
<p> Nope. Downloading and Offline playback are Spotify Premium features that cannot be hacked because these are server-side and directly linked to your account. </p>
<p> If you want to download music and listen music offline then we will suggest you to pay for Spotify Premium. That is the only way to enjoy those 2 features. </p>
<p> Hey Erika, link for Spotify Premium apk is in Step #2 above. Or, you can click here to go to Spotify Premium apk download page. </p>
<p> Music downloading feature cannot be hacked as it is a server-side feature and directly linked to your Spotify account. </p>
<p> Other Premium features like music seeking, unlimited skips, ad-blocking work though! </p>
<p> hi tried it and works fine! 🙂 just to ask, mine doesnt have the lower part showing your library, radio eg… instead they are shown when dragged from the side… anyone’s else similar? </p>
<p> Yes. That’s how it looks like. Because Spotify Premium is currently working on old Spotify app only. </p>
<p> Worked for a week but again got logged out and can’t log back in. Thank you to everyone who is constantly working and giving updates on the matter. </p>
<p> Agreed! This was a miracle worker for a good week or 2 but it just logged me out and I even made a new account and reinstalled it. Any suggestions? </p>
<p> Hey @disqus_7XDYztLFVv:disqus, please recheck the tutorial above. New Spotify Premium modded app has been updated. </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_o2oDo9SbAD:disqus! New and updated Spotify Premium mod is now available. Please check the tutorial again for updates 😉 </p>

<p> Welp, its dead again. after maybe a week of working the app wont let you sign in nor create a new account (auto bans it) and so there is no way around it. I dont think this will be easy to get it working again but i hope you can do your best! </p>
<p> Hi @mastertm:disqus, thanks for updating us about the issue. New Spotify Premium has been updated. Please try to follow the guide again. </p>
<p> many thanks for your time and explanations . I have not try your new method, two questions: 1- does it work with any VPN app? 2- if we make a new account how we can have our previous playlist. we have hundreds of songs in our previous account by making the new one we lose all of them and it is impossible to add them one by one it takes ages. can you please guide me. regards. </p>
<p> Don’t worry, @navidtaghavi:disqus. New Spotify Premium apk is available now which will let you use your existing Spotify Premium account without any issue. Now you won’t need to waste any time on creating new playlists. </p>

<p> Hey, you guys? Did anybody get kicked out of their Spotify accounts and app again? The modded APK and method of getting premium Spotify worked for a while for me, but then when I logged back into the app yesterday, the app gave me the sign-in screen. I tried the current account I was using, but no success. I then made a new account. No success either. Finally, I uninstalled the app and repeated the whole process on this web-page, but that didn’t work either. Is this just me? </p>
<p> @disqus_U6oUqNLrUn:disqus we were aware about the issue and has updated this post with an updated information and Spotify Premium apk. Please try once more. It even works with your existing account. </p>
<p> It works! And I can log in with my old account now. A million thanks for your hard work~ </p>
<p> Its not working anymore but don’t worry. New working mod is ready & will be added soon. Stay Tuned. </p>
<p> Hey Joe, new working Spotify Premium mod is now available. Try to follow the steps again! </p>
<p> Hi Ryan, there were some issues with the existing version. We have updated the post with newer Spotify Premium mod. Try again now 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi @Authumnder:disqus, we have just updated this tutorial with a latest working Spotify Premium mod apk. I will recommend you to try again! </p>
<p> @demiladeakintan:disqus don’t know. It’s still working for me. In case Spotify kicks you out then you can use United States/Singapore VPN as a bypass to sign in to your account and continue enjoying Spotify Premium. </p>
<p> i think they got on it again (at the the one im using for the past 2 weeks or so) dont think there was an update. i cant do anything let alone play music. always says “premium feature” even on shuffle and all songs are unavaiable for me. EDIT: after few retries the app decided to boot itself offline (always says no internet connection even if there is one) </p>
<p> Hey @mastertm:disqus. I will recommend you to give the above tutorial a retry. I have uploaded newer version of Spotify Premium apk. </p>
<p> If it still doesn’t work for you then let me know… </p>
<p> WORKS. Nit sure hiw long, tho. Missing feature! Loud volume not appears in options. How can I boost it? </p>
<p> Hey @irevolutioneu:disqus, are you talking about extreme quality streaming feature? It is under Settings -> Music Quality section. You will see a drop down menu there. </p>
<p> Nope, I was talking about a “Volume Level:” “Silent/Normal/Loud” option (or very similar that I just had on the offical version of spotify like when I wrote the message. </p>
<p> Yup! Downloading will never be supported. You need to pay for Spotify Premium to enjoy this feature. Other features work though… </p>
<p> when i login it says premium activated but when i go to download a song it asks me to start free trial EDIT: nevermind lol </p>
<p> Hey @Aienma01:disqus, the guide still works. I have updated the APK too. </p>
<p> Just repeat the steps mentioned in the guide. Also, I will suggest you to try United States VPN instead of Singapore VPN. </p>
<p> Is it necessary to run BrowseSec/VPN and have it Connected to Singapore? I tried Connecting it to United States, and I have also turned off BrowseSec app on Android. The Spotify Premium still works (4/14/18) without BrowseSec. </p>
<p> Not necessary. United States works too now. The tutorial has been updated with this information. Also, you need to use Browsec in the beginning phase only. And in case Spotify logs you out in future then you will need to use Browsec to activate Spotify Premium. </p>
<p> Hi @anamaerabago:disqus, it seems like you are trying Spotify for the first time and you didn’t understand how Spotify and Spotify Premium works. </p>
<p> Let me explain it to you… </p>
<p> The link to Spotify apk provided in this article is for a modified version that will let you enjoy almost all the Spotify Premium features without going premium or without even starting a trial period. </p>
<p> All you really need to do is follow the instructions provided in the article above and once you are logged in to your Spotify account you should be able to use all the premium features for free. </p>
<p> For example, the free version of Spotify will NEVER allow you to skip songs OR play the music of your choice from the playlist. If you are able to perform these tasks then you are on Spotify Premium! </p>
<p> I hope this explains how Spotify Premium works for free. If you have any questions or confusion then feel free to ask. 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi James, please try again. The Spotify Premium works now. We have updated the guide as well as Spotify Premium apk. </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_d0UaOWbv99:disqus, you don’t really need to start free trial. All the Spotify Premium features works without starting the trial period. Though if you are looking for a way to listen to Spotify music offline then unfortunately that won’t be possible with this modded apk and you will need to opt for Spotify Premium and actually pay for this feature. </p>
<p> Apart from that, almost all the Spotify Premium features works perfectly with the provided Spotify apk! </p>
<p> I followed the steps but premium only worked for the trial period? Does it require browsec everytime I go online? </p>
<p> Hey @anamaerabago:disqus, if you followed all the steps correctly then you should be able to enjoy all the Spotify Premium features on your free account. And Browsec VPN is only required when you are logging in to Spotify for the first time. </p>
<p> My account automatically signs out and when I put in my info it doesn’t log in. If I try making a new account it brings a pop up saying ‘internet connection needed’ and it’s connected to the internet. Please Help … </p>
<p> Hi @rosannemendonca:disqus! Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> 1. On your Android, go to ‘Settings’ -> ‘Apps’ and in the list of installed apps look for Spotify and tap on it. </p>
<p> 2. Now tap on ‘Clear Data’ button. </p>
<p> 3. Open Browsec VPN app (install it if you haven’t already) and use United States as location. </p>
<p> 4. Open Spotify and log in using your credentials. </p>
<p> Hey, @disqus_ZTWVya6ULs:disqus! It still works for me. I just tried 🙂 </p>
<p> What’s the error you are experiencing? Could you please share more details as it will help me in finding out why it isn’t working for you. </p>
<p> Wow! It worked, was able to enjoy premium features. I’ve tested other mods and procedures but they all failed somehow. Thank you for your work, I followed exactly the steps and voila I am now downloading albums for offline play. Thanks again, your work is really appreciated. </p>
<p> Hey, this sometimes happens with Spotify. Fix for this is really simple. Follow these steps: </p>
<p> 1. On your Android, go to Settings -> Apps and in the list of installed apps look for Spotify and tap on it. 2. Now tap on Clear Data button. 3. Open Browsec VPN app (install it if you haven’t already) and use United States as location. 4. Open Spotify and log in using your credentials. </p>
<p> It worked!! Yaay I’m so happy, thanks guys! Quick question tho, do I have to leave the VPN running when I am not using Spotify or can I turn it off and then back on when I need to??? </p>
<p> Yes. You can do that. Also, VPN is not necessary once you got the Spotify Premium working. </p>
<p> I just followed thw steps. Until I logged in and start to listen a song, something popped out that said “Go Premium”. I clicked on it, something was processed then “You have 7 days free trial”. Is that necessary? Or I failed the steps. Like after 7 days, I need to buy and pay for premium??. </p>
<p> Hey @hoodybae:disqus, starting that 7-days free trial wasn’t required. The Spotify Premium apk will let you enjoy all the premium features without any problem. Though your Spotify account is still ‘free’ which is the reason why you saw that popup for Go Premium. </p>
<p> I don’t think you need to pay for premium. 7-days are just for trial to let you test run all the premium features. Paying or not paying is completely your choice and Spotify Free will work once 7-days trial is over. </p>
<p> Hi Carmela, you didn’t have to start that 7-days free trial. The Spotify Premium apk we have provided will let you use all the premium features without starting trial. </p>
<p> I followed all the steps but when I try to create a account it says I need to connect to wifi even though I am. </p>
<p> thanks for this tutorial but I dont understand something…You said that after I get the Spotify to work I will no longer need for the vpn to be running in the background…is that correct? </p>
<p> after installing, everything works. But I did get an email asking to confirm my account. Should I click the confirmation, or is it best not to? Thank you for all the hard work. </p>
<p> I have installed and everything works fine. I did receive an email asking to confirm my account. should I click on the confirmation link or is it best not to? Thank you for all the hard work </p>
<p> I logged in with a previous non premium account in this modded apk, and imI getting every premium feature, fine! But I’m not getting the daily playlists spotify used to make for me based on what artists I followed! This SUCKS!! </p>
<p> The only way to listen offline is by recording the music using built-in recorder and then listening to it later or you have to pay. </p>
<p> Sometime down the road when I get a new device, will I be able to transfer this same account to that device? Or will I have to do this again and lose playlists and things? </p>
<p> Hey @chrisfosnot:disqus, all your playlists and favorites are stored in your Spotify account. You should be able to login using the same account on multiple devices and it will be synced everywhere. 😉 </p>
<p> is the streams are counted here? and the name where it is randomly typed can be change? </p>
<p> works really great except that i cant download the music/playlist.. then its asking me to upgrade to premium besides that everything is perfect no ads and i can skip songs how much i want and when i want </p>
<p> It tells me to get Premium when I try and download the songs but everything else works fine. Does any one know how to fix this? The equalizer also is not available so I think this may be an outdated version of Spotify? </p>
<p> Did you try again, @disqus_ZSvFuXAiOp:disqus? Equalizer feature is working for me. </p>
<p> It’s work but one question, possible to play it offline or just the free Skips and ads free is the cover of this APK? Thanks by the way. </p>
<p> Offline won’t work because that feature is directly linked to your account. You need a Premium account for that. </p>
<p> It appaently all worked well for me 😀 thank you, I’ve been searching for this tutorial for a long time ago… but I still want to know: what’s about the download option? will I still listen to my music when I’m offline ? thanks again 🙂 </p>
<p> Offline/Download won’t work because that is a server-side feature and linked directly to your account. To enjoy downloading you must need to have a Premium Spotify account. </p>
<p> Just wondering, do you have to keep the VPN on during the whole time that you’re listening to the spotify app, or once you’ve downloaded the premium version, can you uninstall the VPN? </p>
<p> Mohammad thnx man! Is there anyway to stream the music from this app to a Wi-Fi speaker? I can’t se;ect another device 🙁 </p>
<p> Hi! Thanks for your work! Seems to work for me for skipping songs all I want, so thanks! 😀 There is one thing not working (maybe you are aware of it): the songs that are grayed-out and not playable with a free account, are not even shown when using your premium approach. Can you confirm this, or is it only on my side? </p>
<p> Sorry, just realized there is a “Show unplayable songs” option that was disabled. So the disabled songs are showing, but unplayable tho 🙂 Anyway, great work! </p>
<p> What’s the error you are experiencing? Please share more info so that I can help you further. </p>
<p> Hussain saab, one question. Spotify mod is working flawlessly. BUT Google Assistant will tell me “choosing songs is only allowed for premium members” when I ask it to play a specific song on Spotify. Then it will play a random playlist “inspired” by the song I requested. I tried unlinking and re-linking my Spotify credentials from the Google Home app but it will still do this. Any way to get it to play nice with spotify on the phone? </p>
<p> Obviously, it won’t work with Google Assistant because it checks with the Spotify servers if you are actually a Premium user or Free user. However, in this case, you are using a mere trick to enable few Premium features. Your Spotify account is still Free. To verify if you are Premium or Free user, try downloading a song, Spotify won’t let you. </p>
<p> I don’t get it, at first I could download songs and listen to them without wifi and now suddenly it doesn’t work is there some way to get it back or what? </p>
<p> It happens sometimes. Try clearing Spotify app data by going to App Info on your Android device. Then enable Browsec VPN and then try to login. You should be able to use Spotify now. </p>
<p> Once you are successfully logged in then you can disable VPN. </p>
<p> This trick will not enable downloading option because that’s a server-side thing and cannot be hacked. So you can’t use offline listening mode. Other features work fine though! </p>
<p> For those having trouble logging back in, here’s what worked for me: </p>
<p> – click “having trouble logging in” and enter your email – you should receive an email with your username – log in with username and not with email address </p>
<p> In order to log in with email again, do the following: </p>
<p> – log into your Spotify account on a browser – update your location to USA – you can now log in to the app with your email address and without using a vpn </p>
<p> Hey @disqus_mOGtAruuEf:disqus, glad you found a workaround and shared with the fellow Android users 😀 </p>
<p> However, there’s a much simpler approach to the problem where you are having trouble logging back in: </p>
<p> 1. Clear Spotify app data. 2. Open Browsec and enable VPN. 3. Open Spotify and login using your credentials. 4. Once successfully logged in, disable VPN. 5. Enjoy Spotify Premium without VPN 😉 </p>
<p> That’s how simple it is. Give it a try and let me know. </p>
<p> And thanks for stopping by and sharing what worked for you! 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi, I can’t update my location to USA there’s no other option but the country where I lived in which is Philippines. Im having the unable to login/either username or password is incorrect. </p>
<p> Hi @janeruis:disqus, you don’t need to update your location to USA. All you need to do is first clear the Spotify app data and cache. And then enable Spotify VPN, then enter your login username and password and tap on Login. </p>
<p> It should work and you will be logged into your Spotify account. </p>
<p> In case you are still unable to login then please let me know. I will help you out! 🙂 </p>
<p> Hello, i have a question if you don’t mind. You know artist fanbases use spotify for stream purposes and we were thinking using this but we’d like to be sure that our streams will count as “premium”. Do you happen to have any idea about this? Because this VPN accounts seems to only have some Premium features, not all of them. Thanks for in advance. </p>
<p> Hi @yumiy:disqus! Hope you are having a great day.. </p>
<p> Nope. I don’t think any of the stream with the above method would count as premium because this is just a workaround to let you enjoy few Spotify premium features. This method never changes your account status. In front of Spotify, you still have a free account. </p>
<p> Ah, i see. It’s a shame but nonetheless thanks for your all efforts!! Please have a great day~ </p>
<p> In case you are automatically logged out of Spotify app then all you need to do is, on your Android phone, clear app data of Spotify app then enable Browsec VPN, open Spotify, and login using your credentials. </p>
<p> Once you are successfully logged in, then disable VPN. Now you can enjoy Spotify Premium for free without VPN 😉 </p>
<p> So just to clarify, with the updated version, if i login with my already existing account i wont be detected and banned? :0 </p>
<p> Yes @bluwn:disqus. It will let you login. But you must need to use the method given in the blog post above 🙂 </p>
<p> You need to have root access on your phone to delete system apps. If you are a novice user and don’t know anything about rooting then I will recommend you to first search on the Internet about all the pros and cons of rooting Android device. Once you are knowledgeable enough only then proceed. </p>
<p> If you need any help then feel free to ask here or on our official forum here. </p>
<p> Now I’m not able to log in 🙁 already tried clearing the app data, uninstalled and installed the latest version provided on this site, browsec installed and nothing. Is there a new workaround? </p>
<p> Hey is there any way to make it so I can download music? I used to be able to using this apk download but apparently not now? </p>
<p> So I downloaded using VPN, its connected and everything, I even created a new account but I still cant download my music? </p>
<p> I used to be able to download it but then I opened an app while playing my music and the app forced stopped my music and when I opened Spotify again all my music was ‘undownloaded’ and i couldnt redownload it. </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_gNM6ggLk50:disqus Download is server side feature and you can’t get it via cracked apps. This app only provides features like ad blocking and unlimited skips. </p>
<p> Yeah I understand that now but it was will weird that I was able to download music before?? </p>
<p> Also, I got a random ‘watch this for 30 mins ad free songs!’ ad despite using this apk. For now theres still no ads but that was weird + my songs took longer to play than usual when it happened. Could it be a glitch? </p>
<p> Thanks. I got my spotify premium. Can i uninstall the VPN app thingy? Or do i still need it? </p>
<p> At me Spotify is pre-intalled app. I can just disable it make passive, but not delete. So this don’t works for me. </p>
<p> Thank god i finally found something that worked. Thank you so much.. i appreciate so muc your work and thank you for this. 👏💗 But to be honest i wish we could download music too but we cant have everying, can we?;) </p>
<p> Hey @disqus_c2DdgGcfVh:disqus, thank you so much for the appreciation 🙂 Download is a server side feature and requires premium Spotify account. </p>
<p> Good day bro , it works very well thank you so much , but is there anyway i can download the songs ? </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_b0lSxxg5Zd:disqus, unfortunately downloading is not supported on this modded Spotify app. But you are free to enjoy other premium features like unlimited skips for free 😉 </p>
<p> My spotify logged me out (no idea why, it happened when I wasnt on the app) and now I cant log back in. The button just goes from logging in… to login straight away. How?? </p>
<p> Hey @disqus_gNM6ggLk50:disqus, that usually happens with this modded Spotify app. All you need to do is the following and it will work afterwards: </p>
<p> 1. Clear Spotify app data on your Android. 2. Open Browsec and enable VPN. 3. Open Spotify and login using your credentials. 4. Once successfully logged in, disable VPN. 5. Enjoy Spotify Premium without VPN. 😉 </p>
<p> Hi @sebastiankilmer:disqus, please tell me the version number and I will get a modded apk for that specific version for you 🙂 </p>
<p> Seems to work fine, only thing: Android Auto does not see the app, probably because it’s not legit anymore. So sadly it’s useless for me 🙁 </p>
<p> I don’t know what else should I do, I followed it, but I always get the error Unable to login. Either username or password is incorrect. I get the same error either I sign up or log in. Please help…. </p>
<p> Hi @janeruis:disqus, please try clearing your Spotify app data and cache. And then give it another try. It will work for sure! 😉 </p>
<p> Hi, I’ve already done that actually but still get the same error. Anyway, this updated mod doesn’t seem to work on my device, good thing I still have a copy of the previous one, last march, I’ve installed that and still works perfectly fine. </p>
<p> Hi @janeruis:disqus, glad you still had a working version. Though I just reuploaded a Spotify Premium modded apk and I thought I should let you know that it should work on your device too. The issue has been fixed and you can download the apk from here 🙂 </p>
<p> I can’t log in nor can I sign up by fb. Btw I already had a Spotify account before </p>
<p> Use your exisitng Spotify account. But please clear Spotify data and cache from the Android app settings first before giving it another try. Also, use Browsec VPN while logging in for the first time. </p>
<p> Yes. You can use your non-modded and free Spotify account with this Spotify Premium app 🙂 </p>
<p> same with me. no matter what combination, account or strategy I used, it just doesn’t work </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_pJKT6OE4um:disqus, could you please try clearing the data and cache of Spotify app and then give it another try. It should work after that! </p>
<p> Already did that as well as everything covered in this article and comments section. </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_pJKT6OE4um:disqus, thanks for the update! I checked the APK and found an issue somewhere in the file. I have fixed the issue and reuploaded the new Spotify apk file. </p>
<p> Please uninstall the current Spotify app from your Android phone and download the new APK from here or from the link given in the “Step 2” above. It should work now. </p>
<p> nope, still not working. I cleared cache and data, uninstalled. reinstalled your apk, ran Browsec, tried signing in with my facebook account and the screen just swipes and comes back to sign in options. </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_pJKT6OE4um:disqus, glad to hear that you finally managed to log into your Spotify account. </p>
<p> As already mentioned in the blog post as well as in other comments, this Spotify mod apk will never let you download music because that’s a premium feature and requires you to have a paid Spotify account. Also, downloading feature is directly linked to your Spotify account and it is a server-side feature. </p>
<p> And of course, you are going to see the upgrade to premium notification because your account is still free. This Spotify Premium mod apk will let you enjoy other premium features like unlimited skips, ability to select music manually from the album, high quality music listening, blocked advertisements. </p>
<p> I hope you understand how this app works now! And please don’t forget to share this with your friends 🙂 </p>
<p> I created 2 Google account just to use this app but I’m getting signup and login error </p>
<p> Hi @bamangtachung:disqus, the app is still working fine for me. Could you please try clearing the data and cache of Spotify app and then give it another try. </p>
<p> Hi @bamangtachung:disqus, thanks for the heads-up. Seems like there was some issue with the Spotify apk. I have fixed the issue and reuploaded the Spotify Premium apk. </p>
<p> Please uninstall the current version of Spotify from your Android device and download the updated version from the link given above, and then give it a try. It should work now. 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi Mihai, please uninstall the currently installed Spotify apk from your Android device and download the latest Spotify Premium apk from here. And then try to sign up or sign in using your existing Spotify account. It will work. </p>
<p> Hi Peyton, what’s not working? Could you please be more specific so that I can help you further? </p>
<p> It’s working for majority of our readers, even for me. </p>
<p> What’s the error you are experiencing? Please let me know so that I can guide you. </p>
<p> Wow, I cannot believe this actually works (at least, so far). I was blocked from the old modified apps months ago when they started to crackdown, and I didn’t realize it had been worked around. Nice! </p>
<p> Hey Carmen! I don’t know why you are hearing audio ads. Advertisements are completely blocked in the app. I am a regular user of Spotify app and I never came across a single ad. And not only me, there are hundreds of users who have tried the same Spotify app and they never reported any issue with ads. </p>
<p> I will recommend you to please make sure you are using the Spotify mod apk version provided in this article and then try again. 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi Hannah, if you referring to your phone’s internal storage data then yes it will consume some data depending on the number of music you have played through Spotify. Though most of that data is stored in a form of cache, which can be cleared by going to app settings. 🙂 </p>
<p> Hey Robert, how do you know the Spotify is normal and not the premium? </p>
<p> In case you are clueless, the easiest way to find out is to try to open any music album and manually select a music from the list. If you are able to do that then it means you have Spotify Premium. </p>
<p> Hi Gogo San, if in any case it stops working or won’t let you login then all you need to do is follow the troubleshoot guide we have posted in the article above. That will solve the issue. 🙂 </p>
<p> Guys, what will be added if you do it ? Only unlimited skips or you can download too the songs? </p>
<p> Hallo, I the apk doesn’t work it will go automatically to playstore. Can you help me please. </p>
<p> tried this today and it worked! I hope it will continue on… weehee! Thanks for sharing this trick! 🙂 </p>
<p> The app is working perfectly for me, but the only issue I have is that there’s no icon on my homescreen to open it. In order to open it, I have to go to Settings — Apps — Spotify. And there doesn’t seem to be a way to get a shortcut to my home screen. </p>
<p> I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and it’s PERFECT. I don’t mind the inability to use offline as I have free music streaming from T-Mobile. Yes it’s an older UI version but it works great. Unlimited skips and on-demand selection work great. App is not buggy and I’m very happy you did this for us! </p>
<p> so I just found out that this is just downloading a Laptop/tablet mode of spotify on your phone….its fine to have unlimited skips but I hate the ads tho </p>
<p> I’m Using Windows 10, but when playing Spotify. The song stuck when on 6 seconds, How do I repair it ? </p>
<p> but in other hand, I tried on my phone and this works . Thanks ;D </p>
<p> Yes, but if you are asking about Spotify Android APK then you will first need to install Android Emulator on your PC. </p>
<p> Please log in again. The login page will open in a new tab. After logging in you can close it and return to this page. </p>

<p> Google Account Manager APK </p>
<p> Google Account Manager apk download for Android phone and tablet devices. Google is serving as the backbone of Android smartphones, </p>
<p> Download APK File </p>
<p> App Details & Guide </p>
<p> Google Account Manager apk download for Android phone and tablet devices. Google is serving as the backbone of Android smartphones, where all the applications are synced to a Gmail account. Gmail, Google, Hangouts, and YouTube, all are linked via a shared Gmail account. But it is not necessary to have a single Gmail account for our email communications, and multiple Gmail accounts are used for different professional and personal communications. So it is important to have a Google account manager working at the back to maintain all the Google accounts. </p>
<p> The smartphone penetration is around 45 percent globally, with the open-source Android operating system implemented. Android smartphones come equipped with inbuilt Google application, including: </p>
<p> All of these Google applications are linked and operated by a standard Gmail account. This article will help you to understand the mechanism of how the Google Account manager synchs these accounts. There are other uses of this app, which include password recovery, protection, and other Google accounts’ privacy. You can sync your contact with your Google account and recover them on any device. You can bypass the factory restore settings in case you forget your password. </p>
<p> About Google Account Manager APK </p>
<p> Google Account Manager apk is a utility app that allows Android smartphone users to bypass factory reset protection. It is always a hassle to change phones. Importing the contacts, photos, and other phone contents requires so much time transferring the data from the old phone to a laptop or any other device. The same process is then reversed to transfer the data to the new phone. This app saves users from all this fatigue. </p>
<p> Many users have different Gmail accounts for multiple purposes. One account serves the purpose of all the formal and professional communications. There is one account that is used only to have personal data, backups, contacts, and other related stuff. Some of the institutions and organizational accounts can also be accessed via Gmail. In this way, the user ends up setting up all the accounts on one device. It can also result in a lot of mess and confusion when it comes to syncing other Google products. Google Account Manager plays an essential role in managing all these accounts in a single click. </p>
<p> Features of Google Account Manager for Android </p>

<p> All Major Google Assistant Commands: Ok/Hey Google </p>
<p> Almost every Android phone and device comes equipped with a Google app and voice search assistant, and once that is </p>
<p> Almost every Android phone and device comes equipped with a Google app and voice search assistant, and once that is linked to your Google account and activated. Merely saying the Google Assistant commands like “Ok Google” or “Hey Google” will wake up the assistant, and your phone will go into listening mode. All ready to listen and understand your command in any supported language. </p>
<p> Over a period of several years, Google has made considerable improvements in its voice searches and actions on the Google Assistant app as well as Google Home and Home Mini devices. It has been polished so much that you can give commands to Google as if you are talking to another human being. </p>
<p> Google Assistant is highly capable, from controlling your smart lights to air conditioner and heater as well as finding out details related to your favorite TV show, all using your voice. </p>
<p> Ok Google and Hey Google Commands Cheat Sheet </p>
<p> Here is a cheat sheet to help you give an idea about the things that you can get done using Google Assistant in your day-to-day routine: </p>
<p> How To Enable Ok Google/Hey Google Command? </p>
<p> Follow these steps to enable voice commands on your phone or other Android devices: </p>
<p> Open the Google app. </p>
<p> At the bottom, tap on the More button. </p>
<p> Tap on Settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Voice, and here you will see a section for Hey Google. Tap on Voice Match. </p>
<p> Here you need to enable Hey Google option. </p>
<p> You will now be able to access Google Assistant any time you say “Hey Google,” even when if your screen is off. </p>
<p> Everyday Routine </p>
<p> Throughout your day, Google Assistant can help you with several tasks, provided how much of the things around you are automated. </p>
<p> Saying commands like: </p>
<p> Ok Google, let’s go home. This will trigger actions for the way to home like giving you traffic updates, playing your favorite playlist, read and send texts, or anything else you have configured. </p>
<p> Hey Google, good morning. The assistant will turn off the lights, tell you about the weather conditions, play your favorite podcast or news. </p>
<p> Using the Routine option within Google Assistant, you can personalize the commands and actions. You can even create new routines too. </p>
<p> Here’s how: </p>
<p> On your Android device, open Google app. </p>
<p> Tap on the More button, located at the bottom right corner. </p>
<p> Tap on Settings > Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Your profile will open along with the settings options and tabs on the top. Tap on the Assistant tab. </p>
<p> From the list of options, tap on Routines. </p>
<p> From this screen, you can either create a new routine from scratch or customize the ready-made routines. The possibilities are endless. </p>
<p> Communicate with Your Friends </p>
<p> Here are some ways using which you can communicate with your friends with the help of Google Assistant: </p>
<p> Call a friend or a relative: “Call Mom” or “Call John.” </p>
<p> Text a friend: “Text Joseph that I will be there in 10 minutes.” </p>
<p> Send an email: “Send an email to Kim, subject photography class reminder, message, Hi Kim, there is a photography class this weekend at 10 a.m., full stop.” </p>
<p> Send a message via WhatsApp: “Send a WhatsApp message to Carl.” </p>
<p> Command To Unlock Your Phone Using Voice </p>
<p> Believe it or not, Google Assistant works even when your device is locked, and the screen is off. However, specific voice commands require you to unlock your device using PIN or fingerprint to proceed further. </p>
<p> Google Assistant, if configured to unlock your phone, can bypass these added security steps and can unlock your phone by just using voice command. The procedure is simple: </p>
<p> NOTE: The voice unlock feature works on limited Android OS, including Android 5.0 to Android 7.1. Whereas, Google has removed voice unlocking support for the newer Android OS. </p>
<p> On Google Assistant settings, you first need to register a trusted voice model. </p>
<p> Once your voice model has been trained and recognized successfully with Google, you can then enable voice unlock functionality through Google Assistant settings menu. </p>
<p> The voice unlock functionality requires you to enable “Access with Voice Match” as well as “Unlock with Voice Match.” </p>
<p> Open Apps with Voice Commands </p>
<p> There are instances where we do have our phone in front of us, but we can’t actually use them. Let’s say, while you are doing dishes. </p>
<p> So, for example, you want to see your recent messages. Simply say, “Hey Google, open Messages app,” and Google Assistant will open the Messages app on your phone. </p>
<p> Using this same command, you can open almost any app on your phone, including third-party apps. </p>
<p> Get Advice and Information About Nearby Restaurant, Shop, or Eatery </p>
<p> We usually get clueless about where to go out for dining or shopping when the weekend is just around the corner. The Google Assistant can help you find all the nearby restaurants, eateries, shops, and malls within a matter of seconds. </p>
<p> Simply ask, “Hey Google, show me nearby eateries,” and it will return with all the restaurants that are near your current location. You can then find and shortlist location based on star ratings or their current offers. </p>
<p> Using this simple command, you can find and discover a new restaurant or place, depending on what you are looking for. </p>
<p> Find About Current Weather Situation </p>
<p> Are you planning a weekend road trip to another state? It is important to make sure the weather remains within your favor and find out how the conditions are going to be so that you can plan accordingly. </p>
<p> The best option is to pick up your phone and ask Google Assistant, “Ok Google, how’s the weather is going to be during the weekend?” and it will tell you if it will be cold, hot, humid, or rainy along with the wind conditions and complete forecast. </p>
<p> Quickly Setup Important Reminders </p>
<p> You can quickly set up important reminders about anything you have to do or something you are keeping somewhere and want Google Assistant to remember that for you, it will do that swiftly. Here’s what you have to tell: </p>
<p> “Hey Google, remind me to pay electricity bills on 15th at 12:30 p.m.” It will automatically create a reminder and ask you for a confirmation in case you want to make any modifications. </p>
<p> Similarly, you can use similar commands to remind you of a birthday or anniversary, or maybe that email that needs a reply. And it will automatically store that for you in the calendar app. </p>
<p> Can I Change/Customize Ok Google Command To Something Else? </p>
<p> Just like you, I have this question in my mind as well because, unlike Google, other brands have a human-like name. </p>
<p> For Apple, we have Siri. For Amazon, we have Alexa. For Microsoft, we have Cortana. But Google seems to be brand conscious here and want us to keep calling their brand name to wake up the AI assistant. </p>
<p> Although the AI behind Google Assistant is really very powerful and can help you get done a lot with just your voice, and plays a vital role in taking automation to the next level with the help of Google Home, mobile devices, and other gadgets/appliances that support or come equipped with Google Assistant. </p>
<p> But the question remains, can I change Ok Google command to something else? Is there any option to personalize the wake-up command? </p>
<p> Well, the straightforward answer is no. You can’t. Google just doesn’t want you to do that. </p>
<p> However, since we are talking about Android devices here, which by far are one of the most highly customizable software thanks to it being open-source, so there is actually a way to personalize and change Ok Google, or Hey Google wake up command to something else. 😉 </p>
<p> But that’s another topic, and I will share about that in a different blog post. </p>
<p> Until then, I would love to hear about your opinion about Google Assistant and want to know your thoughts regarding anything specific you want me to discuss or add to this post. Please feel free to let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Here we have a step-by-step guide on how to fix Google Play store has stopped working error on Android. </p>
<p> You will learn what does unfortunately Google Play store has stopped mean along with the methods to fix the error message on Android phone and tablet devices. </p>
<p> There might be some corrupted data and temporary information stored in the form of cache under Google Play store/services, which usually causes issues. </p>
<p> We can understand how annoying this issue gets as it completely stops you from doing anything on your phone or tablet because the errors keeps popping again and again. </p>
<p> Here we have tried and tested over 10 ways to help you fix the Google Play Store has stopped. </p>
<p> At one point or another, we all have experienced the Google Play has stopped error message that looks similar to, “Unfortunately, Google Play store has stopped working” or “Unfortunately, Google Play services has stopped working.” </p>
<p> The problem with this type of error is that the message continues to appear every 2 to 3 seconds, which don’t let you use your Android device and causes frustrations. </p>
<p> As a quick workaround, most of the Android user factory reset their phone or tablet device when the issue arise. Although the reset takes no more than five minutes but it removes all of your stored important data as well as the personalization you have made to your phone or tablet device. </p>
<p> But that is a last resort. And restoring your data after the reset procedure becomes time consuming. So we at BestForAndroid always prefer to resolve the issue without losing any data. </p>
<p> We have created a list of 10 easiest and reliable solutions with proper steps that will help you fix Google Play store has stopped working error message. </p>
<p> How to fix Google Play store and Google Play services has stopped working </p>
<p> Before trying the mentioned fixes and solutions, we will suggest that you go through few obvious checks on your Android device i.e. make sure the Internet connection is in a working state, you may need to switch from a cellular data connection to Wi-Fi or the other way around. </p>
<p> This is suggested because sometimes there are connectivity issues with Wi-Fi router that causes this problem with Google Play. </p>
<p> If the ones mentioned above didn’t solve Google Play has stopped working issue then try the following 10 solutions one by one to fix Google Play has stopped working error on Android: </p>
<p> 1. Clear Cache and Data of Google Play Store </p>
<p> Every Android app stores some part of data and files on your Android device for later usages like images, formatting, and other relevant files. These cache and other relevant data are stored on your device to save time and processing power when you reopen the app later because all of the cached data are served quickly. </p>
<p> Sometimes these cached data and app data are corrupted that causes certain apps to stop unexpectedly. But good thing is that we can easily clear cache and data with just a tap on the button. </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: Clearing Play Store data is like pressing a reset button as it removes your saved account information like Google account login details. After clearing data, Google Play will ask you to enter your Google username and password again so make sure you remember your login details before following the steps. </p>
<p> Here are the steps: </p>
<p> Go to Settings then tap on Apps. </p>
<p> In the list of apps, look for Google Play Store and tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on Storage. </p>
<p> Tap on the Clear Cache and Clear Data button. </p>
<p> Now restart your device and see if the Google Play Store has stopped working error message reappears or not. </p>
<p> 2. Clear Data and Cache of Google Play Services </p>
<p> If clearing the Google Play Store cache and data did not fix the issue, then there are chances that clearing Google Play Services cache and data should help rectify the issue. </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: Clearing Play Services data will remove your saved account information like Google account login details. After clearing data, Google Play Services may ask you to enter your Google username and password again so make sure you remember your login details before following the steps. </p>
<p> Here are the steps: </p>
<p> Go to Settings then tap on Apps. </p>
<p> In the list of apps, look for Google Play Services and tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on Storage. </p>
<p> Tap on the Clear Cache and Clear Data button. </p>
<p> Now restart your device and see if the Google Play store has stopped working error message reappears or not. </p>
<p> 3. Clear Cache and Data of Google Services Framework </p>
<p> The Google Play Store and Google Play Services depend on Google Services Framework to make sure your data is properly synced with your account and everything is running smoothly. The Services Framework takes care of Google Play Store Services, syncing your contacts, Google Backup, and managing your account. </p>
<p> If there is an issue with the Google Services Framework then your device will not be able to connect to the Google servers and will cause the Google Play to stop unexpectedly. Clearing the cached data of the app refreshes it and forces it to download new data. </p>
<p> Here are the steps to clear Google Services Framework cache: </p>
<p> Go to Settings then tap on Apps. </p>
<p> Tap on the menu button located at the top-right corner. </p>
<p> Tap on Show system to see system apps. </p>
<p> In the list of apps, look for Google Services Framework and tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on Storage. </p>
<p> Tap on the Clear Cache and Clear Data button. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> After boot, the error message Google Play has stopped should no longer pop up. If it does, then there are plenty of methods to fix this issue. Don’t lose hope yet. </p>
<p> 4. Reset App Preferences </p>
<p> There are chances that you have accidentally disabled an important part of Android system (for example Download Manager) which sometimes causes the Google Play to stop. So for problems related to the app preferences, Android has provided us with a reset app preferences option. </p>
<p> It’s simple and easy. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings and tap on Apps. </p>
<p> On the top-right corner, there must be a menu button. Tap on it. </p>
<p> And you will see an option that says, Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Tap it and then restart your device for the changes to take effect. </p>
<p> This will re-enable all the disabled apps which may be causing issues with the Google Play. </p>
<p> 5. Make Sure Download Manager Is Enabled </p>
<p> Android comes with native Download Manager app that is used by Google Play Store and Google Play Services to download updates for apps as well as the Google Play itself. But some apps with download option modify that functionality by disabling Download Manager, which causes Google Play to stop. </p>
<p> Don’t worry. The steps to enable Download Manager are simple. Here’s how: </p>
<p> Go to Settings and under Devices section you will find Apps, tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on the menu button located on the upper-right corner, and select Show system. </p>
<p> In the list of apps, you need to find the following two apps, tap on it, and make sure each one of them is enabled: </p>
<p> Download Manager, and </p>
<p> Downloads. </p>
<p> If both of the apps were already enabled then we will suggest that you try other solutions we have mentioned in this article as one of them should fix Google Play has stopped working issue. </p>
<p> 6. Allow Background Data Usage and Enable WiFi Data Access </p>
<p> While troubleshooting the problem and finding out why Play Store is being stopped frequently, we found out about an option (i.e. Background Data) located under Data Usage, which is once configured will not allow the app to use cellular data in the background. Another option is Disable All Wi-Fi Data Access, which once enabled will not allow the app to access the Internet via Wi-Fi networks. </p>
<p> In case both of these options are enabled on your device then Google Play Store as well as Google Play Services will not be able to synchronize your device with your account and will cause both of the apps to stop unexpectedly. Moreover, it will prevent Google Play Store from updating any app. </p>
<p> To fix this problem, we need to make sure that important apps are allowed background data usage and have Wi-Fi data access. Here is how you can do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings and tap Apps. </p>
<p> Find and tap on Download Manager. </p>
<p> Tap on Data Usage. </p>
<p> Under Cellular data access, the toggle switch for Background data should be enabled. </p>
<p> And under the Wi-Fi data access, make sure the toggle switch for Disable all Wi-Fi data access is disabled. </p>
<p> Now, the above steps were for the Download Manager app. You need to perform similar steps for the following apps too: </p>
<p> Downloads, </p>
<p> Google Play Services, </p>
<p> Google Play Store, and </p>
<p> Google Services Framework. </p>
<p> Once you have verified all the above apps have background data access as well as Wi-Fi data access, then you need to restart your Android device. Once your device boots up, you will notice that the unfortunately, Google Play has stopped error message is gone. </p>
<p> 7. Check Date and Time Settings </p>
<p> Yes, incorrect date and time settings of your Android device can cause some serious issues with how the Google Play works. Mainly because the timestamp is used to synchronize your data and account information between your device and apps. </p>
<p> In most of the cases, date and time settings are automatically updated using your Internet connectivity or information provided by your network. So you first need to make sure automatic updates of date and time is enabled. </p>
<p> To check that, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Go to Settings and under System section you will find Date & time. </p>
<p> Here you will see a toggle switch that tells you whether the automatic date and time is enabled or disabled. </p>
<p> Enabling automatic date and time will force your Android device to use the network-provided date & time, and will not allow you to manually modify it. </p>
<p> In case the automatic date & time is already enabled then we will recommend that you disable it and try to manually configure the time and date while being as precise as you possibly can. </p>
<p> 8. Force update Google Play to the latest version </p>
<p> Google frequently releases a new version of Google Play Store, which brings bug fixes and improvements along with increased compatibility with other Android apps. Sometimes devices are stuck on old Google Play version but dependent apps are updated, this is what causes force closes and errors. </p>
<p> This is where we need to force the Google Play Store to update to the latest version. It’s easy and here is how you can do that: </p>
<p> On your Android device, open Google Play Store app and tap on the menu button. </p>
<p> Tap on the Settings. </p>
<p> Then under the About section look for Play Store Version and tap on it. </p>
<p> A pop-up message box will appear that says, Downloading and installation of new Google Play Store will begin shortly. </p>
<p> Now, it will take some time to download and install the latest Google Play version on your device. Once the new version with all the bug fixes will be installed then you will no longer experience Google Play has stopped error message. </p>
<p> 9. Remove Google Account from Your Device and Add It Again </p>
<p> There have been several instances when the Google account fails to sync your data and causes Google Play Store and Google Play Services to stop unexpectedly. To fix this issue, Android allows you to remove your Google account from your device and then re-add it without any data loss. </p>
<p> This simple procedure refreshes the link between your Android device and Google account, which eliminates the Google Play has stopped error from popping up again and again. Before proceeding, please make sure you remember your Google login details as you need to enter them after removal. </p>
<p> First, we will perform the steps to remove Google account from your Android device: </p>
<p> Go to Settings and under the Personal section, you will find Accounts. Tap it. </p>
<p> You will now see a list of all the accounts added to your device. Tap on Google. </p>
<p> Tap on the email address you want to remove. </p>
<p> On the top-right corner you will see a menu button, tap it. </p>
<p> We will now add the Google account again: </p>
<p> Go to Settings -> Accounts. </p>
<p> You will now be requested to enter your Google login details i.e. your email address and password. </p>
<p> The account should be added to your device and begin syncing your data. </p>
<p> That’s how simple it is. </p>
<p> 10. Uninstall Google Play and Then Update To The Latest Version </p>
<p> Unlike regular user apps on your Android device, Google Play Store and Google Play Services are system apps and cannot be removed or uninstalled like other apps because it is a part of Android system framework. Rather than letting you uninstall, Android allows you to uninstall their updates and rollback to the original factory default state. </p>
<p> This procedure is suggested because there are cases when Google Play is automatically updated to the latest version but then during the update process some bugs are left, which causes Google Play to stop repeatedly. </p>
<p> To fix this, we will go through the steps where we uninstall all the updates and then update it to the latest version. </p>
<p> First, we will remove updates for Google Play Services: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Under Device, you will find Apps. Tap it. </p>
<p> In the list of apps, find Google Play Services and tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on the menu button located on the top-right corner and then tap on Uninstall updates. </p>
<p> A popup will appear asking you, Replace this app with the factory version? All data will be removed. </p>
<p> Tap on OK button to uninstall updates. </p>
<p> Second, we will remove updates for Google Play Store: </p>
<p> Go to Settings -> Apps </p>
<p> In the list of apps, find and tap on Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Tap on the menu button located on the top-right corner and then tap on “Uninstall updates”. </p>
<p> A popup box will appear asking you; Replace this app with the factory version? All data will be removed. </p>
<p> Tap on OK button to uninstall updates. </p>
<p> Once the updates are uninstalled successfully, it is recommended to restart your device. In most of the scenarios after restarting your phone/tablet, the error message: Unfortunately, Google Play has stopped does not appear anymore. </p>
<p> Anyways, we will now go through the steps of updating Google Play Services and Google Play Store to the latest version. </p>
<p> First, we will update Google Play Store by following these steps: </p>
<p> Launch Google Play Store app on your Android device. </p>
<p> Tap on the menu button that is located on the upper-left corner. </p>
<p> Tap on Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll down until you find an option that says, Build number. Tap it. </p>
<p> You will see a popup about the new Google Play Store version. Then downloading and installation will begin shortly. </p>
<p> Now, we will update Google Play Services to the latest version: </p>
<p> Launch any app that relies on Google Play Services like Gmail, Maps, or Hangouts. </p>
<p> Just after launching the app, you will see a notification about Get Google Play services along with an Install button. </p>
<p> Tap on install and the latest version of Google Play services will be automatically downloaded and installed on your device. </p>
<p> Now restart your device to apply the changes. </p>
<p> That’s it. The whole process is a little bit longer but it should fix unfortunately Google Play has stopped error message on Android. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>

<p> Download APK File </p>
<p> App Details & Guide </p>
<p> Google Translate apk – It was a thing of the past when people used to communicate in sign language with those who speak a different language. Most of us have been through an awkward situation of not able to talk or understand different people while traveling around the world. </p>
<p> The language barrier has served not only as an obstacle for people to have a conversation with one another but for the tourists too who cannot understand the road signs and other message boards displayed. Huge credit goes to Google Translate apk for making our lives easy by allowing us to translate and understand multiple languages on the go. </p>
<p> We should not forget that the digital revolution has brought people from all across the globe together on one big platform, i.e., the internet. We now have the freedom to access any type of information by simply pressing a few buttons on our smartphones. With this type of data speed and information sharing, the language barrier is no longer a problem for travelers and tourists. </p>
<p> Google Translate app for Android is an innovative product by Google designed to facilitate us with language translation and understanding another language without hiring a translator or carrying a translation book. And it is not only about how to communicate with people who speak a different language, but with this app, we can even understand signs and other information displayed in a foreign country. </p>
<p> With easy access to billions of websites from around the world, all the information is now available in various languages. For instance, you may want to read the China-based website. That is where Google Translate will help you translate the whole web page to your preferred language. </p>
<p> About Google Translate APK </p>
<p> Google translate apk is quite a sophisticated language translator with Google’s translation engine working at the core. Google has deployed machine translation systems behind this masterpiece. All the data and text is first input to the machine, and then a translator is developed with the help of statistical learning algorithms. </p>
<p> In simpler words, when a user inputs a word or a phrase to be translated into another language, Google translate searches the historical data saved via machine learning algorithms and provides the best match in the desired language. In this way, the language repository is maintained and updated. </p>
<p> Currently, Google translate can translate over 100 languages and has 500 million users. There are different types of input facilities provided to the users. They can either type in the word/phrase, or speak or even take a photo of the sentence they want to be translated. Not only that, but users can also learn new languages and new phrases daily. </p>
<p> Before getting into further details of the Google translate apk, let’s have a brief overview of its history and how it has evolved. </p>
<p> The history of this state-of-the-art language translator dates back to 2001 when Google first launched it with a capacity to translate to-and-from English into eight other languages. </p>
<p> In 2003, the engineers at Google tried to level up this translation service, and by 2006, they came up with a high-speed statistical approach with the capability to translate a single word in less than a second. 2006 is considered to be a milestone achievement year since Google launched its two languages that include Chinese and Arabic. </p>
<p> After that, there has been no looking back for Google. They kept on adding new languages with a significant focus on high-quality, accurate translations and broader language spectrum. </p>
<p> The Google translate apk is not just limited to users inputting text, image, or voice; instead, it translates webpages on the go. Other features include the text written in mobile photos and captions on the Youtube videos. There is an exclusive conversation mode of “speech-to-speech” conversion available on the translate app used in smartphones. </p>
<p> Features of Google Translate for Android </p>
<p> Google translate apk is one of the most powerful language translators that is loaded with all the features ever possible to translate to the desired language on the go. The users can download language files to use in offline mode, browse and convert the webpages on the go, take a snap of the signboard, and translate or listen to the speaker and convert on runtime. </p>
<p> Google has left no stone unturned to make it one of the most utilized and trusted translation app. Here is a quick view of the Google translate apk features that are going to be discussed further in detail: </p>
<p> Easy text translations are available for more than 100 languages. </p>
<p> More than 50 languages can be downloaded on smartphones to be used in offline mode. </p>
<p> Runtime camera translations are available in more than 35 languages. </p>
<p> Users can input any photo to the Google Translate app and get that translated in 50 languages. </p>
<p> A real-time two-way conversation can be made in 32 languages. </p>
<p> Users can input words or phrases to be translated by handwriting and drawing text on smartphones’ screens. This feature is available for more than 90 languages </p>
<p> One can simply tap to copy any word or phrase on an Android smartphone, and the Google translation option automatically appears on the screen. </p>
<p> One can simply download Google translate on the Android phone. The sign-up process is a single button click, and it will automatically sync to the user’s Gmail account. Here’s how it works: </p>
<p> Google translate first confirms the primary language, and the most often language the user is going to translate. That allows Google to translate to save the users’ preference and to provide single tap translation conversion buttons. After the user inputs the choices and presses finished, the main screen is displayed on the screen. It is quite a handy and straightforward interface designed, keeping in view the users’ convenience to use it frequently. </p>
<p> The UI and UX of Google Translate APK </p>
<p> The top bar shows the languages the user selected during the sign-up process. The drop-down options are also available to change the languages as per the requirement. </p>
<p> The top left corner button in the menu bar where one can find the email account details with which Google translate is synced. Other options include home, phrasebook, offline translation, and settings. The settings menu has got multiple translation options for the users that can be turned on and off. </p>
<p> The first one is the tap to translate button that can be enabled by the user. That option allows users to tap any text on the browser or on the phone to translate via Google translate and confirms permissions regarding enabling the tap option since it will display the translate option on the text of other installed apps as well. </p>
<p> The next option is about the data settings that can be enabled or disabled, keeping in view the data speed available at any instant. For example, the user should keep in mind that Google translate will require high-quality speed when using text-to-speech conversion. </p>
<p> Also, the user can manage the data usage by enabling notification before downloading any language for offline use. It is entirely up to the user to allow Google to translate to retain text photos that can be used in the future to improvise the translations. </p>
<p> The users can also enable the translations from the image to be uploaded or clicked on runtime by the Android phone camera. For this, the app asks for the user’s permission to access the camera. One can select the Region to enhance translation quality and precision. </p>
<p> The user needs to set the speech speed to normal, slow, or slower. This speed is not related to conversion; rather, the speech input speed can be adjusted by the user for more clarity. The speech input gives two options to the users. The speak output can be enabled that will allow Google to translate to speak the text. Also, the offensive words can be blocked from the output speech. </p>
<p> Ways to Translate </p>
<p> Coming back to the options available on the home screen of Google translate. There are five options available: </p>
<p> Users can simply enter text on the space available. The app will start giving options, and the user can select the best suited. If it is just a single word that needs to be translated, then all the definitions and related information will be displayed on the screen. If it is a sentence, then it will be displayed with options to include it in highlight, copy to clipboard, share, full screen, start the conversation, and reverse translation. The star option allows the user to save the sentence in the phrasebook for future reference. </p>
<p> The camera option allows the user to take the photo at the very instant, or scan a document or import an image from the present gallery. This feature is handy to read the signboards, restaurant menu, ingredients, road signs, and other information displayed around. </p>
<p> The user can input the word or a sentence by handwriting on the screen. There is space and delete options for the user to complete the sentence while writing by hand. This tool gives freedom to handwrite words and phrases on the phone screen. Google translate learns the handwriting and starts giving the most matched options. The translation here is dependent on the handwriting of the user. Some may have not-so-good handwriting; that’s why it presents them with several options. </p>
<p> The conversation simplifies the entire typing or handwriting option by giving liberty to the user to speak the phrases to be translated. It works as two-way communication and is one of the most powerful features. For example, if a person is talking to a stranger and cannot speak in a foreign language, then Google translate conversation comes into action where two strangers can directly communicate with one another. </p>
<p> There is a voice option for the user to speak the word to be translated and get the desired result on the screen. </p>
<p> The history of the translations are displayed on the home screen and can be swiped either left or right to clear away the history. </p>
<p> Offline Language Translation </p>
<p> Google Translate provides offline language translation package downloading facility for more than 50 languages. The default languages selected by the user are already present in the offline translation section, while offline translation packs for other languages can be downloaded on the device. </p>
<p> You can simply tap on the language you want to download, and its size will appear on the message box. The sizes vary from 35 MB to around 90 MB. Offline language translation is one of the most important and popular features of the app that provides translation without internet access. </p>
<p> Pronunciation Assistance </p>
<p> Google Translate plays a vital role in helping the users to understand the correct pronunciation of the words. There is a speaker button right next to the word searched on the app, so one can tap on that to listen to the exact pronunciation of that particular word. </p>
<p> Google Translate as a Dictionary </p>
<p> On the top of the home screen of Google Translate app are shown the languages used as input and output of the translation. However, if the user taps on the input translation and changes it to “Detect language,” then this translation app can be transformed into a Dictionary. </p>
<p> The user can select any language on the output side, and here is a unified multi-language dictionary available on the Android phone. You will be presented with quite elaborative meanings, along with example sentences and synonyms. </p>
<p> Universal Translator </p>
<p> Although Google Translate apk for Android is a standalone app, but, upon your permission, it can be used to translate whatever shown on other apps running on your Android device. This way, you will be able to translate any word or phrase you read, whether it’s on Facebook, WhatsApp, or any news app. </p>
<p> To translate, you can tap on the word/sentence displayed within any app or website and select the translate option. An additional window of the translate app will appear on top of the screen with input and output language options. One can freely change the language options from that screen. </p>
<p> Travel Guide </p>
<p> Using the Phrasebook feature within the Google Translate for Android, you can save translations of the most common phrases that can be helpful before traveling to a foreign country. This way, you can quickly access those phrases before greeting anyone or asking for some assistance. The users can also take advantage of the conversation mode to talk to the people in real-time. </p>
<p> To add any phrase to the Phrasebook section, simply tap on the star next to a translation, and it will be saved and appear automatically. </p>
<p> Self-Learning </p>
<p> You can learn new languages for free using Google Translate. Download an offline language or start online from simple words’ translation to learning new sentences in any of your favorite languages like Spanish, Chinese, or even Persian. </p>
<p> Google Translator apk is definitely a handy and easy-to-use translator that comes with various features, including writing, speech, and photo input, to translate to more than 100 languages. It can facilitate you to translate any word anywhere on the Android phone, whether it is on another app or a web browser. One can use it online or download any language for offline use. </p>

<p> App Details & Guide </p>
<p> Are you looking for the GTA 5 APK to run the game on your Android phone? You have come to the right place where I will reveal the truth behind GTA V the manual app. Continue reading to find out… 🙂 </p>
<p> As you already know, Grand Theft Auto V is an all-in-one action, RPG, driving, and the shooting based game developed by Rockstar North and released by Rockstar Games. Soon after its release, the game quickly earned the rank of being one of the most popular and successful gaming titles. And the main reason behind this huge success is the scale of the open world as well as the amount of detailing in the fictional local neighborhood of Los Santos, the superior visual quality, and a lot of improvement in the overall graphics. </p>
<p> First of all, before we discuss about the game, it is better to clarify that Rockstar Games has not developed GTA 5 for Android because it is not possible to play GTA 5 on Android due to the limitations in smartphone and tablet hardware (including Processor, RAM, GPU) which is currently not capable enough to run this resource hungry game. Even if, in the near future, the Rockstar Games developers try to optimize GTA 5 to run on Android then the storage space requirement would be far greater than 10GB for the game data alone. </p>
<p> Moreover, there are dozens of websites on the Internet that claims to provide you GTA 5 APK for download or anything related to GTA 5 APK. Keep in mind that those are completely fake and there is a possibility that those APKs might contain Trojan and virus. </p>
<p> So, downloading and installing them on your Android phone or tablet may result in permanent data loss. I will suggest you stay away from those fake GTA 5 APKs. </p>
<p> Also, there are chances you will come across some modified or hacked GTA 5 APK, which in reality is a mod version of the original GTA San Andreas mobile app to make it look like GTA 5. </p>
<p> Apart from all that, the Rockstar Games did develop a GTA 5 app for Android, which apparently is an official game manual. Yes, that is only a manual. The manual is spread over 100 pages and includes almost everything required to help you play and complete the game. </p>
<p> Considering the enormous scale of the in-game world, it becomes necessary for the developers to design an app especially for manual so that players can keep it handy and know all the ins and outs of the map without ever needing to pause the game. </p>
<p> In the manual, you will find help for game controls, a full-featured tour of the local neighborhoods and available activities, an interactive game map with zoom capability so that you can explore the areas. All of which will help you find your way around the game’s open-world environment. </p>
<p> GTA 5: The Manual – Storyline </p>
<p> Unlike previous Grand Theft Auto series, the GTA 5 contains not one, not two but total three different lead characters i.e. Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips, and Franklin Clinton. And throughout the gameplay, you are free to switch between them at any moment you want. Also, there are some missions where two or more characters are involved, that’s exactly where the game will automatically switch the character to complete the certain objective of the mission. This strategic feature added tactical shooting elements, which alone helped the game to win the title for one the best games ever made. </p>
<p> What makes the Grand Theft Auto V different from any previous release of the series is the inclusion of multiple lead characters, the exceptional heist mission strategy, and remarkable world planning along with the great story structure. All of which combined makes the game interesting and stimulating than ever. </p>
<p> All three characters have their own set of over 8 skills, and each one of them has one unique expertise skill set. Like, Franklin has the ability to slow down the time while driving, Trevor has the ability to do twice as much damage to its enemies during combat, and Michael can enter time slice during combat. </p>
<p> The unique skill set of each character needs to be trained during the gameplay. And these skills are limited so whenever you use these special skills they will deplete. In case your character is running low on their special ability then you can easily replenish it by performing and practicing skillful actions. </p>
<p> There is even a GTA Online, which is also known as the online multiplayer mode, that allows up to thirty players to explore the huge in-game open world environment to simply engage as well as compete with each other in multiplayer missions and game matches. </p>
<p> And if you have played the previous releases of Grand Theft Auto then I am sure you must be aware that the character needs to complete the missions in order to unlock certain parts and localities. However, that’s not the case with the latest GTA V release. You are free to explore the whole open world environment right from the beginning of the game. However, as you complete missions and progress through the game then you will be able to unlock more interesting content and items. </p>
<p> Soon after the official release of Grand Theft Auto V, the game managed to break all the sales records of the industry by becoming the fastest selling game title in the history by generating over $1 billion during the first three days alone. </p>
<p> The huge virtual world and three lead characters are the main reason why the developers created GTA 5: The Manual app for Android, as it will be easier for the players to follow the 3D and interactive guide that you can keep handy at all times. Also, as the whole guide is easy to navigate around and will be available on your Android phone all the time, this way the player doesn’t even have to waste much time roaming around the huge world in search for any specific mission, area, or shop. </p>

<p> Cheat/Hack GTA SA, VC, III on Android with CLEO Mods Scripts [Tutorial] </p>
<p> Are you unable to use cheat codes in GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City, or GTA 3 on Android? Or </p>
<p> Are you unable to use cheat codes in GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City, or GTA 3 on Android? Or maybe you are looking for a way to use hacks and cheat codes in GTA Android through CLEO mods scripts but don’t know how to do that. </p>
<p> Here we have an in-depth tutorial to guide you through all the steps to help you use cheats and hacks in GTA with CLEO scripts on Android. 🙂 </p>
<p> In this in-depth tutorial post about hacking and cheating in all versions of GTA Android with CLEO mods scripts, you will learn about: </p>
<p> the basics of CLEO mods, </p>
<p> the best way to install CLEO on Android devices, and </p>
<p> how to cheat and hack GTA on Android with CLEO mod scripts. </p>
<p> What is CLEO Mods Scripts for Android </p>
<p> First things first, many of you might not know that CLEO scripts and CLEO mods were originally developed for PC to help gamers easily modify Grand Theft Auto game series as well as to let them add new items to enhance the overall gaming experience. On PC, you are playing the game using a keyboard, so you have a lot of unused keys which can be allocated to enable/disable many CLEO mods. </p>
<p> Then, soon after the release of GTA game series for Android devices, a developer over at GTAForums named Alexander Blade ported the PC version of CLEO to Android version to enable cheat codes. But we all know that Android devices operate via the touch screen, which means lack of buttons (as compared to PC). To overcome this limitation, the developers implemented CLEO Script menu. This menu can be accessed while playing GTA by performing predefined touch point gestures (we will discuss that later in this article). </p>
<p> Another issue was with the compatibility of scripts. The CLEO mods for PC use .cs extension scripts and operate with the keyboard. While the CLEO mods for Android use .csa and .csi extension scripts. So every PC CLEO mods, which you want to use on CLEO Android, must need to be manually checked and rewritten with a Sanny Builder tool. But to make things easier for every GTA player, developer have included some cheats and hacks scripts by default within the Android CLEO app. </p>
<p> Talking about GTA San Andreas in particular, the Rockstar Games have disabled cheat codes in the Android version by default. No matter what you use, including an external keyboard and a gaming controller, you will not be able to use cheat codes in the game. So, the only possible way to use all of those GTA San Andreas cheat codes in the Android version is by using CLEO SA scripts app. </p>
<p> However, the CLEO scripts are not developed for GTA SA only, but a couple of other GTA series too including GTA VC and GTA 3. That’s because with the help of CLEO scripts you can add many new features to the game as well as use unique hacks, all of which allows you to enhance the gaming experience. </p>
<p> The process of installation, as well as usage of CLEO scripts on Android for all GTA versions including GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City, and GTA 3, is exactly same. So in an attempt to make it easier for you to cheat and hack Grand Theft Auto on Android, I decided to provide CLEO installation and CLEO script usage guide here in one place. </p>
<p> Before we continue further, it is important to note here that CLEO app works on rooted Android devices only. In case your phone or tablet is not rooted then I will suggest you to first root your Android device otherwise CLEO cheats and hacks will not work. </p>
<p> Do you want to use cheats in GTA without rooting? We have an easy workaround for you i.e. JCheater for Android. Give it a try! 😉 </p>
<p> How to Install CLEO Mods Scripts for GTA Cheat/Hack on Android </p>
<p> This is the section where I will guide you step by step about how to install CLEO on your Android phone to use cheat codes on all the Android versions of GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City, and GTA 3: </p>
<p> Step 1 – Download and install CLEO app for your version of GTA from the Google Play Store using the link given below: </p>
<p> Yes, the developer has developed a separate app for each GTA Android series and all of them are free and comes bundled with cheat codes and mods scripts. </p>
<p> Step 2 – Once it is installed, launch the CLEO app. It will ask you to grant root permission. </p>
<p> Simply tap on the GRANT button to allow root access. </p>
<p> Step 3 – In the CLEO app, you will have two tabs i.e. CLEO and SA. (In case you are running CLEO for GTA 3 or GTA Vice City then you will have a second tab named either “III” or “VC”). </p>
<p> Tap on the SA to navigate to that tab. Alternatively, you can simply swipe left. 😉 </p>
<p> Step 4 – Here you will see four options including Install, Check, Install scripts, and Manage scripts. </p>
<p> First, you need to check if the installation of CLEO is possible on your device or not. To do that, tap on the “Check” button. Within a few seconds, a popup check log will appear. </p>
<p> If all the checks are passed then you will see, “Installation is possible” message. </p>
<p> Step 5 – Now you need to tap on the “Install” button to begin the installation of CLEO script engine in your game’s data folder. </p>
<p> It will take around 5-20 seconds, so wait for the installation to complete. You see an installation success message once the CLEO is installed in the GTA folder. </p>
<p> Step 6 – After successful installation of CLEO script engine, you need to install cheat and hack scripts. So tap on the “Install script” button to open a list of scripts. </p>
<p> As shown in the screenshot above, you will see a list of default scripts like Car Spawner, Cheats, and Health Regenerator. You have to install the scripts you need one by one. </p>
<p> Tap on the script name, a popup window will appear and then tap on the “Install” option. Once the selected script has been successfully installed, you will see a toast message that says, “Installed successfully”. </p>
<p> Step 7 – That is all for the installation. Now, in case you ever need to delete or disable any script, you can do so by going to the “Manage Scripts” section of the CLEO app. </p>
<p> Here you will see a list of all the CLEO scripts that are installed on your device. You can tap on the scripts you want to delete or disable. </p>
<p> A popup window will appear, and then you can select your desired option. </p>
<p> To learn how to use CLEO mods scripts and enable scripts during the gameplay, please head over to the next section… </p>
<p> How To Access CLEO Scripts Menu In GTA On Android </p>
<p> In this section, I will guide you about how to use and enable CLEO scripts to apply cheat codes and hacks to the GTA game. </p>
<p> But, before guiding you about how to enable CLEO scripts, first, it is important to learn about the essentials of CLEO scripts menu and exactly how CLEO scripts actually work on Android. </p>
<p> In case you don’t have GTA San Andreas for Android then you can download the game apk for free along with the complete data from here. 😉 </p>
<p> As you already know, in the beginning of this tutorial, we have already discussed that CLEO was originally designed for the PC version of GTA where you can enable and disable a large number of scripts just using a keyboard. But when the CLEO scripts were ported to the GTA Android version, the developers added an in-game CLEO scripts menu that appears over the game, as you can see in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Now to be able to open that menu, navigate around the list of scripts, and activate the scripts, you have to perform predefined gestures on the screen or use touch points. CLEO divides your screen into 9 touch points to make navigation easier. Those touch points are shown in the screenshot below: </p>
<p> Once you have memorized the touch points mentioned above then you can easily open scripts menu, quickly activate/deactivate CLEO scripts, and even navigate around the scripts menu while playing the game. </p>
<p> So now, without any further ado, let’s look at the tutorial on how to access CLEO scripts menu, enable/disable scripts, and use cheat codes in GTA on Android: </p>
<p> Step 1 – Open GTA game on your Android device and start your existing load game or a new game. </p>
<p> The moment your game is loaded, the first thing you are going to notice is the information about CLEO Android shown right next to the map (as highlighted in the screenshot above). </p>
<p> Step 2 – Once your game has been loaded then while keeping your character in a standing position you have to perform a swipe gesture from touch point #2 to touch point #8 to open the CLEO scripts menu. </p>
<p> CLEO scripts menu will appear right in front of the game, as shown in the screenshot. </p>
<p> Good job! 😀 </p>
<p> Head over to the next section where I will guide you about how to navigate around the scripts menu and enable scripts. </p>
<p> How To Enable CLEO Scripts And Use Cheat Codes In GTA Android </p>
<p> In the following tutorial, you will learn how to navigate around the CLEO scripts menu, how to enable scripts, and use cheat codes in GTA Android: </p>
<p> Navigation is very simple and easy. You can use four touch points to navigate around the CLEO scripts menu, those four touch points are highlighted with red boxes in the image below: </p>
<p> Touch point #2, center-top – Moves the selection to up. </p>
<p> Touch point #4, left-center – Moves the selection to left. </p>
<p> Touch point #6, right-center – Moves the selection to right. </p>
<p> Touch point #8, center-bottom – Moves the selection to down. </p>
<p> Step 1 – In the image below, you will notice that the first script on the list is currently highlighted, which means that the first script is selected. </p>
<p> Now to select the second script on the list, you have to tap on the touch point #8 (or the DOWN text). </p>
<p> Doing so will make the second script highlighted. As you can see in the above screenshot. </p>
<p> Step 2 – To enable/start any script, you have to tap on the center of the screen i.e. touch point #5. Here, I want to start the “cheats” script so I first highlight cheats script on the list and then tap on the touch point #5 to start it. </p>
<p> As you can see in the screenshot above, the script has been started and we are in the cheats script. </p>
<p> Step 3 – To make your navigation easy, the CLEO engine shows you four navigational texts i.e. UP, LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. </p>
<p> You can tap on these texts to navigate around the list of cheats. And because there are a lot of cheats and it is not possible to fit all of them on a single screen, so the list has been divided into several pages and you have to tap on the LEFT text or the RIGHT text to change pages. </p>
<p> Step 4 – To activate the selected cheat, you have to use touch point #5 i.e. tap on the center of the screen. Once the selected cheat is activated, you will see a text right next to the map that says, “CLEO cheat activated”. </p>
<p> Now, if you want to activate another CLEO cheat then you have to follow the same procedure again. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Congratulations! By now, you must have learned about the CLEO for GTA Android as well as how you can use the CLEO scripts to activate various cheat codes and hacks in GTA game series on Android. </p>
<p> Did the CLEO scripts help you in using cheat codes and hacks in GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City, and GTA 3?

<p> About GTA San Andreas APK </p>
<p> GTA: SA (also widely known as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas) is a popular and highly successful action, third-person shooter, driving, and RPG game by Rockstar Games and Rockstar North. It is a 7th gaming title in the series of Grand Theft Auto. </p>
<p> Similar to the gameplay structure followed by the previous Grand Theft Auto series, the GTA San Andreas apk also provides you an interactive third-person view which gives you complete control over the way you want to interact with the open-world game environment. You can freely roam around the areas, explore shops, restaurants, steal cars and bikes from the streets, and cause destruction to the property and attack pedestrians. </p>
<p> This life-like game mainly consists of three cities i.e. Las Venturas, Los Santos, and San Fierro. And within those cities, your character is capable of walking, jumping, swimming, running, and have the capability to use a wide variety of destructive weapons, drive different kinds of vehicles, fly helicopters, ride motorcycles, boats, trains, and even those destructive tanks. Apart from stealing vehicles from the citizens, you can even import exclusive vehicles and then customize (by adding nitrous) to make them more powerful. </p>
<p> In an attempt to give the in-game world a realistic touch, all of the locations include vast regions of forests, deserts, beautiful landscapes, hilly areas, ponds, and mountains. There are some restricted areas too. You are free to play and move your character around to explore the in-game world. </p>
<p> GTA San Andreas is the first game that brings some of the most remarkable capabilities to customize the appearance of the in-game character. To make it possible, there are clothing stores with accessories, tattoo shops, hair salons, restaurants, and even a gym. Apparently, if you force your character to eat a lot of food then he will become fat then you need to take him to the gym for workouts and training to make him muscular and stay healthy. </p>
<p> Now you know that there is a lot to achieve and accomplish within the game. Apart from those usual storyline missions that are compulsory to complete to unlock certain content and areas, you are allowed to take part in small and interesting side missions to earn some extra in-game money like: </p>
<p> Paramedics, where you pick injured people from nearby areas and drive them to the hospital. </p>
<p> Burglary, where you have to break into the citizen’s home during the hours of darkness and steal expensive items like a television without being caught by the police. </p>
<p> Taxicab, where you work as a taxi driver to pick and drop passengers. </p>
<p> You can then spend all that earned money at various extents including shopping, food, car modifications, physical appearance, importing vehicles, gambling, and several other aspects. </p>
<p> In case you are running low on money or want to get vehicles without importing them then you can use hacks and cheats like CLEO mods scripts with GTA San Andreas apk. The cheat menu is what makes it the perfect hack for GTA SA. 😀 </p>
<p> GTA San Andreas Storyline </p>
<p> The GTA SA storyline includes the main character Carl Johnson (CJ) who returns home located in Los Santos during the early 1990s. At this point in time, his mother has been murdered and he finds that his whole family has fallen apart and old childhood friends are ruining their life by heading towards unlawful activities, while the whole city is captured by cruel gang members and people are involved in corruption and drugs. </p>
<p> To find the truth behind his mother’s murder and save his family members, he goes all the way to rebuild his old street gang (Groove Street Families), clashes with the corrupt cops, and regains control over the streets of Los Santos and surrounding areas by taking part in gang warfare where he takes over the enemy territories. He also reduced the amount of drugs being used within the area. </p>
<p> Doing all of these helped CJ in gaining a lot of respect among his fellow friends and the neighborhood residents. </p>
<p> On the GTA San Andreas apk Android version, most of the gameplay structure and the missions are almost identical to the original PC version but developers have added several upgrades and enhancements to polish the game for mobile devices. They also added a much superior draw distance, detailed and dynamic shadows, enriched color palette, improvement in car models, and characters in an attempt to make the game more optimized for Android phones and tablet devices. </p>
<p> Did you know Rockstar Games have disabled cheat codes in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and you can not use any cheats/hacks in the game? But don’t worry, we have tried a couple of apps that work and will help you enable cheats and hacks in GTA San Andreas within a matter of seconds. 😉 </p>

<p> GTA San Andreas Features </p>

<p> Completely adjustable graphic settings to provide superior visual experience. </p>
<p> Customizable game controls and their color schemes with an option to display on-screen buttons only when needed. And </p>

<p> To make the gaming experience even more remarkable, the game even supports several game controllers including HUD-compliant USB, controllers manufactured by MOGA series as well as other Bluetooth based controllers. </p>
<p> Moreover, because GTA San Andreas is a resource-hungry game and consumes a lot of RAM and storage space, it is recommended to restart your device and close all the running apps before playing the game. This will ensure that the game performs well and doesn’t cause any unwanted lags and delays. </p>

<p> Do you want to use cheats and hacks in GTA San Andreas on Android? But you don’t really know which hacks and cheat codes work and which doesn’t? Here we will give you all the tried and tested working GTA SA Android hacks and cheats. </p>
<p> Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas by Rockstar Games and Rockstar North is one of the most highly popular action and adventure based game. Here you are completely free to explore the open world and have the freedom to move around and interact with the fictional world. </p>
<p> Originally, it was released for PC and gaming consoles like Xbox and PlayStation. But it was later released for Android phones and tablet devices too. </p>
<p> In the GTA San Andreas, you will be controlling a character that you can use to perform interactions like walking, swimming, jumping, climbing, driving, and using a variety of weapons. You can drive various vehicles including bus, boats, cars, bikes, trains, and aircraft. </p>
<p> From the very beginning of the game, you are free to explore the world and visit any place you want. But you will notice that some areas are locked and those can only be unlocked by progressing through the storyline missions. And completing missions also unlocks new content like special cars, weapons, and other items. </p>
<p> Otherwise the game will become boring as you will be stuck in the same place. </p>
<p> In case you don’t know, you can grab a free copy of GTA San Andreas APK for Android along with complete data files from here. 😉 </p>
<p> Also, some missions are harder to complete on Android mobile devices so many gamers opt for cheats & hacks to quickly progress through the game as well as unlock new items and locations. But the problem is that the GTA SA Android version does not officially support cheat codes. </p>
<p> GTA San Andreas Cheats and Hacks for Android </p>
<p> In an attempt to help you out in using GTA San Andreas cheats and hacks on Android, I have tried and tested a couple techniques that will allow you to enter all the cheats you want as well as use hacks like infinite health, armor, and get rid of the police. </p>
<p> All of which will help you play the game without worrying about getting wasted or busted so that you can quickly complete missions and unlock new content. </p>
<p> The apps that help you use cheats and hacks in GTA San Andreas Android are as follows: </p>
<p> CLEO SA Scripts for GTA San Andreas Android </p>
<p> CLEO is one of the best and the most popular tool ever designed for GTA game series. It allows you to add and run custom scripts commands to modify the gameplay without starting a new game. Which means, CLEO mod scripts can help you modify GTA SA even when your current game is running and the best thing is that scripts do not interfere with your save games. </p>
<p> For beginners, the CLEO SA comes preloaded with basic scripts like cheats, car spawner, health regenerator, and full stats. You can install each one of those preloaded scripts from within the app to test and try how it can help you cheat and mod GTA SA on Android. </p>
<p> Here’s what you can do with those preloaded scripts: </p>
<p> Cheats – It consists of over 55 cheats, which means you have direct access to all the standard as well as bonus GTA SA cheats including weapons, infinite ammo, health, armor, money, wanted level, invincibility, bulletproof, and many others. These cheats can be activated from the CLEO menu while playing the game. </p>
<p> Health Regenerator – Once installed, this script will automatically start whenever you play the game and keep running in the background to constantly regenerate your health every second and to keep it full. </p>
<p> Car Spawner – This is the best script as you can spawn all the bikes, cars, boats, helicopters, and planes available in the game. Whenever you want and wherever you want. The script will show you the vehicle and let you switch left or right to change the car. Once done, simply tap on it to make the selection. </p>
<p> Full Stats – This script will simply boost all of your skills stats like driving, cycling, shooting, swimming, stamina, and muscles to the maximum. </p>
<p> Apart from those four preloaded scripts mentioned above, you can even load and run many custom scripts to improve gameplay experience by adding new features or modifying the existing ones. </p>
<p> So, if you are into advanced modifications and want to run custom scripts then you can easily download them from the Internet, add to the game data folder, install using CLEO SA app, and then activate from the CLEO menu. As simple as that. </p>
<p> To help you out, we have a complete step-by-step tutorial along with the tips and tricks to get the most out of GTA CLEO scripts on Android. Moreover, you can learn more about how to use CLEO mods scripts to hack and cheat in GTA here. 😀 </p>
<p> In case you are wondering, CLEO custom scripts are already written by the developers and modders. All you really need to do is download the ones you like and add it to the game data folder. Then CLEO SA app will help you run those scripts while you are playing the game on your Android phone or tablet. </p>
<p> Even though CLEO SA scripts app is available for free and provides you tons of features to help you cheat and hack in GTA SA, but there’s a little drawback of CLEO scripts, it requires you to have a rooted Android device otherwise it will not work. </p>
<p> JCheater: San Andreas Edition </p>
<p> JCheater for GTA San Andreas Android is slightly different and less powerful as compared to the CLEO scripts. Even the process to apply and activate cheat on your existing game is hard and lengthy; we will talk about that later. </p>
<p> First, I will discuss the cheats and hacks you can activate with the help of JCheater app. You will get infinite health, armor, sprint, and money. You will also get to modify the level of respect as well as adjustable stats of skills like stamina, muscle, body fat, shooting, swimming, and driving skills. </p>
<p> We all know that GTA San Andreas has three different set of weapons i.e. thug, professional, and nutter. You will get a radio tab to select the one you want to have in the game. Moreover, each one of the weapons you get will have infinite ammunition. And if you want, you can get a parachute too with just a simple check mark option. </p>
<p> JCheater provides you a very small list of vehicles for spawning. The list includes only 5 types of vehicles i.e. army tank known as Rhino, fighter jet known as Hydra, army helicopter known as Hunter, GT40 supercar known as Bullet, and the well-known giant Monster Truck. </p>
<p> That is all you can cheat and hack with JCheater app on GTA San Andreas Android. </p>
<p> Now, I will tell you why it is hard and lengthy to activate cheats/hacks with JCheater. </p>
<p> That’s because the hack requires you to go to the CJ’s house and save your game progress in the slot. Then you need to open JCheater app and it will scan your list of slots. Then you have to select the same slot where you saved your game earlier. </p>
<p> At this point, you have to go through the list of available cheats/hacks and mark the ones you want to activate and then tap on save. Once everything is done, you have to reopen the game and load the same saved game slot that you modified earlier. </p>
<p> So to sum it up: </p>
<p> Every time you start playing the game, you need to go through the above mentioned steps in order to activate cheats, use hacks, or to spawn your choice of vehicle in the game. </p>
<p> No doubt, the usage and application process is time-consuming. However, the hacks and cheats works without any issue. </p>
<p> If you are interested, we have an easy to follow tutorial along with the helpful tricks so you can get the most out of JCheater on Android. And in case you don’t know much about the working of this cheating app then you should check out our guide on how to use JCheater to hack/cheat in GTA San Andreas, which is available here. 😀 </p>
<p> You are now aware that it provides you with some very limited set of GTA SA cheats and hacks. Unlike CLEO, the JCheater app does not require you have a rooted Android device but the app is not available for free and will cost you $1.99. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>

<p> Have you tried any other app for GTA San Andreas cheats and hacks? Or maybe you know about other methods to enter cheats in San Andreas? Share your opinion and views with us about cheating and hacking in the comments section below. 🙂 </p>

<p> Do you find it hard to complete missions, unlock vehicles, and weapons in GTA San Andreas Android version? With JCheater San Andreas Edition, you can enable cheat codes and hacks in GTA SA and get all those vehicles, weapon sets, and maximum player stats without completing missions. </p>
<p> We all know that Rockstar Games and Rockstar North have disabled cheat codes and modifications in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for Android, which has made it harder for beginners and GTA fans to play the game without cheats. </p>
<p> There are very limited numbers of working apps and workarounds you can use to enable cheat codes in the Android version of GTA San Andreas, and the JCheater aka GTA SA Cheater app is one of them. Because the cheating app is not easy to use and requires some configurations so here I have written an in-depth tutorial to help you guide through all the steps. </p>
<p> In this tutorial post about JCheater, you will learn: </p>
<p> What is JCheater, </p>
<p> How JCheater allows you to cheat in GTA San Andreas, </p>
<p> List of cheat codes and hacks supported by JCheater, and </p>
<p> How to use JCheater to cheat in GTA San Andreas. </p>
<p> What Is JCheater/GTA SA Cheater For Android? </p>
<p> The JCheater: San Andreas Edition app (also known as GTA SA Cheater) is designed and developed by Net Tech Development Ltd. Their key motive behind the development of this app was to help players like you in spawning all the cars, bikes, helicopters, and other vehicles as well as providing all the weapons. All of which are locked and requires you to spend a lot of time in completing missions in an attempt to unlock those items. </p>
<p> With JCheater, you can get every vehicle as well as all the weapons along with the in-game stats without spending endless hours on completing missions and upgrading stats. </p>
<p> In a nutshell, the GTA SA Cheater app will modify your saved game data of GTA San Andreas and enables all of your selected cheats and hacks on the game, so you won’t even need to enter any cheat codes. </p>
<p> JCheater app brings a completely new gameplay experience, as all the cheats will be enabled from the moment you begin playing your modified version of saved game. </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: There is a possibility that the save game files modified by JCheater app could get corrupt and might not work after applying cheats, so to be on a safe side, I will suggest you create a copy of your existing save game in a new slot and then apply cheats on it. </p>
<p> Even though the GTA SA Cheater app is simple to use and does not require root access but it is not free and will cost you a one-time fee of $1.99. In case you are looking a free option then try CLEO Mods Scripts to cheat in GTA San Andreas on Android. 😀 </p>
<p> Now before I guide you on how to use JCheater to enable cheat codes in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for Android, first I will show you the potentials of JCheater as well as what type of cheats and hacks you can enable in the game. </p>

<p> How To Use JCheater To Cheat In GTA San Andreas For Android? </p>
<p> Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how you can use JCheater: GTA San Andreas Edition to enable cheat codes in the Android version of the game: </p>
<p> Step 1 – Download and install JCheater on your Android phone/tablet from here. </p>
<p> Step 2 – Before you launch JCheater, you must need to save your existing game in a new slot by going to one of the two recognized safe house i.e. Johnson House or Santa Maria Beach. </p>
<p> So first, open GTA San Andreas on your phone and start a load game. Once the game has been loaded, go to either the safe house located in Santa Maria Beach or Johnson House and save the current game in a new slot/empty slot. </p>
<p> In case you don’t have GTA San Andreas for Android then you can grab one for free from here along with the complete save game data. 😀 </p>
<p> NOTE: Going to the mentioned safe house to save the game is only required if you want to spawn a vehicle, otherwise that step is not necessary. </p>
<p> TIP: There are 6 slots in total, and the first one is occupied by default while the rest are empty. I will suggest you save game in the sixth slot. </p>
<p> Step 3 – Do not close the game yet, simply use the home button to minimize GTA SA and then open JCheater app. </p>
<p> Step 4 – You will see a launch page along with the warning and instructions. Simply tap on “Skip”. </p>
<p> Step 5 – JCheater will scan your save games list and show you the slots where all your games are saved. As I saved my game in the sixth slot so, I will tap on the “Save 6”. </p>
<p> Step 6 – The GTA SA Cheater will now begin loading data from the selected savegame. This process will take a while. </p>
<p> Step 7 – Once the data from the save game has been loaded successfully, GTA SA Cheater will show you a list of cheats and hacks you can apply to your saved game. </p>
<p> Go through the list and make your selection wisely. I have already mentioned in the previous section about what are the available cheat codes and what each one of them will get you in the game. </p>
<p> Step 8 – When you are done, tap on the “Save” button. </p>
<p> Step 9 – JCheater will now apply your selected cheats and hacks. Progress will be shown in a popup window. It will take a few seconds to complete. </p>
<p> Step 10 – Once completed, JCheater will automatically close and show you a toast message that says, “Cheat Activated. Now load the save in GTA”. </p>
<p> Step 11 – Open GTA San Andreas (it must be already running in the background). Then go to “Start Game” -> “Load Game” -> and from here select the sixth slot. </p>
<p> Step 12 – That is it. When the game loads, all the cheat codes and hacks you have selected in the JCheater will be automatically activated including weapon set, unlimited ammunition, infinite health, infinite armor, maximum money, and other cheats you had selected. </p>
<p> To spawn the selected vehicle: open the garage and the vehicle will be spawned in front of the house (as shown in the image below). </p>
<p> Have fun! 😉 </p>

<p> Are you into racing mobile games and love challenges? Try installing Hill Climb Racing APK and I am sure that the perfect combination of challenging tracks, amazing stunts, and ultimate vehicle modification possibilities will make you play this game for endless hours. </p>
<p> Hill Climb Racing is a popular physics-based racing game for Android devices where all you really need to do is take your vehicle as far as you possibly can, without tipping your vehicle over and running out of fuel. You only have two paddle buttons i.e. gas and brake. You can use those to drive and control your vehicle. </p>
<p> Continue reading to learn more about Hill Climb Racing APK and find out how the game actually works… </p>
<p> About Hill Climb Racing APK </p>
<p> Hill Climb Racing apk, developed and published by a game development studio company named Fingersoft based in Finland, is an entertainment-filled racing and driving game that is completely based on the physics. Which is the reason what makes it more like a strategy based game because you need to select the right combination of vehicle and track to win the race. </p>
<p> We will talk about the Hill Climb Racing winning strategies later in some other post. Here we are discussing the basics of this game… </p>
<p> The game is very simple. You have only two basic controls i.e. gas and brake. You will be using those two on-screen buttons to control the vehicle as well as perform outstanding tricks (like back flips and long airtime) while racing to gain some extra coins. You also need to collect coins that are spread out on the track. </p>
<p> One more important thing is fuel. Yes, you guessed that right. Vehicles have limited fuel and while racing you are required to collect a gas tank or else it will run out of fuel and you won’t be able to race further. </p>
<p> The basic goal of the game is to get your vehicle as far as you possibly can, without running out of fuel and tipping over your vehicle. </p>
<p> The scores you earn during the race and after winning the race will be accumulated and added to that level’s distance record, which will then be used as a target for your next run on the same track. Also, after the end of every race, the coins you have earned by performing tricks, as well as those collected from the track, will be added to your account. </p>
<p> The coins you have earned can then be used to purchase a new vehicle, unlock dozens of new tracks, and even upgrade your vehicles to improve their overall performance and driving capabilities. These updates and new purchases will help you progress in the game. </p>
<p> Features of Hill Climb Racing </p>
<p> In an attempt to make the game more interesting and keep you enthusiastic to play more, Hill Climb Racing has some unique set of features: </p>
<p> Vehicles – There is a wide array of vehicles including jeep, bike, hippie van, monster truck, quad bike, race car, snowmobile, and twenty more. You need to earn coins to be able to buy these vehicles. </p>
<p> Upgrades – Each vehicle has their own unique upgrades and tuneable parts including suspension, four wheel drive, engine, and tires. If you want to reach greater distance then you must need to upgrade your vehicle. </p>
<p> Tracks and Levels – Anybody will get bored if the game has only one or two tracks. That is why there are more than twenty different stages and each one of them has unique levels. Some of the tracks include Arctic, Countryside, Desert, and my personal favorite Moon*. 😉 </p>
<p> The Garage Mode – Completely fresh mode that gives a new life to the existing game. This is the feature where you are allowed to use custom parts to build the vehicle of your dreams and break your own records. </p>
<p> Share Score With Friends – Whenever you make a new record on any track or hit your best score, you can quickly share it with your friends from within the app to make the game more challenging. </p>
<p> *TIP: If you want to quickly earn coins then Moon is the best track to play on. </p>

<p> HUAWEI now says Hongmeng OS is no Android alternative </p>
<p> Even when talks of HUAWEI readying Hongmeng operating system for its smartphones were dominating the headlines HUAWEI refrained from categorically </p>
<p> Even when talks of HUAWEI readying Hongmeng operating system for its smartphones were dominating the headlines HUAWEI refrained from categorically confirming if the proprietary OS was meant for the smartphones as a replacement for Android. </p>
<p> Maybe the idea to use its OS in smartphones was plan B for the company in case the ban against HUAWEI continues. Now when it is reported that the US might ease up the ban an executive from HUAWEI has refuted the speculation on Hongmeng OS being developed for running the smartphones. </p>
<p> HUAWEI board member and senior Vice President Catherine Chen at a media roundtable in Brussels unequivocally said that the Hongmeng is not designed as mobile OS platform and the company intends to continue using Android OS in its smartphones. </p>
<p> The clarification comes at a time when HUAWEI was reportedly testing Hongmeng in its smartphones, allegedly the HUAWEI Mate 30 series. </p>
<p> HUAWEI Co-Founder Ren Zhengfei recently stressed upon the fact that the Hongmeng OS is possibly faster than Android and macOS and meant for interconnecting a variety of devices such as network switches, routers, data centers, smart home centers, and autonomous vehicles other than smartphones. </p>
<p> Recently, HUAWEI also trademarked a new name “Harmony” for its OS, which was believed to be the global name of the Hongmeng. </p>
<p> According to Chen, Hongmen OS is for industrial use and not for serving as an alternative to Android. She said the OS has been in development long before the media chatter started on Hongmeng being an alternative to Android. </p>
<p> She also said that Hongmeng is very secure since it uses fewer lines of codes as against millions of lines used in a mobile OS and has low latency as well compared to a smartphone OS. </p>
<p> Although Chen’s statements are contradictory to the earlier messaging from the company, it is, nonetheless, more likely to be true. At present, HUAWEI can’t afford to rush into Hongmeng OS as Android alternative mostly because it doesn’t have a compatible ecosystem for Hongmeng as wide and developed as Android. </p>
<p> In all likelihood, HUAWEI will carry on with Android for its smartphones and Hongmeng might be used for the smart IoT devices and others. Then again, HUAWEI’s decision largely hinges on how much relaxation the US administration allows to the company. </p>

<p> The filters are pretty awesome especially the face filters, and some new filters also get added after some time. </p>
<p> You can also show people what you’re up to by putting stories on Instagram. A single story can be 15 seconds long, which is very short but Instagram allows you to post as many stories as you want and they will all disappear after 24 hours of upload. </p>
<p> Instagram also added a nice feature in which you can add multiple photos or videos (10 to be exact) in a single post. Your friends and followers can swipe through your pictures or videos while looking at your post. </p>
<p> You can choose if you want your account to be private or open. If you set it to be a private account, then only your friends and followers can see your posts. If any person wants to see your post or wants to follow, then he’ll send you a follow request to you, and you can choose if you want to allow him or not. </p>
<p> But if you have an open account, then anyone can see your posts, and anyone can start following you. Then, you can also use hashtags (#) on your posts, if anyone searches that hashtag on the search bar then your posts will appear under that hashtag. </p>
<p> You can also follow certain hashtags if you like them and then you’ll be able to see what people are sharing while following that hashtag. </p>
<p> There is also a new feature added called Instagram direct which is a nice implementation. It is a personal chat to talk to your friends on Instagram. It is also known as Direct Message or DM. </p>
<p> You can also go live on Instagram. When you’re live, your followers will get a notification that you’re live streaming. They can watch your live stream and also comment and like on it. After you’ve ended your live stream, you can also post it on your story so that anybody who didn’t get to watch it live can watch it afterward, but it’ll remain there for 24 hours only. </p>
<p> If you go into the camera tab, there you can see some different option. You can choose from a normal photo or video, a text picture, live, boomerang, superzoom, focus, rewind, and hands-free. </p>
<p> Depending on the option you choose, you’ll get different possibilities. Like if you use the text option, then it’ll give some different backgrounds on which you can write something. Live is for going live on Instagram. Boomerang is for making small rewinding gifs. Superzoom gives you various sound effects and options to specify a certain subject that you want. The Focus is like a filter that blurs everything except for your face and hands-free is used for recording a video without the need of holding a button. </p>
<p> To use the Boomerang option, you’ll need to download an app called Boomerang from Play Store that’ll allow you to make a boomerang video. </p>
<p> IGTV is another big thing that is new to Instagram. It allows the user to make videos like on YouTube but in a vertical orientation. You can create your channel and post videos on it.

<p> Easy Guide To Install Lineage OS On Any Android Phone [Tutorial] </p>
<p> Are you looking for a way to give your Android smartphone or tablet device a complete overhaul? Hands down Lineage </p>
<p> Are you looking for a way to give your Android smartphone or tablet device a complete overhaul? Hands down Lineage OS is one of the best ways to achieve that. Here we are going to describe everything about Lineage OS ROM and guide you with the steps for how to flash it on your Android phone. </p>
<p> Android ecosystem is very special for global users because of its customization abilities. Not only the normal customization, but it also lets you deeply tweak the settings and functionalities. Modding and custom ROMs have increased its customization possibilities to a whole new level. There were many custom ROMs for Android platform. However, CyanogenMod was the best one among all others. But it was replaced with a better one named LineageOS. </p>
<p> You can install the LineageOS on your Android phone with multiple methods. But before jumping onto the steps to install it, you have to understand the advantages, consequences, known issues, and the requirements for it. Frankly speaking, you have to make sure you want to install LineageOS on your phone. For this purpose, we have also included a detailed introduction of the LineageOS below. </p>
<p> DISCLAIMER: Rooting, modding, and installing custom ROMs is fun to try out. However, it can be really risky too. There are some chances of bricking your phone during the installation process. We have tried our best to include the safest methods in this article. Anyways, the publication is not responsible for any consequences while installing the custom ROM on your phone. Read the entire article before starting the process. </p>
<p> What is LineageOS? </p>
<p> As mentioned in the beginning, LineageOS came to the heart of global advanced Android users with all the best things from CyanogenOS. Not only that, LineageOS was much better because of the improved performance and functionality. However, it lacks some key features of Cyanogen, which includes the root access for all apps. Anyways, Lineage was accepted by everyone as a single solution for their needs. </p>
<p> The true power of LineageOS is that it can give you all the latest versions of the Android operating system, even if your phone is too old to support the latest Android version. It opens more possibilities on your phone and cuts the restriction line. </p>
<p> Many of you might have the question, is LineageOS a separate operating system or something like that? Well, the answer is very simple. LineageOS is a deeply customized custom version of the Android operating system. </p>
<p> Advantages of LineageOS </p>
<p> There is a long list of reasons to install LineageOS on your Android smartphone. That’s the main reason it stays as the favorite custom ROM for Android users globally. </p>
<p> Mainly, people use this custom ROM to enable root access on their phones while enjoying all the features of latest Android OS. You can easily enable root access on your smartphone after replacing your stock operating system with the Lineage version and then flashing a root file on top of it through recovery. </p>
<p> Not only root access but Lineage also has several other advantages too. Especially, it lets you unleash the true capabilities of your device without making any physical modifications to the hardware. Most of the smartphones come with preset values for each function. Manufacturers limit the speed, access, and some hardware features to avoid bugs and security issues. However, LineageOS lets you bypass all of those limitations and tweak your phone as per your liking. </p>
<p> The most important thing that makes LineageOS a publicly-loved custom ROM is its support for wide range of models. It supports most of the new and old smartphones without any critical issues. However, the support list is smaller than that of the Cyanogen. </p>
<p> Let’s suppose you are using an older smartphone with no OEM support and OTA (Over-The-Air) software updates. Then flashing LineageOS on your phone will let you enjoy the latest Android version and security patches on your phone without the brand’s authorization. </p>
<p> Disadvantages of LineageOS </p>
<p> You must read this section before diving into the installation process. You must be aware of the consequences and disadvantages of flashing LineageOS on your phone. Yes, you heard it right, LineageOS is not completely perfect. It has its cons and problems. But the awesome community of developers that powers this ROM is active in fixing major bugs and reported errors. </p>
<p> The most reported issue with the LineageOS is related to camera and Bluetooth. There are known camera compatibility issues and firmware problems in few models. However, you can easily fix such issues with the patches provided by the developers. Alternatively, you can try third-party camera applications. </p>
<p> The major consequence after installing LineageOS lies in your warranty sheet. Majority of smartphone brands hate rooting and unlocking the bootloader because it can damage the hardware and such modifications are not covered under warranty. So keep in mind that flashing a custom ROM on your Android device voids its warranty. </p>
<p> We want you to remember all these problems and disadvantages of flashing custom ROM before starting with the installation process. </p>
<p> Prerequisites: What do you need to install and run LineageOS on your phone? </p>
<p> Stories and mind-blowing features apart, you must confirm if your device supports LineageOS. Also, there is a list of prerequisites to get started with the installation and flashing process. You can verify whether your Android device supports LineageOS or not in the official list of supported devices. If your device is listed, you are good to go. Otherwise, we will recommend you stop reading this article right now. </p>
<p> Now, as you are reading this article, that means you have checked the list of supported devices and your device is capable of running LineageOS without any major issues. Let’s check out what you need before starting the process. </p>
<p> Supported Android smartphone, </p>
<p> A compatible USB cable, </p>
<p> A working computer running Windows, Mac, or Linux, and </p>
<p> Active internet connection. </p>
<p> Above mentioned are the basic things you need to have to install LineageOS on your device. You can’t skip any of the above things in the process. Once you are all set with the prerequisites, you are good to move forward to the next section. </p>
<p> Steps to install LineageOS on your Android phone </p>
<p> Now you are all ready to start with the installation. But that’s not enough. Patience plays an important role in this process. If you can’t handle the panic situations and pressure, you should avoid doing this. Because there are always chances for a technical flaw and human error during this. I am not dragging you down, but it’s basic advice that nobody will ever give you. </p>
<p> For you to understand the whole flashing process better, a glimpse of all the major steps have been listed below: </p>
<p> Install the necessary tools and software on your PC. </p>
<p> Backup your smartphone and set it up for flashing. </p>
<p> Download the installation packages and required apps. </p>
<p> Unlocking the bootloader. </p>
<p> Flashing TWRP recovery. </p>
<p> Flashing the ROM. </p>
<p> Rebooting and setting up LineageOS. </p>
<p> These are the steps to complete the flashing process without any trouble. You have to stay calm, read as well as understand each step before trying them. A simple mistake or error in the process could permanently kill your smartphone, which is also known as hard-bricking. The risk is too high. But don’t worry, the flashing and installation method mentioned in this article is safe as long as you know what you are doing. </p>
<p> A) Install the necessary tools and software on your PC </p>
<p> You need to install several tools and applications on your computer. LineageOS strictly requires the use of a computer device. So make sure your PC has the necessary tools and software for this. </p>
<p> You need ADB tools installed on your computer. ADB is the short form of Android Debug Bridge by Google. As the name reveals, it creates a bridge between your PC and Android phone to execute some advanced commands and actions directly from the computer. </p>
<p> You can download the official installation files of ADB from the Android Developers page and extract it on your computer. Once extracted, you can open the ADB command shell in your PC. </p>
<p> In addition to the ADB tools, you will also need to download and install the USB drivers for your phone on your PC. Majority of the smartphone manufacturers release USB drivers for the computer so that owners can connect their Android device with their PC. You can easily perform a Google search for USB drivers and install it on your device. Once you are ready with required drivers and ADB tools, we can step onto the next step. </p>
<p> B) Backup your smartphone and set it up for flashing </p>
<p> Creating a backup of all the data stored on your device is an important step before starting the flashing processes. Your data is important and you should back it up. If you don’t care about your app data, stored files, photos, and settings, then you can skip this step. Otherwise, use a backup tool like Helium. </p>
<p> Alternatively, if you are not into the technicalities then you can always create a copy of all your files on your computer. Remember, any changes made to your phone cannot be reverted. Especially for storage, there is a great chance that you might lose all the stored data and settings. So make sure you have secured all your files before proceeding with the flashing process. </p>
<p> After backing up, you have to prepare your smartphone for the installation of LineageOS. For that, you need to enable USB debugging and OEM Unlocking settings on your phone. You can find these options under the Developer Options of your Android device. In normal case, you can’t find developer options on your phone. However, you can enable it by tapping multiple times on the build number of your smartphone, which is located in the About menu. </p>
<p> Once you are in the developer options, scroll down and find USB debugging and enable it. Then you need to find an option called OEM Unlocking. Enable that setting as well. Some smartphones may not have the OEM unlocking menu. If your smartphone does not come with that, just skip that step and enable USB debugging only. Now you are ready to go. </p>
<p> C) Download the installation packages and required apps </p>
<p> Now you are all ready to start the first step of installation. However, we need the software packages and other required applications to install on your mobile phone. There are plenty of package versions available on the web repositories. To ensure the complete compatibility and functionality, you have to download the proper version of the required packages. For that, you can choose the most recently uploaded file. That way it ensures that you install the latest version. </p>
<p> You can simply go to the LineageOS website and select your device. There will be multiple versions of the package available. Just choose the recently uploaded one and download it. Now you have the basic operating system files for the installation of LineageOS on your phone. But that is not enough. You have to download the custom recovery packages and GApps package (Google Apps Package). </p>
<p> There are two most commonly used custom recovery packages. The one we are using here is TWRP and the other one is CWM recovery. TWRP stands for TeamWin Recovery Project and it is the safest custom recovery package. You can download the correct variant of the TWRP from the official website of TWRP. There is a list of the supported models as well so you can see which package you should download. </p>
<p> For more information about TWRP and how to install custom recovery on your Android device, you can check this blog post. </p>
<p> Now comes another important section – Google Apps. You need to install/flash the GApps package along with the ROM package. Otherwise, you won’t be able to use Google services and applications on your device. So download the GApps package from the OpenGapps.org. Make sure you select the correct options in the download page of GApps. </p>
<p> Now you have all the necessary packages to install and run LineageOS with Google support on your phone. For your convenience, rename the TWRP, GApps, LineageOS files to twrp.img, gapps.zip, lineage.zip respectively. It will avoid unnecessary confusion in the process. </p>
<p> Make sure you copy the Lineage.zip and gapps.zip to your phone. This will make the flashing process easier later. </p>
<p> D) Unlock your bootloader </p>
<p> Unlocking your bootloader enables you to install and run custom recovery on your device. Most of the smartphone models come with a locked bootloader to maximize device security. However, here we are unlocking it for installing LineageOS. </p>
<p> As mentioned above, the bootloader is tricky in some smartphones. The process may become very easy in some models, whereas some models have the hardest process to unlock the bootloader. Also, note that some smartphones do not have any unlocking methods yet. If you are using a smartphone without bootloader unlocking options, there is no need to follow this step and skip to the next one. </p>
<p> We can’t generally explain the method to unlock bootloader. There are plenty of supported smartphone models and each of them has its own unique method to do it. Don’t worry, head over to the official LineageOS Wiki page to find your phone model’s method to unlock the bootloader. Once you have completed unlocking the bootloader, you can proceed to the next step. </p>
<p> E) Flashing TWRP recovery </p>
<p> As mentioned above, we need to install a custom recovery to execute several pro-level actions. Your OEM stock recovery does not support flashing so having a custom recovery is the best option when it comes to installing packages and flashing ROM to your Android device, which requires admin-level access. </p>
<p> We are using the TWRP recovery as it is the most popular one with support for a wide range of Android devices. In addition to that, TWRP has a great community of developers with a lot of solutions for all the problems you might experience during the flashing process. </p>
<p> We have already downloaded the required custom recovery package in the step C. Now connect your Android device to your PC with the USB cable and open the ADB terminal in the location where you previously installed ADB. Right-click on that folder and click on Open Command Prompt here option to open a command prompt in that folder. Usually, the folder is C:\USER PROFILE\adb-fastboot\platform-tools\ </p>
<p> Now you are entering the most crucial stage of flashing so make sure you don’t mess up anything as it could be really dangerous for your Android device. Once you are ready, type and run the following command in the command prompt window: </p>
<p> This command forces your smartphone to boot into fastboot mode instead of the Android operating system. Once your smartphone restarts into the fastboot mode, run the following command: </p>
<p> This command initiates the flashing of TWRP recovery on your smartphone. Once the execution is complete in the CMD, you are good to go. </p>
<p> Now you can boot into the recovery mode using the hardware keys. Different smartphone models have different methods to boot into the recovery mode. In most of the smartphone, you can enter into the recovery mode by pressing and holding Power + Volume Up + Volume Down buttons. You need to continue holding these buttons until you see recovery mode on the screen. </p>
<p> Unlike your stock recovery menu, TWRP has a user-friendly touch-enabled interface with easy options. You will love it more than your stock recovery environment. </p>
<p> The welcome page of TWRP will show an option to enable modifications on your phone. Right below that messages, there will be a slider named “Swipe to Allow Modifications.” Just swipe to allow modifications to your phone. Once you see the TWRP recovery, you are good to proceed with the flashing of LineageOS ROM. </p>
<p> F) Flashing the ROM. </p>
<p> This is the step where you will be installing LineageOS to your phone. As compared to all other steps, this one is the quickest but the riskiest. If you are ready, you may proceed to the steps: </p>
<p> On the home screen of the TWRP recovery page, tap on the Wipe option then press Format Data. Remember, this action will format all the data stored on your smartphone. But you don’t need to worry as we have already created a backup of all the files and settings. </p>
<p> Once the wiping process is complete, tap on the Advanced Wipe option located under the Wipe menu. Here you will see a list of options for an advanced wipe. Just checkboxes near these three options: </p>
<p> Dalvik / ART Cache, </p>
<p> System, and </p>
<p> Cache. </p>
<p> Make sure you are NOT checking any other boxes than the ones mentioned above. Now swipe from left to right on the bottom slider which says “Swipe to Wipe.” </p>
<p> Now we are going to flash the Lineage OS files and GApps to the Android device: </p>
<p> On the main menu of TWRP, tap on the Install button and it will list your storage contents. </p>
<p> Navigate and select the Lineage.zip and GApps.zip files. Make sure the Lineage.zip is selected first in the queue. </p>
<p> After selecting, use the bottom swipe option to start the flashing process. This process may take some time to complete the successful installation of the Lineage OS and associated apps. </p>
<p> Once the installation has been completed successfully, it will display a message in the log window. Now you will have to perform cache cleaning so perform the option Wipe cache/dalvik to wipe the cache files. Once done, reboot your phone. </p>
<p> G) Rebooting and setting up the device. </p>
<p> Now that you have successfully installed the LineageOS ROM along with the latest Google services. After pressing the reboot option, your phone will welcome you with a boot animation of LineageOS. If you are seeing that animation that means everything has been perfectly installed. </p>
<p> Though you have to be patience with the first boot of your phone with Lineage OS as it may take a longer duration to completely boot up your phone and set things up. During this process, LineageOS will install all the GApps and other tools that comes bundled with Lineage OS. </p>
<p> Once the boot logo is gone, a welcome screen will appear from where you can configure your phone settings and make personalizations. You can log into your Google account and start using your phone. </p>
<p> So that is how you are going to install LineageOS on your phone. </p>
<p> Enabling root access on your phone </p>
<p> This is the reason why I mentioned that you should read the entire article before proceeding with any of the steps. We have separated this section from the main process to avoid enabling root access for normal users. If you want to enable root access and enjoy more features and superuser (SU) access to your device, then you can follow this step. </p>
<p> You can download the root file named SU to flash along with the LineageOS package. It is available to download at LineageOS Wiki page. Choose your Android device variant and model number and download the SU files. Make sure you copy the downloaded file to your phone before the flashing process because you will then be able to easily flash the SU root file along with LineageOS ROM package in Step F. </p>
<p> Final Thoughts </p>
<p> That’s all about the installation of LineageOS on your Android phone and tablet devices. Now you know how to unlock the bootloader of your Android device, flash custom recovery, and a custom ROM. </p>
<p> You have just entered the world of custom ROMs and deep-level Android customization. Now you can go ahead and search for online communities and Android development forums to learn more about supported ROMs for your phone. </p>
<p> There can be some instances where the user does not love the LineageOS after flashing it. If you are one of them, we have a solution for that too. If you are searching for that then drop your comment below and we will update this article in the coming weeks with a link to the guide which contains detailed steps to rollback your Android device to the stock ROM. </p>

<p> Guide on Installing Google Play Store & Other Apps on Smart TV [Samsung | Sony] </p>
<p> I bought a Samsung smart TV for my bedroom a few weeks ago and although it has Netflix I was wondering how one can install Play Store and any other third-party apps in the smart TV if there is no Google Play Store installed/found in the TV. </p>
<p> What I found out is that any smart TV running any version of the Android operating system will absolutely support the installation of Google Play Store as well as any third-party apps through APK. In case, smart TV does not have Android. Then there is no way to install any app on it. </p>
<p> However, you can easily convert your smart TV into Android TV by purchasing an Android set-top box and connect it using HDMI. </p>
<p> So the first thing we have to do is find out if the smart TV we have is compatible with the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Is My Smart TV Compatible With Play Store? </p>
<p> The smart TV you have in front of you may have preinstalled apps like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, Internet browser. TV manufacturers like Samsung, TCL, Sony, and LG sell their LED and LCD TVs with some handful of apps preinstalled. In most of the cases, smart TV manufactured by Hisense, Toshiba, and Philips doesn’t come with any app. </p>
<p> If there is no way to download or install new apps or update the existing ones, then there is a possibility that your TV is not compatible with Google Play Store. </p>
<p> But we have a way to find that out. Here’s how: </p>
<p> To find out if your smart TV is compatible with Play Store, on the TV controller, look for a Home button. Then within the options available, see if you can find an icon for Play Store. </p>
<p> If it’s not seen anywhere, then the next step you have to perform is to look for the operating system running on your smart TV. You can find that in the Settings menu. If it says Android, then it means you can install Google Play Store, a tutorial for which is available in the next step. </p>
<p> However, if you are unable to find Android, then it means you have a simple, smart TV with limited capabilities. The best alternative, in this case, is to buy any Android-enabled set-top box and connect it to your TV via HDMI cable. Once purchased, you can then follow the steps below. </p>
<p> How To Install Google Play Store On Smart TV? </p>
<p> There are chances that although your smart TV is running Android OS, the manufacturer didn’t install Google Play Store for some reason. Here we have a guide that you can follow to install Play Store on your smart TV: </p>
<p> Prerequisites </p>
<p> Tutorial </p>
<p> Using your computer, download the Play Store apk from our APK section. </p>
<p> Connect USB flash drive to your computer/laptop. </p>
<p> Copy the apk file you just downloaded and paste it onto the flash drive. </p>
<p> Connect that flash drive to your smart TV. </p>
<p> Using the built-in file explorer already installed on your TV, access the USB flash drive and navigate to the folder where you have downloaded Play Store apk. </p>
<p> Select the apk file to start the installation process. </p>
<p> Once the process is completed, you should be able to find Google Play Store in the list of apps. </p>
<p> How To Install Third-Party Apps On Smart TV? </p>
<p> The procedure to install third-party apps on your smart TV is very much similar to the step I have mentioned in the previous section. </p>
<p> However, you may find the procedure mentioned above a bit lengthy and time consuming, so as an alternative, I will recommend you to open the Play Store on your smart TV and first install the app called Send Files To TV. </p>
<p> Send Files To TV is a powerful little app that makes the whole third-party app installation procedure simple and straightforward. Not only that, but you can also even send movies, pictures, music, and any huge file wirelessly to your smart TV directly from your PC or Android phone or tablet device. </p>
<p> Rest assured, you would no longer need to use your USB flash drive once you have this properly set-up. </p>
<p> Prerequisites </p>
<p> Things you will need for Send Files To TV app to work: </p>
<p> Android Smart TV, </p>
<p> Windows PC or Android smartphone/tablet device, </p>
<p> All of your devices must need to be on the same Wi-Fi network. </p>
<p> Tutorial </p>
<p> Here is a guide on how to setup and use Send Files To TV: </p>
<p> On your Android Smart TV, open Play Store and search for Send Files To TV. </p>
<p> Install the app. </p>
<p> If you want to transfer files from your Android smartphone/tablet device to your smart TV, then install the app from Play Store on that device. Else, </p>
<p> If you want to transfer files from your Windows PC/laptop to your smart TV, then download and install Send Files To TV software from SourceForge. </p>
<p> Once all the installation has been done. Open Send Files To TV on both devices, i.e. Smart TV and phone or Windows PC. </p>
<p> Then follow this guide where I am going to show you how to send files from your Android phone to Smart TV: </p>
<p> On my Smart TV, I will select Receive. That will open a progress screen where I will be able to track my transfers. </p>
<p> On my Android phone, I will select Send. That will open a “Select File” screen with all the folders on my device. </p>
<p> I can now select any file or even a whole folder to send to my Smart TV. Tapping and holding any item will allow you to select multiple files/folders. </p>
<p> Once the selection has been made, tap on the tick icon located at the top right corner. </p>
<p> A device selection screen will appear, tap on the device you want to send these files to. </p>
<p> A progress bar will appear on both devices showing the transfer progress. </p>
<p> That’s it. Now sit back and relax. Selected files will be sent to the smart TV within a matter of minutes (depending on the file size). </p>
<p> Now, using this same procedure, you can quickly transfer almost any third-party apps like APK files including Kodi to your Smart TV and install it using any file explorer app. </p>
<p> You can even watch and stream full-length movies and TV shows on your Android TV for free without any fee using these best movie streaming apps that are similar to Kodi. And I will also recommend you get a VPN to protect yourself and your identity. </p>
<p> What Are The Play Store Alternatives To Install Apps? </p>
<p> Even though the official Google Play Store is the best out there because of better compatibility and superior security, however, there are moments when you are looking for some specific app but wasn’t able to find it in the Play Store. </p>
<p> That’s when the hunt for Play Store alternatives begins. </p>
<p> There are handfuls of third-party app store for a smart TV that let you install apps, but the major drawback is lack of content regulation and security issues. So I won’t be responsible if something goes wrong while using any of these. </p>
<p> You can find a lot of third-party apps and APKs on all the above-mentioned alternative stores and install them on your Android smart TV and other devices. </p>
<p> Please log in again. The login page will open in a new tab. After logging in you can close it and return to this page. </p>

<p> If you love to modify your Android device then TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) is one of the most widely recommended recoveries for phone and tablet devices running Android OS. So if you are wondering how to install TWRP on your device then this step by step tutorial will help you. </p>
<p> Before we dive into the actual process of installing TWRP recovery on Android device, a little introduction on the subject will give you more understanding of what you are going to do and you will be less likely to make a mistake in the process. </p>
<p> What Is Android Recovery? </p>
<p> Android recovery is an integral partition in Android that provides an alternative boot partition that lets the device boot up in case there is a problem with the boot partition or the system partition (that actually has the OS). As the name suggests it provides recovery console and other tools to perform recovery or maintenance operations on the Android device. </p>
<p> Every Android comes with a recovery (partition) installed into it and as explained earlier it is an important partition. However often OEM’s, like the version of Android, modify the recovery for improving the experience of their consumers. One such example can be found in the recovery of the Xiaomi phones. </p>
<p> Not only manufacturers modify recovery, but developers also make their customized recoveries (since Android is an open-source project) which are available publicly. Most notable of them are CWM (Clockwork mod or Phillz) and TWRP recovery. </p>
<p> Benefits Of Custom Recovery </p>
<p> A custom recovery can let you install a custom Android operating system on your device. It allows you to make a complete backup of the system called ‘NANDROID backup’ and enables you to restore them at your convenience. </p>
<p> Not just backups, with the help of custom recovery you can also update your Android device to the latest version of Android operating system (given that the compatible update is available). </p>
<p> Custom recovery also allows us to install root binary like SuperSu, Magisk, or popular mods like Viper4Android. Other than that, it also provides other advanced features that a normal recovery would provide plus it also gives you the ability to mount and unmount data partition, move files into the device without booting the operating system, formatting and resizing partitions, and whatnot. </p>
<p> About TWRP Recovery </p>
<p> TWRP recovery is created by TeamWin hence the name “Team Win Recovery Project”. Initially it was a team of only four people but later on, due to the project being open source, the contribution of many contributors made the recovery quite popular. </p>
<p> TWRP got famous and stole position of being the most preferred custom recovery from CWM in the days of Android 4.4 KitKat. And the reason for its popularity and early adaptability was that the interface of the TWRP was very well laid out for every type of user and it offered touch controls, which at that time CWM and stock recovery lacked. </p>
<p> For those of you who are wondering, CWM did catch up and got renamed as Phillz recovery but it couldn’t compete with much wider preference and choice of the developers and community. </p>
<p> Prerequisites Of Installing TWRP </p>
<p> First, you will need to know the exact phone model number which is usually given on the box of your device. If you don’t have the box then don’t worry as Android phones have their model number in their ‘About Device’ section, which is located in the ‘Settings’ menu. </p>
<p> Once you have found the correct model number, you can do a Google search for codename of your device. </p>
<p> For example, the codename of the Huawei Honor 5x is ‘kiwi’, Samsung Galaxy S9+ (Exynos variant) is ‘star2lte’, and Samsung Galaxy S9+ (Snapdragon variant) is ‘star2qltechn’. </p>
<p> Once you have found the correct model and codename of your Android device then head over to the TWRP website to check whether the recovery is available for your variant of device. </p>
<p> In case your device is not listed there then you can search through different forums like XDA Developers for unofficial version of TWRP recovery. But you should keep in mind that an unofficial recovery can have known bugs or other issues, details of which you can find on the link where you found the recovery. </p>
<p> Also, there is a possibility that the custom TWRP port hasn’t been developed through the recommended methods of TWRP so it hasn’t got official status. Other than that there is usually no other problems. </p>
<p> Anyways, the second thing you need do is turn on USB debugging on your device. Here is how to do that: </p>
<p> Navigate to Setting > About Device. </p>
<p> Tap the Build Number eight times. On your eighth tap, you should see a toast message that says, “You are now a developer”. </p>
<p> Now go back to Settings > Developer Options. </p>
<p> Look for USB debugging and turn it on. </p>
<p> A Word Of Warning </p>
<p> Installing TWRP recovery is a fairly easy process only if you are patient and can follow the steps exactly. If you can’t understand the given instruction then you should avoid the whole process for the sake of your own device. </p>
<p> Installing a custom recovery on Android may seem like a simple process like copy, pasting, and downloading a bunch of tools from links. But if the guide is not followed correctly then you might end up with a phone that is unable to boot, or even worse, a phone that is not even able to recognize a USB connection which is actually a hard bricked state and is almost impossible to be fixed. </p>
<p> You may continue beyond this step if you understand all the risks mentioned earlier. </p>
<p> Unlocking The Bootloader </p>
<p> Before installing the recovery please make sure, your Android device is at least 70% charged, the data cable you are going to use for this process connects properly to your device and the connection is not loose, and you have created a local backup of all the important data stored on your Android device. </p>
<p> Most carrier unlocked devices come with unlocked bootloader or at least an unlockable bootloader so that the consumer can unlock it easily. If you want to unlock the bootloader of your Android device then the steps are quite simple: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Tap on OEM unlock. </p>
<p> After checking OEM unlock, perform a factory reset on your device. </p>
<p> In case your Android device is old, you might not find the above option in the developer option and you can get to unlocking the bootloader right away. </p>
<p> For Samsung devices, the above method easily unlocks the bootloader, however, for other devices you may need to go through additional steps which you can find out by searching through the Internet for the specific model number of your Android device. </p>
<p> Huawei no longer officially provides bootloader unlocking and there are some carrier-locked devices which also do not allow bootloader unlock. The most notable brands that still allow unlocking of bootloader are Samsung, Google, Motorola, Xiaomi (they’ve made the process very complicated), OnePlus, HTC. For other manufacturers, you can search the web as that is another topic. </p>
<p> How to Install TWRP Recovery Using ADB Commands </p>
<p> For Samsung Devices </p>
<p> Once the bootloader is unlocked you can now download the appropriate version of ‘Odin’. Droidviews has created an Odin compatibility list, which is a wonderful resource. So check that out to find the correct Odin version required for the process and then download that Odin on your computer. Please note that Samsung does not officially provide Odin so you have to search for that on the Internet. </p>
<p> After getting the right Odin version, you need to install the Samsung USB drivers which you can obtain from the official Samsung website here. Install the drivers on your PC and then reboot your PC. That’s pretty much it. </p>
<p> Once the computer boots up, then you need to copy the recovery.img.tar that you previously download from twrp.me and place it into the directory where you have extracted the Odin tool. </p>
<p> Right click on Odin and run it as administrator. Click on AP/PDA button and browse to the directory where you stored TWRP recovery and select that file. You don’t need to bother with any other options or settings on Odin. </p>
<p> Now you need to follow these steps: </p>
<p> Turn off your phone. </p>
<p> Press and hold Volume Down + Home + Power button. </p>
<p> Release the Power button when the display turns on and then release the other two buttons when you enter a screen like the one shown below. </p>
<p> Press Volume Up button to continue to the Download mode. </p>
<p> Connect your phone to your PC through USB cable. Odin will show “Added” in the log. </p>
<p> Press the Start button on Odin and wait until the process is completed. </p>
<p> When the process is completed, press Volume Up + Home button before the phone boots up (but before doing that please make sure that Odin has shown the process as successful, otherwise your device may get bricked). </p>
<p> For Google Pixel/Nexus Devices </p>
<p> The first step is to set up ADB and Fastboot on your computer which can be done through this link. So download the file and extract it. </p>
<p> Then, we have to install the drivers for your Android device and for that we can use XDA-Developers member Snoop05’s tool. Run the tool as admin. Skip the installation of ADB and Fastboot as we have already downloaded the newer version since Snoop05’s tool comes with an older version of ADB and Fastboot. </p>
<p> As we are done with setting up ADB, Fastboot, and driver, now we can move towards installing recovery. </p>
<p> On your computer, place the recovery.img file in the same folder where ADB and Fastboot are located. </p>
<p> While in the same folder, hold the Shift key on the keyboard and right-click on the folder and click on “open PowerShell windows here.”IMPORTANT: If in the context menu you find “open command prompt windows here” instead, you may omit “./” (without the quotes) from the steps explained beyond this point. Also, all the commands are without double-quotes. </p>
<p> Connect the phone to the computer and type “./adb devices” (without the quotes). </p>
<p> Unlock the device allow the ADB request (if you have connected your phone through ADB before than through this pc then this step is not required). </p>
<p> Now type “./adb reboot bootloader” (Your device will reboot into bootloader mode, wait for it). </p>
<p> Now type “fastboot flash recovery recovery.img” (recovery.img is the name of the recovery file which in our case was twrp-3.2.3-0-bullhead.img, you may write the name of your recovery file). </p>
<p> Wait for the process to complete and type “fastboot reboot”. </p>
<p> After reboot, your device will have TWRP recovery installed. </p>
<p> Installing TWRP Recovery Using Root </p>
<p> If you were able to root your device and have root permission on your device then you can also use “TWRP Manager” app, which can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Click on install TWRP, but first you need to make sure the device shown there is the correct one as TWRP Manager will download the recovery and flash it automatically. Once the custom recovery has been installed, then you can also use the app to boot into recovery. </p>
<p> Disadvantage Of TWRP Recovery </p>
<p> TWRP itself doesn’t has any disadvantage rather it mostly comes from the fact that you have unlocked the bootloader and you are running a custom recovery, so whenever you flash a custom recovery whether it is TWRP, CWM or any other, you are most likely to lose the ability to update your phone through OTA (Over The Air) on the stock version of Android because installing custom recovery recovery breaks the OTA update. </p>
<p> There are also security-related issues with custom recovery. Moreover, by unlocking the bootloader of your Android device you are going to lose Android Pay and in most cases warranty and support for your device from the manufacturer. </p>
<p> Modern Trend And Community </p>
<p> Installing TWRP is only a good idea if you like flashing your phone or you are a developer. Today phones have ample features and storage which is the main reason why people are going towards flashing their phones which frees them from any limitations. </p>
<p> Flashing a phone with custom recovery and then modifying the system files can help increase the performance of the phone, you can improve battery life or may improve camera or sound through a mod. All of this depends on the availability of the mods and custom ROMs. Today we have reached the point where people question the need for rooting or modifying the device and communities are also less active than they were in the past. </p>

<p> How to install & use Exodus on Kodi [Tutorial] </p>
<p> Exodus, if not the best, is one of the best add-ons for any Kodi setup whether it is on Android, </p>
<p> Exodus, if not the best, is one of the best add-ons for any Kodi setup whether it is on Android, Raspberry Pi, Linux, Windows, or Mac. Here we are going to guide you on how to install Exodus on Kodi along with a step-by-step tutorial on how to use Exodus on Kodi. </p>
<p> Without any doubt, Kodi is one of the most popular media players that is open-source too. It supports the installation of add-ons that allow you to add endless possibilities to your Kodi setup including the ability to stream movies, TV shows, and live TV channels. </p>
<p> How to Install Exodus on Kodi? </p>
<p> In this section, we will guide you about how you install Exodus on Kodi and start streaming movies for free. </p>
<p> Before we install an addon on Kodi, we first need to enable Unknown Sources. Similar to how the installation of third-party apps is disabled on Android, Kodi blocks the installation of add-ons by default. And you need to enable it once only and then you can install any kind of addon you want. </p>
<p> Here’s a guide on how to enable Unknown Sources on Kodi: </p>
<p> On your Android device, launch Kodi. </p>
<p> Tap on Settings (cog icon). </p>
<p> Tap on System settings. </p>
<p> Now, from the sidebar, tap on Add-ons and then tap on Unknown sources toggle button. </p>
<p> A warning popup will appear asking if you want to allow installation of add-ons from unknown sources. Tap on Yes to proceed. </p>
<p> Once unknown sources are enabled, we will now guide you on how to install Exodus add-on to watch movies for free on Kodi. The step-by-step guide on how to install the addon on Kodi are as follows. </p>
<p> But before you proceed, first you need to download Kodi Bae repository zip file from here on your Android device using Google Chrome (or any other web browser). The zip file should be saved in the Downloads folder. </p>
<p> Open Kodi on your Android device. </p>
<p> From the sidebar options, tap on Add-ons. </p>
<p> Over the top left corner, you will see an Open Box/Add-on browser icon. Tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on Install from zip file option. </p>
<p> A popup “Install from zip file” menu will appear, tap on External storage. </p>
<p> Now look for Download folder and tap on it. </p>
<p> Here you should find the Kodi Bae repository zip file (repository.kodibae-1.0.0.zip) that you downloaded in the beginning. Tap on it to start the installation. </p>
<p> Once the zip file has been installed, you will see a Kodi Bae Repository add-on installed popup notification on the top-right corner. As shown in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Tap on Kodi Bae Repository. </p>
<p> Tap on Video Add-ons. </p>
<p> Tap on Exodus. </p>
<p> Now you need to wait for about two to three minutes until all the required files are installed for the Exodus add-on. Once the add-on has been successfully installed, an Exodus add-on installed popup notification will appear in the top-right corner. </p>
<p> You can now head over to the Add-ons and then Video add-ons section on your Kodi to launch Exodus add-on. And start streaming all the old and new movies as well as films and TV shows for free on Kodi. </p>
<p> In case you don’t know how to use Exodus add-on to watch movies and TV shows on Kodi then we will suggest you to head over the next section where we have a complete guide on how to use Exodus on Kodi. </p>
<p> How to use Exodus on Kodi </p>
<p> Using Exodus on Kodi to watch movies and TV shows is quite simple. But for starters, who trying to learn all the ins and outs of Kodi and its add-ons, finding out how to use Exodus on your own could be time consuming. </p>
<p> So to help save your valuable time, here we have an easy to follow guide on how to use Exodus on Kodi: </p>
<p> Open Kodi app on your Android device and tap on Add-ons. </p>
<p> Tap on Exodus. </p>
<p> Here you will see Movies, TV Shows, along with few other options. Tap on Movies. (If you want to watch TV shows then tap on the TV Shows option.) </p>
<p> Then you will see categorization by Genres, Year, Languages, Most Popular, Most Voted and few other categories. Select whatever option you want. We are selecting Most Popular option to find all the popular movie titles. </p>
<p> You will now see all the movie titles that are currently popular on Exodus. From the list, tap on the movie you want to stream. We are selecting Black Panther (2018). </p>
<p> Exodus will now start searching all the sources and providers for streaming. This process will take a minute or two to complete. </p>
<p> Once the scan has been completed, Exodus will show you a list of movie streaming sources that are currently active. The quality is mentioned at the end of each source, whether it is 4K, 1080p, 720p, or SD quality. Also, the high-definition movie sources are listed first. Tap on the source that you prefer. I selected source provided by ‘STREAMANGO’. </p>
<p> Now Exodus will try to connect to the selected source and begin loading your selected movie stream source. This process will take a while depending on your Internet connection speed. </p>
<p> Once the connection to the stream has been initiated successfully, the movie will start playing as you can see in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> If in any case the stream was unable to load or the movie does not start playing then simply try another source from the list because sometimes the source is down due to overload or maintenance. </p>
<p> That is all. If you come across any error while installation of Exodus on Kodi or unable to stream movies and TV shows then let me know in the comments below. I will help you troubleshoot the problem. 🙂 </p>

<p> The one-click root process saves the user from following operational steps and, most importantly, the user’s time. </p>
<p> How to Install & Use King Root on Android? </p>
<p> The installation of the Kingo Root app is quite easy, and it opens the gateway to rooting the Android device with just one-click. Once the setup is installed on your Android device, you then have to fulfill the following requirements before starting the root process: </p>
<p> The user must back up all the data available on the Android phone. There is a possibility that the rooting process can clear out the data on the Android device, so it is safer to back up the data. </p>
<p> The device should have enough battery remaining. Ideally, it should be at least 60 percent. The rooting process should not be interrupted due to low battery, as this may cause serious damage to the phone. </p>
<p> The user should ensure good-speed internet connectivity. Rather than relying on the data services, having a good-quality Wi-Fi is recommended. </p>
<p> The user should know how to restore the firmware of the Android phone. In case anything goes wrong during the rooting process so that you can restore the phone to its original state. </p>
<p> The user should enable the “Allow installation from unknown sources” option available on the Android phone. One can switch off this option only after the rooting process is complete. The option is available in the Settings menu. Then, go to security and enable unknown sources. </p>
<p> Once the Kingo Root is installed on the phone, the home screen will appear. The screen displays a lock in the middle of the screen with the Device model and Android version mentioned on the lower side. There is a tab that shows the one-click root option available. Once the user presses the button, the app starts the root process on the Android phone. </p>
<p> The process completion percentage is mentioned on the screen, along with different processes, which are discussed below: </p>
<p> Rooting script is matched with the device </p>
<p> Environment preparation for the rooting process </p>
<p> Rooting script is executed </p>
<p> There are multiple rooting processes integrated within the app. However, only one process runs at one time on the phone. That is why the user is recommended to try running the app several times. If the device is not rooted even after multiple tries, then you can try the Kingo Root PC version to root the Android phone. </p>
<p> Moreover, there are other one-click root apps readily available with a higher success rate and better compatibility with Android devices, and those apps are Framaroot and KingRoot. </p>
<p> It is quite interesting to know how Kingo Root apk performs the rooting task at the back-end after the user clicks the root button. </p>
<p> The first step is to recognize the Android version of the operating system. Once the version is identified, it downloads the relevant exploit files from its server. That is why good-quality internet connectivity should be ensured before starting the root process. After downloading the exploit, the app starts a new process as a system process, which allows it to inject files in the system partition. </p>
<p> Once the app has run the process successfully as a system process, it goes to the next step of installing superuser (SU) files. These files are available on either /system/bin or system/xbin partition. Once that is done, you will have the root access and can do the modifications as desired. </p>
<p> Android Root process </p>
<p> Android is an operating system for smartphones, which is developed by Google on the Linux kernel. So, Android has got more or less similar features available in Linux, which is an operating system for desktops and laptops, just like Windows and Apple. Linux is an open-source operating system and allows the user to access the kernel, which is called root-access. </p>
<p> The user can now access the kernel and enjoy the additional features of the Linux operating system after root-access. The system-level files can be accessed and modified by the user. Similar access can also be achieved on Android phone after rooting. By definition, the root is a privileged user of the operating system. He can not only just access the system files but has got the following three rights as well: </p>
<p> Read </p>
<p> Write/Modify </p>
<p> Delete </p>
<p> It means that the user can perform all the above right on the system-level files. These rights are only available with the administrator and the root. We all have experienced instances when the administrator permissions are required to download or install anything on the operating system. That’s where the privileged access of the root plays an important role. </p>
<p> As mentioned earlier, the Android operating system is developed on the Linux kernel. However, these Android phones do not have access to the root user by default. This means that the user has to root the Android phone to gain the root access. There is a reason that smartphone manufacturers disable root access. It is because all the users can then modify the system-level files that may lead to the unwanted deletion of the system-level files. That may cause inconsistency in the operating system that can cause serious damage to the smartphone’s hardware as well. </p>
<p> That is the main reason that the manufacturers have to disable the root access for the users permanently. The manufacturers can also void the smartphone’s warranty if the user roots the Android phone. All these steps are taken to stop the users from rooting their Android phones since not all the users may have relevant knowledge and expertise about the rooting process. </p>
<p> There can be various reasons to root the Android phone since the user buys the phone to fully utilize its functions and features so one can root it to enjoy root access. </p>
<p> The user can overclock or under-clock the CPU of the Android phone. One can also change the CPU profile after rooting. </p>
<p> The UI and overall appearance can be modified by rooting the Android phone. </p>
<p> The user can change the fonts’ style and their sizes. </p>
<p> One can also enhance the performance of the OS. </p>
<p> Some users intend to explore and learn about the Android OS. </p>
<p> Some applications on Android require the root access on the smartphone. </p>
<p> The user can easily modify the app properties of any application on the Android phone. </p>
<p> The user can uninstall the unwanted system apps that come pre-installed on the phone, which are known as Bloatware. The overall performance is affected by these system apps occupying memory space. </p>
<p> Full customization of the kernel after Android rooting can be achieved. </p>
<p> One can install custom ROMs in the Android phone. </p>
<p> One can restore the deleted files after rooting the Android operating system. Not all the files deleted are permanently removed from the device. So, if the user has deleted any file by mistake, then it can be easily restored if the device is rooted. </p>

<p> LG launched LG G8X ThinQ Dual Display smartphone. Here is how it works </p>
<p> While the Samsung Galaxy Fold and the HUAWEI Mate X are set to herald a new trend of foldable smartphones </p>
<p> While the Samsung Galaxy Fold and the HUAWEI Mate X are set to herald a new trend of foldable smartphones LG has a different approach to it as it aims at mainstreaming a new form factor, a phone with dual screens- one main screen and the other, a detachable one. </p>
<p> As LG launched the LG G8X ThinQ at IFA 2019 it piqued everybody’s interest for its dual screens though it is not the first time LG has flirted with this idea. LG earlier this year launched the LG V50Q ThinQ with dual screens along with the LG G8 ThinQ at MWC 2019. </p>
<p> And now what LG has done is it has launched a successor to the LG G8 ThinQ in the form of the LG G8X ThinQ borrowing the dual-screen idea from the LG V50Q ThinQ, albeit with some refinements. </p>
<p> The LG G8X ThinQ is no doubt a two-screen smartphone but it is a standalone device as well. Like a normal phone, the LG G8X ThinQ sports a 6.4-inch FHD+ OLED FullVision display with 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a smaller waterdrop notch upfront. The display also embeds a digital fingerprint scanner underneath. The smartphone also uses a USB Type-C port without shunning the legacy 3.5mm audio jack. </p>
<p> The glass back of the device mounts a dual-camera system including a 12MP primary sensor and a 13MP super-wide-angle sensor. On the front, a 32MP selfie shooter lives inside the notch. And quite intriguingly, while recording videos users can now switch between front and rear camera. </p>
<p> Under the hood, the LG G8X ThinQ is powered by Snapdragon 855 SoC paired with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage with up to 2TB expansion support via microSD card. A 4,000mAh battery amply backs the phone, considering it also supports a secondary display that sucks juice. </p>
<p> The LG G8X ThinQ comes with a Dual Cover. When there is a need of a secondary screen the phone needs to be slid into the right leaf of the Dual Cover. The phone attaches to the Cover via USB Type-C port instead of Pogo pins used in the case of the LG V50Q ThinQ. </p>
<p> The left leaf of the dual cover already has a display with same size and resolution as that of the LG G8X ThinQ primary display. The second display also has a water-drop notch like that of the primary display but it is a fake one just for the symmetry purpose. </p>
<p> The Dual Cover needs to be opened like a book to take advantage of the two-screen real estate. And when folded there appears a third 2.1-inch mono display on the outer side of the Dual Cover, letting the users have a quick peek to notifications as well as real-time info about date and time without having to open the device. </p>
<p> When held in landscape mode, one of the displays will turn into a trackpad for gaming or a keypad for typing. Also, the two screens will work as two windows for pages to open, elevating our multitasking experience. Both the sides of the Dual Cover are attached via hinges for a seamless 360-degree rotation. </p>
<p> Despite announcing the launch of the LG G8X ThinQ the company has, however, refrained from detailing the price and availability of the phone. We hope LG will soon divulge some information in this regard. So, stay tuned with us. </p>

<p> We all are very well aware of the fact that Android is the only mobile operating system that gives us the maximum choices when it comes to the customizability. </p>

<p> 3 Ways To Fix ‘Failed To Detect Location’ Problem In Pokémon GO [Tutorial] </p>
<p> Are you experiencing failed to detect location or location not found an error in the Pokemon GO and unable to </p>
<p> Are you experiencing failed to detect location or location not found an error in the Pokemon GO and unable to play the game? Or maybe you are trying to spoof your location? You have come to the right place, as here I have shared a step-by-step guide to help you fix the failed to detect the location in Pokemon GO. </p>
<p> According to my research, there are two main reasons why many of you are experiencing the error failed to detect the location in Pokemon GO. Those reasons are: </p>
<p> Reason 1 – You are somewhere under the buildings where your Android phone/tablet is unable to receive GPS signals. </p>
<p> Reason 2 – Mock Locations option is enabled on your Android phone/tablet. </p>
<p> Now, in case you are unaware, ‘mock locations’ feature is being widely used by the Pokemon GO users to spoof their location using GPS spoofing apps like Fly GPS, Fake GPS GO and other similar location hacking apps. These spoofing apps allow them to take their Pokemon GO character to any part of the world and catch Pokemon from the comfort of their home. </p>
<p> Mock locations feature in Android have a back door bug that allows GPS spoofing apps to mock your location without revealing that to the system as well as any app including the Pokemon GO. So, the people over at Pokemon GO have no idea if you are using any location spoofing app. </p>
<p> However, in an attempt to stop spoofers from using location hacking apps on Android, it seems like Pokemon GO developers have teamed up with the developers over at Google Android. This is what forced them to release Android security update through OTA for Android 4.4.x KitKat, Android 5.x Lollipop, Android 6.x Marshmallow, and Android 7.x Nougat. </p>
<p> This security update was released during March 2017, which has directly affected how the spoofing apps like Fake GPS GO and Fly GPS works to spoof your real location in Pokemon GO and apparently patched the mock locations feature. </p>
<p> Once the latest security update has been installed on your phone, the Pokemon GO app will be able to find out if the GPS is being altered using mock locations then it will show you an error message about the location not found, making it unable for you to play the game unless mock locations option is disabled. </p>
<p> After the Android security patch update, the only possible way to spoof your location in Pokemon GO is to first root your Android phone/tablet and then use the GPS spoofing apps. I have discussed in detail about spoofing on Android after security patch below in the tutorial section. </p>
<p> How To Fix Failed To Detect Location Pokémon GO? </p>
<p> Here is a detailed step-by-step tutorial where I will help you troubleshoot the error failed to detect location error in Pokemon GO and ultimately fix the issue. </p>
<p> And if you are one of those PoGo users who is trying to use Fly GPS, Fake GPS GO, or any other similar GPS spoofing and hacking apps with Pokemon GO to spoof your location then please head straight to the Method #3 below to fix the problem of GPS signal not found. 😀 </p>
<p> Method 1 – Check and Make Sure Location Services Are Enabled </p>
<p> The first method. This is where we will check and make sure that the location services are enabled on your Android phone/tablet device or not. </p>
<p> Follow these steps: </p>
<p> Step 1 – Go to “Settings” and tap on the “Location” option. </p>
<p> Step 2 – Tap on the “Mode” option and select “High Accuracy” to set GPS to maximum location accuracy mode. </p>
<p> Step 3 – Now, try to play Pokemon GO and see if the failed to detect GPS issue has been resolved or not. </p>
<p> If it is still not resolved, then follow the steps mentioned in method #2 below. </p>
<p> Method 2 – Disable Mock Locations In Developer Options </p>
<p> In this second method, we will go through a little bit advanced route in an attempt to fix failed to detect location problem that you are experiencing while playing Pokemon GO on your Android phone. </p>
<p> Follow the below steps to find and disable mock locations feature on Android: </p>
<p> NOTE: If the “Developer options” is already enabled on your device then please start following this method from Step 4. </p>
<p> Step 1 – Go to “Settings” and scroll down until you find “About Device” option and tap on it. This option should be located under the System section. </p>
<p> Step 2 – You will now see a list of information about your device, find and tap on the “Build Number” 7 times and then you will see a toast message that says, “You are now a developer”. </p>
<p> Step 3 – Developer options is enabled on your phone. To check, go back to the “Settings” and you will see that the “Developer Options” has now appeared right above the “About Device”. </p>
<p> Step 4 – Tap on the “Developer Options”. There you will see a toggle button on the top and a large list of check boxes. Tap on the toggle button to enable Developer Options. </p>
<p> A new popup message box will appear that says, “These settings are intended for development use only”. Tap on the “OK” button to enable. </p>
<p> Step 5 – Look for “Allow mock locations” checkbox, it should be located under the Debugging section. If this option is enabled, then simply tap on it to disable mock locations. </p>
<p> Also, it is possible that in your version of Android, instead of Allow mock locations checkbox there will be “Select mock location app” option. Make sure it says, “No mock location app set”. </p>
<p> Step 6 – That’s all. Now, try playing Pokemon GO and see if the issue failed to detect location has been resolved or not. </p>
<p> This method should work and fix the failed to detect location error because the latest Android security update has patched the mock locations option, which most of the Pokemon GO users were using to spoof their location. </p>
<p> But, what if you still want to spoof your location in Pokemon GO after the Android security patch update? Next method i.e. Method #3 is where I will guide you on how to spoof in Pokemon GO even if your phone has received the latest Android update. </p>
<p> Method 3 – Spoofing In Pokemon GO After Android March Security Patch </p>
<p> This third and last method is for those of you who are trying to play Pokemon GO on Android device with GPS spoofing or GPS hacking apps (like Fake GPS GO, Fly GPS, GPS JoyStick) through Android’s “Mock Location” feature to spoof location, but unable to play because the game is showing the error ‘Failed to detect location’. </p>
<p> Simply follow the steps below to permanently fix the error and continue spoofing location in Pokemon GO after Android March security update: </p>
<p> To be able to spoof your location in Pokemon GO after the latest Android security update you need to root your device. So the first step to root Android device is to find out the make and model number of your Android phone or tablet by going to Settings and then About Device section. </p>
<p> Since the procedure to root Android device is different for every phone manufacturer, I will suggest you to first try an easy and one-click Android rooting app KingRoot. </p>
<p> In case your phone/tablet is not supported by the KingRoot app then simply perform the following example Google search i.e. “how to root Galaxy S7 SM-G935F” (obviously, you need to replace ‘Galaxy S7 SM-G935F’ with the model number of your device) and you will find many tested and proven ways on how to root your particular Android device. </p>
<p> For best results, I will recommend you to opt for system-less root. </p>
<p> We will now use a unique Privacy Mode feature of GPS JoyStick app to hide the presence of location spoofing app from Pokemon GO. So open GPS JoyStick and under the Quick Options section, you will find Privacy Mode. Tap it. </p>
<p> It will ask, “Do you want to generate a new copy or update an existing generated one?” Tap on Generate. </p>
<p> In the provided box, type a new app name. Here I am using “PoGo GPS App” as a new name. Then tap on Start. </p>
<p> The generation of the new app will take about a minute to complete. </p>
<p> Once the app has been generated successfully, the installation screen for the PoGo GPS App will appear. Tap Install. </p>
<p> Now first you need to uninstall GPS JoyStick Fake GPS Location app and then convert PoGo GPS App to the system app. For that, we will use the Link2SD app. This app will let you move PoGo GPS App to the system directory within a matter of seconds and will take care of all the permissions. </p>
<p> When Link2SD has been installed, open the app and allow it root access. </p>
<p> You will now see a list of all the apps installed on your device. Find PoGo GPS App and tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on the menu button located at the upper right corner and then tap Convert to system app option. </p>
<p> A convert app popup, as shown in the screenshot below, will appear. Tap on OK to proceed. It will take a while to convert. </p>
<p> Once the app has been converted successfully, you will see a “Reboot device” toast message. Please reboot your device for the changes to take effect. </p>
<p> Now we have to configure PoGo GPS App. So launch the app and tap on the menu button located at the top left corner. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Under settings, you need to make sure the following four options are enabled: In case you are wondering, the Enable System Mode option will let you spoof your location in Pokemon GO without enabling mock locations. And remember, enabling and disabling the Disable Location Service state option will require you to reboot your device. </p>
<p> Enable Indirect Mocking, </p>
<p> Enable System Mode, </p>
<p> Disable Location Service, </p>
<p> Enable A-GPS Reset. </p>
<p> That is all with the setup. Now you need to unroot your Android device because if you stay rooted then Pokemon GO will not allow you to play the game. </p>
<p> Simply use the SuperSU app’s built-in feature to unroot your phone. In case you are wondering, the SuperSU app must have already been installed after you rooted your device. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you opted for system-less root method then you will be able to enable/disable root using a simple switch as shown in the screenshot below using iSU. 😉 </p>
<p> We will now check if our Android device has been unrooted properly. For that, we need to install SafetyNet Helper app. </p>
<p> Open the app and run the test. It will perform several tests on your device and let you know if your device has passed or not. </p>
<p> If the tests are cleared successfully it means your device has been unrooted successfully and you can now play Pokemon GO. Else, if any of the tests failed then you need to perform Step #18 again in order to unroot your device. </p>
<p> In case you are unable to unroot your device then please leave your comment in the comments section below. I will help you out! 🙂 </p>
<p> Go to Settings -> Location and set the location mode to Device only. </p>
<p> Open PoGo GPS App, select Set Location option and then tap on the option that says Click here to open the map. A map will now open and then you can select whatever location you want your Pokemon character to spoof. Then tap on the Start button to begin spoofing in the selected location. You will see a hovering menu with a joystick and all the controls. </p>
<p> Now you can launch Pokemon GO game and control your Pokemon character with the joystick to spoof your location. There won’t be any ‘failed to detect location error’ and you will not see any Pokemon GO blacklist warning screen, all thanks to the GPS JoyStick’s Privacy Mode. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> I hope the methods mentioned here in this article have helped you in fixing failed to detect location error in Pokemon GO. And also assisted you in spoofing your location in the game even after your phone has received the latest Android March security update. </p>
<p> In case you have any questions or if you are stuck at any step then leave your question in the comments section below and I will get back to you shortly. </p>
<p> Does the rooting option work also on old operating systems like lollipop? I don’t really wanna risk making damages to my a5 7.0 </p>
<p> Yes it should work on Lollipop too. And as far as I am aware, Google has not released a security update for Lollipop yet, so what you can do is first try location spoofing using Fly GPS app on your old device. Tutorial for that is available here: https://bestforandroid.com/fake-location-pokemon-go/ </p>
<p> In case Fly GPS didn’t work or your old device has already received a security update, then simply use the Fake GPS GO rooting option. </p>
<p> I have tried 3rd method after march security update. it still showing failed to detect location ,i checked everything that is fake gps go is my system app and safetynet is also passed .still its showing “failed to detect location”. then I went to developer options and mock location was disabled.but when i run fake gps go ,mock location starts automatically .I set it to none and reboot my device.Then it was selected as no mock location app but when I start snoffing in fake gps o it turned on automatically and pokemon go shows failed t detect location. When i turned it off again still it shows failed t detect location . If anyone has a solution for this ,please help me. </p>
<p> Hey @disqus_Ylu7FLPINm:disqus, thanks for stopping by. </p>
<p> Before I can suggest you anything, please try to play Pokemon GO without running Fake GPS GO. This is just to check if the game detects your location or it is still unable to detect location. </p>
<p> Yes, it shows my location without fake gps. And pokemon too but where I live there are no pokestops. As I told U fake gps automatically set mock location to itself. Or my phone set mock location app as fake gps go. But It is set as system app in my phone. I don’t know why this is happening. The point is that mkck location app is setting automatically to fake gps. Even when I set it to none and reboot my device then in mock location app fake gps go is already set up when I start spoofing. Also I have magisk installed can u tell any other method to hack it by root. </p>
<p> @disqus_Ylu7FLPINm:disqus that’s strange. I never experienced this type of problem :/ </p>
<p> Anyways, to find a solution for you, I have tried few other GPS spoofing apps and luckily found an app that works better than the one mentioned in article. Also, it has a couple of more settings like that might solve your mock location issue. The app is GPS JoyStick Fake GPS Location available here. </p>
<p> Give it a try then let me know. And don’t forget to make it a system app. 😀 </p>
<p> In case you are wondering, check the screenshot to see the settings I am talking about 😉 </p>
<p> Make sure the location mode is set to “GPS only/Device only”. Also, check that the “WiFi scanning” and “Bluetooth scanning” options are turned off. Sometimes changes in these settings reveal your true location. </p>
<p> that fixed the problem of pokemon go detecting my original location, thanks a lot </p>
<p> Depends on the Android device you are using. In majority of cases, that ‘simply’ works well. 🙂 </p>
<p> im almost worn out on trying to do this- it’s been several hours and i cant figure out what the hold up is. I was able to root, and when i did, the fake gps app dissapears. When i unroot and reboot, i install the fake gps app again and toggle the mode the root mode. Pokemon GO does let me play, and the joystick thing is up- but when i try to move my character around, it wont move. I have set the location mode to device only, and turned off the scanning things as you have advised in previous comments, and i still cant get the guy to move around using the joystick or manually selecting a location in the fake gps app. I feel like i have done literally everything and i cant get it to work. Im using an s5 model sm-g900h , running 6.0. It’s been like 10 hours over the past two days and i’m about to give up. Any ideas for something i haven’t tried? Thanks </p>
<p> I am glad you tried things on your own and then left a comment for help. </p>
<p> Don’t worry, you didn’t waste your time. Seems like Fake GPS GO isn’t working well with your phone. Please give a try to GPS JoyStick app, it is available here. </p>
<p> I have already suggested this same app to someone else in the comments section. It worked for him. </p>
<p> i think it has something to do with fused location which i am currently trying to figure out because i still get the failed to detect location even after following all these steps to a t </p>
<p> There is a manual way to disable fused location on Android but that only works well if you have systemless root. The easier way is to give a try to the app (GPS JoyStick) I have recommended to Dave in the comment below and enable all these options shown in the screenshot. Then restart your phone. It will take care of fused location for you. 😉 </p>
<p> I have the same problem as dave. I installed the GPS Joystick app now, but I can not enable the system mode and disable location service. I moved the app to the system and rebooted the phone, but it does not work. what should i do ? </p>
<p> Anyone successfully done it on a metro samsung j7? I want to do it but not waste my time.please and thanks </p>
<p> I have Samsung Galaxy J7 and this guide worked for me but I did not unroot my phone I simply opted for Magisk which is a systemless root so I can easily switch off the root when I want to play Pokemon GO and switch on the root when I am not playing. </p>
<p> This way I am able to enjoy the best of both worlds. </p>
<p> Trying to test this on an old Experia E3 I had lying around.root king unlocked it but when I try to put the fake GPS into the system I get “mount: operation not permitted” I wanted to test this before I root my good phone as I have to root it the hard way as its not supported by rootking and sure if I got it working on my old Experia maybe I might leave it at that </p>
<p> Seems like your phone isn’t properly rooted. And since it is an old phone so there aren’t much information available regarding this particular phone. </p>
<p> Which other Android phone do you have? Maybe you will be able to use Magisk on it, which is far better than KingRoot/SuperSU? </p>
<p> In case you don’t know, Magisk is powerful and allows you to switch the root on/off at your convenience. 😉 </p>
<p> Vodafone smart ultra 7 running running android 6.0 </p>
<p> Stupidity install the security update last Friday which killed my fake GPS no root hack. </p>
<p> There isn’t a simple way to root my phone as I have to flash it as its not compatible with root king ect </p>
<p> This seems to work youtu. be/WuJk0hxRsRY as the guy who uploaded it linked it to me on fda developers forum but this is something I haven’t done before so. I’m struggling to follow and scared ill mess it up. Again this doesnt unroot it </p>
<p> What I’m thinking of doing is getting someone to roll back the security patch or would I be able to do it myself? </p>
<p> Hey, I rooted my Samsung A5. So I wanted to start with step 4 method 3. But when I tried to convert Fake GPS Go, FakeGPS Free or Fly GPS to a system app with Link2SD I got this error: “mount: ‘/dev/block/platform/13540000.dwmmc0/by-name/SYSTEM’->’/system’: Device or resource busy”. So what can i do? </p>
<p> If Link2SD is not working then you can download and use “Titanium Backup” to convert any app to system app. It is available on Play Store. </p>
<p> this is exactly what my s6 says, on stock with root and on CarHD nougat rom with root, titanium wouldnt do it either, tried to manually do it with ES but I can/t see any option for moving the App.Sorry , don’t want to be a pain but would love to get this to work. </p>
<p> on my case everything worked out, and I ain’t getting the detect thing anymore, but the flygps go app just doesnt work, neither the teleport neither the joystick, what can I do? </p>
<p> Hi @ayronpereira:disqus, many people are having problem with Fly GPS app. I will suggest you to give a try to another location hacking app i.e. GPS JoyStick. You can download it from here. </p>
<p> Give it a try and let me know if that works for you or not! 🙂 </p>
<p> Thanks!!! I was babysitting and when I wasn’t looking the brats screwed with my phone to see if it would work without risking theirs. I didn’t think my phone would ever work again. I’m trying this on my sons phone now because why break one persons phone when you can break two! Again Thanks. You’re a lifesaver! </p>
<p> So sorry to hear that! But I would like to mention that Android phones are generally not THAT easy to break. </p>
<p> Anyways, I am here to help you out. You can share your problem here in comments and I will help you fix your phone. 🙂 </p>
<p> I have a gun you can borrow for yourself (kill yourself) u can have it for free in 3 days then 50usd per day </p>
<p> This worked perfectly, but a recent update to Pokemon Go now IDs blacklisted apps and displays the warning message if it detects any blacklisted apps. Has anyone used an App Cloner to clone GPS spoofing app, change app name then convert it to a system app and still be able to use all the GPS spoofing app functions? Wanted to see if cloning would hide the app from detection. </p>
<p> Hey @kawikakaanohi:disqus, thanks a lot for your valuable input and a valid query. I tried this method after recent Pokemon GO updates and it showed me the following Pokemon GO blacklist warning message about apps that falsify your location. </p>
<p> Now since you have pointed it out so I searched and found out that there is actually a workaround for this problem and to help you guys I have completely updated the method #3 in above article along with relevant images. I hope the guide helps you to continue spoofing in Pokemon GO. 😉 </p>
<p> For those of you who don’t know, the whole Pokemon GO blacklist warning message reads: “We have detected software that can interfere with the operations of Pokemon GO on your device. This includes applications that falsify your location. Using unauthorized software that directly impacts Pokemon GO is a violation of Niantic’s Terms of Service and can result in the loss of your account. You will need to uninstall any such applications in order to continue gameplay.” </p>
<p> hey bro, whenever i tried to move my GPS joystick to system app, after reboot it always dissapear, care to explain why it is happen? </p>
<p> Hi bro, sometimes there are issues with specific Android phone or version which causes the app to disappear after reboot. There are other apps too (like Lucky Patcher) that allows you to move any app to system directory but I have given you a manual method below that works on almost any phone. Give it a try and let me know if it worked for you! 🙂 </p>
<p> Here’s what you can do to move GPS JoyStick to system: 1. Download GPS JoyStick from above and then generate a new copy of app using Privacy Mode. 2. Use file manager with root access like ES File Explorer to manually move the GPS app to “system/priv-app” directory. 3. Now change the permissions for GPS app as follows (rw- r– r–): – Read for all, – Write for owner, and – Execute for none. </p>
<p> Now restart your device and the app will not disappear. </p>
<p> Please share details about your Android device including make, model number, Android version. Also tell me which method did you use to root your phone? </p>
<p> 1) Link2SD doesn’t ask me about having root access, so I’m not able to change the new app to system app. How do I change the Link2SD to have root access? </p>
<p> 2) If we want to use back the real location, do we just open the original Pokemon Go app instead of the newly created one? </p>
<p> 1(a) There are chances that you don’t have root access. Download any root checker app to check if your Android device is rooted. 1(b) In case you are already rooted but Link2SD didn’t prompt for root access then open SuperSU and check the list of apps, you should see Link2SD there. Tap on it and grant root access from there. </p>
<p> 2(a) We are not creating a hacked Pokemon GO apk here. What we are actually doing is creating a unique copy of GPS JoyStick app (using Privacy Mode) to fake our location without letting the Pokemon GO game to detect that we are using any location spoofing app. 2(b) If you want to use your real location then go to GPS JoyStick settings menu and deactivate “Disable Location Service” option and restart your phone. Now play Pokemon GO game without GPS JoyStick app and it should detect your real location. </p>
<p> And it seems like you didn’t understand how this GPS hack really works. Don’t worry, let me explain you a bit: </p>
<p> GPS JoyStick is a simple app that will let you fake your location using a joystick. It imitates realistic walking/jogging to avoid detection. You can enter any coordinates into the GPS JoyStick app and it will spoof you there and show that you actually there. You can then move around that location using onscreen joystick. </p>
<p> Now, the joystick app alone is of no use. So you need to open Pokemon GO game and it will take your character to the same location which you selected in the GPS JoyStick app. You can now control your character using joystick. </p>
<p> I hope this helps you out. If you have any other question please feel free to ask. Happy Spoofing! 🙂 </p>
<p> Since you are using Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge so I will recommend you to opt for system-less root like Magisk so that you can easily bypass safetynet. You haven’t provided your device model number otherwise I would have redirected you to your device specific forum. </p>
<p> Anyways, you can read more about the installation of Magisk on Galaxy S7 Edge here. </p>
<p> I will suggest you to first read all the relevant topics there and then begin with the rooting process. This is just to avoid any unexpected loss of data. </p>
<p> Your question/comment wasn’t deleted, it was under moderation, maybe because of your name. </p>
<p> And if GPS JoyStick app worked first time then it should work every time without any issue. To rectify the issue, I will suggest you to retry all the steps and see if it works or not because it’s working perfectly here. </p>
<p> Hi and thank you for a great guide, quick question, I can’t get link2sd or titanium to convert to system app, I have root and put on a fresh nougat rom on an s6 edge G925F, any tips on what i need to do ? Many many thanks in advance. </p>
<p> Thanks for the appreciation, @liam_nightingale:disqus! 🙂 </p>
<p> You mentioned that you have root. If Link2SD and Titanium failed then the best option is to manually convert GPS JoyStick using any root file manager like ES File Explorer. </p>
<p> If I have already mentioned the procedure to manually convert user app to system app in the comments below. Anyways, here’s how to convert: 1. Download GPS JoyStick from above and then generate a new copy of app using Privacy Mode. 2. Use file manager with root access like ES File Explorer to manually move the GPS app to “system/priv-app” directory. 3. Now change the permissions for GPS app as follows (rw- r– r–): – Read for all, – Write for owner, and – Execute for none. </p>
<p> Now restart your device and the app should be converted into system app. </p>
<p> Hi, @Mohammad Farzan. I too encounter disappearing app after using Link2SD. I have followed the manual copy method as suggested. Thereafter, as soon as I uninstall the original GPS JoyStick Fake GPS Location app, PoGo GPS App disappears. I discovered that as soon as there’s no APK in the data/app, PoGo GPS App disappears even if a APK exists in either system/priv-app or system. Any advise? Thanks. </p>
<p> I am glad that you gave the manual procedure a try before asking. </p>
<p> Here is a suggestion for you: </p>
<p> Download the GPS JoyStick apk and copy it to the “system/priv-app” directory. Then set correct permissions for APK (as mentioned in my previous comment). It should not disappear now. </p>
<p> hello i have android 5 and i don’t have the “Enable Indirect Mocking” option. what can i do? </p>
<p> Hi @dangrinberg:disqus, the reason why “Enable Indirect Mocking” option is not visible for you is that you didn’t convert GPS JoyStick to system app. Please follow step 9 to 14 in the above guide. </p>
<p> Hi. I did everything simingly well, but I failed the scans of the unrooting process. I used the SuperSU full unroot option, as mentioned, and then rebooted, but the device still seems rooted. Can you please help me? It will be much appreciated if it ends up working. </p>
<p> Can you please help me? I have a galaxy S5 with Android 6.0.1 installed. I ended up in the unrooting phase, but after choosing the option of full unroot in the SuperSU app, the app that you provided (SafetyNet attest) says that the CTS profile match is false. Even though the Root Checker Basic app says that the phone is unrooted. </p>
<p> I am trying to open the Pokemon Go app, but it says “Unable To Authenticate. Please try again” whenever I try to log in via the Google Account. </p>
<p> Hi @georgekousias:disqus, I will suggest you to opt for systemless root like Magisk or iSU. </p>
<p> The reason why you are unable to login to Pokemon GO app and CTS profile mismatch is because SuperSU failed to completely remove all the patched files from the /system directory of your phone. </p>
<p> Passing SafetyNet tests is important if you want to play Pokemon GO on rooted Android device and this is the reason why I have suggested in the guide above to use systemless root. </p>
<p> If you need any further help then please let me know… </p>
<p> Hey i need help too:( i make a root with odin, trwp and SU on my Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2016). Root worked well, the gps app with private mode worked too (link2sd worked not..but lucky patcher made a system app of it and i could chance the switches). Root checker said successfully root.:) But then i tried to unroot..i deinstalled su and said no to make stock room again..after restart i tried the test and all tests were red..what can i do to unroot?:( </p>
<p> Hi @tlhhecklero:disqus, there are certain Android devices with which SuperSU finds it hard to remove all the patched files from the /system partition. If anything is modified in the Android system directory then you won’t be able to pass SafetyNet tests. </p>
<p> Your best bet is to use systemless root method like Magisk to root your phone. This way you will NOT need to unroot your device, will be able to pass all SafetyNet tests, and spoof in the Pokemon GO game with GPS JoyStick app. </p>
<p> I hope this helps. If you need any further guidance then let me know… </p>
<p> Hi, great article. I used super u and it asked I wanted to unroot. it did inexactly what it said it would do, but I still fail the safety net scan. Thanks again </p>
<p> Hi @keithzahler:disqus, I will suggest you to try systemless root method i.e. Magisk or iSU. The reason behind this is that unrooting using SuperSU usually leaves some files in the Android /system partition which triggers SafetyNet and results in the failure of tests. </p>
<p> I’m in my lotion I choose but it said location not found error on top of my Pokemon go screen in red. </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_axfexASstz:disqus, are you sure you have disabled “Mock Location” option in the “Developer Options” of your phone? If not then I will suggest you to follow the steps mentioned in Method #2 in the article above. </p>
<p> I used method 3 on my old Samsung S4 with version 5 Android. It all worked perfectly except the first option to enable indirect mocking was greyed out and I could not turn it on. </p>
<p> I am able to teleport and can catch a few pokemon that pop up as I enter, but after that I see no more pokemon. I can spin pokestops and move about but usually about a half hour into it, nothing works for me and I have to leave the game and reenter. Sometimes I get unable to authenticate and have to wait a long time to get back in. I also can no longer do raids, though originally I did do one. I get network error on raids. </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_WbAxYdT0fg:disqus, you mentioned that your Galaxy S4 is running on Android 5, which is Lollipop. While the “Enable Indirect Mocking” option is only compatible with Android 6.0 and above. </p>
<p> As far as seeing less Pokemon is concerned, maybe you are trying to move too fast. You need to travel slowly and imitate how you actually walk. </p>
<p> For example, if you try to reach a Pokemon by walking over the buildings/hindrances through which usually no one can pass then the game will detect this move and impose temporary ban on your account. That’s the reason why you encounter less Pokemon and experience unable to authenticate error. </p>
<p> When playing with joystick, you must need to play it safe and are not allowed to jump from one place to another within a minute. </p>
<p> That’s not what happened at all. I walked slowly down roads or stood around by lured pokestops and didn’t move … no pokemon came. I have since given up and no longer am interested in spoofing. Thanks anyway, you got me closer than I ever got before. </p>
<p> Even if you were careful, Niantic must have noticed some unusual activity and imposed temporary ban on your account, which is why you didn’t see any Pokemon. Good thing is that most of the bans are temporary and lifted in 24 to 48 hours or when you play legit. </p>
<p> You’re welcome, Debbie! Location spoofing in Pokemon Go works perfectly if you do it occasionally with extreme precaution 🙂 </p>
<p> Hello.. I followed your third method..and I am not able to login through my Gmail account as it is showing unable to authenticate account…… Please give me any solution…. </p>
<p> Hello @diamondahuja:disqus, that usually happens when you are unable to pass SafetyNet tests. </p>
<p> Make sure your device is properly unrooted before attempting to play Pokemon GO. I will recommend you to follow step 18 and step 19 in method #3 above. </p>
<p> Ok.. thanks I am now able to login… But it is still detecting third party software…and recommending to change password… How to stop it from detection….? </p>
<p> Are you sure you have used GPS JoyStick’s Privacy Mode feature? It has been mentioned in Step 4 under Method #3. Privacy Mode is designed to stop Pokemon GO from detecting third party software like GPS JoyStick or any other location spoofing app. </p>
<p> Try Privacy Mode and see if the error comes back again or not. Good luck! 🙂 </p>
<p> I now noticed that ​indirect mocking mode was not enabled.. As my Android version is 5.1.1and it is only working for marshmallow and above ..so how can i upgrade my Android version.. pls tell…… </p>
<p> Hi, go to settings>apps and force stop Pokemon go. Exit and restart the app, it should then work if it’s not a server issue with Niantic. </p>
<p> Hi Mohammad, Thank you very much. Got all your method 3 right and it worked 100 % until yesterday when I logged in and up pops the dreaded red warning screen. I’m from Level 1 till almost end of Level 20. I spoof only at pier 29 to 39 which is within the 5 km radius and only use the walking mode. Do you think that Niantic caught onto the system or is it my IP address betrayed my location. Please help. Thanks </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_qq5hY7oNoR:disqus, Niantic have a lot of different ways to detect spoofing. Seems like your account was detected for suspicious activity and they gave you a warning. I will suggest you to play legit (without spoofing) for about a week to ten days and the warning should disappear. </p>
<p> Guys over at Niantic knows very well about spoofing but they cannot simply ban all the accounts in one go. They start by giving warnings to stop players from using GPS joystick or other location spoofing apps. Usually botting permanently bans your account but spoofing will give you warnings only. </p>
<p> And thanks a lot for verifying that the location spoofing method works with Pokemon GO. </p>
<p> Thanks Mohammad for your advice, will definitely try new ways to perfect the system now that I’d gain more insight by reading through all your Q & A. You’re the best. </p>
<p> I have been unable root my zte zmax pro model number z981 any idea why it what else I try </p>
<p> I used kingroot to root spare phone, I turned the root off but still failed the test. Help! </p>
<p> I have been spoofing using a Metro ZTE zMAX Pro with the fake GPS free app. I would say for the first couple hours I had no issues. Now any time I go to move on the map of gps app i get the location or gps message in the red box of pokemon game and have to boot the game. I’m just wondering if anybody else has had any success with this particular phone and if so what was their best method when unrooting and then rooting back. I’m not very good when it comes to computers or the smartphones I am terrified that I’m going to end up with a worthless phone I have read every single one of these comments and not one person has mentioned a zMAX ZTE Pro I’m hoping that’s a good sign and nobody had any issues and it was very easy for them any and all suggestions or advice is very welcome </p>
<p> Hi Mohammad, would like to seek your advice. Does GPS Joystick still work for rooted phone with the recent Pokemon Go or Google Maps update that caused these spoofing apps not to work on unrooted phones recently (pls see link below)? I’m asking because I am thinking if i should take the risk to root my Samsung S7 Edge but i do not want to end up not being able to spoof after rooting…thanks in advance.. </p>
<p> Hi @andr_ayoung:disqus, before trying the joystick with Pokemon GO, I will recommend you to open Google Maps and try to use the joystick there and see if it works or not. Then let me know here. </p>
<p> No luck. Tried several options and reinstalled. Still nada on the map or the app </p>
<p> Hi! Could you please help me? My phone is already rooted and my phone is not supported with SD card. Is there any way on how to convert the app into system app? Thank you! </p>
<p> Hi @rodneytarrazona:disqus, you don’t need to have a SD Card compatible phone/tablet to use Link2SD app. We have used that app just to convert GPS JoyStick app into system app. Alternatively, you can try Titanium app to convert the app. </p>
<p> Hi Mohammad, I tried the method 3 and worked perfectly. I’m using Android 4.4.2 in my tablet GT-N8000. I had a problem to unroot the device, so I bought the app “Simply Unroot” and solved the problem. thanks a lot! </p>
<p> I followed all of your steps above. Instead of using SU though, I have Magisk installed using Magisk hide and had safetynet pass. I am still getting the GPS location error though </p>
<p> Hello. I rooted my phone with Kingroot, i wanted to unroot it, the app was deleted, but root still remained. What i need to do? My phone sony experia z1 </p>
<p> Hi, I followed your method #3 and managed to get it to work. However, Google Maps does not work for me anymore. Is there any way that i can get it to work again? Thanks! </p>
<p> Hi, I managed to get it to work using method #3. However, Google Maps is not working for me after doing so. Is there any way that i can get it to work again? Thanks! </p>
<p> I was able to get as far as Unrooting with SuperueSU but then my phone got into a Loading screen loop, unable to start, so I got the ROM image and undid all I had done. any tips to prevent Knox from activating? </p>
<p> I’m getting the message: This device, OS, or software is not compatible with pokemon GO, but it only seems to appear if joystick is running. </p>
<p> Hey, the pokemon go keeps closing saying the game is not compatible with my device (probably still rooted, yet it passed in the tests) </p>
<p> Hi, I unrooted my device using SU clean unroot but i still fail the safetynet test “SafetyNet response CTS profile match: false Basic Integrity: false” </p>
<p> Thanks for this, seems to be working. However its seems the joystick is very slow. I havent made any other changes to the gps app other than what was said here, has anyone else noticed it being slow. I have it set to the third option wich shows what looks like a very fast runner but my character walks very slowly. </p>
<p> So i rooted my phone using odin and cf autoroot… worked rather well… got joystick into system… everything is set… went to superSU aaaand…. well first time arond… it didnt even want to unroot… the next cf autoroot and going over the steps again more carefully and not restoring my phone while rooted did let the superSU finish without errors… however… the safetynet fails on both fronts… superSU is not present anymore… my pokemon go seems to not go past half loading… showing sign out button, i guess it signed in when i downloaded it from playstore via google account… anywho… its not working… after first try i used odin to install firmware from the internet that matched my phone… and it was unrooted and safety check worked except the joystick was gone… so i guess that 4.5 gigabytes of firmware replaced everything in system folder… so… now im rooted again anyways and dont want to proceed without getting help first… superSU – uninstalled, not sure if rooted or not, safetynet – failed… dev options not enabled (that obviously was undone) phone galaxy a5, model sm-a520f , build nr- nrd90m.A520FXXU4BRC4 , android ver 7.0 samsung experiance 8.1 security march 1 2018 baseband ver (unsure if that helps) A520FXXU4BRC1… </p>
<p> Sadly, I don’t understand why its not linking, it says for me to ‘grant’ or ‘allow’ however it the allow.and grant never show up, not sure what or where to find it…any help? </p>
<p> after unrooting my phone using supersu, it reboots my phone and gets stuck on boot screen forever. can’t do anything appart from using boot recovery. Can you help? </p>
<p> On the featured post it says to select those options but they are greyed out for me and says it needs to be a system app </p>
<p> Hi my location is coming back to it’s original location in few seconds I tried different apps but it still coming back what to do man please answer me please </p>
<p> Is it really necessary to rename the GPS app package still? </p>
<p> I’m on a Google Pixel XL – 8.1, rooted with Magisk. I have root hidden (PoGo runs without any issues) and I can spoof with 100% accuracy (no rubberbanding) using FakeGPS Route (paid). I run FakeGPS in Expert Mode as a system app and have disabled fused location and it gets my spoofed location while having NO mock location app set. I have yet to get any warnings or anything. I’m not sure how PoGo determines how you are spoofing but my set up seems pretty good. </p>
<p> Hey Mohammed followed your guide and I’m stuck on step 18 I am failing the safety net tests of CTS and basic integrity! Need help! </p>
<p> After doing step 17, and rebooting, I got in a bootloop on my new Honor View 10 phone!! Nooooooo :”( </p>
<p> Fucking nigger. You know what happens to animals like you? They get slayed! You broke my device nigger dick </p>
<p> Fucking nigger. You know what happens to animals like you? They get slayed! You broke my device nigger dick 4333 </p>

<p> I try and run pokemon go and it says it can’t connect to my google account which I used to hook up with the game… I have disabled supersu but no luck so far </p>
<p> Hello. After Step 14, PoGo GPS App has gone. I don’t know where to go after the step. Need some help. Thanks </p>
<p> Option 3 – On step 18 we are unable to “enable system mode” . Had this issue with link2sd error : mount: /’system’ not in /proc/mounts. Then when attempting to fix that , it gives the error : second partition not found blah blah blah. ( It wants second partition on an ad card . This phone is only internal storage( no sd card option) </p>

<p> Malwarebytes – AdwCleaner APK </p>
<p> Want to protect your device from viruses and malwares? We’ve got you covered by bringing to you the best adware </p>

<p> Want to protect your device from viruses and malwares? We’ve got you covered by bringing to you the best adware cleaner at the palm of your hands. </p>
<p> About Malwarebytes/AdwCleaner APK: </p>
<p> ADW cleaner is one of the most trusted and widely used adware cleaners out there in the market. It was first developed for MAC and Windows but as a lot of people were requesting a similar version of that app for their android devices, they finally made one for all the Android smartphones and tablets. </p>
<p> It was originally launched by the name “Adw cleaner” but after a while, they changed their name into Malwarebytes security. Its main job is to scan your device every day for any type of malware or ransomware and remove them to protect your device from any harm as quickly as possible. </p>
<p> A brief description of malware and ransomware could be that malware is a kind of software, designed to take over unauthorized or unsecured devices to use and view your data. And ransomware is another type of application that is designed to block the access of the original user until the requested amount of money is paid. </p>
<p> This type of virus was generally popular for windows computers as it was easier to gain access on that device but with advancement in software and increasing demand for users ID and their info for negative use, people have developed applications that can do the same thing on your android device. </p>

<p> Download APK File </p>
<p> App Details & Guide </p>

Look no further, simply download Mobdro app now and enjoy endless streamable content, in the form of the channel, from all around the web. </p>
<p> About Mobdro APK Movies Streaming </p>
<p> Mobdro apk is favorite videos and movies streaming app for Android smartphones and tablet devices that search the whole web, discovers all the freely available streamable media content, and then sorts each one of them neatly in different categories including news, TV shows, movies, music, sports, gaming, technology, animals, cartoons, and whatnot. </p>
<p> From the list of categories, just tap on your favorite category and the app will show you the list of all the live and streamable videos available from all around the world in that specific category. For example, if you choose movies, then the Mobdro app will show you a list of movie channels where different movies would be playing. From this point onwards, you can just try switching between different channels until you find the one that is worth watching. </p>
<p> By now, you must have got an idea about how the Mobdro app actually works. The user interface of this app is designed in such a way that the experience of using it seems pretty much similar to how you switch channels on your home television because in both cases you will never know what type of show, movie, or content will be playing on the upcoming channel. </p>
<p> The broad variety of streaming media and video content available in Mobdro for Android is overwhelming and caters to the needs and requirements of people for all ages and interests.

Using this app, you can easily find those missed TV show episodes, and then binge-watch those episodes whenever you want. </p>
<p> It is important to let you know that Mobdro was previously not entirely free and there were two different versions, i.e. Freemium and Premium. Because the app was gaining serious popularity among the entertainment and media streaming users, so the developers planned to add a paid Premium version with the option to remove advertisements along with some additional features like the option to remove ads as well as the ability to download live streams. </p>
<p> But that addition of Premium turned off a lot of users and negatively affected the usage of the app. So the developers decided to change their app structure completely and introduced premium versions within the Freemium Mobdro without any charges. </p>
<p> The Mobdro Freemium version is entirely free to download, install, and use on any Android device and does not require any charges or fees to use but it is supported by advertisements so you can expect to see ads here and there while watching videos. However, there is an added option that let you turn off advertisements without any charges. </p>

You can download streams for specific minutes or hours (depending on the free storage space available on your device). </p>

<p> The modified, patched, and a modded Google Play Store apk is one of the most called for apps among Android users because of its benefits. Now, your search is over for latest and working Google Play Store apk with installer+patch+mod for all your apps need and requirements. 😀 </p>
<p> We all know about the usual Play Store by Google that comes preinstalled in almost every Android phone and tablet devices. But there are some limitations in the original Play Store, which is why many opt for modified Google Play Store apk because it offers numerous benefits including the popular trick to download paid apps for free. </p>
<p> And if you are wondering… </p>
<p> Why I should download and install modded/patched Google Play Store apk on my Android phone and what are its benefits? Then we have a straightforward answer for you, and for that, you need to read the features and benefits section below. </p>
<p> About Google Play Store Mod & Patch APK </p>
<p> The modded Google Play Store is exactly similar to the original store we all already have on our Android smartphones and tablet devices. It has same interface, usability, the same number of apps and games, you can even do in-app purchases and buy paid apps. </p>
<p> However, the patched version of Google Play Store has some advanced functionalities like offline verification of paid/pirated apps, ability to freely use all those apps that are protected by Google LVL, and few more. We have discussed these and how you can benefit from them in detail in our next section. </p>
<p> Features/Benefits of Patched & Modded Google Play Store APK </p>
<p> Here we have listed all the features and benefits of having a patched and modded version of Google Play Store apk on your Android device: </p>
<p> Use apps protected by Google LVL (License Verification Library) – The modified version of Google Play Store will let you use all of those apps protected by Google LVL without cracking the app itself as the store is configured to auto-verify these types of apps. </p>
<p> Offline license verification of the apps – Since the Play Store apk is modded so you can easily verify the license of all those Google LVL protected apps even while you are offline and without internet connectivity. </p>
<p> Allows you to keep & use paid apps even after refund – Usually, when you install a paid app and then request a refund within 2 hours, the process automatically removes the app from your phone too. But with the patched Google Play Store, you will be able to keep and use the app without any restrictions even after you have received a refund. </p>
<p> Stops Google Play Store automatic updates – In original Play Store there is no way to stop/disable official updates to the store but the modded Google Play Store comes with the updates disabled so you will continue to stay in the same version and there won’t be any forced downloads. </p>
<p> Apart from these above-mentioned modifications, rest of the features being offered by the original Play Store will remain intact and operational including billing, interface, usability, and other core functionalities. </p>
<p> However, we feel that it is important to tell you that the Google Play Store modded and patched version apk requires root access and would not allow you to do the following: </p>
<p> Download paid apps for free, </p>
<p> Hack in-app purchases of apps. </p>
<p> By the way, if you are looking for a method to free in-app purchases, we have a separate app and a complete tutorial to help you hack in-app purchases of apps and games on Android. 😉 </p>

<p> NOTE: Before we begin, we will suggest you create a backup of your original Google Play Store that is already installed on your phone, in case you want it later or something goes wrong during the following process. </p>

<p> Here are some of the most frequently asked questions we receive from our readers so we have added those into this section along with a brief answer: </p>
<p> How to keep yourself safe and protected while watching free movies online? </p>
<p> As long as you are using a paid app with monthly subscription or using a trial version of that app then you are absolutely safe. </p>
<p> However, in case if you are using any third party APK or apps to stream movies then it means your privacy is at risk. And that’s not it; there are some piracy related risks involved too, which may get you penalized by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) or maybe your government. So we will recommend you to use a reliable VPN service to keep yourself and your identity safe. </p>
<p> How to use VPN service to safely stream and download movies? </p>
<p> VPN is a virtual private network that helps you hide your footprints and real identity so that your internet service provider and government will not be able to find you or know about the content you are trying to stream or the movies that you are downloading. This way, you can safely download as well as stream movies on your mobile devices. </p>

<p> So if you are looking for a way to have background playback support for YouTube on Android, then you are going to love this guide. </p>
<p> Are you fed up of keeping your phone’s screen on all the time just because you are listening to your favorite music or podcast on YouTube? Keeping the screen continuously on causes your phone’s battery to drain much faster and will not let you do anything else on your phone. </p>

<p> Before we jump onto the tutorials and apps, we would like to mention Google introduced the YouTube background playback feature in YouTube Red (which is now reinvented as YouTube Premium), which is actually a paid membership that offers you some of the most incredible features including ad-free videos, background play, option to save videos for offline, audio-only mode. </p>
<p> But you don’t have to worry about YouTube Premium plan as the methods and apps we are about to share with you in this guide will help get all the premium features without paying a penny. </p>
<p> Yes! For free 😉 </p>
<p> Not only that, some apps even allow you to download videos and MP3 from YouTube for offline playback. </p>
<p> Isn’t it wonderful? 😀 </p>
<p> Let’s get started… </p>
<p> How to Play YouTube in the Background on Android? </p>
<p> So, without any further ado, let’s jump onto the twelve easy-to-follow methods and apps you can use right now to play YouTube songs, podcasts, and videos in the background on your Android phone and tablet devices: </p>
<p> 1. Using Google Chrome Browser on Android </p>
<p> One of the best, quickest, and well-known methods that allow you to play YouTube in the background is by using the Google Chrome web browser. Yes, the same browser that comes preinstalled on almost every other Android device. </p>
<p> The procedure for that is mentioned below: </p>
<p> Open the Google Chrome browser and go to YouTube.com. </p>
<p> Tap on the menu button and then enable the “Request desktop site” option. </p>
<p> Chrome will then load the desktop version of YouTube. </p>
<p> Search for the video/open the video you want to play in the background. </p>
<p> Once the video starts playing, simply minimize the Chrome browser and look at the notification area, you will notice a new notification with play/pause buttons has appeared. </p>
<p> You can use these buttons to control YouTube background playback while you continue using other apps. </p>
<p> The best part is that the method lets you listen to YouTube music even when your Android phone is locked and the screen is off (as you can see in the screenshot). </p>
<p> If because of any reason you are unable to use this trick on your Android phone, then you won’t have to worry as we have a list of working apps that will let you enjoy background playback on YouTube. </p>

<p> PokeAlert Pokemon Go Tracker Guide & APK Download </p>
<p> Are you in search for a working personal Pokemon tracker & scanner that can help you scan and track all </p>
<p> Are you in search for a working personal Pokemon tracker & scanner that can help you scan and track all the Pokemon hiding in your neighborhood without actually going there? You can come to the right place. PokeAlert is the best Android app for independently scanning and finding Pokemon in your locality. </p>
<p> We have prepared this in-depth tutorial article for PokeAlert which will guide you on how to setup and use the PokeAlert app on Android device. The process is easy and once you have got it working then you won’t need to wander around your neighborhood in search for Pokemon because the PokeAlert will automatically scan your area and send you a notification alert about Pokemon spawns. </p>
<p> To be honest, like most of you guys, we were previously using the FastPokeMap scanning service due to its simplicity that allowed us to scan and find Pokemon, no matter in what part of the world we are. </p>
<p> But since the FastPokeMap is no longer working, we decided to give PokeAlert a try. And we are simply amazed by the results. The automated scans and trackers are speedy, and within no time, it will show you all the Pokemon in your neighborhood. 😀 </p>
<p> However, it is important to note here that the PokeAlert app is relatively different from any other web-based Pokemon trackers. The reason is, this app requires you to have some dummy Pokemon trainer accounts and then you need to do a proper setup of the app before you can start scanning your locality for Pokemon. </p>
<p> So, before we move on to the guide about how to use the PokeAlert app to scan Pokemon, we find it more important to let you guys know what PokeAlert really is and how this scanner actually works. </p>
<p> What Is PokeAlert? </p>
<p> WARNING: Do NOT use your real/official Pokemon account on the PokeAlert app. </p>
<p> The PokeAlert app is smartly designed to automatically allocates each Pokemon account to a fixed area around you, and then uses that account to perform a periodic scan. And whenever a Pokemon is found within a scan radius, it will give you a notification alert to let you know about the discovery. </p>
<p> The greater the number of dummy PTC (Pokemon Trainer Club) accounts you have added to the app, the greater the area you will be able to scan. That is what makes PokeAlert an extremely powerful Pokemon tracker app. </p>
<p> Don’t have dummy/fake PTC accounts for Pokemon tracking? Don’t worry. Follow our free dummy PTC account creation tricks here. It is simple and easy, and will help you create unlimited accounts. 😉 </p>
<p> In a nutshell, the app is capable of virtually scanning any part of the world and will show you the Pokemon found in that area. However, there are some scanning limitations and you need to abide by these limits, otherwise, intense scanning will either flag or ban your PTC account. Now you must be wondering, how a simple scan could ban my account, right? </p>
<p> Here’s an explanation: For example, you want to find the Pokemon located in the area ‘x’. The PokeAlert uses the Pokemon account to send a request to the PokemonGO servers to scan that area. The servers respond and show all the Pokemon located within the area ‘x’. Now immediately, if you rescan an area that is too far away from the area ‘x’ then the servers will detect this unexpected movement and will flag your account as spam. And this would result in either soft banning or permanent banning. So, the best way is to avoid a ban is to stay within a limit and scan the nearby area only. 😀 </p>
<p> Moreover, in reality, you will only be able to catch Pokemon located nearby you (i.e. areas you can access by walking or driving), so it is completely pointless to scan any area that is too far away from you. Unless you have some sort of superpowers. 😛 </p>
<p> How To Setup And Use PokeAlert To Scan Pokemon? </p>
<p> Since installation and setup of the PokeAlert app are essential for the proper usage of the app, so we have divided this section into three parts i.e. </p>
<p> Part 1: How To Download And Install PokeAlert? </p>
<p> Here we will guide you about how to download and install PokeAlert on your Android device. The whole process is simple and it consists of eight steps in total. </p>
<p> Step #1 – Download PokeAlert APK from the official GitHub repository URL given below and save it to your phone: </p>
<p> Step #2 – Once downloaded, tap on the PokeAlert APK file to start the installation process. You will see a popup window similar to the one shown in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Tap on the ‘Install’ option to begin the installation process. </p>
<p> Step #3 – Because PokeAlert is a third-party APK file; the Android will show you the ‘Install Blocked’ message. </p>
<p> Tap on the ‘Settings’ option. </p>
<p> Step #4 – This will open a ‘Security’ menu. </p>
<p> Tap on the ‘Unknown sources’ option to allow the installation. </p>
<p> Step #5 – A popup window will appear with the following message. </p>
<p> Make sure the ‘Allow this installation only’ option is enabled. And then tap on the ‘OK’ button. </p>
<p> Step #6 – Now, you will be redirected to the installation process. </p>
<p> Tap on the ‘Install’ button to begin the installation of PokeAlert on Android device. </p>
<p> Psst! Do you know there are some new real-time PokemonGO scanners and trackers to help you find all those rare Pokemon without installing app? Check out the list available here ? </p>
<p> Step #7 – This will take a while to complete. </p>
<p> Step #8 – Once done, you will see the ‘App installed’ message. </p>
<p> Tap on the ‘Open’ button to open the PokeAlert app. </p>
<p> Part 2: How To Setup PokeAlert? </p>
<p> To begin with the setup of the PokeAlert app, you need to create some fake/dummy Pokemon Trainer Club (PTC) accounts and then add those accounts to the app for scanning. </p>
<p> TIP: To be able to get the most out of the PokeAlert app, in the beginning, we will suggest you create at least five (5) PTC accounts. And if you want to scan a larger area then you can create more accounts later. </p>
<p> Don’t know how to quickly create lots of Pokemon Trainer Club (PTC) accounts? Check our awesome guide here. </p>
<p> Okay, so at this point, we are assuming that you have installed PokeAlert on your Android, have created dummy PTC accounts, and have the username and password for each PTC account in easy reach. </p>
<p> The PokeAlert setup steps are as follows: (There are 12 steps in total) </p>
<p> Step #1 – Open PokeAlert app, and tap on the menu button located in the bottom right corner. </p>
<p> This will open a bar menu. </p>
<p> Step #2 – Tap on the ‘Settings’ option located on the top of the bar menu as shown in the screenshot. </p>
<p> This will open a Settings sidebar menu. </p>
<p> Step #3 – Tap on the ‘Accounts’ option. </p>
<p> This will take you to the ‘Add Extra Accounts’ page. </p>
<p> Step #4 – On this page, there should be three buttons located at the bottom right corner. Tap on add account (+) button. </p>
<p> This will open a popup window. </p>
<p> Step #5 – There should be two boxes where you need to enter your dummy PTC (Pokemon Trainer Club) account details for scanning. </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: Never use your real/main PokemonGO account on PokeAlert. </p>
<p> Enter username and password in the provided boxes and then tap on the ‘Send’ button. </p>
<p> Step #6 – The page will show you a status message (if the account is active or not) just below the PTC account you entered. As highlighted in the screenshot. </p>
<p> Step #7 – Now depending on the number of dummy PTC accounts you want to add to PokeAlert, you need to simply repeat Step #4 and Step #5 until all of your accounts are added to the list. </p>
<p> Step #8 – When you have successfully added all of your accounts, tap on the save (floppy disk) button. As highlighted in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Step #9 – Now, go to the ‘Settings’ and tap on the ‘General Settings’ option. </p>
<p> Step #10 – Scroll down until you see the ‘Search Radius’ option and tap on it. </p>
<p> Step #11 – This will bring up a list with various predefined search radius. Tap on the one that is the most appropriate for you. </p>
<p> We have added five PTC accounts so we have selected 210m search radius, which is absolutely perfect for us. </p>
<p> Calculating Search Radius: The larger the search radius selected, the greater the number of accounts you need to have in PokeAlert to scan that area in the least amount of time. </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: PokemonGO servers allow each account to send only one scan request in every 10 seconds. </p>
<p> Step #12 – Once done. You can then head over to the Part 3, where we will guide you about how to use PokeAlert on Android. </p>
<p> Part 3: How To Use PokeAlert? </p>
<p> The usage of PokeAlert is very simple and doesn’t require any special setup. The steps are as follows: </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: Never try to manually scan any area that is located far away from you. While using the manual scan option, be as realistic as you possibly can. Else, Niantic and PokemonGO servers will detect this unusual activity and will impose a softban on your dummy PTC accounts. </p>
<p> Step #1 – When you are on the home screen of the PokeAlert. Tap on the menu button, as highlighted in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Step #2 – Now, tap on the sixth button i.e. the ‘Background Scan’ button. (As highlighted in the screenshot). </p>
<p> Step #3 – Now, wait for the PokeAlert to complete the scans. Whenever any Pokemon is found within the blue radius, PokeAlert will send you a notification alert. </p>
<p> We found these Pokemon in our area within 2 minutes of background scanning. 😉 </p>
<p> Step #4 – You can leave the background scan running for as long as you want. And PokeAlert will automatically scan the given radius and keep sending you a notification whenever any Pokemon spawn around the area. </p>
<p> Do you know there’s a hidden Pokemon GO battery saver option? Here’s how you can enable it to prevent unnecessary battery drainage while playing Pokemon. </p>
<p> Now, you can go to the area where Pokemon are shown on the map and catch them all. As simple as that. Good luck. 😀 </p>
<p> PokeAlert didn’t work for you? Don’t worry, we have compiled a list of the best PokemonGO real-time scanners and trackers to help you find and catch all the rare Gen 2 Pokemon, click here to see the list ? </p>
<p> PokeAlert is pretty fast and reliable in finding Pokemon. We hope this in-depth step-by-step PokeAlert tutorial helped you in setting up the app and made it easier for you to find Pokemon around your area. </p>
<p> Don’t forget to share this with you friends and let them know how to find and scan Pokemon in their locality 😉 </p>
<p> Do you have any question or query related to the PokeAlert? Please feel free to leave a comment below and we will get back to you shortly. 🙂 </p>

<p> Pokémon GO by Niantic, Inc. is one of the top greatest adventure games of all time for Android where you must need to step outside of your comfort zone, move around your neighborhood, explore your city in search for the Pokémon and capture them to ultimately become a true Pokémon trainer. </p>
<p> After the release of latest Pokémon GO 2nd Generation, Niantic added over hundred new Pokémon which means to be able to complete your PokéDex you now need to capture a total of around 250 Pokémon. All of which can be discovered in the different parts of the planet Earth. Also, some Pokémon are region specific, which makes it even harder to complete the Pokémon collection. </p>
<p> The game does not end there. You need to find some powerful, legendary, and ultra rare Pokémon with high IVs and attacking capabilities because you need those dominant Pokémon to battle for the reputation and ownership of the Gyms around your locality. </p>
<p> Searching for the Pokémon is simple. You need to walk around your neighborhood with Pokémon GO game running on your Android phone, whenever there’s a Pokémon found nearby your phone will vibrate to let you know about its presence. Now, you just have to take a perfect aim and throw a Poké ball at the Pokémon to catch it. </p>
<p> The game is completely dependent on your Android phone’s GPS and Internet connectivity. And both of these functionalities are important to properly run this game, detect your true location, and move your gaming character along with you. </p>
<p> Pokémon GO Features </p>
<p> Apart from exploring the Pokémon world and catching those Pokémon, there are some additional features waiting for you to discover which makes the game more challenging and interesting: </p>
<p> Hunt for Environment Specific Pokémon: There are different types of Pokémon and each one of them appears within their own proximity and suitable environment, which means if you are near some beach, ocean or river then there are higher chances to find Water-type Pokemon. </p>
<p> Find Special Items: Poké Balls and other special items like incubators and eggs are the important part of the game. You can find and collect these items by visiting PokéStops, mostly located at interesting places like historical landmarks and museums. </p>
<p> Catch Pokémon, Hatch Eggs, and Evolve: The first goal of the game is to catch Pokémon. As you level up and your trainer gets some experience points, you will be able to catch powerful and strong Pokémon which brings you closer to completing your PokéDex. Some Pokémon are found by hatching eggs. And there is an option to evolve your Pokémon, if you have caught many of the same kind. </p>

<p> 9 Amazing Pokemon GO Cheats & Hacks – Get Free Pokeballs, Pokemon & Hatch Eggs </p>
<p> Do you have a lot of eggs to hatch in the Pokémon GO and finding it hard to hatch them? </p>
<p> Do you have a lot of eggs to hatch in the Pokémon GO and finding it hard to hatch them? Here I have found the 8 best hacks, cheats, tricks, and tips to help you quickly hatch eggs in Pokémon GO without walking. And don’t forget to check number 7 on the list, it’s the best eggs hatching trick. 😉 </p>
<p> In the Pokémon GO game, there are only two ways to find rare and powerful Pokémon. You either go out of your house to walk around the neighborhood to hunt for any wild Pokémon or else hatch those Pokémon GO eggs that usually gives you rare and legendary Pokémon depending on the egg type you have. </p>
<p> The problem with the latter is you need to walk a lot to hatch those eggs. The eggs are found in 3 types, 2KM, 5KM, and 10KM. For example, if you have a 5KM egg then you need to walk 5KM in order to hatch it. </p>
<p> That is exactly when the game becomes challenging. However, you don’t need to worry as here I have listed the Pokémon GO eggs hatching hacks, cheats, tricks, and tips to help you hatch eggs without walking including that 2KM, 5KM, and 10KM ones too. </p>
<p> How To Hatch Eggs In Pokémon GO Without Walking </p>
<p> Following are the some best hacks, cheats, and tricks you can use to hatch eggs in Pokémon GO without walking: </p>
<p> 1. Ride A Car </p>
<p> If you are playing the game for a while then you must have tried this one already. But Niantic, developers behind the Pokémon GO game are smart enough so they have implemented a protection known as speed lock, which is automatically triggered when your traveling speed goes beyond 25 km/h. </p>
<p> If you are riding a car that is traveling at 20 km/h then technically this hack should work without triggering speed lock. I am not suggesting that you play Pokémon GO while driving. Moreover, you must need to follow all the traffic regulations. </p>
<p> What we are actually trying to do is hatch eggs without walking. In this case, all you really need to do is open the game on your phone and leave it in the passenger’s seat, and then drive to your destination at the speed of about 20 km/h. Now when you reach your destination, depending on the total distance traveled, your egg should be hatched. </p>
<p> However, if you are one of those who takes a highway route to go places then please check the next hack. </p>
<p> 2. Take A Bus </p>
<p> I can understand that driving under 20 km/h on roads is not really possible for everyone, especially if you are on a freeway. You can consider taking a bus to reach your destination, but keep in mind that this trick will only work if you happen to travel in a locality that is densely populated and experience heavy traffic. </p>
<p> This way, the speed of bus will remain under the Pokémon GO speed limits and will trick the game into thinking that you are walking. Moreover, since you are on a bus, you will also be able to catch Pokémon and spin PokéStop while on the way whenever the bus stops, which is an added benefit. </p>
<p> 3. Cycling </p>
<p> Keeping the Pokémon GO game running while you are cycling around the neighborhood is another good trick to quickly hatch eggs without walking and you will stay within the speed limit too. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, you won’t be able to play the game while you are on your bike. But our aim is to hatch eggs which should be achieved if you usually travel a lot on a bicycle. Or maybe it’s about time that you should start cycling more to quickly hatch those Pokémon eggs. </p>
<p> 4. Let Your Pet Do The Walking </p>
<p> Do you have a pet? Any pet, dog or cat? If yes, then you must have seen that how much they walk around the house. Or, if you leave them in an open area, somewhere like a park or a backyard, you must have seen how much they enjoy roaming around the whole area by running or walking. </p>
<p> Do you have a pet? Any pet, dog or cat? If yes, then you must have seen that how much they walk around the house. Or, if you leave them in an open area, somewhere like a park or a backyard, you must have seen how much they enjoy roaming around the whole area by running or walking. </p>
<p> Why not use their walking or running as a trick to bump up your Pokémon eggs mileage? Have you ever thought about that? No? </p>
<p> The trick is very simple. You tie your phone to your pet. All the walking and moving around of your pet will be counted as your egg hatching distance. </p>
<p> It is important to take some precautionary measures while tying your phone to your pet and make sure your phone is securely positioned so that it doesn’t slip or drop down. </p>
<p> Do you know how to catch all those ultra-rare and legendary Pokemon without aimlessly walking around in your neighborhood? Just download and install this best personal Pokemon scanning tool and start tracking the exact location of Pokemon 😉 </p>
<p> 5. Hang Your Phone On A Fan </p>
<p> Yes, hanging your phone on a fan (ceiling fan, to be precise) is one of the hacks that can be used to speed up Pokémon GO eggs hatching process without walking. Apparently, the complete revolution of ceiling fan seems to be enough for the Pokémon GO game to perceive it as walking. </p>
<p> We already are aware of the fact that the trick is risky and could lead to potential damages to your phone as well as your home if in case you didn’t accurately secure your phone to the fan blade. Please use this trick with caution. </p>
<p> 6. Automated/Robotic Floor Vacuum Cleaner </p>
<p> You must have already heard about robotic vacuum cleaners, which are completely autonomous and vacuums the flooring of your house or office using the intelligent programming system to keep the area clean all the time without any input from your side. </p>
<p> No doubt, these are the awesome invention. And if you are tech enthusiast then you must have one of these at your home. And here, we will be using this robotic vacuum cleaner to hatch Pokémon GO eggs. </p>
<p> You will ask, how? </p>
<p> Open Pokémon GO on your phone and then place your phone on the robotic vacuum cleaner and let it move around your house cleaning those floors. And in the process, those moves will be counted as walking and will bring you closer to hatching eggs without any effort from your side. </p>
<p> This eggs hatching trick is most effective when used in a large area because the vacuum cleaner will need to move around the bigger space. </p>
<p> 7. On Its Own </p>
<p> I was playing Pokémon GO a little while ago on a cheap Android phone with unsteady GPS hardware which was having a hard time to correctly fix my location and was constantly drifting around in a small area. I didn’t notice it much until one of my 5KM egg was hatched without me doing much walking. </p>
<p> That’s exactly when I realized that this happened due to an unreliable GPS of my cheap smartphone. Isn’t that amazing? 😀 </p>
<p> If you have any cheap Android smartphone with GPS capabilities, then try installing and playing Pokémon GO on that phone. Who knows, you might be able to hatch few eggs just by leaving your phone on your desk. </p>
<p> 8. GPS Spoofing App </p>
<p> If none of the above-mentioned tricks and cheats worked for you then try this one. It should work in all circumstances. But it requires you to have some technical knowledge about your Android phone and working of the GPS navigation systems. </p>
<p> You will be using a GPS spoofing app, an app that allows your device to hide real GPS coordinates then override it with fake GPS coordinates and trick the Pokémon GO game into believing that you are located in that fake location. </p>
<p> GPS spoof apps are powerful and will actually allow you to let your Pokémon character teleport to any part of the world. But we are never going to use this app like that due to the risk of account ban from Niantic. </p>
<p> Instead, we will use GPS spoofing app to slowly walk the Pokémon character within a close radius. And what’s awesome about these fake GPS apps is that they allow you to create/assign your own track and once started, your Pokémon trainer will continuously move around that track without any input from your end. </p>
<p> Now, you can leave it running for as long as you want and hatch all those eggs without walking 😉 </p>
<p> And please don’t forget to set the speed limit of 20 km/h otherwise, if you travel beyond the speed limit then Niantic servers will assume that you are traveling in a car and will trigger speed lock. </p>
<p> 9. Secret Trick </p>
<p> Here is another amazing trick that you will love. </p>
<p> More hacks are coming soon. Bookmark this page and we will notify you as soon as we added new tricks. </p>
<p> Back To You </p>
<p> Which hack you think is the best?, How many eggs did you manage to hatch without walking? How many rare Pokémon did you hatch? Share your experience with other fellow Pokémon trainers in the comments section below. 🙂 </p>
<p> Also, subscribe to our email notifications to get latest hacks and tricks on the weekly basis. </p>
<p> Wow! Loved that trick number 3. I usually use cycle to move around my neighborhood to catch Pokemon but never thought about leaving the game open to hatch eggs quickly. Great idea guys. I am going to do that from now on.. </p>

<p> How to Spoof in Pokemon GO Android without Root [Detailed Guide] </p>
<p> Are you looking for a working method to spoof in Pokemon GO without rooting your Android device? You have come </p>
<p> Are you looking for a working method to spoof in Pokemon GO without rooting your Android device? You have come to the right place as here we have an easy to follow step-by-step tutorial to help you spoof your location in the game using a joystick app without getting banned. </p>
<p> From the very beginning of the release of Pokemon GO on Android, we at BestForAndroid has been covering various methods and tricks to help you cheat in Pokemon GO by spoofing your location and catch Pokemon from virtually all around the world while in reality, you are sitting comfortably on the couch. </p>
<p> Now, on the countless request from our readers, we are back with another working strategy to spoof in Pokemon GO using an original and unrooted Android device. It is completely safe, easy to follow, and all you need to have is an Android smartphone or tablet device running Android Marshmallow, Nougat, or Oreo regardless of the Android security patch level. </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: It is important to note here that this unrooted spoofing trick is only possible to achieve on Android devices running Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Android 7.0 Nougat, and Android 8.0 Oreo. If your device has received an update that took it to the most latest Android version, i.e., either Android 8.1 or Android 9 then most probably you won’t be able to spoof using this method. However, you can still try this trick though. Who knows, it might work! 😉 </p>
<p> For those of you who are attempting this spoofing trick on their Android devices, you might be interested in knowing how this is actually going to work. So the strategy we are using here is to downgrade the Google Play Services on your Android device to the specific version that allows you to use mock location app through Developer options without letting the Pokemon GO find out that you are using an app to spoof your location. </p>
<p> Yes, this truly works and will continue to work as long as you don’t update the Google Play Services and your current Android OS to the latest version. You can see this unrooted spoofing trick in action in the screenshots attached above. </p>
<p> Step 1 – Download old version of Google Play Services for your Android device </p>
<p> First, you need to download an old version of Google Play Services for the specific model of your Android device. Here, to be able to spoof without root, the recommended version is 12.6.85 or older. The link for that is available below. </p>
<p> Now, when you open the provided link, you will see a list of variants and each variant have a set of variable numbers inside the brackets. You need to look at the first six digits inside the parentheses. You need to find a variant whose number matches with the current version of Google Play Services already installed on your device. </p>
<p> Here’s an example: </p>
<p> Currently, my Android phone has the Google Play Services version (040306) installed. So I will look for the same when downloading an older version of Google Play Services using the provided link. As highlighted in the screenshot. </p>
<p> Step 2 – Download and install location spoofing app of your choice </p>
<p> There’s a limited number of location spoofing apps that are currently able to let you spoof your location in Pokemon GO without requiring you to have root access. Which means, the apps featured in these steps are the only ones using which you can spoof in the game without having root access. </p>
<p> FGL Pro by LTP PRO LLC: </p>
<p> GPS JoyStick by The App Ninjas: </p>
<p> Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer by IncorporateApps: </p>
<p> Fake GPS Joystick & Routes Go by IncorporateApps: </p>
<p> You are free to download and install any of them or all of them and then try to spoof using each app one by one and find the app that suits your needs and let you spoof without showing you the location not found error message. Though, at the moment, you just need to download and install the app. And move onto the next step. </p>
<p> Step 3 – Disable Find My Device on your Android device </p>
<p> Here in this step, you will have to disable the Find My Device feature on your Android smartphone or tablet device because if this feature is enabled, then you won’t be able to downgrade or modify the Google Play Services. In case you don’t know, here is how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings and scroll down until you find Security option. Tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on Device administrators. </p>
<p> You will see Find My Device option, which most probably will be enabled. Tap on it to disable it. </p>
<p> A new page will open, and you need to tap the option “Deactivate this device administrator.” </p>
<p> Once you have successfully disabled the device administration, here is how it will look like. </p>
<p> You may now proceed to the next step… </p>
<p> Step 4 – Uninstall Google Play Services updates </p>
<p> This step will guide you with the uninstallation of the Google Play Services updates and revert it to its default factory version. Here is how you can do this: </p>
<p> Go to Settings and then find the Apps option. Tap on it. </p>
<p> Once you are under the Apps section, tap on the menu button located at the top-right corner. </p>
<p> Tap on the Show system option to see all the system apps. </p>
<p> Now scroll down and look for Google Play Services. Remember, the apps are in alphabetical order. Once found, tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on the menu button located at the top-right corner. </p>
<p> Tap on Uninstall updates. </p>
<p> A popup will appear asking you if you want to replace this app with the factory version? All data will be removed. Tap on OK button to proceed with the uninstallation. </p>
<p> Uninstallation process will now begin. </p>
<p> Once Google Play Services has been successfully uninstalled and reverted to its factory version, you can then move onto the next step. </p>
<p> Step 5 – Install an old version of Google Play Services </p>
<p> Do you remember that you downloaded an old version of Google Play Services back in step 1 during the beginning of this tutorial? We will now guide you with the installation of that apk file. </p>
<p> Open any file explorer of your choice to browse to the Downloads folder where the apk file is located. You can use the built-in file explorer too. Here I am using ES File Explorer. </p>
<p> Go to the Downloads folder. </p>
<p> Tap on the downloaded Google Play Services apk file. The package name will be com.google.android.gms. </p>
<p> A popup might appear, tap on the Install button to begin the installation process. </p>
<p> The installation window will appear, tap on Install button. </p>
<p> Your selected Google Play Services will now begin installing. </p>
<p> Once installed, you will see the following page. Tap on the Done button. </p>
<p> You can now head over to the next step. </p>
<p> Step 6 – Disable Background Data Usage of Google Play Services </p>
<p> In this step, we will disable the Background Data usage of Google Play Services so that it won’t have access to the Internet connectivity and cannot automatically update itself to the latest version on its own. The steps are pretty much identical to the ones you followed in Step 4 above. </p>
<p> Once you are in the Apps section, look for Google Play Services in the list and tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on the Data usage option. </p>
<p> Tap on Background data to disable it. </p>
<p> Once disabled, it should look similar to the screenshot shown below. </p>
<p> Step 7 – Disable Google Play Store </p>
<p> This step is necessary because Google Play Store is designed to automatically update Google Play Services as well as other system apps without your consent due to security reasons. And there is no way to disable the auto updates other than completely disabling the Google Play Store. It’s easy, and here’s how you can do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings and then find the Apps option. Tap on it. </p>
<p> Once you are under the Apps section, tap on the menu button located at the top-right corner. </p>
<p> Tap on the Show system option to see all the system apps. </p>
<p> Now scroll down and look for Google Play Store. Remember, the apps are in alphabetical order. Once found, tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on the Disable button. </p>
<p> A popup menu will appear asking you, if you disable this app, other apps may no longer function as intended. Simply tap on the Disable App button. </p>
<p> Another popup will appear that asks, replace this app with the factory version? All data will be removed. Tap on OK to proceed. </p>
<p> Once Google Play Store has been disabled, you will see the toast message as shown in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Step 8 – Run GPS spoofing app and start location spoofing in Pokemon GO </p>
<p> This is the best step, as here we will use the location spoofing apps that you downloaded in Step 2 above. Since you are not rooted and using the Android in its original state, so we will make use of the mock location feature of Android in Developer Options to spoof our location in Pokemon GO. </p>
<p> But before attempting to experiment location spoofing in the Pokemon GO game, we will recommend you first to try to spoof your location in Google Maps to check and see how the joystick actually works in changing your location and how reliable and accurate it really is. </p>
<p> For the sake of an example that how well this method really works, we will use an app GPS JoyStick by The App Ninjas. So here are the simple steps that you need to follow to begin location spoofing in Pokemon GO: </p>
<p> Launch GPS JoyStick app and tap on the menu button located at the top-left corner. </p>
<p> Tap on Settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Developer Options. </p>
<p> Scroll down and look for Select mock location app. Once found, tap on it. </p>
<p> A Select application popup will appear, tap on GPS JoyStick. </p>
<p> Go back to the GPS JoyStick settings page and tap on Enable Indirect Mocking. </p>
<p> Now get back to the GPS JoyStick home screen and under the section Select an option to get started, tap on Set Location option, and then tap on Click here to open the map. </p>
<p> You can now either use the search bar to search for the location where you want to spoof or manually zoom and scroll to your favorite location. Once you are there, tap on Select this location. </p>
<p> A popup asking you, Use this location will appear. Tap on Select option. </p>
<p> Now, you need to enable GPS on your Android device and select High accuracy mode. </p>
<p> Go back to the GPS JoyStick and tap on the Start button to begin spoofing to your selected location. </p>
<p> Starting JoyStick loading popup will appear. </p>
<p> Now, to test if the location spoofing is really working, launch Google Maps. </p>
<p> Google Maps will show that you are in the selected location. </p>
<p> You can use the on-screen joystick to move your location in any direction you want, and the blue dot in the Google Maps should move too. </p>
<p> Once you are completely satisfied with the joystick and learned how to use it, you may then proceed to the Pokemon GO game, start spoofing in the game to any location of your choice and begin catching all those rare Pokemon without any limitations. </p>
<p> In case you have any questions or come across any issue while going through the tutorial to spoof your location in Pokemon GO without root then feel free to leave your queries in the comments section below and we will get back to you with a possible solution shortly. Happy spoofing! 🙂 </p>

<p> How to Spoof in Pokemon GO with Rooted Android devices [Detailed Guide] </p>
<p> Did you ever want to spoof in the Pokemon GO on your Android device while remaining rooted? Or maybe you </p>
<p> Did you ever want to spoof in the Pokemon GO on your Android device while remaining rooted? Or maybe you have an unrooted Android device, and you want to gain root access to spoof in the game, then follow this detailed tutorial as it will help you spoof your location and control your character using a joystick. </p>
<p> Location spoofing in the Pokemon GO on rooted Android smartphones and tablet devices is usually difficult to achieve because the process of gaining root access is different for every Android device. Also, the rooting process depends a lot on the manufacturer and model number of the phone you are using. </p>
<p> Moreover, once rooted, it becomes impossible to log in to the Pokemon GO game due to the security checks and the game will only let you log in if you unroot your device. But we have a solution that helps you keep your Android phone rooted and continue to play Pokemon GO as well as spoof location in the game. </p>
<p> Anyways, I have created a whole section on rooting Android device so I won’t be talking much about that here in the intro. But just to give you a hint, this location spoofing method requires you to have system-less root access on your Android device, which let you hide root from the Pokemon GO. </p>
<p> In case you don’t already have root access and want to spoof without rooting your Android device then we already have a step-by-step tutorial for the same here. You might be interested in checking that out first. However, if you are already rooted or in case that method does not work on your Android device, then you can always follow this rooted spoofing guide. </p>
<p> Step 1 – Gain Systemless Root Access on your Android device </p>
<p> Did you read the heading properly? It says, system-less root. Depending on your experience with the Android rooting, you may or may not have heard about systemless rooting. Don’t worry as here we are going to explain to you what it is and how it works. </p>
<p> But first, a word of warning. You must need to stay away from all those one-click rooting methods like KingoRoot, FramaRoot, and KingRoot as using those apps to gain root access might break your Android device or make it completely unusable. You have been warned. </p>
<p> What is the system-less Android root and how it actually works? </p>
<p> Initially, only a simple and normal rooting procedure was known that let user gives an administrative system permissions to different apps to perform advanced tasks. And this was achieved by modifying the files in Android /system partition. </p>
<p> But things within the Android root world were changed after the release of Android 6.0 Marshmallow because Google added some advanced security layers, which made it impossible for the “su” –superuser command– to be executed during the boot with the required permissions by modifying the “/system” partition without breaking the operating system. </p>
<p> So, alternatively, a modified boot image (also known as bootloader) is used which leaves the original files in /system partition intact and executes the su command separately from the system. This not only allows gaining root access on newer Android versions possible but it is also much better and reliable than the regular rooting method where files were added or modified in the /system directory. </p>
<p> The second most important aspect and the most beneficial aspect of systemless rooting for Pokemon GO users is that this root method keeps your device’s software in its original state. Which means it will not break SafetyNet and you can login and continue to play the game or use various banking apps without any issue because it let you bypass SafetyNet and completely hide the root from other apps. </p>
<p> How to install system-less root on your Android smartphone or tablet device? </p>
<p> Now that you are aware of the new rooting method, we will give you a glimpse on how to gain systemless root on your Android device. </p>
<p> There are two well-known methods to gain systemless root on Android smartphones and tablet devices: </p>
<p> Magisk, and </p>
<p> iSU. </p>
<p> But to be able to install system-less root, you need to have a custom recovery installed on your Android device, and then you will be able to flash Magisk or iSU and gain root access. But wait, before flashing any of those files, you first need to have an unlocked bootloader on your device. And unlocking bootloader or flashing a custom recovery is not as easy as it sounds. And each device has its unique way of unlocking and flashing recovery, which I won’t be able to cover, as you already know that there are hundreds and thousands of Android devices. </p>
<p> The best option is to find out the exact make and model number of the Android device you are using by going to the Settings and then to the About Device section of your device. There you will be able to find all the information required to begin the research for the rooting process of your Android smartphone. </p>
<p> Once you have found the make and model number, head over to the XDA Developers forum and use the search bar. See the following example search term for Samsung Galaxy S7 model SM-G935F: </p>
<p> Example search term: How to systemless root Galaxy S7 SM-G935F. </p>
<p> There you are going to find dedicated sub-forums for your exact model along with a proper tutorial to gain system-less root. Moreover, there will be developers as well as other users to help you out in case you hit the bump. </p>
<p> If you already have system-less root access on your device, then please feel free to move on to the next step. </p>
<p> Step 2 – Options to Spoof in Pokemon GO </p>
<p> Once you have managed to gain system-less root access on your Android device, now it unlocks various possibilities of spoofing in Pokemon GO and hack the game without being banned. Yes, you read that right. We have different working methods to help you spoof in Pokemon GO and catch all the Pokemon without wandering around your neighborhood. </p>
<p> Not only that, our rooted spoofing method will even let you visit virtually any part of the world and catch every one of the Pokemon, all without getting banned. </p>
<p> Without any further ado, let’s reveal the methods to spoof in Pokemon GO on rooted Android smartphones and tablet devices. </p>
<p> Method 1 – Pokemon GO Spoofing using GPS JoyStick app, </p>
<p> Method 2 – Spoof in Pokemon GO using FGL Pro app. </p>
<p> But before we jump into the methods to spoof in Pokemon GO with system-less root, here are a couple of prerequisite apps that you must need to install first as they will be required in further steps: </p>
<p> Link2SD – This app will be used to move the location spoofing app to the Android /system directory. </p>
<p> SafetyNet Attest Helper – This app will help you know if the Pokemon GO game will be able to find whether your Android device is rooted or not. </p>
<p> Once these two apps are installed you can then proceed to follow either Method 1 or Method 2, depending on the app you have planned to install. I will recommend you to completely read both methods first, and then choose the one that you are most comfortable with, and then start attempting to perform those steps on your Android device. </p>
<p> Method 1 – Pokemon GO spoofing using GPS JoyStick </p>
<p> In this method, we are going to use the popular and widely known GPS JoyStick app by The App Ninjas to spoof our location in the Pokemon GO while having a rooted Android device. </p>
<p> Download and install GPS JoyStick on your Android device from here. </p>
<p> Launch GPS JoyStick app, and under the Quick Options you will find Privacy Mode option, tap on it. A popup prompt box will appear asking you if you want to generate a new copy. Tap Generate. </p>
<p> You will see a box where you can enter a new app name for this GPS JoyStick app, which will be completely unique. You can enter whatever name you feel comfortable with; we are using “PoGo Spoofing”. Once filled, tap Start. </p>
<p> The process of generating a new app with your provided name will begin. And it will be completed within two minutes. When the app with your provided name has been generated, the Android app installation screen will automatically appear. Simply tap Install to begin the installation. </p>
<p> Once the app has been installed, you will now need to uninstall the original GPS JoyStick app from your device. To do that, go to Android Settings then tap on Apps. Scroll down until you find GPS JoyStick and tap on it. Tap Uninstall to remove the app. </p>
<p> Now launch the Link2SD app. On its first launch, you will get a request to allow root access. Tap on Allow. A list of all the apps will be visible now. Find the app with the name you entered while generating location spoofing app and tap on it. I used “PoGo Spoofing” so I will look for the same. </p>
<p> Tap the menu button located at the top right corner. Then tap Convert to system app. A prompt confirmation window will appear, tap OK to start converting app. </p>
<p> Once the app has been converted to system app, you need to restart your Android device for the changes to take effect. </p>
<p> After restart, launch “PoGo Spoofing” app. And tap the menu button located at the top-left corner, and then tap Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll down and enable the four options that are highlighted in the screenshot below: </p>
<p> Enable indirect mocking, </p>
<p> Enable system mode, </p>
<p> Disable location service (enabling/disabling this will require device restart), </p>
<p> Enable A-GPS reset. </p>
<p> Now, the next step is to use the system-less root function to deactivate or disable the SU/SuperUser root state. The option to enable/disable SU state may be different depending on the system less root method you opted while gaining root access.For me, I used iSU system-less root method, and I can simply go to the iSU’s Controls tab and tap on the Change SU state to deactivate the root on my Android device as shown in the screenshot. </p>
<p> To verify if Pokemon GO will be able to see if we have root access on our Android device, we will use the SafetyNet Attest Helper app. Simply open the app and tap on the Run SafetyNet Test button. </p>
<p> If the SafetyNet Attest shows CTS profile match and Basic integrity as True, then it means you have properly disabled root access and will be able to log into the Pokemon GO game. However, in case the result shows CTS profile match and Basic integrity as False then it means you are unable to hide root and you will not be able to log in to the Pokemon GO game. Please try to disable root again and then try to run SafetyNet test again. Your device must need to pass the safetynet test to proceed further. </p>
<p> Go to Settings and tap on Location. Turn on location and make sure the location mode is set to Device only. </p>
<p> Open PoGo Spoofing app, tap on Set Location radio tab and then tap Click here to open the map button, as shown in the screenshot. </p>
<p> Using the map, either manually navigate to the location or use the search bar to find the location where you want to spoof. Once finalized, tap Select this location button. Then a confirmation popup will appear, tap Select. </p>
<p> Now, to begin spoofing and open the on-screen joystick, tap on Start. </p>
<p> To try how well the joystick is actually working, I will recommend you to take the first trial on Google Maps. You can use the joystick to move the blue dot in any direction you want. Once you are satisfied with the joystick controls, you can then launch Pokemon GO and start spoofing. </p>
<p> You can see in the screenshots below that how well this method is working for me in the Pokemon GO. </p>
<p> Method 2 – Spoof in Pokemon GO using FGL Pro </p>
<p> In this second method, we are going to use the new location spoofing app FGL Pro. It is developed by LTP PRO LLC and works flawlessly with the Pokemon GO on rooted Android devices, and this app is easier to configure too. </p>
<p> Download and install FGL Pro on your Android device from here. </p>
<p> Launch the Link2SD app. On its first launch, you will get a request to allow root access. Tap on Allow. A list of all the apps will be visible now, in the list find FGL Pro and tap it. </p>
<p> Tap the menu button located at the top right corner. Then tap Convert to system app. A confirmation prompt window will appear, tap OK to start converting app. </p>
<p> Once the app has been converted to system app, you need to restart your Android device for the changes to take effect. </p>
<p> After restart, use the system-less root function to deactivate or disable SU/SuperUser root state. The option to enable/disable SU state may be different depending on the system less root method you opted while gaining root access.For me, I used iSU system-less root method, and I can simply go to the iSU’s Controls tab and tap on the Change SU state to deactivate the root on my Android device as shown in the screenshot. </p>
<p> To verify if Pokemon GO will be able to see if we have root access on our Android device, we will use the SafetyNet Attest Helper app. Simply open the app and tap on the Run SafetyNet Test button. </p>
<p> If the SafetyNet Attest shows CTS profile match and Basic integrity as True, then it means you have properly disabled root access and will be able to log into the Pokemon GO game. However, in case the result shows CTS profile match and Basic integrity as False then it means you are unable to hide root and you will not be able to log in to the Pokemon GO game. Please try to disable root again and then try to run SafetyNet test again. Your device must need to pass the safetynet test to proceed further. </p>
<p> Go to Settings and tap on Location. Turn on location and make sure the location mode is set to Device only. </p>
<p> Now, the next step is to launch the FGL Pro app. Popup will appear asking you for access to your device location, tap Allow. Then a popup for the mock location will appear, tap Cancel. And then a warning to set the location to high accuracy mode will appear, tap Cancel on that too. </p>
<p> Then tap on Continue to proceed further. Once you see the home screen of FGL Pro, tap Settings button located at the top-right corner. </p>
<p> Disable Secure Mocking option and enable Root Mode option, as shown in the screenshots below. Once done, go back to the main screen of the FLG Pro app. </p>
<p> Using the provided map, manually navigate to the location or use the search button to find the location where you want to spoof. Once finalized, tap the Play button to start location spoofing and launch the joystick. You will see the mock location started successfully toast message. </p>
<p> For initial tests, I will recommend you to use the joystick on Google Maps. You can use the joystick to move the blue dot in any direction you want. Once you are satisfied with the joystick controls, you can then launch Pokemon GO and start spoofing. </p>
<p> See how well FGL Pro app is working for me in Pokemon GO in the screenshots attached below. </p>

It is a simple and easy to use app which allows you to catch virtually unlimited Pokémon, and most importantly, the app is softban proof because it uses an outstanding feature called ‘home coordinates’. </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: Before you snipe any Pokemon, please don’t forget to read the FAQ (frequently asked questions) section to avoid any possible bans like softban and shadow ban. </p>
<p> The PokeSniper app provides a simplified interface where you can add the details of your targeted Pokemon you want to snipe including its name and coordinates (latitude, longitude), both of which you can easily find and copy from the Pokemon sniping sites. Once the details are entered, then with just a tap of a button, the app will snipe that Pokémon for you and add it into your Pokemon account Pokebag. </p>
<p> It is a powerful app and can help you quickly complete your Pokedex by sniping all those rare and regional Pokemon. </p>
<p> The app allows you add multiple Pokémon Trainer Club (PTC) accounts and also let you seamlessly transfer all those captured Pokémon between the added PTC accounts. </p>

<p> Step 1 – Download PokeSniper APK for Android from the official PokeSniper GitHub repository and save it on your phone. </p>

<p> Tap on the “Security” option. </p>
<p> Put a checkmark on the “Unknown Sources” option. </p>

<p> IMPORTANT (Only for existing PokeSniper users): If you have previously used/installed any PokeSniper app on your Android device, then please make sure that you have already uninstalled it first before installing this latest version. Else, you may experience force close. </p>
<p> Step 3 – Install the PokeSniper app. Open the APK file you downloaded earlier in Step #1 to install it on your phone. </p>

<p> Do you find it hard to snipe Pokemon? Don’t worry, there are several apps that let you take your Pokemon GO character to any part of the world. Are you interested? Here is a guide about manually controlling your Pokemon character. 😉 </p>
<p> How To Setup And Configure PokeSniper On Android </p>
<p> In this section you will learn about all the ins and outs of the app as well as how to properly setup and configure PokeSniper app to safely snipe rare Pokémon through your Android device without getting your account banned. </p>
<p> NOTE: There are 8-steps in total. </p>
<p> Step 1 – Open PokeSniper app. You will see a screen similar to the one shown in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> The Account drop-down box will show “No Account”. So first you need to add the Pokémon GO account in PokeSniper. </p>
<p> Step 2 – To add an account, you need to tap on the Menu button located on the top-left corner to open the side menu. </p>
<p> Step 3 – Tap on the “Accounts” option. </p>
<p> Step 4 – Under the Accounts section, tap on the “ADD NEW ACCOUNT” button. It is located on the bottom of the screen. </p>
<p> Step 5 – Here you have to fill your Pokémon GO/Pokemon Trainer Club account details. </p>
<p> Username: Enter your Pokémon Go username (If you signed up using the Google account, then enter your full Gmail email address). </p>
<p> Password: Enter your Pokémon Go account password (If you used Google account, then enter your Google account’s password). </p>
<p> Home Coordinates: This is important, and you must enter the correct coordinate (latitude, longitude) to avoid your account from unwanted ban. IMPORTANT: To find the right home coordinates, please check the tip given below. </p>
<p> Google Account? If you entered your Google account detail in the username and password box, then enable this option. Otherwise, if you used Pokemon Trainer Club account then leave this option disabled. </p>
<p> TIP: How To Find Correct Home Coordinates? </p>
<p> The home coordinate is the location/position where you last used Pokémon Go. To find the exact coordinates, i.e. latitude and longitude, please follow these steps: </p>
<p> On your Android device, open any web browser and go to the website: http://latlong.net. </p>
<p> In the “Place Name” box, type the address where you last used Pokémon Go. [Example: 15th Street, Brooklyn, New York] </p>
<p> Tap on the “Find” button. </p>
<p> Within a few seconds, the “Latitude” and “Longitude” boxes will be filled with the coordinates of the address you entered in the Place Name box. [Example: Latitude: 40.665572, Longitude: -73.989314] </p>
<p> Now enter that coordinates in this format: (latitude, longitude) in the PokeSniper “Home Coordinates” box, as shown in the screenshot below. [Example: 40.665572, -73.989314] </p>
<p> Once all the boxes are properly filled. Tap on the “SAVE” button to save your account settings. </p>
<p> Step 6 – Your Pokémon Go account should now be visible under the Accounts section. </p>
<p> Do you know you can create unlimited Pokemon Trainer Club verified accounts? Want to know how? Check our guide available here. 😀 </p>
<p> Step 7 – Tap on the Back icon to navigate to the main screen. </p>
<p> Step 8 – Now you will notice the Account drop-down box shows your PTC account username/email address. Which means you are now all set to snipe Pokémon. </p>
<p> How To Snipe Pokemon Using PokeSniper </p>
<p> This section is all about sniping Pokemon on Android using the properly configured PokeSniper app. The steps are as follows: </p>
<p> Step 1 – To snipe Pokémon, you have to tap on the Menu button located on the top-left corner to open the side menu. </p>
<p> Step 2 – Tap on the “Hunt Coordinates” option. </p>
<p> Step 3 – Under the Hunt Coordinates section, you will see the following three options: </p>
<p> PokeZZ, </p>
<p> PokeDexs, </p>
<p> My Pogo Snipers. </p>
<p> Only two of the above mentioned options support “Auto Snipe” feature. However, you can use all three of them as a source to acquire Pokemon coordinates you want to catch and then snipe them via PokeSniper. </p>
<p> Tapping on any option will simply open its website. [Example: I am using “PokeZZ” in this tutorial] </p>
<p> Are those coordinates sites not working? Here are the best Pokemon sniping alternative sites you can use to find and snipe 100IV Gen 1 and Gen 2 Pokemon. 😀 </p>
<p> Step 4 – Once the website is loaded, scroll down a little bit until you will see an automatically refreshing list of Pokémon along with their details like: Pokémon’s picture, Pokémon’s Name, its coordinates, IV percentage, and Skills. </p>
<p> You can even select your favorite Pokémon from the list and filter out the results using the filter functionality given within the website. </p>
<p> Step 5 – In that list, if you find any Pokémon that you want to snipe then simply tap on the “Poke Sniper” option given in that Pokémon box. </p>
<p> Step 6 – Within a second, you will be redirected to the PokeSniper app and all the required details (Pokémon name and coordinates) of that Pokémon will be filled automatically, as highlighted in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Now tap on the “SNIPE THOSE BITCHES!” button to start sniping Pokémon. </p>
<p> Step 7 – You will now notice a similar process in the log box as shown below: </p>
<p> Login success, </p>
<p> Pokémon in sight: 2, </p>
<p> Attempt to catch Pokémon, </p>
<p> If you see the message “Pokémon captured” in the log box, this means the PokeSniper has sucessfully sniped the targeted Pokémon and it added to your collection. </p>
<p> Congratulations! 😀 </p>
<p> Step 8 – Now, you can even check the Pokemon type, CP score, and IV of all the captured Pokémon right from the PokeSniper app. </p>
<p> To do so, tap on the Menu button located on the top-left corner. </p>
<p> Step 9 – Then, tap on the “PokeBag” option. </p>
<p> Step 10 – It will prompt you to pick the Pokémon Go account. Select the account you want to access and then tap on the “OK” button. </p>
<p> Step 11 – In a few seconds, PokeSniper will show a list of all the Pokémon in your collection including their picture, name, type, CP value, and IV value. </p>
<p> That is it. </p>
<p> Give yourself a pat on the back as you have now learned to snipe all those high IV, rare and legendary Pokémon without even moving away from your comfortable couch. Now it’s time to catch all the Pokemon and win all those gym battles in your neighbourhood! 😉 </p>
<p> Frequently Asked Questions & Troubleshooting </p>
<p> FAQ 1: I spin PokeStop 40 times but my account is still soft banned. What should I do? </p>
<p> The loophole we used to use to unban account by spinning Pokestop 40 times has been blocked by Niantic. Now the only way to unban your account is to wait for about 2 hours. </p>
<p> FAQ 2: How can I avoid any possible soft ban from sniping? </p>
<p> Sniping has become harder than before. The only possible way to avoid any type of possible ban while sniping is to wait for two hours between every snipe. </p>
<p> FAQ 3: Whenever I try to catch Pokemon it flees, what to do? </p>
<p> Your account has been soft banned. Please wait for around 2 to 6 hours and then try to play again. </p>
<p> FAQ 4: How much I have to wait for my account to unban? What is the cooldown time for softban? </p>
<p> The simple answer is 2 hours. </p>
<p> Niantic has blocked the 40x PokeStop spinning loophole and has now implemented a cooldown time, which means if you have traveled 500km to snipe Pokemon then your account will be softbanned for 1 hour. Here are some estimated cooldown timings for softbans depending on the distance you have traveled: </p>
<p> FAQ 5: PokeSniper app has been force closed. How to solve it? </p>
<p> You might be running an older version of PokeSniper app. Please try to uninstall the app and install the latest PokeSniper APK. It should fix the problem. </p>
<p> FAQ 6: Pokemon fled. First time I caught the Pokemon successfully but second time it fled. What is the issue? </p>
<p> You have been softbanned because of quickly sniping 2 Pokemons as Niantic now checks encounter coordinates too. Please check the cooldown time table given in FAQ 4 to find out how much time you need to wait before sniping another Pokemon. This is the only way to avoid softbans. </p>
<p> FAQ 7: My sniped Pokemon is slashed/crossed out. </p>
<p> This means Niantic servers has detected that you have caught Pokemon by cheating/sniping. Now you can not use those slashed Pokemon in gyms and can not evolve. But you can use them in battles or completely get rid of them by transferring to other account. </p>
<p> FAQ 8: What is Pokehash? Where can I find Pokehash key? </p>
<p> After the release of Pokemon GO version 0.57.4, Legacy API can not used anymore. The only possible workaround for the third party apps like Pokesniper to work is by using Pokehash key (i.e. Bossland API hashing service). </p>
<p> For starters, PokeSniper app automatically uses a shared Pokehash key which is automatically obtained from their server. </p>
<p> For serious snipers, you can buy your personal Pokehash key from PogoDev, which usually lasts for 31 days. </p>
<p> Do You Have Any Question? </p>
<p> We have tried our best to keep this tutorial simple and easy to follow so that everyone can enjoy sniping Pokemon using PokeSnipers APK. </p>
<p> Did this guide help you with the proper download, installation, setup, and usage of the PokeSniper app on your Android device? </p>
<p> If you have any question regarding PokeSniper APK then please feel free to let me know in the comments below. Our support team will help you out! 🙂 </p>
<p> It is actually related to Pokemon GO as with this you can quickly catch all those rare and ultra-rare Mons from any part of the world and complete your PokeDex, all while sitting in your home. If you are not interested in that, then this app can help you find and catch strong/powerful Pokemon to take over those gyms in your local neighborhood. 😉 </p>
<p> What is pokehash where do I get it…as I snipe those bitches it shows u need a pokehash </p>
<p> After the recent updates released by Niantic Inc. the Pokemon GO legacy API is no longer working with PokeSniper. This means you must need to snipe using Poke hash key until the legacy API is back. </p>
<p> 2. Use this Poke hash key: 4R3X1J0V8D9D0K6Z1T9R Though the above key is limited to 150 requests per minute (RPM) and is probably being used by thousands around the world so you might face response error while sniping. </p>
<p> You need to be careful while using these apps. Which type of ban was imposed on your account?, mostly bans are temporary. </p>
<p> wut does missing x-autotoken header mean its not letting me snipe just tells me this it wus fine a day ago but now this… </p>
<p> This app works great with my ptc account… but every time I try to snipe with my Google account, I get an error and the app force closes. Why? </p>
<p> Please log in again. The login page will open in a new tab. After logging in you can close it and return to this page. </p>

<p> 30+ Best Productivity Android Apps That can change your Life & Boost Performance </p>
<p> Finding the right apps to help you keep your productivity at the peak level is the key to accomplishing your </p>
<p> Finding the right apps to help you keep your productivity at the peak level is the key to accomplishing your targets in a timely manner. And we know everyone measures productivity in their own personal way, which brings us to the fact – what’s best for one could be a complete junk for the other. </p>
<p> So in an attempt to keep everything well balanced and make this extensive list of best productivity apps meaningful for everyone, we have divided this list into over fourteen section and each section includes up to three best apps. </p>
<p> The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. – Walt Disney </p>
<p> To-do Lists, Task & Activity Manager </p>
<p> 1. Wunderlist </p>
<p> Wunderlist is a project planner and to-do list organizer where you can quickly create a list of reminders, tasks, places you want to visit, things you need to purchase. The app is beautifully designed with greater flexibility to add as much detail as you want to each of your task including due date and attachments. </p>
<p> It offers you the ability to share the plans as well as the option to collaborate with friends, colleagues, family on a mutual task in real-time. And to make sure you can access all those data from anywhere, it can instantly sync across all of your devices including smartphone, tablet, and computer. </p>
<p> Organize to-do lists and tasks in folders. </p>
<p> Attach photos, presentations, files to any of your task. </p>
<p> Cross platform compatibility. </p>
<p> Arrange tasks according to the deadline or in alphabetical order. </p>
<p> Wunderlist widget might not update sometimes. </p>
<p> Requires you to re-sort list/readjust arrangement after adding a new task. </p>
<p> 2. Any.do </p>
<p> Any.do is an emerging to-do list manager app for Android while keeping in mind the ease of use, maximum practicality as well as the ultimate flexibility to organize your day-to-day schedule, set reminders, along with the ability to watch over all the current tasks that are on your today list. </p>
<p> What’s good about Any.do is in case if you were unable to complete any task on a due date then it will automatically be rolled down to the following day to make sure you won’t miss it. Once your task is completed, you can mark as done using a swipe gesture. You can even reorganize your tasks using the intuitive drag and drop. </p>
<p> Reliable reminder and notification system, visually appealing and user-friendly design. </p>

<p> Tasks with recurring reminders will require you to purchase the premium version. </p>
<p> 3. Trello </p>
<p> Trello is an intuitive and flexible task organizer app for Android that is quite different from Wunderlist and Any.do. The card and board styled design of the app will help you gain perspective of the entire task list in just a single glance and will let you see a real-time status of all the tasks, whether they are done or needs to be completed. </p>
<p> Whether you are managing a project with your business team or planning a vacation with your family, this app will help you collaborate with them without any hassle. And with the reliable notification system, Trello will keep you updated with the progress of each and every task. You can even leave comments on the task along with the ability to add attachments and links. </p>

<p> Offline capability is missing, which sometimes results in infrequent syncing and restricts from editing while there’s no Internet connectivity. </p>
<p> Widget and app are not synced in real-time and requires manual refresh. </p>
<p> Bugs and stability issues make Trello unreliable at times. </p>
<p> Note-taking Apps To Stay Organized </p>
<p> You can’t remember everything you hear no matter how much important it is unless you are highly intelligent, so why not keep note of every important thing that matter. </p>
<p> 1. OneNote by Microsoft </p>
<p> Microsoft OneNote is a cross-platform app that gives you the ability to note down anything in your very own digital notebook. And specifically for those of you who have a smartphone or tablet with pen support, the things will be a lot easier for you as you can draw, label, type, even extract data from the Internet and save it as your note. </p>
<p> You can also note down your tasks in a list format and then check them off one by one as you go through them. If you are managing a team project, you can then collaborate with your teammates from within the OneNote app. And with the new hovering badge, similar to the Facebook Messenger chat heads, option to add a new note is just a tap away. </p>
<p> User interface is designed in such a way that it will give you a feeling of having a physical 3-ring binder, which supports tags and labels. </p>
<p> OneNote let you access your notes even when you are offline. </p>
<p> Support for Android Wear brings access to the recent notes along with an option to quickly record an audio note. </p>
<p> Intermittent syncing makes it harder to work on the notes. </p>
<p> OneNote Android app is unreliable on some devices, which leads to unexpected crash and force close. </p>
<p> 2. Evernote </p>
<p> Evernote is an outstanding note-taking app that is fully compatible with other platforms including Windows, Mac, and iOS so that you can seamlessly access and work on your projects while keeping track of your notes. The app will help you effectively organize your projects where you can collect and capture ideas and work on them alone or with a team. </p>

Paid subscriptions will allow you to sync your notes with unlimited devices as well as the ability to access your notes and notebooks offline. The free account gives you about 60MB upload limit. </p>
<p> Full-featured note-taking app with seamless sync capability and cross-platform support. </p>
<p> Option to take notes in different formats including text, photos, video, audio, sketch, web clipping. </p>
<p> Businesses can maximize productivity by assigning a project to multiple team members and stay updated on the status. </p>
<p> Free plan is downgraded, which removed essential features and forced limitations like sync between two devices only and no offline support. </p>
<p> Pricing model for paid plans might be costly for an individual or a startup. </p>
<p> The app consumes a lot of space on Android device and sometimes become laggy. </p>
<p> 3. Google Keep </p>
<p> Unlike Evernote and OneNote, Google Keep gives you an incredibly fast and simplified interface to help you organize all the notes whether they are work-related or personal. You can quickly capture an idea or add reminders in a form of photo, text, web links, checklist, or voice (that converts your speech to text). </p>

<p> Tasks Automation </p>
<p> You may have never heard about task automation but your Android device is so much powerful that you can configure it to perform specific tasks automatically and then it will be executed without you even touching it. Yes, that is possible and you can unleash the true potential of your Android device using the exceptional automation apps mentioned below. </p>
<p> 1. IFTTT (If This Then That) </p>
<p> In a nutshell, IFTTT is an absolutely free web-based automation service that enables you to create a sequence of conditional statements called “applets”, which are automatically activated based on the signal/variation originated from any connected web service. For example, a premade recipe that triggers whenever you receive a new email with an attachment in your Gmail account, and then it automatically saves attachments to a folder in Google Drive. Or it can even save popular productivity tips from Reddit’s productivity subforum to your Evernote notebook. </p>
<p> There are millions of premade recipes and you can even create your own, the only limit is your imagination. There are more than four hundred apps that can easily be connected with IFTTT interface including weather, social media services, emails, cloud storage, location, and even your home appliances. An example related to an appliance, it sends you an email or message notification when thermostat’s battery is low. </p>
<p> Hundreds of apps and services can be connected with IFTTT using the applets and recipes to achieve automation. </p>
<p> IFTTT applets help you connect your favorite web services together and save time. </p>
<p> Powerful automation service that is ideal to make those tedious tasks automated. </p>
<p> Lacks possibility to add multiple IF, AND, OR conditions in the recipes. </p>
<p> 2. Tasker </p>
<p> Tasker will help you completely automate all of your Android tasks. As compared to the IFTTT, Tasker is rules and profiles based automation app whereas IFTTT is a web-based tool. The rules can be defined to create specific profiles, and the rules include time, date, event, app, gesture, or even a location. Once the profile has been created, it will wait for any amendment to the rule, which will then trigger the task. </p>
<p> For example, you can create a profile that automatically modifies the screen timeout settings to maximum when you open Kindle app. Or you can create a Tasker profile that disables passcode lock of your Android device when it is connected to the home WiFi network. Apart from these functionalities, there are dozens of Tasker Plugins and one of them even let you connect IFTTT with Tasker to achieve an ultimate automation. </p>
<p> Powerful app to automate any task on your Android phone or tablet. </p>
<p> Plugins support to enhance the capabilities of Tasker app. </p>
<p> The interface and usage are complex for beginner users of Android devices and requires learning to get the most out of the app. </p>
<p> You may come across a minor glitch or bug, but the development team is active and supportive of fixing it for you. </p>
<p> Cloud Storage Services </p>
<p> The cloud-storage service apps give you online space where you can easily store your documents, PDF files, photos, music, videos, and any other file or data with a flexibility to access them through any smartphone, tablet, computer, or web interface, without any limitation. </p>

With offline access option, you can keep an offline copy of important files and folders, which will enhance your productivity when you are traveling. Dropbox gives you up to 20GB of free cloud storage space and about 90% of that can be earned by completing small tasks and referring friends to Dropbox. </p>
<p> Do you want more space? Dropbox offers pro plan for individuals @ $9.99/month with 1TB of storage limit. And if you have a team, it’s better to opt for a business plan with unlimited cloud storage, file recovery & versioning, phone support, data protection, and much more for $15/month for each user, which equals to $75/month for five members. </p>
<p> Cross-platform cloud service with support for every device, along with the secure two-step authentication. </p>

<p> 100GB storage @ $1.99/month, </p>
<p> 1TB storage @ $9.99/month, </p>
<p> 10TB storage @ 99.99/month, </p>
<p> …and there are more plans.

Overall, the business plan will cost $50/month for five members. </p>
<p> Easily share files and folders with others, and the option to modify the access level to view, edit or comment. </p>

This will let you seamlessly work on your projects while keeping a backup of your document synced with every connected device. </p>
<p> OneDrive offers up to 15GB of free cloud storage space for starters but about 70% of that needs to be earned by referring friends. So you can earn up to 10GB free cloud space via referral. If that seems hard to achieve then there is a paid basic storage plan that will give you 50GB storage @ $1.99/month. It is cheap but the storage limit will raise a few eyebrows. </p>

<p> 3 Tricks To Quickly Create Unlimited Verified PTC Accounts For Pokemon Go </p>
<p> Are you in search for a way to quickly create unlimited verified Pokemon Trainer Club (PTC) accounts for Pokemon tracking </p>
<p> Are you in search for a way to quickly create unlimited verified Pokemon Trainer Club (PTC) accounts for Pokemon tracking service? Here we have 3 simple and easy Pokemon GO account creation tricks for you. 😉 </p>
<p> The 3 tricks shared here to help you create virtually unlimited Pokemon Trainer Club accounts along with verification are completely safe and reliable. And all the accounts created using the following tricks will be trouble-free. </p>
<p> Also, it is important to mention here that if you use an unverified PTC account then Niantic will simply ban it within 48 hours. So you must need to verify your account. This is where our tricks come handy. 😀 </p>
<p> Why Do You Need Multiple Pokemon GO (PTC) Accounts? </p>
<p> Since after the release of new Pokemon GO API updates by the Niantic, almost all of the global Pokemon trackers and scanners became outdated. To fix that up, it is going to take a while for their developers to find some new loopholes and create fresh algorithms to resume their Pokemon tracking and scanning services. </p>
<p> However, some third-party tracker tools allow you to create your own local personal Pokemon tracker on your Android device. And using these portable Pokemon scanners for Android, you can easily scan your surrounding areas for Pokemon spawns and find out where the Pokemon are hiding. </p>
<p> These trackers are reliable, risk-free, and very helpful to find and track Pokemon until some web-based Pokemon scanners are active again. </p>
<p> But, to be able to perform these types of local Pokemon scans, the tool requires you to have several (at least 5) dummy Pokemon accounts just for scanning purpose. And you cannot use your main Pokemon GO account due to the risk of ban. </p>
<p> How To Create Unlimited Pokemon Trainer Club (PTC) Account? </p>
<p> The Pokemon Trainer Club does not require much time and effort to create an account because the process is simple and easy. </p>
<p> The tough part is to have enough valid email addresses at your disposal for each PTC account, where the email service will send you a verification link to verify whether the account owner is genuine or not. </p>
<p> You must be wondering, why creating an email address is hard, right? Here’s why: </p>
<p> In an attempt to fight spam, most of the popular email service providers have implemented an anti-spam filter i.e. phone verification. </p>
<p> Yes, most of you already know about this whole process, but for those who don’t know: </p>
<p> In the phone verification, they will ask you for your cell phone number and send you a one-time five or six digit verification code. And then you have to enter that code in the provided box to complete the email creation process. </p>
<p> However, in this case, it is simply impossible to have a large number of mobile phone numbers just to verify email accounts. Even if you can arrange some numbers, the time and efforts it would take to create these email accounts do not simply worth it. </p>
<p> 3 Tricks To Create Multiple Verified PTC Accounts </p>
<p> So, in an attempt to make things simpler and easier for you, here we are sharing some tricks that will let you create virtually unlimited PTC accounts quickly along with verification. </p>
<p> Trick 1: Create Unlimted Verified PTC Accounts Using One Gmail ID </p>
<p> This first method requires you to have just one Gmail email address. And we will be using this one email ID to trick Pokemon Trainer Club website in believing that you have multiple email addresses. </p>
<p> Actually, we are using a loophole that exists within the Gmail system. Isn’t that awesome? 😀 </p>
<p> Here’s how: </p>
<p> Step #1 – Go to the Pokemon Trainer Club account creation page by clicking here. </p>
<p> Step #2 – Enter a valid date of birth and select a country from the drop-down list. </p>
<p> Once done, click on the “Continue” button. </p>
<p> Step #3 – You will be asked to enter a username, password, and email address. Before filling that, you need to learn the Gmail email ID trick. </p>
<p> Right before the ‘@’ symbol, you simply need to insert a plus ‘+’ symbol and then insert any number or letter after that. Check example below. </p>
<p> Any email sent to the above example email ID will be automatically redirected to the original ID i.e. [email protected]. </p>
<p> Step #4 – Now, using the above details, this is how we are going to quickly create PTC accounts: </p>
<p> Username: willsmith+01 (make sure it is available), </p>
<p> As simple as that. Don’t make things complicated. Keep it simple. It’s just a dummy account. </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: Don’t forget to note the username and password you are using, you will need it later. </p>
<p> Step #5 – Scroll down and click on the box right before the “I accept the Pokemon.com Terms of Use”. And right below the TOU checkbox, there will be a reCaptch box. Click on the box to solve the captcha and verify you are a human. </p>
<p> Once done, click on the ‘Continue’ button. </p>
<p> Step #6 – You will see the following thank you message, as shown in the screenshot: </p>
<p> So, you now have two days to verify your account. But we are going to do that right away! </p>
<p> Psst! You can fly your PokemonGO character to any part of the world to catch those hard to find Pokemon using the guide available here. </p>
<p> Step #7 – Now, go ahead and check your Gmail email ID. There should be an email from ‘Pokemon Customer Service’ along with an email verification link. </p>
<p> Click on the “Verify your email” link. </p>
<p> Step #8 – A new tab/window will open and you will see the following confirmation message: </p>
<p> “Thank you for signing up! Your account is now active.” </p>
<p> Congratulations, you have just successfully created your first verified dummy PTC account. </p>
<p> If this trick worked for you then you can now create some more verified PTC accounts using the same technique. If not, then don’t worry, there are two more tricks below: </p>
<p> Trick 2: Create Verified PTC Accounts Using Single Gmail ID </p>
<p> This trick is similar to the trick we shared above, however, the implementation is slightly different. Moreover, it would be handy in case the first trick gets patched by Niantic/Pokemon. 😉 </p>
<p> Since the majority of the steps are similar to the Trick #1 mentioned above and the only modification is in Step #3 and Step #4. So we are mentioning those 2 steps only. </p>
<p> …on the Pokemon Trainer Club website, after you have filled the date of birth and country details, you will be redirected to a page requesting you to enter your username, password, and email address. </p>
<p> You can now catch rare and legendary Pokemon without moving away from your couch. Here’s how you can do that! 😉 </p>
<p> Step #3 – Before you fill that, you need to learn this second trick for the Gmail email ID. </p>
<p> To make it unique, you can insert a period ‘.’ symbol between your email ID. Didn’t understand? </p>
<p> Now, any email sent to the above example email ID will be automatically redirected to the original ID i.e. [email protected]. 😉 </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: The only limitation in this trick is you will be able to create a limited number of PTC accounts, depending on the length of your original Gmail email ID. </p>
<p> Step #4 – Using the above details, this is how we are going to quickly create PTC accounts: </p>
<p> Username: willsmith+01 (make sure it is available), </p>
<p> As we already mentioned previously, keep the details simple. Don’t make things complicated. It’s just a dummy account. </p>
<p> Please don’t forget to note the username and password you are using, you will need it later. </p>
<p> Rest of the steps are same. Want a quick recap? You need to accept the terms of use, solve the captcha, click on the Continue button. A verification email should be emailed to your email ID. Check your email, click on the provided verification link in the email. </p>
<p> And there you have it. A manually verified PTC account. 😀 </p>
<p> In case that didn’t work for you, we have another trick below: </p>
<p> Trick 3: Create Verified PTC Accounts Using Temporary Email ID </p>
<p> Creating PTC accounts with temporary and disposable email accounts are usually not possible because they are blocked by the Pokemon. But we have found an email service that would provide you with infinite disposable email accounts, using which you can create unlimited PTC accounts. </p>
<p> Here is how you can use this trick: </p>
<p> Step #1 – We are using MyTemp.Email service. They give us access to unlimited disposable email accounts. Click here to open the temporary email website. </p>
<p> Once opened, click on the ‘Start Here’ button. </p>
<p> Step #2 – You will be redirected to your brand new disposable email address. </p>
<p> Simply click on the email address shown on the top bar. And the website will automatically copy it to the clipboard. </p>
<p> For a moment, leave this website open and let’s create a PTC account using this email ID. </p>
<p> Step #3 – Go to the Pokemon Trainer Club account creation page by clicking here. </p>
<p> Step #4 – Enter any valid date of birth and select a country from the drop-down list. </p>
<p> Once done, click on the “Continue” button. </p>
<p> Step #5 – Using the disposable email address we copied in the Step #2, here is how we are going to quickly create a new PTC account: </p>
<p> Username: yourname+01 (make sure it is available), </p>
<p> Yes, as easy as that. Keep the details simple. You are just creating a dummy PTC account for Pokemon tracker. 😀 </p>
<p> Don’t forget to note the username and password you are using for account creation, you will need it later. </p>
<p> Step #6 – Scroll down and accept the Pokemon Terms of Use. And right below the terms of use checkbox, there will be a reCaptch box. Click on the box to solve the captcha and verify you are a human. </p>
<p> Once done, click on the ‘Continue’ button. </p>
<p> Step #7 – You will see the following thank you message: </p>
<p> You now have two days to verify your account. But since we are using a disposable email address so we must have to verify it right away. </p>
<p> Step #8 – Now, switch back to the temporary email tab. There should be an email from ‘Pokemon Customer Service’ along with an email verification link. </p>
<p> Click on the “Verify your email” link. </p>
<p> Step #9 – A new tab/window will open and you will see a confirmation message: </p>
<p> Well done. You can use this same technique to create unlimited verified PTC account using temporary email address service. 😉 </p>
<p> I hope our tutorial helped you in creating verified PTC accounts. If it did, then please support us by sharing this piece of content with your friends and let them know how easy it is to create bulk Pokemon Trainer Club accounts. </p>

<p> Redmi K30 Spec & Features </p>
<p> Swirling in rumors and leaks for long, the Redmi K30 has made its debut in the homeland, China, in 5G </p>
<p> Swirling in rumors and leaks for long, the Redmi K30 has made its debut in the homeland, China, in 5G as well as 4G variants. The Redmi K30 succeeds the Redmi K20, which was launched in May this year. </p>
<p> The Redmi K30, both the variants, of course, comes with plenty of upgradations, which include a whopping 120Hz refresh rate display in line with the Asus ROG Phone 2, a 64MP quad-rear camera with Sony IMX686 sensor- a first for the Redmi phone, along with two front-facing selfie cameras. </p>
<p> In terms of downgrades compared to the Redmi K20, the Redmi K30 variants use the IPS LCD screen instead of the Super AMOLED screen while an in-display fingerprint scanner has now moved to the side- embedded into the home button. And most noticeably, the pop-up selfie camera mechanism has now been replaced with the punch-hole cutout on the top-right of the display. </p>
<p> As a result of these corner cuttings, the Redmi K30 series is also priced at the lower side compared to the Redmi K20 when it was launched. The Redmi K30 4G variant starts at CNY1,599 (Approx. USD227/EUR204) while the 5G variant is priced upwards of CNY1,999 (Approx. USD284/EUR255). </p>
<p> The difference in the prices for 4G and 5G models of the Redmi K30 is the outcome of the differences in some of the specs. For example, the 5G variant features a better processor, faster-charging technology, and a better macro camera at the back. </p>
<p> The Redmi K30 4G has already hit the shelves in Deep Sea Light, Flower Shadow, Purple Jade Fantasy color hues. The Redmi K30 5G, on the other hand, with an additional Time Monologue color options will go on sale next month. To note, the 5G variant will be available in dual 5G modes: Stand Alone (SA) and Non-Stand Alone (NSA). </p>
<p> Talking about the specs, the Redmi K30 4G, as well as Redmi K30 5G, packs a 6.67-inch full HD+ 120Hz screen with taller 20:9 aspect ratio, HDR 10, and Gorilla Glass 5 layer of protection. </p>
<p> The display has a top right-positioned cutout that houses two selfie cameras of 20MP and 2MP resolutions. The rear of the device is graced by four vertically arranged cameras. The whole arrangement is confined inside a prominent circular area with an LED flash sitting outside the module. </p>
<p> The quad-rear camera setup comprises a 64MP Sony IMX686 primary sensor alongside an 8MP wide-angle sensor, 5MP macro sensor, and a 2MP depth sensor. The Redmi K30 4G variant, however, gets a 2MP macro sensor only while retains the same three sensors from the K30 5G model. </p>
<p> While the battery for both the variants is of 4,500mAh capacity, the Redmi K30 5G is supported by 30W fast charging and the Redmi K30 4G is armed with 27W fast charging. Both the variants boot MIUI 11 based on Android 10 out-of-the-box. </p>
<p> Now coming to the most crucial change, the Redmi K30 5G integrates a Snapdragon 765G SoC, which has been announced just a couple of days ago. The Redmi K30 4G makes do with a less powerful Snapdragon 730G SoC instead. </p>
<p> The devices include up to 8GB RAM and up to 256GB internal storage alongside the further expansion support up to 256GB via a dedicated microSD card. Other notable aspects are USB Type-C port and 3.5mm headphone jack. </p>
<p> Redmi is yet to announce the International availability of the Redmi K30 series. Still, considering what we saw in the case of the Redmi K20 series, the smartphones will likely move to other markets soon. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, reports are coming in that the Redmi K30 Pro series, the more premium sibling of the Redmi K30 series, will debut sometime in March next year equipped with Snapdragon 865 SoC and X55 5G modem </p>

But since you are looking for a way to gain root access so we have found a method that will let you flash TWRP recovery and gain root access without even requiring you to unlock the bootloader in the first place. </p>
<p> So without any further ado, we will first show you the list of compatible variants to root Asus Zenfone 2 Laser with our method and then take you through the guide to help you root your Android phone. </p>
<p> List of compatible variants to root Asus Zenfone 2 Laser </p>
<p> Mentioned below is a list of compatible Asus Zenfone 2 Laser variants that you can successfully root using this method. Also, make sure your phone is running Android 6.0 Marshmallow. </p>
<p> If you have successfully tried this root method with any other variant then share with us in the comments below. 🙂 </p>
<p> How to root Asus Zenfone 2 Laser and install TWRP recovery </p>
<p> Here is a complete step-by-step tutorial that will help you root Asus Zenfone 2 Laser and let you install TWRP custom recovery without unlocking the bootloader. </p>
<p> First, we will download and install all the required files, then install TWRP recovery on the phone via ADB, and then we will use the custom recovery to install/flash SuperSU. </p>
<p> DISCLAIMER: Before proceeding, please keep in mind that rooting your Android device will void its warranty and there is always a risk of soft/hard bricking your Android device, which means your phone will not function properly. As a precaution, make sure to backup important data before trying to gain root access. In case something went wrong during the process, we won’t be responsible. </p>
<p> Download the latest version of TWRP image for Asus Zenfone 2 Laser from the official TWRP website here. Once downloaded then rename the file to twrp.img. </p>
<p> Download ADB and Fastboot for Windows from here. It’s actually a zip file, which contains four files. </p>
<p> Download Windows driver for Asus Zenfone 2 Laser phone from the official Asus support website here and install it on your computer. </p>
<p> Create a new folder in “C:\” directory and rename it to “zenfone2”. Then copy/move all the files you have downloaded in the first 4 steps to this folder. Also, make sure all the files in “ADB_Fastboot.zip” are extracted in the same directory i.e. zenfone2 as shown in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> On your phone, you need to enable USB Debugging. So go to Settings, tap on About Phone, find Build Number and tap on it 7 times. You will see a toast message that says, “You are now a developer”. </p>
<p> Now, go to Settings, tap on Developer Options, and then enable USB Debugging. </p>
<p> Open “C:\zenfone2\” directory. Its same folder we created in step 5. Open Command Prompt in this directory by holding the shift key on the keyboard and press right mouse click then select Open command window here. </p>
<p> Connect your phone to your computer. Then in the command prompt window, type the following command and then press enter: </p>
<p> If your phone is successfully connected and recognized, it will be shown on the list. </p>
<p> Now, type the following command to reboot your phone and enter bootloader mode: </p>
<p> After rebooting, your phone will be in the bootloader. </p>
<p> Flash TWRP recovery by entering the following commands: </p>
<p> It will take a while to complete the flashing process. Please be patient. </p>
<p> Once the flashing of recovery has been finished successfully and there are no errors, then you will see a finished message. </p>
<p> Now, this step is crucial and requires perfect timing. So please make sure you perform it properly. First, type the following commands but do not hit enter yet: </p>
<p> You need to do two things at the same time i.e. press and hold the volume down button on your phone while at the same time hit the enter button on the keyboard. </p>
<p> If you followed the above instructions correctly then you will see the TWRP (TeamWin Recovery Project) logo. Simply skip to step 15, else follow step 14. </p>
<p> If you did not see the TWRP logo then your phone will boot to the Android OS. Don’t worry, just let the phone finish the booting and then type these commands: </p>
<p> This will reboot your phone and it will automatically enter the recovery. You will see the TWRP logo. </p>
<p> Once you are in the recovery, the first thing you need to do is create a full nandroid backup of all the files. </p>
<p> When the backup has been made, then you need to transfer the UPDATE-SuperSU-v2.82-20170528234214.zip file to your phone’s internal storage or SD card using MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) as your phone is already connected to your computer. </p>
<p> Now, you have to flash the SuperSU.zip file. In the TWRP, tap on Install and then open the located where you copied the SuperSU file on your phone and flash it. </p>
<p> When done, TWRP might ask you to update binary. Tap No and reboot to Android OS. </p>
<p> Congratulations, you have successfully rooted your Asus Zenfone 2 Laser and gained superuser access without even unlocking the bootloader. </p>
<p> Now that you have successfully rooted your Android device, we will suggest you have a look at our best-handpicked apps for phones with root access to help you unleash the real power of your device. We know you will love them! 😉 </p>

<p> If you have managed to gain root access on your Asus ZF2 Laser phone using the above method then please let me know your experience in the comments down below, I would love to hear about them! 🙂 </p>
<p> fortunately i found my way around but rebooting after installing superuser takes too long </p>
<p> Hey @Angeleo7:disqus, good to know that you managed to root your Asus Zenfone 2 Laser. The first boot after flashing SuperSU on Android usually takes some time but I am glad you found another way. </p>
<p> Would you mind sharing your workaround with our readers? It would be helpful for others who are trying to root their phone. </p>
<p> Actually i deleted my system cuz i got stuck at boot log and later installed a custom rom lineage in this case as simple as that </p>
<p> Well that’s smart, @Angeleo7:disqus. Lineage is no doubt a great ROM. I use Lineage 7.1.1 on my Galaxy Note II and it works without any hiccup! </p>
<p> Moreover aint 6hrs enough for a boot ciz thats how long it was stuck in it… </p>
<p> Moreover i reccommend magisk for su than normal one cuz i can hide my root priviledge from apps/games </p>
<p> Great! Magisk is a lot better and gives you more control over root access. </p>
<p> the process was a success. I was looking for a simple matter of instructions..Thanks for that. Also, I am cuurently having a Marshmallow version I found a Oreo based rom can I flash that ? </p>
<p> Hi Chandrakanth, glad to know that the tutorial helped you with gaining root on Asus Zenfone 2 laser running Marshmallow. </p>
<p> As far as flashing Oreo based ROM is concerned, if you have an unlocked bootloader then you are free to flash a ROM. However, in case the bootloader is locked then unfortunately you won’t be able to flash any custom ROM. </p>
<p> Thankyou i was able to root my zenfone laser 2 ze550kl by following the same procedure </p>
<p> My twrp has became permanent though im not sure if my bootloader is unlocked or not The only problem i face is while rebooting it takes nearly 6-8 to start because it always optimizes 1 app its irritating but my root resources works well no difficulties at all I will check for unlocking bootloader but i wonder can u help with this 1 app optimizer </p>
<p> Hello after having followed this tutorial my phone does not want to start anymore. it remains blocked on the logo asus. can you help me please. thank you in advance </p>
<p> I failed at the 11th step , PS C:zenfone2> fastboot flash recovery twrp.img error: cannot load ‘twrp.img’ </p>
<p> Not everyone uses Windows, could you post an alternative guide for Linux too please? </p>
<p> Actually, never mind. I found a much simpler rooting guide which worked, at least for the ZE500KL. You just have to use fastboot to install a new boot image. Maybe that’s what you mean by unlocking the bootloader which can cause trouble, but there was no app involved that may force close and I encountered no problems. </p>
<p> Hi @disqus_ignkmj64pS:disqus, I am glad you managed to root your Asus Zenfone 2 Laser. Thanks for sharing your experience 🙂 </p>
<p> Thanks for the guide. It worked right away on my ZE600KL. Thanks to you, I now have the root permissions. </p>
<p> Have been wanting to root my phone for ages and this guide gave me hope again. However there seems to be broken redirect links in the article. Could you check the links are still valid? </p>

The purpose is to share honest feedback and opinion related to people or any subject topic in a private way. It allows the user to be honest as the platform keeps the identity of the sender completely anonymous. The principal is similar to any mail that we receive in our letterbox daily. The only difference is that we simply do not know who the sender is. </p>
<p> The point under discussion is that what was the need for this application in the first place? </p>
<p> Sarahah has been designed by a Saudi Arabian developer Zain ul-Abidin Tawfiq. According to the developer, the basic objective of this platform is to share honest feedback among different employees of any organization. The world is now advancing towards a feedback system.

<p> The same applies to human beings. The employees, employers, and co-workers can share their thoughts, opinions, and feedback about one another anonymously. It has got a total of more than 300 million users globally. </p>
<p> The employees can share their voice regarding different subject matters within the organization with their employers keeping their identity anonymous. This feedback system allows both employers and employees to improvise their performances and to address different problems and challenges faced within the organization. This platform was initially rolled-out internally within the organizations. After some time, the developer created an English version of the app and made it public. </p>

<p> How to See Saved WiFi Passwords on Android </p>
<p> A definitive guide on how to see saved WiFi passwords on Android phone and tablet devices. We have shared five </p>
<p> A definitive guide on how to see saved WiFi passwords on Android phone and tablet devices. </p>
<p> We have shared five working method and complete step-by-step guide to help you find and view Wi-Fi passwords for saved WiFi networks. </p>
<p> Some methods require you to have a rooted Android device and some works without root. We have discussed about all the working methods and you can follow whichever you find convenient and easy. </p>
<p> There are moments like when we check-in to a hotel or some guesthouse for a stay. We ask the management for Wi-Fi password and they simply type that in on our phone for us. But then when we reach our room and take out our laptop to reply to some emails (or maybe our colleague wants to connect to the Wi-Fi too), and obviously we don’t know the password. </p>
<p> This is when we try to look into Wi-Fi settings on our Android phone to view saved Wi-Fi passwords but to our surprise there is actually no way to view that information. </p>
<p> Thankfully, Android and this wonderful Android community have always provided us with workarounds to solve problems like these. </p>
<p> Luckily, in the latest version of Android OS i.e. Android 10 or above, the saved WiFi password can be accessed directly from the Wi-Fi settings page. But for devices running older version of Android, the only way to view passwords is after rooting the device. </p>
<p> But don’t worry as here we have all the working methods to help you see saved WiFi passwords on Android. </p>
<p> Guide to See Saved WiFi Passwords on Android </p>
<p> In this guide, we have outlined three key methods to view saved Wi-Fi passwords on Android devices. The first one is for devices running Android 10 or above OS; the second is for phones running Android 9 or below OS; and the third one is for all Android devices but it requires some advanced steps and might be a bit complicated for an average user. </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: To see saved Wi-Fi passwords on Android 9 or older versions of Android operating systems, rooting maybe mandatory. </p>
<p> View WiFi Passwords on Android 10 and above </p>
<p> Any smartphone or tablet device running Android 10 OS or above do not require installation of any apps or added configuration to view saved WiFi passwords. </p>
<p> Before we proceed to the steps, we will recommend you to perform a simple check whether your device is running the latest Android 10 OS or not. If it does not, then this is a good time to check for updates and see if there is any latest version of Android available for your device. </p>
<p> Open Settings and find Wi-Fi settings on your device. Although the exact naming for some devices might be different, they all more or less follow a similar pattern. So simply go to Setting -> Network and internet -> Wi-Fi settings. </p>
<p> Inside the Wi-Fi settings, scroll down and look for “Saved networks” option, which stores the Wi-Fi network information of all the saved networks. </p>
<p> Tap on any saved network for which you want to see the password. </p>
<p> Tap on the Share option, which will prompt you to enter your PIN or password or maybe ask you to scan your fingerprint. Once verified, a QR code will be displayed on the screen along with the Network SSID and Password. </p>
<p> Now you have two options, you can either scan the QR code with another device using QR code scanner app or simply copy the password, which is listed just below the QR code. </p>
<p> View WiFi Passwords on Android 9 and below </p>
<p> With devices running Android 9 or below operating system things get a bit complicated as there is no direct way to view network information because all of these details are stored in the root directory, and by default, Android doesn’t give its access to us users. </p>
<p> However, as mentioned above, the Android community still provides doable workarounds for everyone for nearly everything they want to achieve on Android phones. And here we are going to use a root method to view those hidden details like saved Wi-Fi passwords. </p>
<p> The first step is to root your phone, which will let you gain access to the system files. There are many ways to root Android OS and one method doesn’t apply to all Android devices so we will always recommend you to do some research for your model of Android before jumping onto the steps to root your phone. </p>
<p> Anyways, here we believe that you already have a rooted Android device. So the next step is to view saved Wi-Fi password of the network. </p>
<p> This can be achieved in many ways, but two feasible methods are: </p>
<p> Method 1 – Using App from the Google Play Store </p>
<p> This method is one of the easiest out there, but only if you have a rooted Android device. Here you simply have to download and use any reputable app from the Play store that can help you gain access to Wi-Fi network details. </p>
<p> One of the many apps out there is the “Wi-Fi Password Show,” which is a free and easy to use app to view saved WiFi password on Android. </p>
<p> Once you have downloaded and installed it on your device, all you really have to do is provide the app with root permissions, so it can access the relevant directory. </p>
<p> Within seconds, the app will show you the password for any saved WiFi network and you can then use those details to easily connect another device to the same network. </p>
<p> Method 2 – Using File Explorer with Root Access </p>
<p> The second way is to use a file explorer or file manager to manually access the system directory on your Android and find files that contains details about WiFi network. </p>
<p> But first, you need to allow root access to the file explore so that it can let you access system directory, which is usually just a toggle button (root explorer) in the app settings. </p>
<p> Once you have done that, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Open file explorer and navigate your way to the following path: data > misc > wifi (for some devices, it could be system > etc > wifi). </p>
<p> Look for a file named conf. This file contains the network names along with their password. Everything is written in a plain text. </p>
<p> We are looking for the following text: </p>
<p> In the above text, SSID field contains the name of your WiFi network and PSK field is where you are going to find the password. </p>
<p> Alternative Method to View Saved WiFi Passwords on Android </p>
<p> In case your Android device cannot be rooted, here we have an alternative method that works for most of the Android OS. But this will be a bit complex and requires you to have some basic knowledge about ADB and Android. </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: This method requires you to have a computer, compatible USB cable, drivers for your Android device, and ADB tools. </p>
<p> Download ADB tools on your computer and extract the files to your desktop. </p>
<p> Enable Developer Options on your device. For that, you need to go to Settings -> About Phone and scroll down to “Build number.” Tap seven times on it to enable developer options. </p>
<p> Go back to the Settings, tap on Developer Options, find and enable USB debugging. </p>
<p> Connect your Android device to your computer using supplied USB cable. For ADB to work properly, it is important to check that you have updated USB drivers. </p>
<p> Go to ADB folder extracted on desktop, open command window and type it the command: </p>
<p> The contents of the file should have been copied and placed in the ADB folder in a new file. Open it to view network names and passwords. </p>
<p> Please log in again. The login page will open in a new tab. After logging in you can close it and return to this page. </p>

<p> SHAREit APK </p>
<p> If you are looking to find an easy, fast, and reliable way to share large files with friends within seconds, then </p>
<p> Download APK File </p>
<p> App Details & Guide </p>
<p> If you are looking to find an easy, fast, and reliable way to share large files with friends within seconds, then SHAREit apk is the right choice for you. Gone are those days when you have to transfer files within devices using wire. The app has deployed state-of-the-art technology behind to facilitate its users to transfer and share data wirelessly. One of the most amazing things about the app is that the transfer is secure, reliable, and fast. </p>
<p> SHAREit has simplified our lives with wireless technology. You can share your data securely with your friends and family with a single click. You do not need to wait for hours and hours to share your larger files. Not only that, but you also do not require any internet or data connectivity to transfer your data. One of the most interesting benefits of using this app is that you can share your file with multiple users at the same time. With our regular Bluetooth connection, we can only share files with one person at a time. But now, with SHAREit apk, you can create a receiver group and share the files with all of them simultaneously. </p>
<p> About SHAREit APK </p>
<p> Sending and sharing files from your smartphones has never been an easy task. Bluetooth technology is quite old and outdated. You cannot share large data with Bluetooth. Moreover, one has to check the compatibility of devices before sending files. All of these problems have been solved by SHAREit apk. It saves our time, allows us to transfer large files at a higher data rate, and you do not need to check the compatibility of the devices. Just install the app on the sending and receiving devices and start sharing the data. But before getting into the details of this innovative sharing platform, aren’t you curious about the working and technology deployed behind. What is the magic behind that allows you to share data instantly with a single click? </p>
<p> Features of SHAREit for Android </p>
<p> Here are the key features of the SHAREit app for Android: </p>
<p> Fast File sharing – Different types of files, documents, videos, music, and photos can be shared at a faster speed of 2 Mbps. You can share large file size wirelessly within seconds. You can share multiple files at a time via single and dual-channel options. </p>
<p> Reliable And Secure Connection – The radar system checks the devices close to the sending device. The connection is authenticated via the QR scanning or the password. The password can only be known between the sending and receiving devices. Other features like connection confirmation make the overall file-sharing process secured. </p>
<p> File Sharing Between Different Devices – You can share your files with multiple different devices, including smartphones, laptops, and tabs. You can also create a sharing group to share data. </p>
<p> User-Friendly Interface – The interface is straightforward and requires a few clicks to send the data via a secured connection. The users are facilitated with instructions to follow the steps easily. </p>
<p> Games and Videos – You can enjoy playing games, watching videos while transferring the data. There is a massive repository of games along with the rankings of its players globally. </p>
<p> Brief Introduction of Data Sharing </p>
<p> We all are aware of the fact about the data transfer between different devices. You can share the data via a wire. You can use USBs to transfer data from one laptop to another. The data is transferred from one computer to another using networking in offices and other large computer networks. There are different routers and switches used to connect different devices with wire. </p>
<p> As technology advances, the data is then shared wirelessly via wireless routers and other technologies. As more and more devices are connected via the internet, the data is then uploaded on some shared path via the internet. But what happens when the data is to be shared between different Android phones? </p>
<p> To share data between Android smartphones, we have been using Bluetooth technology, where both the devices have to enable Bluetooth to share the data. However, the speed at which the data is transferred is quite slow in the case of Bluetooth. Not only that, but you also cannot share larger files via Bluetooth as it will take hours and hours to transfer the data. The two devices have to be placed in quite a proximity to share the data. The longer the time is required to share the data, the more the battery is consumed by the sender and receiver device. </p>
<p> How Does SHAREit app Work? </p>
<p> SHAREit works on the simple principle of networking as it does not require the internet or Bluetooth connection of the Android phone to share the files. But it makes a secure connection between the sender and the receiver device. </p>
<p> It converts the sender device into a hotspot, and the receiver has to connect with that hotspot. Once the receiver is connected, the sending device will start sharing the data in the form of packets. Both of the devices have got an IP address. The connection is based on these IP addresses. As the data is transferred in the form of IP packets, the connection is secure and private. </p>
<p> Another interesting fact is that the speed rate at which the data is transferred is 2 Mbps. That is quite a high speed with which the data is shared between the two devices. You can consider packets as the small size of data chunks transferred using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). As the data is divided into smaller packets and a dedicated wireless link has been established between two devices, the overall connection is secured. That means the data is transmitted wirelessly with complete security. The sender and receiver devices are notified once the entire data transmission is complete. </p>
<p> How To Use SHAREit apk? </p>
<p> Let us discuss the functionality of SHAREit. Once the app is downloaded and installed on the Android phone, you need to click on the start button displayed on the startup screen. There are some permissions required by the app before proceeding further. SHAREit apk will ask for permission to access media, files, and photos on the phone. Moreover, the app works on the proximity and discovery principle, so it will ask to access the location of the device. </p>
<p> Once you have given all the permissions, you will be redirected to the user menu. You can select your name and profile photo. There are some funky photos available, or you can choose from your phone gallery. After setting your name and photo, you can now enter the SHAREit platform. The home screen is quite interactive and interesting. There are some additional features other than the file-sharing. We will be discussing the rest of the features later. But first thing first, let us focus on the process of file sharing between the two devices. </p>
<p> You will see four buttons in the middle of the home screen. These are local, send, receive, and invite options. If you click on the local button, it will lead you to the local device folder management. You can see the total and available used space of the device. There are different categories available at the bottom. The videos, apps, music, and pictures on the device can be accessed via these tabs. The video tab also shows different videos available online. You can view them, download them, and share them on different apps. The music tab segregates the entire list in different tabs like received, playlist, folder, added, and favorites. </p>
<p> The send button will allow you to share files, videos, apps, and photos on your device with other devices. The best part is that you do not need to check the compatibility of the devices. You can share with other smartphones, tabs, and laptops. Just make sure that both the receiving and sending devices have SHAREit installed. You can select as many files as you want to share. You can simultaneously choose files, videos, and photos and then click on the Next button. </p>
<p> Two options should be enabled before transferring the data: </p>
<p> You can share the files via GPS. Enabling your location will help SHAREit to discover the nearby devices. This option is available for Android 6.0 and above. </p>
<p> You also need to enable Bluetooth. There are some limitations of the Android systems, and enabling the Bluetooth option will assist SHAREit to establish a connection at a faster rate. </p>
<p> Both of these steps should be done on the receiving side as well. Once both of these options are enabled, click on the Next button. A radar will appear on the screen that will help you to find the receiver device. That is why selecting a name, and an avatar is really important before using the SHAREit platform. You need to click on the receiver avatar discovered by SHAREit in the vicinity. It is essential to establish a secure connection. There are two options to authenticate a connection. You can either scan a QR code of the receiver device on the sending device. The other option is to connect with a password. </p>
<p> At the receiving device, click on the receive option available at the home screen. Just make sure that location and Bluetooth options are available. You will then be redirected to the radar screen, and you will find a QR option on the top right corner of the screen. Click on the QR code and get it scanned by the sending device. Once the QR code is scanned correctly, you can send your files. You can also send additional files by accessing the local folder. The files are transferred at lightning speed of 2 Megabits per second. </p>
<p> Features and Settings of SHAREit </p>
<p> You also need to check the settings available on the top left corner. The major objectives of SHAREit are: </p>
<p> Reliable and secure connection </p>
<p> Fast data transfer </p>
<p> Group share </p>
<p> The settings are set to assist the user in achieving all of these objectives. You can enable the data or internet connectivity to be used for downloading videos from SHAREit. To make a more secure connection, you can allow the connection confirmation. In this way, you will know about the authentication before the files are transferred wirelessly. There are two ways via which the data can be shared. You can enable the Wi-Fi mode for file-sharing, or you can create a personal hotspot to attain a faster transfer speed. </p>
<p> The data is transferred via channels. You can either set a single channel in which one file is transferred at a time on one channel. That is quite a stable method. Otherwise, you can choose dual channels in which multiple files are transferred at the same time via different channels. </p>
<p> You can share files between different devices without checking the compatibility. There are options available on the top right corner of the home screen. You can connect with PC and use sharing features like group share and web share. You can create a group by authenticating the connections with your desired receiving devices and start sharing files. There are additional features of games and videos incorporated into the SHAREit apk platform. You can download different games from the inbuilt game store. The games are available in various categories like action, casual, puzzle, sports, and racing, etc. There is a ranking tab that shows web games, app games, and popular games. You can see the rankings of other users on the map displayed. </p>

<p> Want to keep your friends and family updated on what you’re doing? Well, you’ve come to the right place, download Snapchat APK and keep your loved ones updated with high-quality pictures and videos. </p>
<p> About Snapchat APK </p>
<p> Snapchat is a really interesting app to keep in contact with your loved ones and relatives. It offers a lot of features and flexibility if you want to send pictures and videos to anybody. It has face filters, emojis and much more to make your normal pictures look more amazing and awesome. </p>
<p> You can share disappearing videos to anybody you want which will disappear right after that person has watched it. </p>
<p> This app is widely famous for its amazing and funky face filters as well as animations that make your videos and pictures more interesting to watch. You can put these pictures and videos on your story, and all of your friends will be able to watch them, but if you want to show what you’ve recorded to everybody available on Snapchat, you’ll have to make your stories or your account public. </p>
<p> These snaps will stay active for 24 hours. After that, it is automatically going to disappear. If you want to save that story, you can tap on save button after you’ve recorded the story and it will save it in your camera roll. </p>
<p> The developer of Snapchat, Snap Inc. had also added a great and new feature a while ago called Maps. You can assess this feature by a gesture of pinching out of the screen and over here you can see where your friends are and what they are doing as well as see random stories of people around your area if they have their stories public to everybody. </p>
<p> As a security measure you can say, they have added a feature that if someone takes a screenshot of your story or the chat, you’ll immediately get a notification that this person has taken a screenshot. </p>
<p> The filters are one of the most important things in this app, and that is the main thing that made this app so popular. The filters are updated every day or every other day with new and interesting filters, and some of the most popular or widely used filters tend to stay there for a while like the famous dog emoji. </p>
<p> In older versions of Snapchat, all the stories were displayed in a specific area, and it was much organized that way. But from the past few updated, they removed that story area, and now to view someone’s story, you’ll need to go to that person’s chat, or a circle will display it on the display picture of that person. </p>
<p> Features of Snapchat APK </p>

<p> Check Out Snapchat Stories Online Using Snap Map </p>
<p> Snapchat requires you to have a Snapchat app installed on your mobile device and have an account to view Snaps </p>
<p> Snapchat requires you to have a Snapchat app installed on your mobile device and have an account to view Snaps and Stories shared by its users. But now using this new feature called Snap Map, you will be able to view Snapchat Story and Snaps from all over the world online right from your web browser. </p>
<p> Snapchat is a huge name in the social media network, and believe it or not, the idea of sharing the disappearing story is stolen from Snapchat. Facebook and Instagram both adopted this idea from Snapchat so that their users can start sharing disappearing stories without leaving their platform, in addition to the regular photos they usually post on their profile. </p>
<p> Now, because other social media platforms stole the idea of sharing stories from Snapchat so this platform lost its uniqueness, to bring the uniqueness back, the founders decided to introduce something new that cannot be found in other networks and their answer was Snap Map. A completely different way to share and explore the snaps and stories. </p>
<p> Moreover, you don’t even need to have a Snapchat account to view and explore snaps and stories shared on the Snap Map. You can also see these snaps from the web without any need to log in or requirement of having a Snapchat app. </p>
<p> Here’s how… </p>
<p> How to view Snapchat Story online without Snapchat account? </p>
<p> Snap Map by Snapchat allows you to view the Snapchat story online without even any requirement of having a Snapchat account or the Snapchat app. All you need is a web browser, and you can see a lot of popular as well as not-so-popular snap stories shared by people from all around the world. </p>
<p> Here is how you can view Snapchat stories online on the web: </p>
<p> On your Android mobile device, open any web browser of your choice. I am using Google Chrome. </p>
<p> In the address bar, enter this URL: https://map.snapchat.com </p>
<p> The Snap Map page will open with a popup message box that says, “Welcome to Snap Map.” And you will see a page similar to the one shown in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Tap on the blue colored “Browse the Map” button to start exploring the map for snaps. </p>
<p> On the top, you will see a search bar. You can use this bar to search for any place, city, or recent popular event happening around the world. Or, </p>
<p> Alternatively, if you want to see snaps and stories from within your area, then you can tap on the “Current Location” option, and it will ask you for the location access of your device. Tap on Allow to let it access your device’s location. </p>
<p> I am using the search bar to jump to an exact location and explore the snaps shared by people there. I am searching for Niagara Falls. It shows me different options since Niagara Falls comes between Canada and the United States. </p>
<p> You can select whichever option you feel like. Here I have opted for Niagara Falls, Canada. </p>
<p> On the Snap Map, you should be able to see some blue spots (or in some cases red spots), those spots are actually a heat map and based on the color it shows that there are some Snapchat stories and snaps shared by users. </p>
<p> Simply tap on the colored area you want to see the snaps. </p>
<p> The stories and snaps will begin playing. A simple tap on the screen will move you to the next snap. Though, you can go back to the previous snap and replay it by tapping on the left most corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Furthermore, you can use your finger to perform the drag gesture to move around the map and explore the area manually and look for stories and snaps from different parts of the city or region you are exploring. </p>
<p> To stop seeing the snaps or to go back to the maps, tap the back button on your device and snaps will stop playing and you will be returned to the Snap Map. </p>
<p> That’s how easy it is to view Snapchat Stories and Snaps without having a Snapchat account. Similarly, you can follow the same steps on the web browser running on your computer and enjoy all the snaps without any requirement of having a Snapchat account or the app itself. </p>
<p> How to view Snapchat Story using Snap Map on the Snapchat mobile app </p>
<p> If you have a Snapchat app already installed on your Android device, and you want to access the same Snap Map using your Snapchat account, then that is possible as well. The steps are simple and very easy to follow. </p>
<p> Open the Snapchat app on your Android device. </p>
<p> While on the homescreen from where you take a picture, perform a zoom out gesture using two fingers. A popup message will appear on the top that says, “Explore the Map, pull down to open.” </p>
<p> Perform a pull-down gesture on the screen using your finger. </p>
<p> Welcome to Snap Map message will appear. It requires location access so it will ask you to allow it. To give device’s location access to Snapchat, tap on the “Allow” button. </p>
<p> A popup will appear asking, “Snapchat wants to use your location.” Tap on Allow to grant device location access to Snapchat. </p>
<p> Once successfully granted, Snapchat will open the Snap Map and show your current location on the map based on the GPS coordinates. </p>
<p> You can easily navigate around the map, use pinch-in or pinch-out gestures to zoom in or out on the map and explore stories from all over the world shared by other Snapchat users. </p>
<p> That’s it. </p>
<p> What is Snap Map by Snapchat? </p>
<p> Snap Map is an interactive map designed by Snapchat to let their users publicly share their personal stories and snaps with people from all over the world to explore so that people can see the world from a different perspective right on their mobile devices. </p>
<p> The Snapchat’s Snap Map not only shows the personal snaps but it also includes stories related to events, breaking news, sports, celebrations, and other happenings from all parts of the world. </p>
<p> Not only that, if you have friends on Snapchat and both you and your friend have shared locations with each other then both of you will be able to find out what’s going around you. You can even see the snaps and stories your friends have shared from a different location. Also, Snap Map will show you their current location on the map, and they are denoted with their Bitmoji character. </p>

<p> Did you ever think about what else the Snapchat is capable of apart from just capturing and sharing videos and photos snaps with your friends? </p>
<p> Snapchat is a very powerful app that has several hidden tricks and features that you may have never heard about. </p>
<p> Here you will learn about the ten best Snapchat tricks for Android that you can start implementing right away and impress your friends with your special snaps. Some tricks will even improve your usage experience. </p>
<p> 1 – Save your friend’s Snapchat Stories, Videos & Photos </p>
<p> We know that every Snapchat stories, videos, and photos are automatically removed within twenty-four hours. And once that period has been passed, you won’t be able to access them again. </p>
<p> However, there is an easy trick to save any Snapchat story, video or photo within seconds. And to achieve that we are going to use Snapchat’s chat feature. </p>
<p> Just follow these steps: </p>
<p> Open your friend’s Snapchat story. </p>
<p> While you are viewing the story, just swipe-up or tap on the CHAT text to open a chat window. </p>
<p> Write something relevant about that story and tap Send. The message will be sent to your friend. </p>
<p> Now, quickly head over to the Snapchat Chat section and tap on your friend’s name. That will open a chat window, and you should see the snap on which you just commented. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on that snap. You will see, “SAVED” message. And all the saved messages will be highlighted with a grey background. </p>
<p> NOTE: Once SAVED, you can tap and hold on any SAVED message to ‘UNSAVE’ it whenever you like to. </p>
<p> That is it! You just saved your friend’s snap without even letting them know. You can now access these saved snaps in chats whenever you want. </p>
<p> 2 – Stylize Snap Text With Bold, Italic, and Underline </p>
<p> With the release of new Snapchat version, the developers have added the formatting functionality for texts that you add in your snaps. This new formatting option allows you to stylize your text with bold, italic, and underline. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Capture a snap. </p>
<p> Tap on the T to add text to your snap and then write anything relevant to the snap. </p>
<p> Now, tap and hold on any word to select it. </p>
<p> You will see a new menu on the top with ‘B’ (Bold), ‘I’ (Italic), and ‘U’ (Underline). </p>
<p> Tap on the formatting option you want to apply to the selected text. BONUS TIP: Using this similar technique, you can even change the font color of any selected text. </p>
<p> Once you are done with the formatting, tap on the done button. </p>
<p> That’s it. You just stylized the text in your snap. </p>
<p> 3 – Add Multiple Text Lines In Your Snap </p>
<p> Did you ever want to add multiple text lines in your snap while adding text? But wasn’t able to do so because there is no enter/return button on the keyboard. </p>
<p> You don’t need to worry anymore as you can now add multiple text lines with this Snapchat trick, and say more in a single snap! </p>
<p> Follow these simple steps: </p>
<p> Go to Messaging app and tap on the write new message option. </p>
<p> In the message box, just tap on the enter/return button on the keyboard to add multiple lines. And in each line add a full stop/period too. This will make it easier for you to copy. </p>
<p> Once done, tap and hold on the full stop/period, select the whole text, and tap on copy. </p>
<p> Now go to Snapchat, capture a new snap, and tap on the T icon to add text. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the box, and then tap on Paste to paste the copied text. </p>
<p> Congratulations, you now have multiple lines and can add your text in each line without any issue. </p>
<p> 4 – Add Background Music To Your Snap Videos </p>
<p> Do you know you can add your own background music to your video snaps? </p>
<p> Snapchat has a precisely designed feature that allows you to add any music as your video snap’s background music and the implementation is actually very easy. </p>
<p> Here is what you need to do: </p>
<p> On your Android phone, open any music player and play the song or music you want to set as your snap’s background. </p>
<p> Once the music has been started playing, open Snapchat and start capturing video snap. </p>
<p> As simple as that. The part of music that was being played while you were capturing the snap will be used as your video snap’s background music. </p>
<p> 5 – Create Your Own Unique Color Filter </p>
<p> We all know that there are no color filters in Snapchat, and for all those filter addicts this might be a little bit turnoff. </p>
<p> However, with this awesome Snapchat trick, you can now add customized color filter to your snaps and give your pictures/videos a unique look. </p>
<p> Capture a photo/video. </p>
<p> Tap on the “T” icon to add text to your snap. </p>
<p> Select text color by tapping and holding the “Pencil” icon. (NOTE: The color you select will be the color of your new filter). </p>
<p> Once the color has been selected, write any letter you want. (For example: a letter ‘I’) </p>
<p> Tap on the “T” icon to make the text appear larger. </p>
<p> Once done, you have to enlarge the text using the pinch-to-zoom gesture and you have to expand it until the text starts to become translucent. </p>
<p> Now all you have to do is adjust the text location until you are satisfied with the results. </p>
<p> You have created yourself a very own color filter. Go ahead and impress your friends with this technique! 😀 </p>
<p> 6 – Find Out If Your Friend Has Blocked/Removed You </p>
<p> Did you ever feel curious about how you will be able to know if your friend has blocked you/removed you from their Snapchat friends list? </p>
<p> We have a trick that you can use to find out, in a matter of seconds, if your friend has blocked/removed you. </p>
<p> Just follow these steps: </p>
<p> Open Snapchat and swipe down to access your profile settings section. </p>
<p> Tap on “My Friends” option. </p>
<p> Under the “FRIENDS” tab, search for the friend who you think has removed/blocked you, and then tap on their name. </p>
<p> Doing this will pop-up their profile info that will show their Snapchat name, username, and Snapchat score (snapscore). </p>
<p> Now, if their snapscore is visible it means that you are still friends and they have not blocked you. Else, if you are not able to see the score that means they have blocked/removed you. </p>
<p> 7 – Easy & Smooth Zooming While Capturing Video </p>
<p> Do you capture a lot of video snaps? If yes, then you must find it hard to zoom in or zoom out while recording videos. </p>
<p> The possible zooming option we all know about is the popular ‘pinch-to-zoom’ gesture. But it would be hard to record video and zoom with just one hand. </p>
<p> Below you will learn a trick to easily and smoothly zoom-in and zoom-out while recording a video snap, without using your second hand. </p>
<p> While you are capturing a video snap and holding the capture button, you can: </p>
<p> Move your finger in the upward direction to zoom in, </p>
<p> Move your finger in the downward direction to zoom out. </p>
<p> Yes, as simple as that! You can now record videos and use the zooming functionality singlehandedly with one hand. </p>
<p> 8 – Swipe To Access Different Snapchat Sections </p>
<p> Did you know you could use swipe gestures to browse through different sections in the Snapchat? </p>
<p> While you are on the Snapchat homescreen, you can perform these gestures: </p>
<p> Swipe to the bottom to access your profile settings section, </p>
<p> Swipe to the left to access your Stories and Subscriptions section, </p>
<p> Swipe up to access your Memories and Camera Roll section, </p>
<p> Swipe to the right to access your Snapchat Chat area, </p>
<p> These gesture tricks will help you save time while browsing through your Snapchat. </p>
<p> BONUS: When you are viewing one of your friend’s Snapchat stories and you want to skip the rest of the story, and jump to the next friend’s stories then what you could do is, rather than tapping the back button and selecting other friend’s name, you can simply swipe to the left to quickly skip it. </p>
<p> 9 – Save Mobile Data Usage With Travel Mode </p>
<p> If you are a new Snapchat user, and wondering why the app is consuming a large amount of mobile data then this Snapchat trick will help you out in saving your valuable mobile data. </p>
<p> Usually, whenever you open Snapchat, any new story will be downloaded automatically for you. However, there is an option that will stop the app from pre-downloading Snapchat stories and will save you significant amount of mobile data. </p>
<p> From your Snapchat home screen, swipe down to access your profile section. </p>
<p> On the top-right corner you will see a “Gear” icon, tap on it to go to “Settings” menu. </p>
<p> Now scroll down until you find “Manage” and then tap on it. (This should be under “Additional Services” section) </p>
<p> Here you will find “Travel Mode” check box. Tap on it to enable this mode. </p>
<p> Now, Snapchat will not load snaps and stories automatically. You have to manually tap on each story to load it. This will save your mobile account from any unwanted mobile data usage. </p>
<p> 10 – Share Photos & Videos From Gallery As Story </p>
<p> We all wanted to share our old photos and videos on Snapchat as story but there was no option that would allow you to do that! </p>
<p> Until recently when Snapchat developers decided to update the app that included the ability to let you select the photos or videos stored in your gallery, and allows you to share them as your story. </p>
<p> Here’s how you can share them: </p>
<p> From your Snapchat’s homescreen, swipe up to access “Memories” section. </p>
<p> Here you will find three tabs, i.e. ‘All’, ‘Snaps’, ‘Stories’, and ‘Camera Roll’. You need to tap on the “Camera Roll” tab to access all the photos and videos stored in your phone’s gallery. </p>
<p> Tap on the one you would like to share. </p>
<p> And then perform the swipe up gesture to Edit the photo/video and then Share it as your story. </p>
<p> That is awesome, isn’t it? </p>
<p> 11 – Give artistic styling to your old snaps </p>
<p> Did you know you could reshare your old snaps via Memories section? And that too with an artistic touch using a paintbrush tool. </p>
<p> Open the Snapchat app and swipe up to access Memories section. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on any snap you want to stylize. </p>
<p> From the popup menu, tap Edit Snap option. </p>
<p> On the left-hand side, you will find several options. Tap Paintbrush icon. </p>
<p> That will pop open a filter slider with a wide range of artistic styling options that you can apply on your snap. </p>
<p> There are over twenty styling options to choose from and don’t forget that these styling can also be applied to the photos stored in your camera roll (as already shown in the previous tip). 😉 </p>
<p> 12 – Transform a color of any object in your snap </p>
<p> Did you know you could transform a color of any object in your snap within a matter of seconds? There is a little-known tool known as Tint Brush located within Snapchat that lets you do that. </p>
<p> This is where you are going to find this tool: </p>
<p> Using Snapchat, capture any snap. </p>
<p> On the right side, you will find several options, tap Scissor icon. </p>
<p> Tap the Paintbrush icon. </p>
<p> Simply outline the object in your snap that you want to recolor. </p>
<p> Now on the color slider located on the right, drag your finger to choose a suitable color. </p>
<p> So that’s how simple it really is to change a color of anything in your snap. </p>
<p> 13 – Add your own twist to ‘Discover’ content and share it with your friends </p>
<p> Discover is like a newscaster that keeps you updated about all the things going on around the world including breaking news as well as stories about celebrities, food, technology, and other Snapchat Discover partners. </p>
<p> Many Snapchatters don’t know while exploring any Discover content story, you can tap and hold to share it with your friends. But before sharing it with your friends, you can add your own twist by adding text, emoticons, or another artistic touch to the content. </p>
<p> Here’s how it is done: </p>
<p> From the camera screen, swipe left. </p>
<p> You will see Discover stories marked with a bookmark icon in the top-right corner. </p>
<p> Tap on the story you want to watch. While watching, if you like any content and want to let your friends know about it, simply tap and hold and then tap on the Pen icon to start customizing the Discover content. </p>
<p> Once done, tap that Blue send button. </p>
<p> Remember, Snapchat does not allow you to share Discover content as your Snapchat Story. You can only share these with your friends via chat. </p>
<p> 14 – Make the text look colorful and vibrant </p>
<p> If you are feeling creative and want to make your picture pop out then we will recommend you to try this trick, as it will not only impress your friends but will also add a vibrant touch to your snaps. </p>
<p> Here are the steps to achieve this: </p>
<p> Take a snap. </p>
<p> Add caption by tapping the T icon. </p>
<p> Once added, tap the T icon again to make the text enlarged. </p>
<p> Now to change the color of letters in your caption, you need to tap and hold on the letter to highlight it. </p>
<p> Select your desired color using the color slider. </p>
<p> Repeat the same process for every letter in your caption. </p>
<p> Yes, it is a bit time-consuming but you should know that creativity takes time. </p>
<p> 15 – Create your own stickers to decorate snaps </p>
<p> Do you know you can you can create your very own custom stickers out of the snaps you took on Snapchat? For this, we will be using a Scissor tool. </p>
<p> Here are the steps: </p>
<p> After you have taken a snap on Snapchat, tap on the Scissor button. </p>
<p> Using your finger, outline the object you want to create a sticker. </p>
<p> The moment you lift your finger, that object should appear on your Snap as a sticker. You can easily drag it around. </p>
<p> Whenever you cut something with scissor tool, that object will be automatically saved in the sticker drawer. Now, these stickers can be used in your future snaps to decorate them and you can share them in chats too to add a personalized touch to your conversations. </p>
<p> 16 – Add web links to your snaps </p>
<p> We all are aware of Snapchat’s limitation with external linking as well as how Snapchatters are restricted from adding a clickable link in their snaps. However, with the release of updated Snapchat version, you now have the ability to add web links to your snaps that can be easily opened by your snap viewers by performing a simple swipe up gesture on the screen. </p>
<p> Here’s how you can add links to your Snapchat story: </p>
<p> First copy the link you want to share in your story. This will add it to your clipboard so you don’t have to type it. </p>
<p> Open Snapchat and capture a snap. </p>
<p> On the left-hand side, you will find several options. Tap the Paper Clip icon. </p>
<p> Paste the URL you copied earlier by tapping and holding your finger in the link box. </p>
<p> Tap Attach to Snap button to attach web link to your Snap. </p>
<p> That is how simple it has become to share amazing web content including news, blog pages, recipes, and interesting article with your friends. </p>
<p> 17 – Make anything disappear from a snap </p>
<p> We know that not all snaps we take from Snapchat turns out to be perfect but now with the help of Magic Eraser feature you can make your imperfect snaps perfect than ever before. </p>
<p> Capture a snap. </p>
<p> Tap the Scissor icon. </p>
<p> Tap on Stars icon. </p>
<p> Using your finger, simply outline the object you want to erase. </p>
<p> The moment you lift your finger, the outlined object will magically disappear. </p>
<p> Getting rid of imperfections is not the only use of this tool. You can be more creative by removing any object and replacing it with a sticker or emoticon to give a new perspective to your snap. </p>
<p> 18 – Generate Snapcode for any website for easy sharing </p>
<p> Initially, Snapcodes were limited to Snapchat profiles. But now, as Snapcode has started to gain popularity, Snapchat started to allow its users to generate custom Snapcodes for any website as well as personalize the QR code with a custom image. This makes the distribution of your favorite web content a lot simpler. </p>
<p> You can create Snapcode right from your smartphone on the Snapchat app or alternatively you can go to scan.snapchat.com from any web browser and get a unique QR code generated. </p>
<p> Copy the URL of any website for which you want to crate Snapcode. </p>
<p> Open Snapchat app and tap on your profile icon that is located on the top-left corner. </p>
<p> Tap Settings icon. </p>
<p> Tap Create Snapcode option. </p>
<p> Either manually enter the URL or paste it into the box by tapping and holding your finger. </p>
<p> Once done, tap on Create button. </p>
<p> It will now give you an option to add an image to your Snapcode. If you want to personalize your code then tap on it to add an image. </p>
<p> You can save your personalized Snapcode to your Camera Roll and share it with your friends. </p>
<p> Now share it with your followers or anywhere where Snapchatters can view your Snapcode. Whenever anyone scans the code via the Snapchat app, he/she will be automatically redirected to the website. A perfect solution for quick branding. 😉 </p>
<p> 19 – Restyle the surrounding of your snap </p>
<p> Snapchat is a powerful app that transforms your face using Lenses, but with the addition of new tool i.e. Backdrop, you can now restyle the surrounding of your snap. Usage is straightforward too. All you need to do is select what you want to have in focus while the rest of your snap’s backdrop will have a new look. </p>
<p> Capture a snap. </p>
<p> On the left-hand side, you will find several options. Tap the Scissor icon. </p>
<p> Tap the Shade icon, which is right before the Paint Brush icon. </p>
<p> Outline the object you want to have in focus. </p>
<p> The moment you lift the finger off the screen, Snapchat will apply the backdrop to the rest of your picture. It is a great Snapchat trick to add restyling touch to your snaps. </p>
<p> 20 – Unlock new and exclusive lenses with a Snapcode </p>
<p> If you are a regular user of Snapchat then you must have seen that they release a range of new lenses almost every other day. Apart from those, there are some exclusive lenses too that you can use for limited time. These lenses can only be unlocked by scanning a special Snapcode using your Snapchat. </p>
<p> It’s easy to differentiate between regular Snapcode and Lenses exclusive Snapcode. A Snapcode that unlocks lenses has a circle in the center. It can unlock either Face Lens or World Lens. Moreover, you can even share these Lenses with your Snapchat friends so they can try them too. </p>
<p> So if you ever find a Snapcode with a circle in the center, here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Launch the Snapchat app. </p>
<p> Point your camera at that Snapcode. </p>
<p> Once the code has been focused, to scan the code simply press and hold on the Snapcode on your screen. </p>
<p> You can now use this exclusive lens on your snap and amaze your friends. </p>
<p> 21 – Effortlessly promote your Snapchat profile with easy-to-share link </p>
<p> There are moments when you are unable to share the picture of your Snapcode with your friends or followers. So alternatively, you can use a shortcut URL for your Snapchat profile that is easy to memorize and can be shared anywhere on the Internet. </p>
<p> The format is simple: </p>
<p> https://www.snapchat.com/add/YOURSNAPCHATUSERNAME </p>
<p> Now, simply replace the phrase “YOURSNAPCHATUSERNAME” with your Snapchat username. And there you have it, an easy to remember Snapchat profile link for promotions. </p>
<p> 22 – Quickly share anything with your Snapchat friends </p>
<p> There are times when you find something interesting while browsing the Internet on your phone and want to share it with your Snapchat friends or secret Snapchat group. Rather than copying and pasting the URL for that page, there is a shortcut that let you directly share it to chat. Even from other apps… </p>
<p> Find something spooky your friends just need to see? 💀🎺 On Android, you can share to Chat right from other apps! https://t.co/bo3as7CnXE </p>
<p> While you are browsing and found an interesting page that you want to share, tap on the Share button. </p>
<p> A popup with a list of apps will appear, tap Snapchat. </p>
<p> Select friends or group, with whom you want to share the URL. </p>
<p> Now hit that blue send button. </p>
<p> That’s how quick and easy to share anything with your friends with the help of share extension. </p>
<p> 23 – Access Snaps shared by people from all around the world </p>
<p> In case you are new to Snapchat then you might be unaware about Snap Map, which allows you to find, search, and discover snaps as well as stories shared by people from all around the world. </p>
<p> Accessing Snap Map on your phone is easy and there are several ways: </p>
<p> While you are on the camera screen, perform a Pinch Out gesture and you will enter Snap Map. </p>
<p> Tap the Search button and then tap on the Map. </p>
<p> When on the Discover screen, simply tap on the Map Story. </p>
<p> Or, go to map.snapchat.com from any web browser and start exploring Snap Map Stories. </p>
<p> You can drag the map and go to virtually any part of the world to discover live content shared by people of that area. Moreover, the Map will also show you the last location as well as the snap shared by your friends. </p>
<p> 24 – Hide your location from Snap Map for specific hours </p>
<p> If you are planning to travel somewhere and take some snaps there but don’t want to share your location with your Snapchat friends for few hours then there is a feature specially designed for you i.e. Ghost Mode with a new timer functionality. </p>
<p> Gotta disappear from the Map to prep for a party? 🎈Set Ghost Mode to "3 hrs" so ur not hidden when the fun starts! https://t.co/PqA2YrmI1F </p>
<p> Tap the Settings button, which is located at the top-right corner. </p>
<p> Now, this is where you can enable Ghost Mode. And the moment you enable this mode, a pop-up prompt will appear with three timer options asking you about the duration i.e. 3 hours, 24 hours, or Until Turned Off. </p>
<p> Want to get away from it all? 👋 Go into 'Ghost Mode' to hide your location from everyone on the Snap Map 👻 You can still see it though! pic.twitter.com/jSMrolMRY4 </p>
<p> Apart from the Ghost Mode settings, you can also modify settings for who can see your location on Snap Map. </p>
<p> 25 – Record longer video snaps with multi snap feature </p>
<p> There are moments when we feel 10 seconds are just not enough to capture what we are experiencing around us. And to record another video snap, first we need to share the existing snap. This process takes time and during the process, there are chances you might miss a moment that should have been captured. </p>
<p> Worry no more, as with Snapchat’s Multi-Snap feature you can now record a continuous video snap of up to 60 seconds. Here’s how this Snapchat hack works: </p>
<p> On Snapchat camera screen, tap and hold the capture button to start recording a video snap. </p>
<p> If you continue holding the capture button for more than 10-seconds or until the timer runs out, you will notice that the recording for another snap is started. </p>
<p> While recording multi snaps, a thumbnail for each video snap will keep appearing right above the record button. </p>
<p> If you kept holding the button for 60 seconds then now you should have six 10-second snaps and can apply filters, effects, and text to all of them in one go. However, there are certain limitations i.e. you cannot separate a single snap from a multi snap, multi snap currently does not allow you to use effects like a loop and reverse and you cannot use 3D stickers. </p>
<p> 26 – Add a voice filter to snaps </p>
<p> Snapchat is well known for lenses that transform your face and give a new twist to your voice. But the new Voice Filter feature is designed to give your video snaps a vocal filter while keeping your video visually untouched. </p>
<p> — Snapchat Support (@snapchatsupport) July 7, 2017 </p>
<p> Record a video snap with some voice. </p>
<p> Tap the speaker icon located at the bottom-left corner of the screen, a list with different voice filters will appear. </p>
<p> Choose any one of the characters from the list of filters and see how it changes your voice. </p>
<p> Apart from the filter, there is even an option that allows you to completely mute the voice altogether. </p>

<p> Video files can be converted to audio formats and then downloaded. </p>
<p> Ensures reliable and fast downloading with features like multiple connections and simultaneous downloading. </p>
<p> User Interface </p>
<p> There is also an in-built video player similar to YouTube that allows you to play the video before downloading. There is a dedicated search bar available on the top of the screen that can be used in case you do not find your video in the given categories. There is a long list of sites supported by Snaptube apk, which means you can download audio and video content from these sites: </p>
<p> Facebook, Instagram, Vevo, WhatsApp, Daily Motion, Animeq, Vimeo, Vine.co, Musical.ly, Vuclip, Metacafe, Liveleak, Twitter, Tune.pk, Pagalworld, Dailytube.in, MrPopat.in, Pinguda, 3GPMania.co, FunnyOrDie, Vid.me. </p>
<p> The Snaptube home screen is quite vibrant and engaging. There is a search bar on top where you can search for any YouTube video. This search bar functions the same way as the YouTube search bar works. </p>
<p> There are three tabs on top, which includes For You, Trending, and Channels. There are icons of all the supported sites available, and then there are the most trending videos available at the bottom of the home screen. The tabs present at the bottom consist of Home, Games, Subscriptions, My Files, and Me. </p>
<p> The user is not asked to provide any personal details for the signup; however, the YouTube account has to be synced with Snaptube to proceed with the video downloading process. Once you have entered your YouTube account details, then the app will automatically sync all your playlist and history for an enhanced experience. </p>
<p> There is also a dark mode pop-up on the right side of the screen. You can switch between the day and night mode according to your choice. The day mode makes the background white, and the night mode changes the background color to black. It is recommended to switch between the modes, as the dark mode is suitable for your eyes when using the phone during darkness. </p>
<p> The “My files” tab consists of all the downloaded files and downloading history. It also displays the total storage of the phone, so you can keep track of the available and consumed phone storage. There are four tabs in the My files bar, which include Download, Music, Video, and Playlist. </p>
<p> The great thing about Snaptube is that it divides different types of downloaded content into a relevant category, so all downloads stay organized. It also shows the music and playlist of the phone itself. </p>
<p> The “Me” tab shows all your activities related to YouTube. The playlist that you have created is automatically updated in-app, and you can begin to download the videos from that. You can also check your history and videos marked as watch later. </p>
<p> How to Download Videos and Music with Snaptube on Android </p>
<p> Let us explore the playlist and downloading procedures of the Snaptube app for Android. It is easy to start with YouTube because we have already synchronized our account. </p>
<p> There is a download button available with all the videos shown in the app. Once you click the download button, you will be redirected to another window with various download formats. </p>
<p> You can download the video as an MP3 audio file or an MP4 video file. The size of the file is mentioned along with the download format options. Following formats are available for audio and video downloads: </p>
<p> Audio – MP3 70K, 128K, 160K, and MP4A 128K. </p>
<p> Video – 1440P UHD, 1080P HD, 720P, 480P, 360P, 240P, and 144P. </p>
<p> As the user can download from multiple online streaming and video sharing platforms, so the downloading process is different from each website. Let us take an example of downloading videos from Instagram. Please note that a similar process applies to the majority of other platforms like Facebook and Twitter. </p>
<p> If you want to download a video from Instagram, open the Instagram app, and click on the more button available at the lower right side of the video. Then copy the URL of the video and paste it in the search bar in Snaptube. It will automatically add the video in the list of videos to be downloaded. </p>
<p> There is an elaborative settings menu available so that the users can personalize their feeds accordingly. The user can enable the pop-up window option where the video can be played in a small window present at the bottom left corner while browsing other content. This way, you can browse and watch videos simultaneously. </p>
<p> The user can enable the option of downloading the videos from the URL copied in the clipboard. The user can set the total number of simultaneous downloads. For example, by default, two tasks can be downloaded simultaneously. However, the user can set it to one download at a time to speed up the downloading process. </p>
<p> You can also enable a restriction on downloading if you want the downloading to be done only via Wi-Fi. There is an option of fast downloading mode that uses multiple connections to enhance the downloading speed. </p>
<p> There is a path set by default where all the downloaded videos are stored. Snaptube comes with an experimental feature that allows the user to play the music even when you are on the lock screen. </p>

<p> However, with the provided Spotify Premium app, you can enjoy all the paid features without paying a penny; and we will guide you about that in a while. </p>
<p> Here are some of the unique Spotify Premium features you can enjoy: </p>
<p> Download Music And Offline Listening – You are allowed to download your whole playlist (limited to 3,333 tracks) and listen to them even when you are somewhere without active Internet connectivity. Offline listening helps you save a significant amount of Internet data and bandwidth. </p>

The procedure is straightforward, and here is a step-by-step guide on how to bypass country restrictions within a matter of minutes and continue enjoying all the premium features regardless of your geolocation 😉 </p>
<p> Difference Between Spotify Premium & Spotify Free Version </p>
<p> Spotify Premium has become one of the biggest music streaming service providers. It is well known for providing an excellent online music service that allows you to listen to any music you want. You will find a massive music collection on their online servers. </p>

<p> Unlimited listening time, </p>
<p> Provides a basic set of features, </p>
<p> Shows advertisements, </p>
<p> Does not allow you to download music for offline listening, </p>
<p> The quality of the soundtrack is set to 128kbps. </p>
<p> However, with the Spotify Premium, you will get an interruption-free music listening experience as well as the following: </p>
<p> Zero advertisements, </p>
<p> Blocked audio ads and video ads, </p>
<p> Ability to download music for offline listening, </p>
<p> Play music and songs in extreme high quality, i.e., 320kbps, </p>

<p> It is essential to mention here that some server-side features cannot be modded and requires you to have a paid Spotify Premium subscription. </p>
<p> How to Get Spotify Premium for Cheap? </p>
<p> If you are a Spotify Premium subscriber then apart from taking advantage of those remarkable features mentioned above, there are a couple of other discounted offers that you may be able to avail if you have plans to stay a Spotify Premium user: </p>
<p> Spotify Premium for Students – Costs about $4.99 per month. </p>
<p> Spotify Premium for Family – Costs about $14.99 per month. </p>
<p> Depending on your conditions, both of these are perfect choices if you want to save some money on the usual premium subscription billing charges. </p>
<p> Even though the pricing of Spotify Premium subscription is affordable and users opt for their premium offer. Still, many cannot pay for Premium even if they want to, because Spotify is not officially available in their country. </p>
<p> And that alone is the key reason why users from those countries are left with no other option but to download Spotify Premium mod for Android and continue enjoying premium features free. </p>

First, download and install Spotify Premium mod on your Android using the tutorial given above. Then, head over to our step-by-step guide here, which will help you remove country restrictions and use Spotify Premium app for free on Android. </p>
<p> What is Spotify Premium mod apk, and how does it work? </p>
<p> Spotify Premium is a modified and hacked version of the original Spotify app. It is designed to unlock all the Spotify Premium features without paying for a subscription for an unlimited period on Android devices. </p>
<p> Is it safe to download, install, and use Spotify Premium apk? </p>
<p> Yes, it is completely safe to download, install, and use Spotify Premium apk on Android devices. We always perform thorough tests on Android apps to check for viruses and malicious codes, and we found the Spotify Premium app to be completely safe from viruses and security issues. </p>
<p> Why am I unable to skip songs on Spotify and don’t have unlimited skips? </p>
<p> It usually happens when you already have an official Spotify app installed on your Android device, and then you try to install the Spotify mod app on top of it. The only way to fix this is to first completely uninstall the original Spotify app from your device, then download the Spotify Premium app from the link given at the beginning of this article and do a fresh installation. We already have a detailed installation tutorial above. </p>
<p> Why is Spotify asking to upgrade to Premium when I tried to download music? </p>
<p> Spotify offers two account types, i.e., Free and Premium. Features like offline listening, music, and album downloading are server-sided and directly linked to your Spotify account type. If you have a free Spotify account but using the Spotify mod app as a bypass to enjoy premium features, then you won’t be able to download any music. You need to have a Spotify Premium account too to be able to unlock offline listening and downloading. </p>
<p> How much does it cost to get Spotify Premium for a year? </p>
<p> If you want to purchase Spotify Premium, it will cost you $9.99 per month. The student memberships cost $4.99. Some special offers and discount deals also give you the first three months subscription for under $3.99. </p>

<p> when i click the download link and the download finishes and i go to click it, it says it cant be opened </p>
<p> Hello, can you update the Deezer Premium apk? Because the one you have linked in the comments says “Page not found 404.” </p>
<p> There’s always an inconsistency in showing the track list in the album I searched for from the free only shuffle mode, seen this issues persist in many others comments too, and the solution provided doesn’t work every time. And it loads very very slow (for searching, playing a song, loading an album when it works, there’s even delay in pausing a song like serious 5 sec delay sometimes) even if my WiFi is able to load a YouTube 4k video within seconds. Nevertheless, when it works, song played are definitely better quality than listening to them on YouTube. </p>
<p> hi.i cant sign up . it stop at the first place and didn’t do anything or confirm my gmail.can you help me? </p>
<p> If Gmail sign up is not working then you can try Facebook Connect. You will first need to uninstall Facebook app for that though. </p>
<p> So this is free? I mean I can use it anytime and play music and all I have to do is to be online? </p>
<p> Thank you very much, I can change my name and when I write an instagram story, I can put it on canvas. </p>
<p> is there a way to change the device name when casting because it says Samsung galaxy tab s6 5g </p>
<p> On your Android device, go to Settings > About Phone. There you should be able to find the Device Name or edit button to change the name of your device. </p>
<p> I saw the latest versions are named APK file and some previous versions are named Spotify premium,is there a difference between them,other than the fact that the first one is a latest version?Also,i had an old version and i wanted to download antoher one but it doesn’t show me the lyrics of any songs now..i don’t know why </p>
<p> Premium is a modded version whereas the simple Spotify apk is an original apk file uploaded directly from the Play Store. </p>
<p> The only version that works for me is the V.8.5.14.752 ARM,i tried to download all the others but they did not work,either it not let me logg in or it did’d work any of the premium features.Could it be the country?I set the country for Romania,2 years ago when i downladed it for the first time it was not available in Romania and i was using browsc,could it solve the problem now changing the country? </p>
<p> Hi Bianca. If any version is working for you then I will recommend you stick to that version since there is a very slight change in the interface and features in the newer versions. Basic features remain the same. There are some compatibility issues with the newer Spotify Premium apk. </p>
<p> Hey, I am using Android Version 10, Galaxy Edge 9. I’ve tried downloading and installing most the versions above but after opening the zip file and installing, it says at the end ” App not installed” . Which version do you recommend? </p>
<p> Hi Jay, I always recommend v8.5.29.828. It has been marked as the “best version” in the downloads list too. Give it a try and let me know how it goes. </p>
<p> I deleted my Spotify app and installed the cracked version but when I log in it still only let’s me shuffle play my playlists, the premium features aren’t working </p>
<p> when I try to log in it says I’m offline, while signing up it says my email is incorrect and shows error when trying to log in with facebook, help please </p>
<p> And to be able to log in with Facebook, you will first need to uninstall the Facebook app and then attempt to log in to Spotify. Once you are logged in, you can then reinstall the Facebook app. </p>
<p> Will it gona work with Alexa? Because i tried with previos Mods and they do not work, it ask for buy premium. </p>
<p> Sometimes it works and sometimes it requires you to have a premium Spotify account. </p>
<p> When I install it, it doesn’t have the premium features, I just can play songs ramdomly.. I tried creating a new account instead of using mine and it doesn’t work too. I deleted the cache and stuff but I don’t know what else I can do. I got it for my boyfriend and it works for him on Huawei but on my Samsung it doesn’t. Thanks </p>
<p> I’m using the best version. It’s great! Tysm! Wondering if there’s an option to view my liked songs when i click the artists on my library. It shows on my spotify pc but it doesn’t seem to be the case with the apk app. It just takes me directly to the artist page without the list of my liked songs from them. </p>
<p> Glad it worked for you. There should be a separate playlist for your liked songs. </p>
<p> Hello. I get like a spotify ads every 10/15 min saying in French “Thx for listening to spotify, you could do something different, but you are listening to Spotify, … bla bla bla ” Is there a way to get rid of that one ? Do other people get il ? Thx </p>
<p> Not much. In case you experience login issues in one version then you can try another version. It should work. </p>
<p> Please log in again. The login page will open in a new tab. After logging in you can close it and return to this page. </p>

<p> I wasn’t too sure XNSPY was real when I first read about it over here but after exploring the powerful features and user-friendly interface I am very satisfied with the results. Thanks for listing this app. I am at ease knowing I can track ever move of kids from my own device. </p>
<p> Spy apps are the biggest liars I have ever met in my life, but xnspy has been an exception. It does what it says and its pretty cheap too. I’ve used this software and I am 100% satisfied with its performance. It delivers all that it promises, including 24-7 online support. It is totally user-friendly and easy to use. </p>
<p> I wanted to secure my devices while I’m on my vacation in another countries, since they had a lot of private data. Fortunately nothing bad happened, so I didn’t have to use any security locks – still, performance of MSpy is pretty incredible. This app is a great security product on my opinion. </p>
<p> XNSPY really helpful software. I use it for many things… to keep my kids in check, to make sure they get to school on time when I’m away… to make sure they’re not getting on bad websites… to see if they’re doing their homework or just goofing off. Every mom should have something like this! </p>

<p> I have used two of the apps mentioned here and I’d say they both worked really well for me. Xnspy was a cinch to install and provided a smooth performance. For my other son, I used Flexispy. Though this one is a bit expensive, it blew my mind with 150+ features…Really advanced in monitoring! I’d recommend both these apps to anyone based on their requirements and affordability. </p>

<p> Ultimate Guide to Stop Popup Ads in Android </p>
<p> In the ever-evolving era of the Internet, the digital promotion has taken over almost every platform we can think of </p>
<p> In the ever-evolving era of the Internet, the digital promotion has taken over almost every platform we can think of from billboards, websites to our smartphone screens. Coupled with the advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and abundance of user data at disposal, ads have become so much intrusive and terrifyingly accurate that at times it feels like they’ve become a part of your digital life. </p>
<p> The ads we view on our smartphones not only consume our most valuable resource, which is our undivided attention but also takes up space in the smartphone to cache them so that they can pop up even when we are offline and uses our bandwidth to load them. They can also affect performance on some low-end devices that are barely capable of meeting the modern web standards. </p>
<p> How and Why We See Popup Advertisements? </p>
<p> One might wonder if ads are that bad for a web or mobile app, then why are the numbers consistently increasing? </p>
<p> Well, the answer is simple. Ads generate revenue for a broadcaster since the ad publisher pays big to maximize the reach of their ads. You can even say that ads are unavoidable if we, as a consumer, want free access to the Internet along with other digital services. </p>
<p> That was just the financial benefit of an ad. These ads can also collect data on user interest based on the activity of the user. That is the reason why lately there have been very strict policies established on user privacy, which notifies the user more about how their data is being collected. </p>
<p> To start the tutorial on how to stop popup ads, first, we will like to give you an overview of the types of ads we see on our Android phones. They may seem similar but in reality, they vary depending on where they show up. </p>
<p> Ads that popup while browsing the web, </p>
<p> Ads that show up on our phone, </p>
<p> System notification based ads, </p>
<p> Ads that show up in system apps (take Xiaomi’s MIUI as an example). </p>
<p> How to Stop Popup Ads on Android Web Browsing Apps </p>
<p> While the most abundant, they are the easiest to deal with as they only occur when we are browsing the web or reading an article over a website or just browsing through online stores. You can simply start using AdBlock or other similar apps and stop popup ads from appearing. </p>
<p> Here are a few famous browsers that come with the builtin adblocking facility: </p>
<p> Google Chrome </p>
<p> Google Chrome is the most famous browser on the Android platform. Not surprisingly, Chrome is owned by the web’s most favorite search giant “Google,” which puts the browser at a favorable spot. Considered as the standard for web technologies, a major chunk of people uses this for everyday browsing. </p>
<p> To counter pop-up ads, Chrome has a couple of native options that enables the browser to block these pop-up ads by default. </p>
<p> Adblocking in Chrome nowadays is enabled by default; however, that wasn’t the case from the beginning because it didn’t have an ad-blocking feature. If you want to modify the ad blocker settings, then here is how you can do it: </p>
<p> Open Chrome and tap the 3 dots in the upper right corner. A drop-down menu will open. </p>
<p> Tap on Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll down to Advanced and tap Privacy. </p>
<p> Tap on Lite mode and turn it on. </p>
<p> Go back to Settings, scroll down to Privacy, and tap Site Settings. </p>
<p> Toggle the Ads switch to on position, and the adblocking will be enabled. </p>
<p> Opera and Opera Mini for Android </p>
<p> Opera is one of the oldest known browsers, especially in mobile history as it has been around even before the days of the smartphone. Opera and Opera Mini has long been providing the adblocking facility to its users. </p>
<p> Blocking ads on Opera and Opera Mini is very simple; here is how you can do it: </p>
<p> Press the Opera logo on the bottom right corner. </p>
<p> A drop-down menu will open. </p>
<p> You can toggle Ad-blocking on/off from here. </p>
<p> Firefox Focus </p>
<p> Firefox is no new name in the browser space; it has been long appreciated for being transparent about privacy. It is not even based on chromium. Mozilla, the developers behind the browser, takes the privacy game to the next level as it is purely made for privacy-conscious people. </p>
<p> Adblocking and tracker blocking is enabled by default. However, if you want to change the settings, then here is how you can do it: </p>
<p> Tap the 3 dots in the top right corner and tap Settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Privacy and settings. </p>
<p> Toggle all the switches shown in the screenshot. </p>
<p> Microsoft Edge </p>
<p> Microsoft Edge is the newest browser in the market. It is the first preference browser for the people who use special Windows features like Timeline Sharing. </p>
<p> It also comes with AdBlock, which is not active by default. So, to enable it, follow the below instructions to stop popup ads on Microsoft Edge browser: </p>
<p> Tap Settings and tap on Content Blockers. </p>
<p> Toggle the switch to “On” position. </p>
<p> Tap on Advanced Settings. </p>
<p> Brave Browser </p>
<p> Brave has been recently in the spotlight for its bat tokens, which allow users to support their favorite websites. Bat token is accumulated when user attention is given to advertising content. </p>
<p> Adblocking on Brave Browser is enabled by default. However, to review the settings follow the instruction below: </p>
<p> Tap on the lion icon as shown in the screenshot, a drop-down menu will appear. </p>
<p> Toggle the switches shown in the screenshot. </p>
<p> Now tap on 3 dots in the upper right corner. </p>
<p> Tap Privacy and toggle the switches shown in the screenshot. </p>
<p> UC Browser </p>
<p> UC browser is well known for its extra-added features. The adblocking functionality is enabled by default on this browser. </p>
<p> To view or modify the settings, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu in the bottom middle of the display. </p>
<p> Tap on adblocking. </p>
<p> Toggle the switches indicated in the screenshot. </p>
<p> AdBlock Browser </p>
<p> The Browser is dedicated to adblocking and it uses old Firefox UI. However, it’s based on Chromium. The rest of the browser functionalities works like a charm. </p>
<p> To enable/disable adblocking or to stop popup ads on AdBlock Browser, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Tap on the 3 dots in the upper right corner. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll to adblocking and tap it. </p>
<p> Now you have to toggle the switch in the screenshot to enable adblocking. </p>
<p> Samsung Browser </p>
<p> Samsung browser is an appealing option for Samsung users as it provides a convenient feature of saving logins and accessing your accounts using a fingerprint sensor with the trust of Samsung that not many browsers have to offer. </p>
<p> Adblocking is not enabled on it by default; however; one can do it easily by installing adblocker add-on on it: </p>
<p> Tap the hamburger menu in the bottom right corner, and a menu will appear. </p>
<p> Select Adblockers from the menu. </p>
<p> Tap the download icon of your desired adblocker and tap install. </p>
<p> Wait for it to finish the download and enable it. </p>
<p> Block Random Popup Ads on Android devices </p>
<p> Random popup ads are perhaps the most annoying form of ads. In the early days of computing, adware was considered a computer virus as it automatically runs ads on your device. Nowadays, in Android, random ads can occur due to the installation of a malicious or untrusted app. </p>
<p> It is not an easy task to identify such apps, but for your ease, we have identified two main reasons for the popup ads that appear suddenly on your Android device. </p>
<p> Popups from unknown sources or any particular apps, </p>
<p> System notification ads. </p>
<p> 1. Pop-ups from particular apps or unknown sources </p>
<p> One of the major reasons why some Android users experience popup ads on their Android devices is due to the installation of particular infected apps. Some apps after their installation start plaguing the Android OS with ads without prior permission. File sharing apps such as Zapya, Shareit, and Peel Remote are some infamous apps known for showing random popup ads on Android. </p>
<p> Sometimes this also occurs when a user installs an app from some untrusted source. Such apps are really troublesome because in most cases, they try to cloak the app package by not having an app icon in the drawer. These malicious apps’ most apparent effect is that they display forced ads; however, they can also have other worse effects depending on the permissions it has. </p>
<p> Fortunately, there is a way to figure which apps are responsible for the sudden full-screen ads or popup ads. </p>
<p> Whenever a sudden pop-up ad appears, there is a high probability that one of the currently running apps is responsible. In this case, proceed with the following steps: </p>
<p> Open the Settings from the drop-down menu. </p>
<p> Go to the System section. </p>
<p> Go to Developers options. </p>
<p> Select Running services. </p>
<p> A new screen will appear, which will show the percentage of RAM consumed by apps that are currently running. The icons of these apps will also be displayed on the screen alongside the size of RAM (in MB) they are using. Now, before proceeding, you should understand that this method is based on analysis and observation on the behavior of apps. </p>
<p> Look for: </p>
<p> Any recently installed app (if any) appeared on the list. </p>
<p> If you find a recently installed app among the currently running app list, then that might be the reason for these sudden popup ads in your Android device and you should be able to completely stop popup ads. In both cases, you should read the reviews of these apps online, which will help you identify whether these apps are responsible for the random pop-ups. </p>
<p> 2. System Notification Ads </p>
<p> Another form of ads that can completely plague your mobile user experience is System Notification ads. The frustrating part is these push notifications containing ads are quite prevalent even with well-reputed apps. However, the good news is the latest versions of Android (Android 5.0 Lollipop or higher) have made it pretty easy to disable these troublesome interruptions. </p>
<p> For instance, if you see any of those annoying IMDB trailer notifications, you can easily disable them by ‘long pressing’ the notification, which will open a notifications settings dialogue box that asks you whether you want to “Stop notifications” or “Keep Showing.” </p>
<p> Selecting “Stop notification” will completely mute any notification from that specific category of the app, which will stop disturbing you with unnecessary notifications on your notification bar. </p>
<p> Alternatively, go to the app info section by tapping the info icon that will take you to the app’s settings from where you can select and customize the type of notifications you want to be notified about and you can silent the rest. </p>
<p> Block Popup Ads using Ad Network Detectors </p>
<p> Another much easier way to stop popup ads on your Android device is to use ad detectors. These apps can detect the presence of advertisements in the apps and notify you about their presence. </p>
<p> Ad Detect Plugin </p>
<p> If you’re looking for something much easier with less input, then Ad Detect Plugin has got you covered. It is a free app that basically detects connections to ad networks from within the apps that are installed on your device. The app notifies you whenever any malicious ads or connection with the advertisement network is detected. </p>
<p> Here is how you can use Ad Detect Plugin on your Android device to stop popup ads: </p>
<p> From the Play store links given below, install the All-In-One Toolbox and the Ad Detect Plugin. </p>
<p> Open the All-In-One Toolbox app. </p>
<p> Tap the 3 dots near the upper right corner and tap on Ad Detect. </p>
<p> Here it lists out all the apps installed on your device and has the capability to show ads. </p>
<p> Delete all those apps that you find suspicious, or you don’t need. </p>
<p> AppBrain Ad Detector </p>
<p> It follows a similar approach to the All-in-one Toolbox in terms of ad detector. Although it can’t block apps from displaying ads, however, it can be used as a tool to identify if any unknown app is displaying ads. One can uninstall such an app from the Settings. </p>
<p> Here is how you can use AppBrain Ad Detector on your Android device: </p>
<p> Install the app from the Play Store link given below and open it. </p>
<p> Ensure that Live detection mode is turned on. </p>
<p> Tap on Show Apps. </p>
<p> Click on the app that you feel suspicious about; it will show all the details about the permissions and ad networks it uses. </p>
<p> You can then uninstall the app from Settings by searching the name on the list. </p>
<p> AdAway (Root required) </p>
<p> AdAway has the capability to block ads from running on your phone completely and prevents them from fetching over the internet. The only downside of this app is that it requires you to have root permissions to modify the system host files. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, there is not a single app out there that can compete with AdAway for blocking advertisements. Since it’s a true ad blocker, so it can’t be used to identify malicious apps that display ads; however, none of the installed apps will be able to display ads. </p>
<p> How to set up and use AdAway on your Android: </p>
<p> Download the app from the download given below and install it. </p>
<p> Open the app and grant root permissions. </p>
<p> Press check for updates. That will update the host files. </p>
<p> Once the update is done, reboot your phone and open the app again. </p>
<p> Press Enable Ad blocking. </p>
<p> You can download AdAway for Android for free from here. </p>
<p> DNS66 (non-root) </p>
<p> Unlike the apps mentioned above, DNS66 can disable ads from appearing without the need for root. The effectiveness of this app depends on how many host files you have enabled. The core working of this app is that it uses VPN to blocks ads from showing within the apps, so you can’t use a VPN app simultaneously with this app. Moreover, the app cannot be used to detect malicious apps that show ads. </p>
<p> Here is how you can use DNS66 on your Android to block ads: </p>
<p> Download apk from the F-Droid market (link is given below) and install it. </p>
<p> Open the app and swipe to the Host tab. </p>
<p> Enable hosts from the list and press the refresh icon. </p>
<p> Wait for the completion of the refreshing process of the host files. </p>
<p> Once done, tap the Start button. </p>
<p> You can download DNS66 from the F-Droid market here. </p>
<p> Block Ads that Show up in Built-in System Apps </p>
<p> Some of you might not be aware of this new breed of ads because, at the moment, it is a Xiaomi specific problem. Or, it might be possible it is visible if you are running a custom ROM. </p>
<p> While experiencing ads in your mobile’s built-in apps such as Settings, Camera, or the File Manager app is unheard of many smartphones, Xiaomi users, however, have to bear yet another intrusion in their digital eco-system by being bombarded with ads. </p>
<p> The good news is there are three possible ways to block these ads in MIUI (Xiaomi skin). </p>
<p> Change region from your Android system settings. </p>
<p> Disable ads from individual apps. </p>
<p> Revoke authorization of the MSA app. </p>
<p> And here we have a tutorial on how you can block ads using these methods: </p>
<p> Change Region of your Android Device </p>
<p> While this might not be the best method, there are chances that the region you have selected on your device shows ads. </p>
<p> What’s interesting is that it has been seen the European regions have the least number of ads displayed so you can always try that however this can be a bit negative for your network-related features such as face unlock which might not work. </p>
<p> With that being said, if you still wish to change the region, you can follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Go to the Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll to the Additional settings and tap it. </p>
<p> Tap Region and change your region to any European country. </p>
<p> Once done, restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable Ads from Apps by Revoking Authorization of the MSA App </p>
<p> That is one of the most effective methods for disabling ads in miui based ROMs; however, with every new system update, you will need to follow the steps again to keep the ads disabled. </p>
<p> Here is how you can do it: </p>
<p> If it is a system app responsible for displaying popup ads, then revoking authorization will make it unable to display ads on the system. So here is the step-by-step guide: </p>
<p> Go to the Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll to Additional settings and tap it. </p>
<p> Tap Revoke Authorization. </p>
<p> Scroll down and find MSA on the list. Toggle the switch. </p>
<p> Wait for 10 seconds and tap Revoke Authorization. </p>
<p> There is a possibility that it might not be successful in one attempt. However, if it turns out to be successful, then you will see lesser ads in the system. </p>
<p> And in case if it doesn’t then you can try other methods we have already mentioned at the beginning of this blog post to disable ads from other apps individually. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> These were all the possible annoying popup ads that you might come across while browsing the Internet or using different apps. From the sudden pop-up ads, while browsing to the extremely intrusive and random popup ads on your Android device, we have listed them all and provided possible solutions to stop popup ads. </p>

<p> Easiest Ways to Stream Kodi on Chromecast using Android </p>
<p> We have shared three ways to quickly setup, install, and stream Kodi to Chromecast using Android phone and tablet devices. </p>
<p> We have shared three ways to quickly setup, install, and stream Kodi to Chromecast using Android phone and tablet devices. </p>
<p> We have written an easy to follow step-by-step tutorial to watch Kodi on Chromecast enabled devices with Google Cast support. </p>
<p> This guide includes method to stream Kodi on Chromecast through Android devices using simple yet powerful apps like Yatse, Google Cast, and LocalCast. </p>
<p> Are you looking for a way to stream Kodi to Chromecast from Android? Or, maybe you are wondering how to install and setup Kodi on Chromecast using your Android device? If that is the case then you have come to the right place as here we are going to share with you not one but three working methods to watch Kodi on Chromecast enabled devices. </p>
<p> Chromecast is designed to receive content that is being streamed by devices that supports Google Cast technology. </p>
<p> That means you can directly stream any Kodi content available on your Android phone/tablet including movies, TV shows, pictures, and music to your Chromecast TV set using Google Cast compatible apps without any issue. </p>
<p> Also, you need to make sure that both of your devices i.e. Chromecast and Android are connected to the same WiFi network. </p>
<p> How to stream Kodi to Chromecast using Android </p>
<p> As you are aware of the nitty-gritty of Chromecast, without any further ado, we will now tell you how to cast Kodi on Chromecast via Android. </p>
<p> 1. Use LocalCast App to stream Kodi to Chromecast </p>
<p> In this method, we will use your Android device to stream any content playing on Kodi directly to the Chromecast using an app called LocalCast along with one configurations file. The requirements and procedure of this method are as follows: </p>
<p> Requirements </p>
<p> This method has four requirements: </p>
<p> Kodi app (previously known as XBMC), </p>
<p> LocalCast for Chromecast app, </p>
<p> .xml configurations file (PlayerFactoryCore.xml). Available for download here. </p>
<p> Procedure </p>
<p> Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you stream Kodi to Chromecast via Android phone/tablet: </p>
<p> First, we need to download and install all the required apps mentioned in the requirements section above. Once all the apps are installed on your Android device then proceed to the second step. </p>
<p> Now using any web browser, download the configurations PlayerFactoryCore.xml file on your Android phone/tablet. Make sure you remember the location where this file has been stored on your device because we will need to locate to that folder in the next step. In most of the cases, it would be stored in the Download folder. </p>
<p> Open ES File Explorer and tap on the Menu icon located on the top-left corner as we have highlighted in the screenshot. </p>
<p> Tap on the Settings option. </p>
<p> Under the General Settings section, you will find the Display settings option. Tap it. </p>
<p> Look for a checkbox that says, Show hidden files and then tap on it to enable the option, as highlighted in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Once hidden files are enabled, you will now need to navigate to the Download folder. It should be in your internal storage directory. Here you will find playercorefactory.xml file. </p>
<p> We need to copy this .xml file and paste it into the Kodi’s userdata directory. So to copy, simply tap and hold the file and then some new options will appear in the bottom section. Tap on the Copy option. </p>
<p> Navigate to the Kodi userdata folder. It is in the internal storage directory. You will find this folder in the following location: Android > Data > xbmc.kodi > files > .kodi Once you have found your way to the .kodi folder, then you will have to look for a folder named userdata and tap on it to enter the folder. </p>
<p> After you are in the userdata folder, tap on the Paste button. We have highlighted the paste button in the below screenshot. </p>
<p> When the .xml file has been successfully pasted, ES File Explorer will show you the following toast message that says, Copy files to “/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/org.xbmc.kodi/files/.kodi/userdata” Successfully. </p>
<p> Now, close ES File Explorer and open Kodi app on your Android device. </p>
<p> Select the content you want Kodi to stream to your Chromecast device. </p>
<p> Once the stream source has been loaded successfully, then Kodi will automatically launch LocalCast on your Android phone and ask you to select the Google Cast device from the list of available devices. </p>
<p> Tap on the Play button to start streaming your selected content from your Android phone directly to the designated Google Cast device. </p>
<p> Once streaming has been started, you will then see the following screen with basic controls including seek bar, play, pause, rewind, forward, repeat, and shuffle buttons. </p>
<p> Everything will now be displayed on the Chromecast device and you can control it from your Android phone/tablet. You can even turn off your phone’s screen and the content will continue to stream without any issue. </p>
<p> Without any doubt, it is quite simple and effective method to stream Kodi to Chromecast. </p>
<p> But there is a small problem with this method, which is you won’t be able to play Kodi content on your Android device because of that PlayerCoreFactory.xml configuration file will open all content via LocalCast. </p>
<p> 2. Use Google Cast to stream Kodi to Chromecast </p>
<p> Google Cast, which is also known as Chromecast, is a popular technology that allows you to stream your favorite content from your Android phone and tablet to your Chromecast enabled TVs and other devices. </p>
<p> Here we will be using the Google Home app to cast your phone’s screen to the Chromecast and view your content on both devices simultaneously over the local network. The requirements for this method along with the detailed tutorial are mentioned below: </p>
<p> Requirements </p>
<p> You will need to install the following two apps: </p>
<p> Kodi app, </p>
<p> Google Home app (formerly known as Google Chromecast). </p>
<p> Procedure </p>
<p> Here’s how you can make it work: </p>
<p> First, we need to download and install the required apps mentioned in the requirements section above. Once both of those apps are installed on your Android device, you can then proceed to the second step. </p>
<p> Open Google Home app and tap on the Menu button located on the top-left corner (as highlighted in the screenshot). </p>
<p> Tap on the Cast screen/audio option. </p>
<p> A prompt box will appear warning you, “Screen casting is not optimized for this device; your experience may vary”. Simply tap on OK to continue to the Chromecast section. </p>
<p> Tap on the blue Cast Screen/Audio button. </p>
<p> Google Cast will now begin searching for all the available Chromecast devices within your network. Found devices will be listed under Cast to section. </p>
<p> Tap on the device you want to start casting to and you will see that your Android phone/tablet interface is now being mirrored to the selected Chromecast TV/device. </p>
<p> You can now open Kodi app on your Android device and start playing any content. Your selected Kodi content whether it is a video, music, or picture will be displayed on both devices i.e. your Android and Chromecast. </p>
<p> It doesn’t matter whether you use Kodi or any other app, as long as Google Home’s cast screen option is enabled and connected to the Chromecast device, everything you see on your Android will continue to be displayed/mirrored on your Chromecast enabled TV or Chromecast device. </p>
<p> 3. Use Yatse app to stream Kodi to Chromecast </p>
<p> Yatse is a remote control app for Kodi but it has an additional feature that allows you to cast and stream media and other Kodi content on Chromecast and Smart TV devices. </p>
<p> The remote controlling and majority of other basic functionalities are absolutely free, however, to be able to use the cast feature to stream Kodi to Chromecast you will need to pay a one-time fee of $3.59 for Yatse Unlocker. After paying for the unlocker, apart from the cast support, you will also get offline media support, ability to use the internal player, access to advanced display settings, and 3 new themes. </p>
<p> Requirements </p>
<p> This method requires you to have two apps: </p>
<p> Kodi app, </p>
<p> Yatse app. </p>
<p> Procedure </p>
<p> Here are the steps to use Yatse to stream Kodi to Chromecast: </p>
<p> Launch Yatse and you will be greeted with the welcome screen. Tap on the Get Started button and follow the onscreen messages to make yourself familiar with the app. </p>
<p> Once you are past the welcome screen, you will then enter the Kodi detection section that basically searches for Kodi hosts within your network and shows you the list of all the available hosts. So make sure your Kodi enabled device is powered on and connected to your network. </p>
<p> All your discovered Kodi hosts will then be shown under the Detected Hosts section as shown in the screenshot below. Simply select the one you want to connect and add to the Yatse. </p>
<p> In the next phase, you will notice that the fields for IP address and web server port are filled automatically and the app will try to communicate with the host by testing connection and then add the Kodi host. </p>
<p> Once your connection with the Kodi host has been established successfully, you will then see the following screen where will see the details about the total number of movies, TV shows, and Music are stored in that specific Kodi setup. Currently, you will be in the Remote section. </p>
<p> Swiping left on the screen will close the side menu bar and show you the full view of the Remote control for Kodi. On the top-right corner, along with the power icon, you will see the Cast icon. Tap it. </p>
<p> A popup will appear with a list of the available players where you will see all the discovered players including Local, Network, and Chromecast players. Tap on the one you want to start casting. </p>
<p> You will then see a prompt telling you about non-availability of Cast feature in the free version and asking you to know more about the benefits of Yatse Unlocker by tapping the OK button. </p>
<p> Now here you will see all the benefits along with an option to purchase the unlocker via in-app purchase. So tap on the Purchase Now button. </p>
<p> A Google Play in-app payment processor popup will appear, showing you the app name and price, tap on the Continue button to purchase the Yatse Unlocker. </p>
<p> Once purchased, you will now be able to play Kodi movies and TV shows on Chromecast using the Yatse Cast feature. </p>
<p> FAQs about streaming Kodi to Chromecast </p>
<p> Here are a few frequently asked questions related to streaming Kodi to Chromecast: </p>
<p> How to install Kodi on a Chromecast? </p>
<p> For those of you who are new to Chromecast, we feel that it is important to let you know that Chromecast being a Google Cast receiver device gives you no option to install Kodi on Chromecast because it does not have any media storage capability. So you are allowed to stream only. </p>
<p> Can we install apps on Chromecast? </p>
<p> Chromecast supports quite a number of apps but you need to install those apps on your Android tablet or smartphone device and then you can use the Cast feature to directly cast whatever that is being shown on the screen and will be displayed on the Chromecast device. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> As mentioned in the beginning, you can use any of these three methods mentioned in this article to seamlessly setup, install, stream, and watch Kodi movies, TV shows, and other content to your Chromecast enabled TVs and other devices via cast feature available in the Android smartphones and tablet devices. </p>
<p> Now apart from the apps like LocalCast, Google Home (Google Cast) and Yaste, there must be several other apps available in the Google Play Store but these are the only ones we have tried to stream Kodi to Chromecast via Android. </p>

<p> Terrarium TV APK is one of the best TV shows and movies app you might be ever going to install </p>
<p> Download APK File </p>
<p> App Details & Guide </p>
<p> Terrarium TV APK is one of the best TV shows and movies app you might be ever going to install on your Android device. If you are a die-hard follower of all the trending seasons and movies and don’t intend to spend money on buying multiple subscriptions, then Terrarium TV apk is an all-in-one solution. </p>
<p> To buy a subscription for various streaming services and apps for entertainment purposes to watch original series and movie rental is always exhaustion of both sanity and hard-earned money. That’s the reason why the Terrarium TV app is designed, which is actually a unified platform that offers an uncountable collection of movies, dramas, and TV series. </p>
<p> You might be wondering what is the best part about Terrarium TV for Android? It is not just a consolidated multimedia platform; instead, it provides links to all the trending movies and series for free. One can find all the latest and current movies, TV shows, and seasons in decent quality without paying for any of them. </p>
<p> About Terrarium TV APK </p>
<p> Well, the phrase that goes by “all the best things in life are free” has been realized in reality by Terrarium TV apk for Android. </p>
<p> This renowned entertainment app provides you easy access to some of the most trending movies and series. Once the app is installed on any Android device, an entirely new world of limitless multimedia streaming options gets unlocked and made available right on your fingertips. </p>
<p> You can access all the multimedia data without providing any of your personal details. Yes, you read that right. It won’t even ask for your email ID that means no need to sign up for an account. Once the Terrarium TV is installed, you will be redirected to the home screen where all the trending movies and TV shows are displayed. </p>
<p> How Terrarium TV App Works? </p>
<p> In the Terrarium TV app, there are multiple sections like recently updated, premieres, most popular, and various other categories to make the overall search convenient for the users. There is a dedicated search bar to let you do precise searches for the desired content. </p>

<p> An exciting feature, which lacks in the majority of TV streaming apps, is the TV calendar, where you can easily see the daily schedule of TV shows and movies. Furthermore, it even allows you to download or stream the content in a suitable format and resolution. </p>
<p> In case you are wondering about the integrity of Terrarium TV for Android, then we would like to clarify that this app is actually not a multimedia streaming service provider.

<p> So the selection of servers depends completely on you and allows you to either stream or download the content. Now, for example, once you have selected a particular movie, the play button will redirect you to the server’s link menu. You are then allowed to start streaming the movie from any link you want freely. </p>
<p> Interestingly, the exact same link allows you to download the videos to be watched later without an internet connection. </p>
<p> Yes, that’s an exciting feature! </p>
<p> TerrariumTV Settings and Configuration </p>
<p> Now moving on to the settings menu, there are several options available for the users to enable/disable the suitable ones. Some of the essential settings include: </p>
<p> Select the default video player from the available options for YESPlayer, ExoPlayer, MX Player, and VLC Player. </p>
<p> It is entirely up to the user to either mark the watched videos or not. </p>
<p> Choose to filter out the non-English language shows from the list. </p>
<p> Select between watching HD links only and other low-quality videos as well. </p>
<p> Multiple options are available for default play action where one can select always ask, play, download, or stream. </p>
<p> The performance settings allow you to select the video refresh time interval. </p>
<p> Enable/disable new releases notifications to keep updated with all the latest trends. </p>
<p> Re-define the interface per your personal liking and interests. You can select either TV shows or movies as default navigation. Changes can also be made in the default category for both TV shows and movies. </p>
<p> Choose to read the details and synopses related to a particular movie or show or else entirely un-check all the boxes. </p>
<p> The font size, color, and other font styles for the subtitles can be modified. </p>
<p> It comes with the ability to create a backup of your settings. </p>

<p> 10 Best Thesis Writing Apps for Android </p>

<p> Writing a thesis involves a great deal of time, concentration, and research. Thirty years ago, working on a thesis meant spending a lot of time in a computer lab or a library. Today, the same process is a little easier, thanks to essay writing apps helping to take the edge off some tasks and save us time. </p>
<p> With the wide adoptability of Android smartphones and tablet devices, users are looking for apps that make their thesis easier to write, improve their time management, and help them to focus. </p>
<p> Here are ten of the best essay writing apps for Android: </p>
<p> Microsoft Word </p>
<p> You can’t write a thesis without a word processor. Originally a program for PCs only, Word has had many iterations and become available on just about everything someone can imagine running it, including Android. </p>
<p> Yes, there are other word-processors out there, but Word has become the most compatible and the most used. As a result, it’s simply easier to use it for writing than to go with another processor that may not be compatible with what your campus or your professor is using. </p>
<p> Any.do </p>
<p> This app, available on Android as well, is targeted at those students who want to get their thesis done, but keep finding themselves having things come up that steal valuable time from writing it. Any.do is there to help organize all of those tasks into one straightforward app. It can handle tasks and reminders. </p>
<p> Any.do also has a calendar for scheduling, which includes a daily planner. An added bonus is that this app will even keep a grocery list for you along with your favorite recipes! </p>
<p> RescueTime </p>
<p> For those who need a little more help on top of task scheduling, RescueTime is there for people who find themselves unable to keep track of time while studying, playing games, or even watching a movie. It’s also a major help to students who find themselves trying to do research or writing, but find themselves distracted by a plethora of things that tend to pop up. </p>
<p> This app specifically will keep track of the amount of time you spend on a given task. It’s also built to keep people focused and distraction-free. </p>
<p> Mindmup </p>
<p> Sometimes a thesis can seem like a monster with many legs, arms, and heads. It’s everything that fills a person’s mind that ends up leading to a clog, preventing people from getting their thoughts straight, much less able to put pen to paper and complete a project. </p>
<p> Mindmup is an app that allows a person to take those thoughts and put them down in a more logical, progressive way so that a person is able to organize all of those thoughts into a thesis. For those who aren’t sure where to begin, there’s even a tutorial for newbies! </p>
<p> Mendeley </p>
<p> This is an app specifically oriented towards scholars that helps them research their topic and develop it into a working thesis. Mendeley allows its users to create their own library, which they can access from anywhere, including their Android. </p>
<p> Mendeley can also generate references, citations, and even bibliographies for those students who could use a little time-saving help. </p>
<p> EduBirdie </p>
<p> The most challenging thing about writing a dissertation or other major project is trying to get help with it. There are plenty of apps out there that do help but finding an actual person is a bit more difficult. </p>
<p> Fortunately, there is a way out. Anyone can get a high-quality dissertation from EduBirdie, or they can edit a thesis if that’s what is needed. It also has several other resources available online for any college student that needs them. </p>
<p> WolframAlpha </p>
<p> This app is also available on Android systems. The best way to think about this software is as a comprehensive encyclopedia for just about any subject. Doesn’t that just make it into Wikipedia? Not quite. This is more like a smart Wikipedia. </p>
<p> WolframAlpha is able to compute expert-level answers to just about any question asked of it, while Wikipedia is strictly read-only. This database uses algorithms and AI software to answer even the most seemingly obscure question. </p>
<p> Paperity </p>
<p> This may not be one of the excellent dissertation writing services, but it is the best option for those students who are on a budget and can’t afford a lot of subscriptions. Even for those with cash, though, it is a great resource for inspiration from all of the scholars who came before them. </p>
<p> Paperity contains a great pool of papers, journals, essays, and even thesis that are considered to be open access across the Internet. Be reminded that these papers are readily accessible online and are, therefore, easily discovered by plagiarism checkers, so use them as a reference, but not as a quick hand-in. </p>
<p> Grammarly </p>
<p> Once that paper is done, it’s time to hand it in, right? Wrong. It still needs to be proofread, and that’s where Grammarly comes in. This does have an app available, but most people usually use the online software which a person can set up an account for. </p>
<p> Grammarly’s great thing is that there is a free proofreader available for this software, but those looking for a truly polished essay might want to get a subscription to ensure they have all the bells and whistles that come with the full version. </p>
<p> Copywritely </p>
<p> The last thing in the list of online apps to help write an essay is one that makes sure your glowing thesis has nothing out there like it in the world. Yes, we know you wrote it and that it’s unique, but many people have been surprised in the past to discover that passages or paragraphs that they wrote were a little too inspired by ones they read. They don’t mean to plagiarize, but some do so unintentionally. </p>
<p> That’s where Copywritely comes in. It checks the entire Internet to see if your text matches anyone else, even Ph.D. writing services, and that’s perfect for peace of mind. </p>

<p> TikTok APK (aka Musical.ly) </p>
<p> Table Of ContentAbout TikTok APK (Also Known As Musical.ly)A Little Background About The ReviewerWhat Is TikTok And How This App </p>
<p> Download APK File </p>
<p> Previous Version </p>
<p> App Details & Guide </p>
<p> About TikTok APK (Also Known As Musical.ly) </p>
<p> So in this digital age of social media platforms, TikTok, aka Musical.ly, is more of a stereotypical breaking approach by giving a creative and ingenious platform where users can engage themselves in making entertaining lip-synching video clips. </p>
<p> There is nothing personal on this social platform; rather, it all depends on the creativity of the users to create attention-grabbing and enjoyable video clips that have a tendency to go viral. </p>
<p> TikTok is not just limited to video creation; instead, it is also used by major corporations and brands for sponsored content and advertisement campaigns. It is important to note that this is not only popular among teens, but celebrities from the TV and film industry have their accounts too, and they enjoy posting clips on their profile. </p>
<p> The statistical data is quite astonishing too, as the app has been downloaded over one billion times, according to Sensor Tower, and is the second most downloaded app on the Google Play store. A China-based company, ByteDance Ltd., developed this app that is regarded as the most valued startups of the world among the list that includes Facebook and YouTube. </p>
<p> By the way, Tik Tok is not the only popular product by ByteDance. Instead, they have got a vast range of products that include the News Republic, Top Buzz, and of course, Musical.ly. </p>
<p> Here we have an in-depth TikTok app review for Android along with the key features and guide to help you download, install, and create TikTok account as well as how to record your first video. </p>
<p> A Little Background About The Reviewer </p>
<p> Before we begin the TikTok apk review, here is a little background about the reviewer and her perspective for various social media platforms: </p>
<p> My social media has been flooded with short humorous lip-sync clips, and I have been wondering about the app behind these videos. My search for the mastermind app landed me on the new horizons of creativity promoted among the millennials by the platform, commonly known as Tik Tok. </p>
<p> Before getting into further details of the app and how it works, let me be very open about my mindset since I am trying to discover this new app with my old Generation X frame of mind and I will discuss everything about the app in great depth the way I searched about this new sensation right from scratch. </p>
<p> I belong to the generation that has been quite contented by using Facebook and Twitter simultaneously. I was satisfied with the microblogging news that Twitter provided me, and Facebook has been serving as a primarily social platform to connect with my friends and to keep myself updated about their activities. And then, Snapchat and Instagram happened, and I had to add two more social media accounts since the “Digital Era” entered into the phase of live stories and instant life-events sharing. </p>
<p> I am fond of Instagram since it is considered a pioneer in introducing “social media influence” terminology that has created a lot of buzz in digital media and its usage. </p>
<p> What Is TikTok And How This App Gained So Much Traction? </p>
<p> So, what is the technology deployed behind TikTok that makes it so exciting and accessible among the general masses? </p>
<p> It is none other than the futuristic Artificial Intelligence (AI) that learns user’s behavior and their preferences according to their most viewed content and videos and customizes the user’s feed accordingly. </p>
<p> Tik Tok is quite a fast-paced app with multiple options and elements derived from existing social media apps like Snapchat, Spotify, and Twitch. Therefore, this new platform is an excellent combination of different platforms to provide numerous options to you so that you can express yourself by creating funny clips, duets, and memes. </p>
<p> After all the background and history of this modern app, the following is an in-depth guide compiled to get yourself familiarize with Tik Tok and its working. </p>
<p> Disclaimer: Get all your gadgets ready before downloading this full entertaining app. Keep your headphones prepared to take this musical journey with Tik Tok, and don’t forget to charge your phone batteries since once you get started, there is no way of turning back. Having a power bank by your side is a bonus. By the way, the above declaration is to enjoy Tik Tok videos. Still, if you want to be a part of the Tik Tok video-makers’ community, you need a good quality microphone along with a high-resolution camera phone. </p>
<p> In-depth Guide on TikTok APK for Android </p>
<p> You can download TikTok from the link given in this review. As soon as the app is installed, a randomly selected Tik Tok clip will start playing on the app along with all other options available on the screen. One can simply scroll down and explore different clips without signing up for an account. If you just want to browse videos, then you don’t need to create an account. </p>
<p> So, what’s the first impression of the app? </p>
<p> On the very top of the app, you will see two options, i.e., “Following” and “For You.” </p>
<p> If you are using the Tik Tok app without an account, then you can only browse through videos via the “For You” option, which displays videos by different artists that are randomly selected using the machine-learning algorithm. </p>
<p> More options are available on the lower side and lower right end. The lower side displays three information related to the video: </p>
<p> The name of the video creator, </p>
<p> Title of the clip and tagged people, </p>
<p> Background soundtrack name. </p>
<p> The lower right end contains the link to the video creator profile so that you can follow them. However, to follow anyone on TikTok, one has to create an account. The “Heart” icon shows the total likes received on any particular video, and the “Share” icon allows you to re-share the video on other social media platforms or to save the video on your device. </p>
<p> One exciting feature of Tik Tok is that if you tap and hold on the video, three options will pop-up, i.e., share, add to favorites, and not interested. All these options allow the app to learn about your likes and dislikes and customize the “For You” feed accordingly. </p>
<p> How To Signup for TikTok Account? </p>
<p> Let’s get into the details of the signing up process… </p>
<p> One has to sign up for an account to post videos, share the videos, and to follow people on Tik Tok. The signup process is quite easy, as multiple options are provided. You can log in via: </p>
<p> Email, </p>
<p> Phone number, </p>
<p> Signup using your Facebook or Twitter account. </p>
<p> Tik Tok app automatically assigns usernames once the user logs in. A personalized user ID is assigned only if the user logs in via email, and a generic username is designated if one signs up via phone number. </p>
<p> However, you are allowed to easily modify the username by clicking the personalize icon at the right bottom of the screen. It will take you to the “Edit Profile” option from where you can add/change account information like username, bio, profile photo, or video. </p>
<p> As per my experience, I signed up for TikTok using my Facebook account, and it imported my required account details from my FB account and all done. </p>
<p> And yes, regarding age restrictions, the app asks about the birthday of the user to keep a check on the minimum age limit. </p>
<p> How To Personalize Your TikTok Profile? </p>
<p> As highlighted above, TikTok allows you to personalize your profile, so now, let’s explore all the personalization options one by one… </p>
<p> Straight away, you will see an “Edit Profile” button that takes you to edit account-related information. You can change your profile photo or even upload a profile video. </p>
<p> Since I signed up for Tik Tok via Facebook account so I cannot change my username, but I can add my one-liner cool bio and can also add a link to my Instagram and YouTube accounts. Once done, hit the save button and then return to the profile menu. </p>
<p> As a new user, you are not going to have any followers or following. You have to invite people using an icon on the top left corner from where one can find contacts and Facebook friends or can send invites by sharing your Tik Tok link with your contact list. </p>
<p> One fascinating feature is “My TikCode,” which allows you to get Tik Tok followers by merely scanning the code that can be saved on your device or shared externally through other social media apps. </p>
<p> The top right corner has got all the options related to managing the account, privacy of the account, wallet, and other related policy stuff. </p>
<p> For those who don’t know, Tik Tok has been under limelight because of increasing privacy issues and is now adding more options for the users to customize their profiles accordingly. </p>
<p> Now, let’s get back to the home screen. Similar to Instagram, you are allowed to freely follow other Tik Tok users, add them to your list, send and receive messages, and can find your existing friends within the “Following” bar. </p>
<p> By now, you must have got yourself familiarized with the app’s UI and options, and have already set the stage for the most essential feature of the app that is none other video recording and sharing. </p>
<p> How To Record and Upload Videos On TikTok for Android? </p>
<p> I am really thrilled to get into the details of how to create videos on TikTok and share among your friends and other social media platforms. I hope you are excited as much as I am, so without further ado, let’s hit the “+” sign displayed right in the middle of the bottom of the app. </p>
<p> There is a wide variety of options available to make creative and engaging videos. </p>
<p> To start it off, you will find an “Add a sound” option displayed at the top from where you can add the sound before or after the video recording. There is a huge repository of soundtracks available on Tik Tok segregated based on different categories, including top trending, global pop, sports, remix, and much more. </p>
<p> You can simply select the sound effects from the list or type in the desired sound name in the search bar. If you like an audio track, Tik Tok even allows you to add it to your favorites list so that you can easily reuse it in the future. </p>
<p> There is a “Red” record button at the bottom, which gives you two options to shoot video, i.e., 50 seconds or 15 seconds. There is an option of the photo templates that can be used to upload photos. Other effects to further edit the video are available on the bottom left side. </p>
<p> There is a list of features available on the top right corner that contains the following six options: </p>
<p> Flip – Change camera from rear to front or vice versa. </p>
<p> Speed – Multiple speed options from slow-motion 0.1x to fast speed 3x the average rate. The selection of speed is all up to you. </p>
<p> Beauty – One tap beauty icon. </p>
<p> Filters – Find all kinds of filters, including portrait, life, food, and vibe. </p>
<p> Timer – The timer allows you to start recording video once the set time is over. You are permitted to select a time between zero seconds to 59 seconds, giving you ample time to adjust the camera and background. </p>
<p> Flash – If you have a good quality flash on your phone, then it is a great feature to enhance your video further. </p>
<p> By the way, one can also upload any prerecorded video from your phone and make all the modifications subsequently. </p>
<p> So what are you waiting for? Just make a video clip of yourself and get started. </p>
<p> Once you are done shooting the video, TikTok will offer you multiple options to make the clip attention-grabbing by adding effects, text, filters, and stickers. The soundtrack can also be added after shooting the video, and the volumes can be adjusted accordingly. </p>
<p> After doing all the enhancements, press the “Next” button, and you will be taken to the next screen where you can add a description to the video. </p>
<p> Here you can add all the related hashtags (similar to how we use on Instagram), tag friends, and save the video. Moreover, you can also choose to switch off the comments on the video and change the video privacy to public, private, or friends only. </p>
<p> Then the bottom screen contains several options to help you post the video on other platforms as well. </p>
<p> Bonus Tip: Numerous hashtag challenges are going on Tik Tok every once in a while where multiple users can participate and can even monetize points earned via participating in those challenges. </p>
<p> That is it, guys. We have reached the final phase, where we can now finally post our first ever video on your profile. </p>
<p> I really hope that this virtual TikTok tour and setup guide has facilitated the beginners like you to record and upload videos on your profile and become a Tik Tok Rock Star soon. </p>

<p> Zero advertisements as TVMC provides you with a direct link to stream live TV channels and your choice of favorite media in the Video-On-Demand styled interface. </p>
<p> A little Background Information about TVMC </p>
<p> Before moving forward, we feel it is important to mention here that TVMC was being managed and updated by developers over at TVAddons.ag but since after the termination of their website and services due to piracy issues the app is no longer being maintained. So it is quite possible that you will experience unexpected shutdowns and force closures while using the app due to lack of compatibility with dependencies. </p>
<p> We understand that there are certain old Android devices that might not be able to run the latest version of Kodi this is why we have included the original TVMC apk and its relevant details in this article. And regarding the workability, we have tested on our Android device and it works well. Remember that some add-ons are updated for the latest Kodi release and as a result, they are no longer compatible with this app. </p>
<p> Also, right after the initial release of TVMC APK, it was released on the official Google Play Store too for a little price of $0.99. But soon it was removed by Google due to their strict terms of service, which do not allow any app that promotes piracy. </p>
<p> Anyways, if you have newer Android device with better hardware and software compatibility then we will recommend you to go for the official Kodi build and manually set it up according to your requirements and install your favorite third-party add-ons because then you will be able to experience smoother and error-free live TV channels and movie streaming. </p>

<p> 10 Best YouTube Video Downloading Apps For Android </p>
<p> Do you want to download your favorite videos on your Android phone or tablet but you are not sure how? </p>
<p> Do you want to download your favorite videos on your Android phone or tablet but you are not sure how? Look no further as here I have tried and tested the best video downloader apps for Android to download videos. </p>
<p> It has been seen that mostly people are looking for a way to download videos on their Android phones or tablets but they don’t know about the perfect app that will help them in downloading videos from their favorite video sharing website. </p>
<p> The reason for downloading video could be many. However, according to my observations, some of the most common reasons I have come across is: </p>
<p> You want to watch the video again later when you are offline? Or, you want to send a video to your friends or relatives? Or maybe your Internet connection speed is too slow to stream the video and you want to download it first so you can enjoy it later? </p>
<p> Whatever your motive to download the video is, here I am sharing with you some of the best video downloader apps for Android that, according to my experience, make your videos downloading task easier and help you in downloading videos from any video sharing website. </p>
<p> #01 – TubeMate </p>
<p> Out of all the apps that are listed here, I can assure you that TubeMate is the best video downloader app for Android as I have been personally using it for the past two years, and the app never fails to amaze me! </p>
<p> TubeMate will allow you to download videos from almost any website where a video content is embedded, without showing you any sign of hiccup. </p>
<p> With TubeMate, you can even download YouTube videos without any issue and I believe that this is the same reason why the app is no longer available on the Google Play Store anymore. However, you can freely download it from their official website I have given below and enjoy all the outstanding features. 😉 </p>
<p> The developers behind this app make sure that it is fully compatible with every Android phone as well as tablet. And frequent updates for the app is released in order to ensure that you don’t face any error or issue while using TubeMate or downloading videos. </p>
<p> #02 – Downloader & Private Browser </p>
<p> Downloader & Private Browser have a similar capabilities as TubeMate but does not allow you to download from YouTube due to some strict legal restrictions imposed by the video sharing website. </p>
<p> Apart from that, it has a built-in browser using which you can go to any video based website and easily grab a downloadable link to the file. It provides some good download speeds, and supports pause and resume functionality too. </p>
<p> If your phone or tablet have external SD card support then you can use the settings page to select the primary location for the storage of your downloaded video files to keep the burden off from your limited internal storage. </p>
<p> There is one key point that you should note about this app. Once your download has been completed, it is required that you export that video file to your phone to be able to either see it in the Gallery or any other video player app. </p>
<p> To export your downloaded video files, you need to go to the “Files” section, tap on the “Videos” folder, then tap and hold the downloaded video file, and then tap on the “Export” button. You should now be able to see your files in the Gallery. 🙂 </p>
<p> #03 – Fastest Video Downloader </p>
<p> Fastest Video Downloader is a trustworthy and reliable video downloading app for Android. To make your downloading tasks easier, the app comes bundles with a browser, video file explorer, and download manager. </p>
<p> You can use the built-in web browser to search for the videos and websites. Once the video has been found, the video downloader will automatically detect the file and ask if you want to download it. </p>
<p> The download manager is fully capable of pausing and resuming files that are being downloaded as well as the capability to handle lost connections, depending on the website you are trying to downloading the video from. </p>
<p> And because the download manager supports multiple concurrent connections to the file server, which ensures that you get the maximum downloading speed when you are downloading videos using this app. </p>
<p> The integrated video files explorer provides you with the ability to gain complete control over the video files you have on your Android device, such as rename, delete, or move your video files to another directory. </p>
<p> #04 – Download Video: Downloader </p>
<p> Download Video: Downloader is a popular video downloading app designed for Android devices that has become personal favourite for most of the users due to its remarkable video downloading capabilities. </p>
<p> Similar to any other video downloading app, this one also includes a simple browser so that it can easily grab a download link for the video being played. </p>
<p> The notable feature of the app is that it supports MP3 music downloading too. </p>
<p> So for example, you have listened to some great music video and want to download it in the MP3 format. You will need to search for the MP3 format and it might be difficult to do so right from your Android device. However, this app will make your whole task easier as it has a capability to directly download the same video in the MP3 format. 😉 </p>
<p> #05 – Tube Video Downloader </p>
<p> Have you already tried the previous app on the list? If yes, then you will find out that this Tube Video Downloader have an identical user interface. However, it will provide you a much better video downloading section and have a much greater compatibility with video sharing websites. </p>
<p> Apart from that, the app can also download your videos in both MP4 video format as well as MP3 music format, and that too in an enhanced and enriched audio and video quality. </p>
<p> If you are one of those users who prefer to use single app to watch and download videos and music then this app should be your best bet. </p>
<p> #06 – Tube Video Downloader </p>
<p> No. This is not a similar app as before. Even though the names are same but both are developed by completely different developers. To me, it seems like the developers behind this Tube Video Downloader has managed to slightly improve the interface to make it more user friendly. </p>
<p> And not only has the interface been improved, the implementation of pausing and resuming functionality into the download manager makes it more useful if you have an unstable Internet connectivity. This feature is exactly what was missing in the previous app. </p>
<p> Other than polishing the interface and adding those two praiseworthy functionalities, the developer has managed to make sure that the videos are easily downloadable from the major video sharing sites. </p>
<p> #07 – Download Video App for Android </p>
<p> Previously known as MP4 Video Downloader, it is a popular video downloading app for Android that let you download MP4 format videos effortlessly. For those of you who are not aware, a while ago the developer has decided to change the name to Download Video App for Android. </p>
<p> To download videos you have two options, you can either enter the video URL manually or browse the video websites use its central web browser system which will allow the download manager to grab the video file right from the website and begin the downloading process. </p>
<p> If you have any favourite video sharing website from where you frequently download videos then you can add that website to the favourites using a bookmark option right from the integrated web browser so that you can access that website within seconds. </p>
<p> #08 – AVD (Android Video Downloader) </p>
<p> AVD Download Video (Android Video Downloader) app that was once known as Video Catcher is popular app among the Android users who frequently download videos that are shared on the Internet. </p>
<p> Similar to any other popular app, you will find a browser in the AVD app too! This will help you in finding your favourite videos without any hassle of using other web browser to copy the URL and then paste on the app. AVD includes everything in one place so that you can save your time and easily find your favourite videos on the Internet. </p>

The app is being actively used by more than 10 million Android users to download their favourite videos from the Internet. </p>
<p> The developers has specifically designed this app in such a way that you don’t need to copy and paste the URL of the video you want to download. </p>
<p> They have eliminated this procedure and made the whole video downloading task easier by using a native web browser that automatically detects the video being played and then prompts you to download the file in your desired resolution. </p>
<p> #10 – SnapTube </p>
<p> Remember that TubeMate app I mentioned in the first position of this list? SnapTube is similar to that but provides a lot of customizations and large number of additional features that you might not find in any other video downloading app. </p>
<p> Trusted by millions of users around the world, and the easy to use UI, support for almost all of the major video and audio sharing social media websites, fast download mode, and an inbuilt download manager is what makes SnapTube one of the best video downloader apps for Android. </p>

<p> Since SnapTube supports downloading videos from YouTube, which is the reason why it has been removed from the Google Play Store due to the strict YouTube terms and policies against all the video downloading apps. </p>

<p> VLC for Android apk download for Android to get a reliable and good video player to play videos and clips </p>
<p> Download APK File </p>
<p> Previous Versions </p>
<p> App Details & Guide </p>
<p> VLC for Android apk download for Android to get a reliable and good video player to play videos and clips on your Android devices. We will recommend you install the VLC Media Player app that supports playback of almost all types of audio and video file formats. </p>
<p> About VLC for Android APK </p>
<p> VLC for Android was first developed for Windows and Mac OS and was then made cross-platform by making apps for Android as well as the iOS operating system. It is a free and open-source media player for almost all portable devices. </p>
<p> VLC Media Player is one of the most versatile and widely used media players available out there. The app is comparatively easy to use as compared to other similar media players for Android. </p>
<p> One of the most useful features of VLC apk is its wide range of file support. It supports almost all types of audio and video file formats that come in handy when you want to watch a movie or listen to some music right on the go. </p>
<p> Key Features of VLC for Android </p>
<p> After one of its latest updates, it has got some more features added into it that are particularly useful when you want to watch movies. Some of its newly added features are: </p>
<p> Video Playlist – Previously, there was only the audio playlist on the menu, but after the release of the latest update, developers added a similar tab for all video files. </p>
<p> Online Streaming – We can now stream specific supported files through VLC Player. </p>
<p> Automatic Subtitles – The player can now find available subtitles automatically for your videos and movies, and you can change the font and styling of characters as well. </p>
<p> Window Mode – Developers have added Window Mode in the latest update that you can use to view your videos on top of another app like a picture-in-picture style. </p>
<p> As far as the User Interface is concerned, VLC Media Player is easy to use, and the options are pretty much self-explanatory. </p>
<p> The Video Tab </p>
<p> When you first open the app, you are greeted with some permissions and a walkthrough of the app. Once you hit the done button, it takes you to the app itself. You will be in the Video tab whenever you open the app, which is located at the top in the hamburger menu. </p>
<p> When you open the app for the first time, it is going to show you a notification that it is parsing all the files, which means that VLC Media Player is looking for all the videos available on your Android device. Give it a second or two, and it is going to show you all the videos you have on your device along with their names as well as folder names if they are in a folder, respectively. </p>
<p> Once the list has been populated, you can start watching any video you want just by tapping on any video from the list, and VLC Media Player is going to starting playing. On your first video playback, the app will give you a brief knowledge about what all the different gestures and buttons will do and how you can use each video player feature. </p>
<p> The Audio Tab </p>
<p> Now, if you tap on the hamburger menu button again, the second tab that you will see is the Audio tab, which is no different from the previously discussed video tab. In this tab, you are going to find all the audio and music files you have on your Android device along with their specific names on the top. </p>
<p> Under the search button, there are four options to help you find, organize, and sort all of your audio files. And the possibilities are artists, albums, tracks, and genre. </p>
<p> Artists – This is going to sort the audio files according to the name of the artists. </p>
<p> Albums – Sort all the audio files according to the name of its respective album. </p>
<p> Tracks – Show you all the music tracks according to their names in alphabetical order. </p>
<p> Genre – This will help you sort the audio respective of its type. </p>
<p> Now, if we come back to the hamburger menu, the next tab that you’ll see is the playlists tab, which is going to show all of your playlists that you’ve made previously and are going to make in the future. </p>
<p> Coming back to the menu again, the next marker that you’ll see it the directories tab. Here you’ll see all of your storage directories where your video and audio files are located. It also gives brief information about what is in that specific directory. </p>
<p> The next thing in the hamburger menu is the Local Network tab. All of your local networks, such as your laptop, your PC, and other devices that you’ve connected your device to previously will be displayed here. </p>
<p> After that, there are two more tabs, namely, Stream and History. The Stream tab is for streaming some movies or videos, and the history tab shows you all the media you’ve played on VLC Player before. </p>
<p> The Settings and Personalization Menu </p>
<p> In the hamburger menu, in the end, we have a Settings tab where you can tweak all the settings for VLC Media Player. Under the settings tab, you will find numerous other options, and we have discussed those below. </p>
<p> The first section is for Media Library, and two options come under it, i.e., Media Library Folder and Auto rescan. </p>
<p> Media Library Folder – Here, you can specify which directories you want to include in the media library during the scan. </p>
<p> Auto rescan checkbox – This is checked by default. This option instructs if the app should scan your specified directories for any new media files every time you launch the app. </p>
<p> The second section is for video. You are going to find three options, and each of them is explained below: </p>
<p> Background/PiP Mode – This tells VLC Media Player about what it should do if you switch to other apps while watching a video on VLC. It can either stop the video, play video in background or play videos in Picture-in-picture mode. </p>
<p> Hardware Acceleration – This option comes handy when your device is not running smoothly while using VLC Media Player or when you want to increase the performance of the player. </p>
<p> Video Screen Orientation – It instructs the app about the orientation you want it to keep when you play a video. There are four options to choose from, i.e., Automatic, which uses the gyro sensor of your device for screen orientation, locked at the start, landscape, and portrait. </p>
<p> The third section is for history, which is a Playback history and is enabled by default. You can uncheck the box if you don’t want VLC to save the history of what was played. </p>
<p> Then there is the last section for Extra Settings. That includes settings related to Interface, Video, Subtitles, Audio, Casting, and Advanced. </p>
<p> VLC Media Player Interface Settings </p>
<p> You can use the Interface settings menu to tweak the interface and appearance of the media player. If we go through the settings one by one, you’ll see that you can tweak a lot of things according to your liking. </p>
<p> DayNight Mode – Used to turn the interface to the dark mode or light mode, according to your liking. </p>
<p> Android TV Interface – A checkbox that you can enable when you use this app on your smart TV. </p>
<p> Save Playback Speed – When checked, plays the video at the same speed that you set during your last playback. </p>
<p> Locale – This is where you can change the language of the app. There are hundreds of languages to choose from, which makes it easier for every user to understand and use this app fully. </p>
<p> Resume Playback after a Call – Checkbox, which is checked by default. If you uncheck it, it is going to pause the video after your phone call ends rather than continuing to play the video. </p>
<p> Show all files in Browser – Shows all the files in browsers that it recognizes other than video and audio files. </p>
<p> Blurred Cover Background – Blurs the cover photo of your music files while playing it. </p>
<p> Video Settings </p>
<p> If you look inside the Video setting option, you will see a lot more options that you can use to personalize the video related settings for VLC Player according to your liking. For example, seeking options, support for different gestures, audio boost, and other customizations related to the video player. </p>
<p> Subtitle Settings </p>
<p> When you tap on the Subtitle option, here, you will see some options to customize the appearance of subtitles. The customizable settings include the size of the subtitles, subtitles color, if the subtitles should have a background and if it should be in a bold look. And there an option at the top for autoloading subtitles, which is enabled by default. That will automatically load subtitles if the VLC player finds it. </p>
<p> Audio Settings </p>
<p> The Audio menu gives you some advanced options to further customize the audio playback settings for VLC Media Player. You can personalize it as you per your personal preference, just as you did for the video options. </p>
<p> For example, you can change if it should display the music cover on the lock screen or not if it should show all the names of the artists, advanced audio output settings, and some other settings similar to that. </p>
<p> Casting Settings for VLC Media Player </p>
<p> Casting Settings is where you can enable or disable wireless casting as well as audio passthrough along with the settings for conversion quality, which is applicable when you are casting on a remote screen. </p>
<p> Advanced Settings </p>
<p> The advanced settings menu is where you can further personalize the advanced aspects of the VLC Media Player as per your usage. You might be running into some bugs during playback, and that is where you can tweak some advanced settings and make some performance modifications. </p>
<p> The Overall Usability of VLC Media Player </p>
<p> Now, as far as the UI and UX of the VLC Media Player for Android are concerned, it is really simple to use for audio and video playback. To control the essential aspects of music and video while playing, you can use simple gestures, which makes the interface very simplified. </p>
<p> Some of the gestures that you can use to control the player are: </p>
<p> Swiping left and right to seek through the video, </p>
<p> Scrolling up and down on the left side of the screen to change the brightness, </p>
<p> Scrolling up and down on the right side of the screen to increase or decrease the volume, </p>
<p> While seeking through the video, you can use a swipe up gesture on the screen to make the seeking slower and precise. </p>

<p> Best Kodi Addons for Movies & TV Shows </p>
<p> Here are some of the famous and working Kodi add-ons that will let you watch movies and TV shows on your Kodi setup for free: </p>
<p> Tempest </p>
<p> Tempest is a brand new Kodi addon and currently one of the most up to date Kodi addons for movies and TV shows, which supports native integration for movie tracking services like Trakt. They have a huge database where you can easily find all the old and new movies & TV show titles and even IPTV channels. </p>
<p> For those of you who have previously used other addons like Covenant or Exodus, then you are going to find Tempest very much similar to those addons as they seem to be like their fork. Regardless of the similarities, this Kodi addon is quick to find and fetch working streams. </p>
<p> FEN </p>
<p> FEN is a recently released movie and TV show Kodi addon that has managed to gain a lot of popularity among the users because it provides you with working streaming links for all the new as well as old shows and movies. </p>
<p> Since the addon is hosted on the Tikipeter repository, so it uses its very own movies and TV shows links scraping technique known as Tiki Scrapper. Which apparently is a lot more powerful in fetching links as compared to the scrappers found in other Kodi addons. </p>
<p> The Magic Dragon </p>
<p> The Magic Dragon Kodi addon offers you a wide range of TV shows and movies for a never-ending round of entertainment, which is exactly how this addon managed to claim one of the top positions for best Kodi addons for movies and TV shows. </p>
<p> For those of you who are wondering, the Magic Dragon addon is hosted on Kodi Diamond build repo and can be quickly installed. It has become the go-to addon for the majority of Kodi users from all around the world to consume the latest shows and movies. </p>
<p> The Crew </p>
<p> Being one of the newest additions to the Kodi addon list, The Crew has managed to become one of the most favorite movies and TV shows addon for Kodi users because it offers additional content like cartoons, sports, IPTV, and a lot of entertainment-related content. </p>
<p> The addon is proudly hosted by The Team Crew on the GitHub repository and can be easily downloaded on your Kodi device by going to the repo link given below. The Crew addon features a huge library of popular and old as well as latest movies and TV shows available in high definition and ultra HD quality. </p>
<p> Venom </p>
<p> The Venom Kodi addon to watch movies on Kodi was recently released to compete with other existing well-known addons like Covenant and Exodus. And now this addon has become really popular among the community who loves to watch movies and TV shows on their Kodi setup. </p>
<p> Venom is a powerful and feature-rich Kodi addon for movies as it allows you to filter out the content and movies or TV shows title based on rating, popularity or genre. In case you are wondering, this addon uses Lambda scraper to scan for streaming movie links from a wide range of reputable sources. </p>
<p> Exodus </p>
<p> Believe it or not, Exodus is one of those addons which comes in the mind of everyone who is looking for a way to watch and stream movies and TV shows for free on their Kodi devices. The addon was previously shutdown which kind of forcing users to switch to other addons and look for alternatives, but it has since been revived from scratch by a new developer. </p>
<p> Exodus has been one of the most reliable and best Kodi addon for movies and TV shows. The content and links are usually updated with new streaming links, but they are not always reliable. But since the addon is still working so, we have included this in our list. </p>
<p> Exodus Redux </p>
<p> Exodus Redux is a fork of the popular and original Exodus addon that we have already discussed and detailed above. However, this clone is updated more frequently and with the latest Web scrapers, since a totally different development team is managing it so you will be able to find a wider range of movies, TV shows, documentaries, cartoons and whatnot. </p>
<p> Although the name looks identical to an existing addon but there is a lot of difference in the user interface and usability. The best feature is the availability of movies and TV shows in various video resolution and quality, including some 4K, 1080p, and 720p. </p>
<p> Covenant </p>
<p> Covenant addon is developed by Lambda. If you have heard about Exodus or have previously used the Exodus addon, then you will find Covenant the exact similar of that addon because it is a successor and an official fork of Exodus that’s why it uses the same user interface and offers identical features. </p>
<p> Similar to Exodus, this addon was abandoned by its developer but recently, it has been revived and it has become better than ever before as you can find original movies, TV shows, films, cartoons, and even documentaries. </p>
<p> Incursion </p>
<p> Incursion is a popular Kodi addon that lets you stream an endless number of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and a variety of video content. It is a clone of Covenant addon but it is well maintained, consistently updated, and developed more frequently with the latest movies and video content. </p>
<p> Neptune Rising </p>

<p> Installing Kodi on Android </p>
<p> There are a couple of ways you can install Kodi on your Android phone and tablet devices. If you have already installed Kodi, then skip this section and head over to the next section. </p>
<p> Method 1 – Install Kodi via Google Play Store </p>
<p> If you have Google Play Store on your Android device then this is by far one of the most reliable and straightforward ways to install Kodi on Android. This method will give you stable releases and always keeps your Kodi up to date via the Google Play app. </p>

<p> On your Android device, launch Google Play and search for Kodi. Or, you can tap on the following link to download and install Kodi on your phone/tablet. </p>
<p> Now tap on the Install button, and Google Play will automatically download and install the right version (ARM/x86) of Kodi on your Android device. </p>
<p> Once installed, a shortcut to the Kodi icon should appear on the home screen. </p>
<p> You can now head over to the next section, where we will guide you on how to watch movies for free on Kodi by installing an add-on. </p>
<p> Method 2 – Manually install Kodi via APK </p>
<p> In case your Android device doesn’t have Google Play or you simply want to sideload Kodi on your device, then the steps mentioned in this method will help you with the manual installation of Kodi via apk file. </p>
<p> Once downloaded, open the apk file to begin the installation process. </p>
<p> You will see the following security warning about the blocked installation of apps obtained from unknown sources. Tap on Settings to continue. </p>
<p> Scroll down and tap on Unknown sources to enable the installation. </p>

<p> How to watch movies on Kodi for free? </p>
<p> In this section, we will guide you about how you can watch and stream movies for free on Kodi by using an add-on. </p>
<p> Before we install an addon on Kodi, we first need to enable Unknown Sources. Similar to how the installation of third-party apps is disabled on Android, Kodi blocks the installation of add-ons by default. And you need to enable it once only, and then you can install whatever addon you want. </p>
<p> How to enable Unknown Sources on Kodi </p>
<p> Here’s a guide on how to enable Unknown Sources on Kodi: </p>
<p> On your Android device, launch Kodi. </p>
<p> Tap on Settings (cog icon). </p>
<p> Tap on System settings. </p>
<p> Now, from the sidebar, tap on Add-ons and then tap on Unknown sources toggle button. </p>
<p> A warning popup will appear asking if you want to allow installation of add-ons from unknown sources. Tap on Yes to proceed. </p>
<p> How to install Kodi addon to watch movies and TV shows </p>
<p> Once unknown sources are enabled, we will now install an add-on to watch movies for free on Kodi. The step-by-step guide on how to install the addon on Kodi are as follows: </p>
<p> Open Kodi on your Android device. </p>
<p> Tap on Settings (cog icon). </p>
<p> Tap on the File Manager option. </p>
<p> Tap on Add source, as highlighted in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Under “Enter the paths” section, tap on <None>. </p>
<p> In the provided box, type any of the repository URL we have provided in the list above. Example: http://addons4kodi.site and make sure the repo address is entered properly without any typo then tap OK. </p>
<p> Now there’s another box, as highlighted in the screenshot, where you can enter a name for the media source. Tap on it. </p>
<p> In the provided box, type the name of repository. For example: Incursion and tap on OK button. </p>
<p> Once the source URL and source name have been entered successfully, tap on OK to continue. </p>
<p> You should now see a new link to Incursion in the File manager. </p>
<p> Now go back to the Kodi home screen and from the sidebar options tap on Add-ons. </p>
<p> Over the top left corner, you will see an Open Box/Add-on browser icon. Tap on it. </p>
<p> Tap on Install from zip file option. </p>
<p> A popup menu will appear, tap on Incursion (it’s the same source file that we added earlier in step 8). </p>
<p> Tap on the repository. </p>
<p> Tap on repository.incursion. </p>
<p> Tap on repository-0.0.3.zip. </p>
<p> The installation of repository add-on will begin and once it has been successfully installed, you will see an Add-on updated popup notification appear on the top-right corner as shown in the screenshot below. </p>
<p> Tap on Incursion Repository. </p>
<p> Tap on Video Add-ons. </p>
<p> Tap on Incursion. </p>
<p> Once the add-on has been successfully installed, an Add-on installed popup notification will appear in the top-right corner. </p>
<p> You can now head over to the Add-ons and then Video add-ons section on your Kodi to launch Incursion add-on. And enjoy all the old and latest movies as well as films for free on Kodi. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>

<p> 4 Ways to Watch Movies Online on Android with Best Movies Apps </p>
<p> Smartphones add a lot of flexibility to the way people work, live, and consume entertainment. The screen may be smaller, </p>
<p> Smartphones add a lot of flexibility to the way people work, live, and consume entertainment. The screen may be smaller, but the impact is still big. This guide explains the different ways to watch movies and series using Android. </p>
<p> There’s no doubt that television is still hugely popular, but not everyone wants to sit in front of the TV. Plus, sometimes it’s occupied by someone else, watching the shows they want to watch. This is where Android comes to the rescue, along with different apps and their vast libraries of shows and movies. </p>
<p> The 4 Ways to Watch Movies With Android </p>
<p> Never say that Android users lack options because there are a few different ways to access movies with this OS. The four main ways are outlined here, though again, more options open up depending on a person’s choice. For instance, there’s a legion of streaming apps to wade through if an Android user decides to download one from an app store. But more on that below. First up, here’s how to access movies and series via Android. </p>
<p> Buy/Rent Movies Through the Google Play Movies & TV App </p>
<p> Google has a movie buying and renting app that’s set up in a similar way to the Google Play Store. It contains a massive library of old and new content that Android users can get access to at any time. </p>
<p> The Google Play Movies & TV app is super simple to use, too, just log in with a Google account where a payment method has been set up and start browsing. The latest releases always show up at the top, and there’s also a recommended list based on previous watches. Users can watch any content they rent through this app for 24 hours. </p>
<p> Watch With Android Streaming Apps </p>
<p> The Google Play Store has a long list of content streaming apps available for download. Some are free, while others are paid. A portion of the free apps offers a limited library with the option to upgrade to a paid version for access to the full library. Other free apps provide a large library of old and new content, though the legality of these apps greatly varies. </p>
<p> 8 Best Free and Paid Movie Apps for Android </p>
<p> These are some of the best apps currently out there with which you can watch movies and TV series on any Android device. Many of these apps also support other devices like the Roku or Amazon Fire TV. </p>
<p> 1. Popcorn Time </p>
<p> This app works great with Android because it has that classic simple scroll interface with left-hand menu setup. Besides the clean UI, Popcorn Time is popular with Android users all over the world because it relies on torrent files for its content. This means that there’s an extensive library of movies and series to choose from. Plus, no extra torrenting software is needed for it to work. </p>
<p> Download Popcorn Time APK — Free </p>
<p> 2. Netflix </p>
<p> A list like this wouldn’t be complete without this streaming giant. Netflix has been around for a long time, and the quality of their content grows every day, along with their library size. Unfortunately, as is the case with most legal streaming sites, different regions get access to different content. This can be overcome by getting a VPN for Android. But, honestly, it’ll take a while to get through all the content already on offer. </p>
<p> 3. Amazon Prime Video </p>
<p> Amazon Prime Video hasn’t been around for as long as Netflix has, but it has gained a lot of support since its launch. Thanks to the massive backing behind it, Amazon Prime Video has launched many quality shows of its own and boasts an impressive library. The app isn’t available everywhere yet, but new countries are added to the list every year. </p>
<p> 4. Showbox </p>
<p> If any one app could be called the most popular free streaming app, then it would be this one. That title is bestowed unto Showbox thanks to its massive library of content and easy interface. The app doesn’t require its users to sign up, it doesn’t contain annoying ads, and it supports HD quality content. </p>
<p> 5. Hulu </p>
<p> Hulu sets itself apart from many other subscription-based streaming sites by offering both on-demand series and movies, as well as live TV. Right now, this service is only open to those living in the US. However, it offers a sizeable library and a very user-friendly UI to those who can access it. </p>
<p> 6. Sony Crackle </p>
<p> This is a Sony Entertainment app, but they’ve also partnered with a few other production houses. So the content isn’t just limited to Sony Pictures movies. Sony Crackle is a great and legal way to watch free movies on Android. The only downside here is that there is a ton of advertisements that cannot be skipped – be prepared for that. </p>
<p> 7. Tubi TV </p>
<p> If diversity is a dealbreaker, then there’s no better option than Tubi TV. Not only does the app contain popular movies and television shows, but it also hosts an eclectic collection of content. There’s a bit of everything to be found here, from British documentaries to Korean dramas. </p>
<p> 8. Terrarium TV </p>
<p> If torrents are out (it’s risky in some countries), then Terrarium TV is the best free alternative to apps like Showbox and Popcorn Time. The app doesn’t rely on torrents to deliver content but hosts all of its movies and shows on cloud servers. On top of that, Terrarium TV boasts a very clean UI and an extensive library of content. In fact, the creators claim that the collection has grown to over 10,000 shows and movies, some of which even come in 4K quality. </p>
<p> Download Terrarium TV APK from https://terrariumtv.co — Free </p>
<p> Watch Movies on YouTube </p>
<p> Watching movies or series episodes via YouTube isn’t always the most reliable option, but it’s still worth mentioning in the list of options to watch movies online. Many people upload full movies or episodes onto the platform, but these videos often get reported and taken down. There’s a chance that someone will be able to catch a movie they have wanted to see on the video-sharing platform before it’s taken down. </p>
<p> Present-day content aside, there is a whole collection of older movies and series that’s been uploaded onto YouTube. These usually don’t get taken down, either because the copyrights have expired or the creators don’t care enough to flag the videos. </p>
<p> Download from Torrent & Transfer to your Phone </p>
<p> This method isn’t strictly “online” as it can be done entirely offline. People can download movies straight onto their phones, but it’s usually easier and quicker to move them through a computer. </p>
<p> There are a couple of ways to go about this, but most people use torrenting programs to download movies or series they want to watch. Just keep in mind that it is illegal for a person to download anything they don’t already own. </p>
<p> After the download is finished, the computer and smartphone can be connected via either a cable or Bluetooth if the PC supports that. The files can then be transferred to the phone and stored in the internal storage or an external SD card if one is installed. </p>
<p> Always Put Mobile Security First </p>
<p> Despite the convenience that comes with using apps for movie streaming, there are many pitfalls to watch out for before opting to watch movies and TV shows online on your Android device. </p>
<p> Due to the demand for streaming apps, many fake or malicious movie streaming apps keep popping up. It can be tough to differentiate between a legitimate app and malware. Especially with the less than legal ones. So many people get tricked into downloading an app that will violate their privacy or safety. These apps may even work as intended, making them none the wiser for a good while. </p>
<p> On the flip side of that dangerous coin are the relatively common safety risks posed by reputable apps. Their developers aren’t out to “get” those who download their apps, but they aren’t doing all they can to ensure the safety of their apps either. Hackers take advantage of the security holes opened up by these insecure apps to infect phones with their malware. Or, as often happens, they simply hack into the app and get access to everything the app has access to. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there’s no foolproof way of knowing whether an app is safe to use or not. But there are a few things a person can do to lower their risk of becoming a victim: </p>
<p> Check all the app permissions and deny any permission access that seems irrelevant to the app’s function. </p>
<p> Activate two-factor authentication on any account that has access to sensitive information, like credit card details. </p>
<p> Download and install any good VPN for Android like Nord VPN, which you can download from here. This will protect the phone’s internet connection from outsiders latching on. </p>
<p> Stick to reputable app stores like Google Play and stay away from any third party app stores. </p>
<p> A Final Word </p>
<p> There’s a wide variety of options available to Android users who want to watch movies and shows online. Whether they prefer buying, renting, subscribing to a service, or getting free content —there’s something for everyone. </p>
<p> Yet, as always, the term “free” comes with a price. Getting movies and series for free may seem like a bargain, but those who create these apps need something in return. Yes, advertisements can be a big incentive, but so is the identity or credit card theft. So be sure to take precautions when downloading any new apps, especially if they’re free. </p>

<p> How to use Google Maps & Waze Offline to save Internet Data? </p>
<p> Are you looking for a way to use Waze and Google Maps offline to save Internet data or maybe you </p>
<p> Are you looking for a way to use Waze and Google Maps offline to save Internet data or maybe you want to have access to maps even when there is no network connection? Look no further as here we have a complete step-by-step tutorial that will help you download maps and use navigation apps on your Android device to save mobile data bandwidth. </p>
<p> Believe it or not, the continued advancement in smartphones, mobile operating systems, innovative navigation apps (like Waze & Google Maps) as well as the implementation of GPS into mobile phone devices has completely eliminated the need for traditional GPS devices. What’s more interesting is that these navigational apps provide turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic updates. </p>
<p> However, these navigation apps require you to have active Wi-Fi or data connection, which is used to download maps, road data, nearby POI and get real-time traffic updates as you drive to your destination. </p>
<p> Since these apps are dependent on the Internet connectivity, what would you do if you lost the Internet connectivity or reached your mobile data bandwidth limit while traveling? How would you reach your destination without directions? </p>
<p> Don’t worry as here we are going to share with you the technique you can try right now to use Waze and Google Maps offline, which will not only help you with your day-to-day commute but you will save a significant amount of data too. </p>
<p> How can you use Waze offline? </p>
<p> Even though Waze does not offer any built-in map downloading or offline maps option but there is a workaround that allows you to use Waze as offline, even when you don’t have any Internet connectivity. </p>
<p> However, this loophole to use Waze offline comes at a price. Without an active Internet connection, the navigation app will not be able to provide you with an updated traffic data and updates for your selected route. </p>
<p> Now that we have explained about the teeny-weeny drawback of Waze offline, let’s head straight to the steps on how to use Waze offline: </p>
<p> Launch Waze app on your Android device and tap on the Search icon located at the bottom-left corner. </p>
<p> Tap on the Settings icon located at the top-left corner. </p>
<p> Under the Advanced settings, you will find Display & map Tap it. </p>
<p> Tap on the Data transfer. </p>
<p> Make sure the option Download traffic info is enabled. </p>
<p> Now go back to the Waze home screen and using the search bar enter the address of the location where you want to go. </p>
<p> Depending on the starting point and ending point, the app will create a route and show it to you. You can add multiple stops too. Once the route has been configured, it will be remain stored in the app’s cache memory until you close the app. </p>
<p> You can now follow the route and view the map until you reach your destination. But keep in mind that the traffic data will not be updated anymore unless your device connects to the Internet. </p>
<p> How can you use Google Maps offline? </p>
<p> There are two possible ways to use Google Maps offline and we are going to discuss each one of them below. </p>
<p> But before we jump onto the guide, we find it important to tell you that Google’s offline maps feature will allow you to save the maximum of twenty maps at any given time and each offline map has a validity of thirty days, after which it expires and requires an update. </p>
<p> Google offline maps feature is designed to automatically update the expiring map area whenever your device has an active WiFi Internet connectivity. In case your device is not connected to the Internet during this period or Google Maps is unable to update the offline map automatically, then you will receive a notification about expiring map asking you to manually update them. </p>
<p> Method 1: Using search functionality </p>
<p> In this method, we will be using the Google Maps search functionality to save our searched location and its surrounding areas as offline on our Android device. </p>
<p> On your Android device, launch Google Maps app. If prompted, then sign in using your Google account. </p>
<p> Tap on the search bar located at the top and enter the name of the place you are planning to visit. For illustration purposes, I am going to search for “Fallsview Tourist Area”. </p>
<p> Maps will now drop a pin right at the searched place and show you a little box at the bottom. Tap on the More Info button. </p>
<p> You will see all the detailed information about the place you searched along with some prominent buttons like save, share, website, and download. Tap on the Download button. </p>
<p> A new window will appear that will ask you “Download a map of this area?” (As shown in the screenshot) and the blue box will show you the area that would be saved for offline usage. </p>
<p> Depending on your requirements, you are allowed to further fine-tune the download area by dragging and using multi-touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom. Once you are satisfied with the selection, tap on the Download button. </p>
<p> A download notification will appear in the notification area that shows you the downloading status of offline maps. It will take a while to complete the downloading process. </p>
<p> Once downloads are completed, you can now visit this saved offline area and continue to receive driving directions even when you are offline due to slow or lack of Internet connectivity and reach your destination without worrying. </p>
<p> Method 2 (alternative): Using offline maps option </p>
<p> This is an alternative method where we will be using the dedicated offline maps option in the Google Maps app to save an area for offline usage. </p>
<p> Launch Google Maps app and, if prompted, then sign in using your Google account. </p>
<p> Tap on the Menu button located at the top-left corner. </p>
<p> A side menu bar will open. From here, tap on the Offline maps option. </p>
<p> Here you will find all the downloaded maps available as offline along with an option to download new maps and save them offline. To add new location as offline, tap on the Select your own map button. </p>
<p> You can now scroll to virtually any part of the world and save the area as offline by tapping on the Download. For guidance, the estimated required space for selected map area will also be shown at the bottom. </p>
<p> Now a notification about the download status of offline maps will appear in the notification area and will also be shown in the Offline maps section. Depending on your Internet connection speed, it will take a while to complete the process. </p>
<p> Once downloading has been completed, then you can safely visit the selected area and receive driving directions even when you have intermittent Internet connectivity. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Without any doubt, Google Maps and Waze are some of the best feature-rich maps and navigation apps for Android devices that are available for free. And with the help of this perfect option that let you use the maps offline to save mobile data and don’t even require you to keep the data connection enabled all the time. This not only saves Internet data but also helps you save your phone’s battery power. </p>

<p> Even though the weather conditions on the radar is shown as animation but it seems to perform smoothly without any lag at all.

<p> NOAA weather radar and alerts is a free app that allows you to check the detailed weather conditions of your location in real-time on an interactive map.

<p> The homescreen widgets are sometimes unable to fetch weather updates after recent updates. </p>
<p> Subscription based and will cost you about $2.99 for a whole year of up-to-date weather service. </p>
<p> 14. Arcus Weather </p>
<p> If you really liked the Dark Sky app but you are not satisfied with their subscription-based charging structure then you will love Arcus Weather because both offers almost identical hyper-local weather forecast service and it works somewhat similar to the Dark Sky as it uses Forecast.io API as their data source. </p>

<p> In the conclusion, I would say that there are many factors that you must need to consider before picking out the most suitable weather app because the accuracy and forecast details highly vary between different geographical locations. </p>
<p> If you ask me, I like AccuWeather because of its ease of usage and especially I love their RealFeel temperature index, which is pretty accurate most of the time. Apart from that, I sometimes use Weather Underground too. </p>
<p> Have you tried any weather apps mentioned in this article? Which one is your most preferred? What do you like about that particular weather app? Let me know in the comments section below. 🙂 </p>
<p> This blog is informative. But If you are looking for Indian weather app then I suggest one app that is Prkruti app. And this app helps to identify the pureness of the air. It can be used for AQI calculation, Air quality index by city. </p>

<p> WhatsApp Messenger APK Tablet/Phone </p>
<p> Are you looking to download a communication app that provides end-to-end encryption and allows you to stay in touch with </p>
<p> Download APK File </p>
<p> App Details & Guide </p>
<p> Are you looking to download a communication app that provides end-to-end encryption and allows you to stay in touch with all of your friends and relatives around the world without any charges? Simply download WhatsApp APK for Android tablet and phone from the link below and you are good to go. </p>
<p> About WhatsApp APK </p>
<p> WhatsApp is one of the most popular and widely used communication apps by people from all around the world as it is a cross-platform mobile messaging app. It has a native support for a variety of communication channels i.e. messaging, voice messages, video chatting, and audio chatting. </p>
<p> That is not all. You can even send and receive multimedia files like documents, photos, and videos directly with your contacts, without any limitations. </p>
<p> You can also create personalized groups to keep in touch with a group of people like family members or work fellows and keep all of them updated within a matter of seconds. You can add up to 256 people in a single group. </p>
<p> All for free. </p>
<p> As far as UI is concerned, it is really simple and straightforward. All of your recent chats are displayed on the first page, displaying the most recent on the top and the least recent on the bottom. </p>
<p> There is also a search bar on the top right corner of the screen as well as a settings button. By tapping on that button, you’ll see a drop-down list that has some more options. </p>
<p> Through these options, you can make a new group, open a new broadcast, see all of your starred messages or go into the settings menu. </p>
<p> There is also an option called Whatsapp Web. What this does is that it allows you to open the WhatsApp on your desktop so that you don’t have to check your phone again and again. You can access this easily. Just go to your desktop and open any of your browsers and search “web.whatsapp.com”, There you’ll see a barcode that you’ll have to scan from your phone. </p>
<p> To make your phone read this barcode, you’ll need to tap on Whatsapp web option from that drop-down list and scan that barcode. Once you scan that, you’ll be able to see that all of your recent chats are going to show up there making it easier for you to work and communicate at the same time. </p>
<p> Now, coming back to the phones UI, if you swipe right from that recent page, the camera is going to open up to take pictures right from the app. By swiping up on the screen, all of the pictures in your gallery are going to show up for you to select the picture and send it to someone. You can also record a video from there if you want by pressing and holding the shutter button. </p>
<p> After you take a picture or a video, a green tick is going to show up on the bottom right corner of the screen and depending on the video or picture it is going to give you options to write something on the picture or video, put an emoji or even trim the video if you want. </p>
<p> Talking about photos and videos, these wouldn’t be sent at the most high quality as Whatsapp compresses your pictures and videos to send them quickly without consuming much internet. </p>
<p> So, to overcome that, we’ve come up with a solution to send high-quality pictures. Just go to your chat, and right beside the camera icon, there is an attachments button. Tap on that button and select documents. After that go into your gallery and select the photo you want to send. </p>
<p> Please keep in mind that this might take more time to send depending on your internet as it is a much bigger file. </p>
<p> Now coming back to the different tabs, by swiping left from the chats tab, you’ll see a status tab, this is a new feature added to Whatapp a while ago to tell or show people what you’re doing in your day. It is like a story in which you can upload photos or videos of where you are or what you’re doing. Your saved contacts can only see these photos or videos and they disappear in 24 hours of uploading. </p>
<p> You can even put privacies to your story, so if you don’t want to show your story to someone, you can go into the settings and type in the names of people you want to hide your stories from, and they wouldn’t be able to see your stories. </p>
<p> By swiping right from the status tab, you’ll get to the calls tab. All of your calls that you’ve received or made will be shown here along with all of the calls you’ve missed from someone. There is also an option to clear the call logs on the top right corner of the screen if you want to clear all of your call logs. </p>
<p> If you go into the settings menu from the drop-down list located on the top right corner of the screen, you’ll be able to change your status as well as your display picture. </p>
<p> To change your display picture and your status, first tap on your name on top of this page. There is going to be a circle, and under that circle, there will be a camera, tap on that and it will ask you if you want to take your display picture right now, choose your display picture from your gallery or remove the recent display picture. Under that, you can also change your username which is going to display in front of your number to people who haven’t got your number saved. Right under that, there is an option to change your status as well. </p>
<p> There is also some account settings under the status settings. If you go into the account settings, you can change your privacy settings like who can see your info that includes last seen, profile photo, about, status as well as live location. Please note that if you don’t share the last seen, then you wouldn’t be able to see other contacts last seen as well. </p>
<p> Under the privacy option, there is security which lets you know that all of your chats and calls are end to end encrypted, meaning that no one will be able to see them other than you. Not even Whatsapp itself. </p>
<p> After that, there is Two-step authentication which if you enable, it is going to make it safer and more secure when you change your phone and will require you to enter a pin code if you want to transfer your Whatsapp data to another phone. </p>
<p> Below that, there is change number which is pretty self-explanatory. After that, there is “Request account info”, If you tap on request report, the WhatsApp itself is going to send you the whole report of your WhatsApp usage in about three days, which you can also use to port to another phone. </p>
<p> And right under that, there is delete my account option which is going to delete your account. </p>
<p> Now, if you come back to the main settings menu, you’ll see chats settings. Under this option, you can change your apps language to your liking and also set a wallpaper on your chats background. You can choose from the given backgrounds as well as choose pictures from your gallery. Note that this will only change your chats background and the person you’re talking to can’t see this background. </p>
<p> You can also set up, when the app should backup your chats and also tell it if you want to back up your photos or videos as well. </p>
<p> After that, comes the notification settings. Under this setting, you can turn the conversation tones on or off, change the notification tone of your chats, set the vibration pattern of your notification as well as set a specific notification color to determine if it’s WhatsApp or another app. </p>
<p> You can also set different ringtones for group chats as well. And it also allows you to set a specific notification tone for a specific person or chat. And at the end, you can also set different ringtones for Whatsapp calls. </p>
<p> After notifications, there’s a tab called “Data and storage usage”. Under this tab, Whatsapp allows you to set a limit to network usage as well as turn on or off auto media download depending on your internet and also gives an option for low data usage call, that restricts the use of the internet for calls. </p>
<p> Overall Whatsapp messenger is a great communication tool that helps you talk to your friends and family for free. </p>
