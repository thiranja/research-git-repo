<p> Android Internet Usage Monitoring – Who consume all the data from your Network </p>
<p> Internet is no longer the mysterious thing we experience in our childhood. It is everywhere now, it is seemingly impossible to find a place without an internet connection anywhere in the globe. </p>
<p> And we already had super-fast internet connections, no one is seeing a dialogue box saying it takes 35 years to complete the downloading today just as in the ’90s. </p>
<p> With this advancements, everybody uses the internet, including the app on our mobile phones. That may results in a good experience for you as you can experience new and fresh things constantly as the things get updated constantly. But it’s not the same case with your internet bills, especially when you are using mobile data. And having too many apps that run in the background and killing your bandwidth can cause you to experience the 90’s internet. </p>
<p> So tracking data usage is good for both your bills and also for the internet speed. But the real problem is the inbuild Data Usage monitoring system in android is really the most primitive thing someone can think of when thinking about tracking the data usage. </p>
<p> It only can only show the data usage of the device in the last 30 days, that’s all. And that thing is already there in your monthly bill, and nothing is needed for that. So clearly we need an alternative like Konnekt. </p>
<p> Konnekt is a really powerful tool for monitoring the data usage and it has the following features. </p>
<p> Track data usage according to any time interval like daily, weekly or monthly. </p>
<p> Monitor data usage mobile data and WiFi data separately. </p>
<p> Monitor data usage in each sim separately. </p>
<p> Track the data usage in every app in your device separately. </p>
<p> Track data usage in both system apps and user install apps and uninstall user apps that consume so much data gives very little value for you directly from Konnekt. </p>
<p> If there are system apps that use too much data and you rarely used or not used at all, as they can not be uninstalled you have the option to force stop them within the Konnekt app. </p>
<p> Konnekt is one of the best apps in data usage monitoring but it doesn’t mean it only serves that, It is one of the best network tools available in the play store, here are few key main features of Konnekt instead of data usage tracking, </p>
<p> Performing Internet speed test( With build-in Ookla speed test you get the most advanced internet tests) </p>
<p> View information about your WiFi connection, such as (router information and device network interface information) </p>
<p> Easily access router gateway, and tweak settings of the WiFi router quickly from your mobile </p>

<p> Best Alarm app to get you out of bed doesn’t matter how heavy your sleep is? </p>
<p> Some people are happy with their Android or IOS inbuild alarm app, and some don’t need an alarm at all. And there is a huge chunk of society which doesn’t belong to either of these groups. The best possible reason you are reading this is you are one of those heavy sleepers. </p>
<p> Ignoring an alarm is not a simple thing, Getting late to work constantly, or finding out you are 1 hour late for a one of your most special occasion already being on the bed. Such things can change your entire life. And most bosses out there are not ready to accept it as an excuse. </p>
<p> So here I’m going to introduce a simple app that can solve this problem, and I’m using this app for a few years now and it never disappoints me. The name of the app is I Can’t Wake UP and it is available in both Android and IOS. </p>
<p> Well if the soft sounds of the default alarm app are, literary too soft to you, Simply switch to a heavy noise that you can not ignore like an emergency alarm. If you think it is still not loud enough to wake you up, you can also use the setting for “Extra loud” which will create a loud sound you never thought your mobile phone will produce. </p>
<p> Ok, the first concern of you once you see the above fact is that you will have a terrible wake-up with thrown away from the bed. Of cause, you can have it if you wish, but if it isn’t you can use the “Smooth Wake UP” option which will gradually increase the volume of the alarm, without giving you a sudden shock </p>
<p> Still not happy? Then you are a snoozer who just keeps snoozing the alarm or turn off the alarm completely, even without being fully conscious about what you are doing. Stil there is help, and this is the most interesting part of the app also. </p>
<p> You can select some tasks to complete when the alarm clock is ringing when setting the alarm. And you can not snooze or turn off the alarm without completing those tasks. By the time you complete those tasks, you are fully conscious and you know that you need to wake up right now. </p>
<p> And there are few kinds of tasks you can set for your alarm with I can’t wake UP such as Math tasks, Rewrite tasks and Shake tasks. You can choose any kind of task that you think suits best for you. </p>
<p> And the coolest part is you can adjust the difficulty of each task, as you wish, So you do not need to spend all morning for solving random math problems to turn off the alarm or complete a one-digit addition and sleep again. </p>
<p> Apart from I Can’t Wake UP, there are few other apps such as Alarmy, Timely and Sleep Cycle that serve the same purpose with slightly different approaches, If you feel like I Can’t wake UP is not for you try out one of those. </p>
<p> So we love to hear your opinion about these apps, will these help you to wake up? and what is the best alarm app according to you? </p>

<p> How to get IOS 14 privacy feature camera and microphone access indication on Android </p>
<p> If you take a look at IOS 14 you may already know about the cool new privacy feature of indicating Camera and Microphone access feature, which indicate you whenever an app is using one of them with green or orange indication dot just above the iPhone’s signal meter. Where green is used to indicate camera access meanwhile orange is used to indicate microphone access. </p>
<p> This is a great feature for someone who thinks about privacy, especially with the fact that we here more and more news about apps stealing users data these days, and it is nice to have also within the android phones. </p>
<p> If you are thinking that is a useful feature you must also have in your android, this post is for you. While this hasn’t been officially supported by the Android OS yet, there are some apps you can use to enable this feature in android. </p>
<p> Wisom </p>
<p> Wisom is an app inspired by the IOS 14 privacy feature and indicates you whenever any app is accessing your camera or microphone. It needs usage access permissions to log and identify apps access to camera and microphone. and it also needs, draw over other apps permission to display the indication dot. </p>
<p> This app also comes with some cool customization options, you can choose any shape and color for your indicator. It also can change the position and the size of the indicator. </p>
<p> And this app hasn’t stopped just by indicating camera and microphone access it also logs the access of camera and microphone of each app and presents it you on the app’s home activity, where you can check for any suspicious behaviour of apps and take action. </p>
<p> Access Dot </p>
<p> Access Dot is exactly a replica of IOS privacy feature, it uses an accessibility service so of cause it needs to grant accessibility access to function properly and indicates with a green or orange indication dot just below the battery icon. It also comes with a variety of customization options including, changing the color, position and the size of the indication dot. </p>
<p> Access dot also has the takes the IOS privacy feature further and logs the access of every app camera and microphone use, which you can check whenever you want. </p>
<p> Final thought </p>
<p> Both of these apps are almost identical in terms of the functionalities, though there are differences in the way they access the phone, Wisom use usage access mean while the Access Dot uses the accessibility services. And also they offer slightly different options when it comes customization. </p>
<p> In both of these apps, indicator dot appear below the status bar, as these apps are not system implementations I think that is acceptable. However this indication is small and do not obstuct your view. </p>
<p> As both of these apps use background services both these apps can have little impact on the battery life of your device. In terms of the impact on battery, Wisom might be stepping ahead just a little bit as it does not use an accessibility service. And both of these apps only require around 10 MB of disk space which is not a large overhead for modern devices. </p>
<p> So finally it is hard to choose a one over another, try them both and stick with what is most appealing. </p>

<p> How to view saved WiFi passwords on Android </p>
<p> We all come through this situation when a friend visits you and ask for the WiFi password or even you got a new laptop and needs to connect it with the WiFi. So you try to retrieve your WiFi password from your android and it seems it’s not that simple as you expect it to be. </p>
<p> So another problem with this is you may search google for this and keeps reading solutions and solutions, and Surprisingly they seem to be providing conflicting information about the same problem. Some say you definitely need Root and some say, you can view saved WiFi password even without root. </p>
<p> So in this article, we are going to make this topic finished once and for all. You know all you need to know about viewing WiFi passwords in Android after reading this. However, if you are in a hurry and really do not have the time to read the full article, You can directly jump into the solution you need according to your requirement root or not from below. </p>
<p> Introduction </p>
<p> Retrieving the saved WiFi passwords is not a hard task in a PC, maybe you need to run a command or two depending on the operating system. However, if you google the problem there is a straight forward answer and no uncertainty. </p>
<p> The situation is different for the Android devices, To view saved wifi passwords we need Root permissions If not still there is a workaround but it can not be guaranteed for results. </p>
<p> So let’s take a brief look at what is the root and why we need root and then move for the actual methods for retrieving WiFi passwords. </p>
<p> What is Root – Why we need Root </p>
<p> So if you are familiar with Windows or Linux PC operating systems, you know that there are few types of user accounts, in windows Administrator and user accounts, and in Linux, there is root user or otherwise Superuser and user accounts. </p>
<p> Most of the time if you are only using your PC and not any other shared computer resource you may not be much aware of the above accounts as you always got an Administrator account in it. </p>
<p> So this is the point, either Administrator on Windows or Superuser on Linux gets all the privileges within the computer, meanwhile, user accounts have some limited capabilities. I’m not going to dive deeper into those privileges here. </p>
<p> By default, Android offers a user account for you which has limited privileges, so you can only, work on your workspace and ultimately you do not privilege permissions to access system files in your android mobile. </p>
<p> So, what is rooting? Rooting is the process we used to grant root permissions(Superuser permissions) for an ordinary android user account. </p>
<p> So, why we need root? wifi passwords are saved within system files in your device, in order to read them, you must have permission to access them, no matter whether you try it to do it yourself or via an App. </p>
<p> How to view saved WiFi passwords on Android – With Root </p>
<p> If your device is rooted you can easily access WiFi passwords saved in your device. If you wish to view them manually you can use a root file explorer like ES file explorer and view the WiFi password file in your device. </p>
<p> The file used to save WiFi passwords changed according to the android version of your device if your device running in an Android version below android oreo, WiFi passwords are saved in a file named wpa_supplicant.conf and can be found on the path /data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf and in devices on or above Android oreo WifiConfigStore.xml is used to save WiFi passwords and it can be found here /data/misc/wifi/WifiConfigStore.xml </p>
<p> If you not much familiar with working with system files I do not recommend the above method as it can cause irreversible damage to your device. As an alternative, you can use an app like Show WiFi Password which safely read and present WiFi passwords for you. </p>
<p> Show WiFi password works with all Android versions, which are at use today. And also have some more useful options you may love. </p>
<p> How to view saved WiFi passwords on Android – Without Root </p>
<p> So can we retrieve saved WiFi passwords from your device? the simple answer is no we cannot. But there is a famous workaround most people use to hack around this. </p>
<p> This workaround is not 100% guaranteed and it can only be used to view the password of currently connected WiFi network. with having above in mind lets get on to it, if you feel it worth your time. </p>
<p> Even though we can not access saved passwords without root permission in our android devices, the android system can not restrict us from accessing it from our WiFi router. So here we are going to access the gateway (commonly called router setup page ) and read the password there. </p>
<p> Router gateway is the interface provided for you to tweak settings in your WiFI router. So the same thing can be used to view or change your WiFi password (WiFi preshared key). </p>
<p> You can access the router gateway with an internet browser, you simply have to type the IP address on the URL bar in your browser and visit it. That IP is 198.168.0.1 or 198.168.1.1 in most cases. And also have a possibility to be something else, this is printed on your router if above IP addresses do not work you can try that. </p>
<p> Then the next step is logging in to the gateway with the username and password. As most of the users do not change the default username and password on the router most probably it may be the default username and password which is admin and admin in most cases and this information is also printed on the router. </p>
<p> Now go to Wireless –> Wireless Security and here you have your password. As you may already have guessed this process is a little painful workaround if you going to do all it yourself. And Show WiFi password app can come handy here. It retrieves the router gateway from your browser and loads it for you and also guess the most probable default username and password for your router according to its brand. Which makes your work so much easier. Give it a try from here. </p>
<p> How to view saved WiFi passwords on Android Using a computer with ADB </p>
<p> This method is a little bit techier than previous too this is most probably another way to view file with WiFi passwords if you have the root access and this may work to no-root users also. </p>
<p> Even- with this method root permissions are needed to work properly. So what is “May work to No-Root users”? I saw some people claim that this method works for even without root. However, I do not have personally experienced that happens nor believe this can happens in an Android Production build device. </p>
<p> ADB is the short form for Android Debug Bridge, This is a tool heavily used by Android developers. They use it to perform various operations in developing and testing android apps and also android OS itself. </p>
<p> What we are going to do here is really simple compared to the most common use cases of this tool. So anyone of you can easily follow this guide if you like to try this. </p>
<p> What we going to do here is pull out the file which contains the WiFi passwords from your android device and copy it to your computer using the ADB. And then you can view it from your computer. </p>
<p> So these are the steps, to perform this. </p>
<p> Install ADB on your computer. Follow this guide for installation if you need help. </p>
<p> Enable USB debugging in your android device, follow this guide and connect to this device. </p>
<p> Run CMD or Terminal according to your operating system </p>
<p> Run the commands to check whether ADB is working and it should list your connected Android devices if it correctly works </p>
<p> Then run this command to grant root permission for your ADB shell. </p>
<p> Now finally if your Android device is android oreo or above run or if your device uses a version below oreo then run to pull out the file containing the wifi passwords and copy them to your computer. </p>
<p> Note:- here or is the destination path of the file you can replace it with whatever you want. </p>
<p> Most common problems on these </p>
<p> Isn’t there any app works for No-Root devices? </p>
<p> No, the problem is with the android system security, It does not allow to access system file to the user or an app to access system files without root permissions. </p>
<p> Even Show WiFi Password app just helps you to access the router gateway and guessing the default username and password. Any app can not bypass the android system security. </p>
<p> When viewing WiFi passwords with Root permission with Show WiFi Password app from any other Method long sequence of numbers and letters(Hash code) is shown instead of real passwords, Why and How to solve? </p>
<p> This is a known issue, In some android devices, an extra layer of encryption is used it causes this. This is most common with Samsung devices. And this can be solved with the following workaround </p>
<p> Get a root file explorer like ES file explorer from Play Store </p>
<p> And to </p>
<p> And open the file for editing </p>
<p> And find out the line </p>
<p> Finally, change it to </p>
<p> Note:- Do not edit anything else on this file. It can brick your device. And editing this line also has a risk of losing your saved WiFi network data for the first time. </p>
<p> And that’s all about WiFi password on your android device, do not forget to make some note in the comment section do these methods work for you? </p>

<p> Let Notifications knock you, instead of continuously checking for Notifications </p>
<p> Notifications are meant to be, make your day easy, but unfortunately, it has flipped the sides recently. Everybody needs your attention, so every app on your device try to push the maximum amount of notification they can. So the number of useful notification very low. </p>
<p> How much of your working time is wasted for constantly checking for notification, Well your working on your new project full focused in your full potential, and suddenly your phone notification sound plays, what if can be maybe your boss reminding you a meeting or your wife reminding something as she always does, and you stop your work and go for your phone? </p>
<p> And when you get there there is “Check out this cool cat video”, from one of your apps. </p>
<p> And you swipe it out and come to work and you will regain your focus in five or ten minutes, So what’s the big deal here why should we care about this? As I said earlier Number of notifications you receive is increasing day by day. So does the number of time you distracted from your work, and it can kill a lot of time, and you are not even aware of it. </p>
<p> Can turning off all the notification help? </p>
<p> Well, going back to the stone age, is not a good answer. Being quickly notified is really important in a lot of occasions, you can take immediate actions on things when you know them early. </p>
<p> But limiting the number of apps can really help, If you do not want to know about newly released music albums immediately, go-ahead and disable notifications for your music app. </p>
<p> Then what is the best thing to do? </p>
<p> Well simply glimpse on your notifications. Glimpse notifications is an app that solves this problem in a very interesting way. When you receive a notification glimpse notifications app automatically turn on your display, and give you a quick glance on it. </p>
<p> Let’s think about it again, when a notification sound rings, you have to stop your work and grab the phone unlock and check the notification. So what Glimpse Notification does is it turns on your display once a new notification came at you so you can take a quick look at it even without touching the phone. </p>
<p> So if that notification is an important one you can go ahead and unlock the phone and engage with it, and if it is not important you can simply ignore it knowing that is not important even without touching the phone. </p>
<p> So you do not need to break out of your work occasionally with useless things. Simply keep your phone on your desk, that’s all you have to do. </p>

<p> Mobile data icon missing on Notification bar Quick tile, How to Solve </p>
<p> True, there is a lot of WiFi today. But still, it does not mean, we need to remove the mobile data from devices. I mean still, there are a lot of situations, where we need to connect to the internet when you do not have a WiFi connection around. </p>
<p> Is this something wrong with my phone? </p>
<p> The simple answer is NO. This is not software damage or something which makes the mobile data icon disappear from your notification bar. This problem of missing the mobile data icon problem is common with relatively new devices including popular Samsung products such as S6, S7, S8, S9, Note 6, Note 7, etc. </p>
<p> Instead, this was something the manufacturer of your phone push on you. May be to discourage mobile data use and increase the use of WiFi, I don’t know the exact reason but for whatever the reason they make the change and now we do not have the mobile data icon. </p>
<p> Is it only the icon or no mobile data at all? </p>
<p> No mobile data haven’t been removed from these devices, it’s only the icon. But you do not have the quick and short way to switch on mobile data instead, you have to take the long path. </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Then go to CONNECTIONS </p>
<p> Then go to Data Usage </p>
<p> Finally, tap on the Mobile data to enable and disable mobile data </p>
<p> Is there a way to solve this? </p>
<p> Yes, here we are going to show you two methods to restore the missing mobile data icon. </p>
<p> Using Mobile Data Switch App </p>
<p> Mobile Data Switch app is specially designed for the mobile data icon missing android phones. Instead of the long path we mentioned above, you can simply tap on the Mobile Data Switch apps shortcut, it directly launches Data Usage screen for you, which enables you to switch On and OFF mobile data with a single touch. </p>
<p> Not only that it also has an inbuilt app launcher, which makes this a really helpful app. Where you can turn on mobile data with one touch and then directly launch Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok or whatever your favorite app with another touch. Which saves you a lot of time. </p>
<p> And the best part is this app works with any device, Even with devices we do not find this problem, and it is easy as downloading a small app from Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Using your computer and ADB </p>
<p> This method needs some technical skills to execute. And Also this method also does not work for every device like the above method. But this also has a positive side, this method can restore your mobile data icon as those golden old days. </p>
<p> In some devices, the manufacturer hasn’t completely removed the mobile data switch. Instead, they just have disabled it in a way that regular users can not enable it. Here we are going to enable it back with your computer using a tool called ADB. </p>
<p> ADB stands for Android Debug Bridge which is a tool that is mostly used by Android developers and android technicians. So we are going to do here is enable developer option on your phone and then access a hidden setting to enable mobile data. Which is not available to regular users. </p>
<p> Install ADB on your computer. Follow this guide for installation if you need help. </p>
<p> Enable USB debugging in your android device, follow this guide and connect to this device. </p>
<p> Run CMD or Terminal according to your operating system </p>
<p> Run the commands to check whether ADB is working and it should list your connected Android devices if it correctly works </p>
<p> Run the command to enter the phones command line </p>
<p> Now you have to enter the command to load settings of the quick settings (Icons on the notification bar) </p>
<p> The above command will print all the icons present on the quick settings, copy them to notepad. (Be careful with this step you have to copy all the items correctly if you missed any it may cause unexpected results) </p>
<p> Now append another item to the list, as (You must add it within quotes after the last item on the list put a comma and then add ) </p>
<p> Now copy the command in step 6 and add it to the beginning of the notepad text (put a space between the command and the list). The command on the note pad must look something like this </p>
<p> Now you have a command to update your quick setting icons copy it to command prompt or terminal and execute the command </p>
<p> As I said earlier this method seems to be out of the reach for a general user. If you feel like this is too intense, go with the first method it is completely risk-free and 100% working. </p>
